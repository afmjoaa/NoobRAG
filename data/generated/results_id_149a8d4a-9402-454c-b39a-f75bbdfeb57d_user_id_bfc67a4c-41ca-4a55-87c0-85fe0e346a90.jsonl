{"question":"What role do digital platforms play in multimodal transport chains, and how does telematics enhance their security features?","answer":"Digital platforms enable seamless transport by connecting multiple transport nodes (airports, seaports, warehouses) and facilitating data sharing about progress and disruptions. They support collaborative decision-making through event streams and real-time information distribution. On the security side, telematics enhances safety through intelligent warning systems that allow drivers to send emergency broadcasts to nearby vehicles during distress situations. It also enables container tracking for better security and supports mission-critical decisions through real-time field data collection, particularly important in specialized transport like cold logistics where container temperature monitoring is crucial.","context":["Share this story\nShare on facebook\nShare on twitter\nShare on whatsapp\nShare on print\nShare on email\nEnd-to-end transport most often engages multiple transport modes involving visits to various transport nodes, requiring a high degree of collaboration between the involved actors both within and often across national borders.\nThere is a need to better synchronise transport practices. Hopes are being placed on digitalisation as an enabler and means for integrated and sustainable operations along the multi-modal supply chain. To do this requires decisions on what changes are needed and how they should be made.\nBefore implementing changes, there is a need to reflect on and experiment with the available options to ensure that the desired effects are both feasible and effective, both for the individual organisations and entities involved and for the ecosystem as a whole. Engagement of a multitude of stakeholders is particularly important.\nDrawing from experiences derived from the ecosystem innovation arenas, or ‘living labs’, initiated under the European financed FEDeRATED project, this article provides some observations on how to pursue digital innovation in transport ecosystems.\nA lot of effort is currently being expanded in establishing digital interoperability between systems and (local) information sharing communities. Digitalisation can be seen as an enabler for ecosystem innovation by steering the multiple parties towards co-development, so appropriate changes to their practices will be better aligned.\nTo do this requires a shared common object of interest, an agreement on which standards and design principles are to be used for interaction. In the European initiative on establishing a federated network of platforms such design principles have been defined and are now being validated within two CEF-projects, FEDeRATED and FENIX.\nThose principles allow a participant to register and connect with their solution/service provider of choice using technology independent infrastructure services with standardised protocols through a network of platforms and peer-to-peer solutions, with governance rules for data sharing.\nWithin FEDeRATED, a living lab approach has been adopted to demonstrate these principles in action, gathering different parties that share a common interest. Participants from several European countries including Sweden, Spain, The Netherlands, Italy, Finland, and Luxembourg, and several international organisations such as IATA, are taking part.\nEnabling seamless transport by connected transport nodes\nSeamlessness in transport is an important ingredient for sustainability, for example by avoiding unnecessary waiting times, thereby contributing to high utilisation of used infrastructure, and for providing customer value.\nTo enable seamless and sustainable transport, transport nodes must become more integrated in the transport chain, including airports, combi terminals, (sea)ports, yards, railway stations, but also warehouses and logistics centres.\nA transport node cannot operate in isolation. It is highly dependent on what is happening outside its scope of operations to assure that its resources and infrastructure are used optimally. The required business intelligence needs to be derived from:\n• data on the progress and disruptions occurring in movements made by transport operators and at previous transport nodes expanding the planning horizon for the transport node.\n• providing transport operators with the means to optimise their approach to the transport node, and\n• providing the means for the transport coordinator to inform their clients on the progress and forecasts associated with the goods and people that are being transported, thus providing a basis for onward planning.\nDigitalisation offers capabilities for transport nodes to be highly integrated in the transport ecosystem. At its core, collaboration enabled by digital interaction and data streams will expand the transport node’s event horizon and improve situational awareness, providing opportunities for resource and infrastructure utilisation optimisation.\nInfrastructure for digital interaction\nDigital interaction in multi-modal transport requires infrastructure support (such as coordination of information in interoperable systems). Platform vendors offer methods of integrating with other operational systems, but this is a slow process that does not easily support new ecosystem actors and the exploration of new business models / use cases. Furthermore, the operational systems are typically not suited to adding the different types of sensors required for digitalising operations around multi-modal transport nodes.\nOperational systems need to be complemented with data-agnostic platforms tailored to collect data from different sources and to test new solutions in a fast and flexible way. Besides data from operational systems like Port Management Systems and Terminal Operating Systems, there are a multitude of different sensors providing data for key operations, such as RFID readers, GPS, IoT sensors etc.\nBusiness models and other incentives for sharing data are also crucial in digital interaction and can be explored in these types of data-agnostic platforms. Common ecosystem needs and capabilities can be identified, such as new standards and processes, while security threats can be explored and system mechanisms for identified threats can be verified.\nOne example of a data-agnostic platform supporting ecosystem innovation in multi-modal transport chains is Deplide, under development by RISE and used within FEDeRATED. Deplide is based on similar platforms within the maritime sector adapted to more generic multi-modal transport needs.\nIt has been developed primarily to support data sharing around a transport node, where events occur along the supply chain, and integrates technology and solutions that are available as open-source and will itself be published as open-source.\nDifferent types of data providers or sources can be connected to Deplide, as well as different types of data consumers, including front-end applications and services that can be built on top of the platform.\nData sharing and distribution of ‘live’ information is central to collaborative decision making and increased supply chain visibility. Data sharing and distribution of information is facilitated by interoperability between systems that contain relevant data. This type of interoperability builds upon standardisation of items like communication protocols, security mechanisms and data formats.\nThe data that need to be shared are typically concentrated around events during the transport process; it could be a ship arriving at a port, an airplane arriving at an airport, or cargo that is transhipped at a logistic centre. A flow of events with associated data makes up a so-called ‘event stream’.\nDeplide manages event streams using Apache Kafka, an open-source distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. It is currently being developed as a platform for digital interaction in collaboration with several ongoing ecosystem innovations around multi-modal transport nodes.\nOngoing ecosystem innovations\nApproximately 20 living labs are now being conducted within FEDeRATED, addressing several modes of transport and putting focus on multi-modal data sharing beyond the single organisation.\nThe living labs focus on how information sharing and collaboration among involved parties along the transport chain for selected events may be empowered by digital technologies. (Some of the living labs being coordinated by Sweden are listed and outlined in the full version of this article, which is linked below.)\nThe living labs illustrate some of the needs and challenges involved in multi-modal transport spanning several transport nodes, each having its own ecosystem of involved actors. The identified challenges and business cases highlight the data sources and types of information that need to be shared among the actors to address the challenges.\nIn some cases, only part of the needed data is identified, and additional information needs to be explored during the living lab activities. Typically, this additional information must be obtained through installing new types of sensors or connecting to existing operational systems.\nTo succeed in their ambitions, the living labs require a data-agnostic platform tailored to collect data from different sources and to prototype new solutions in a fast and flexible way. Learnings from the prototype solutions developed during the living labs can then be used to underpin operational solutions supporting the transport node, maximising its value contribution as part of multi-modal transport chains.\nDigital innovation in ecosystem settings is a challenging task. It is crucial to define a common object of interest as well as each of the participants’ needs so that they see the value of taking part in the innovation effort.\nThere is a need to reach agreement on how each participant needs to act, and which standards to utilise in emerging interaction patterns, before making appropriate implementations and changes. Business models, for the ecosystem as well as for each participant, and supporting digital infrastructures need to go together.\nTo pursue ecosystem innovation in authentic settings, arenas that support participants in joining forces to investigate and overcome common concerns need to be established. Within the framework of FEDeRATED those arenas are the living labs.\nIn the case of FEDeRATED, the purpose has been to explore which digital interactions/collaborations are necessary to support seamless transport. A data-agnostic data sharing platform is being used in several of the FEDeRATED living labs to experiment, demonstrate, and elicit requirements for forthcoming implementations.\nSuch a platform has (at least) the following characteristics:\n• Flexible collection and transformation of data from different data sources, such as different sensors, providing data to digitalise key operational elements, as well as operational systems like Port Management Systems, Terminal Operating Systems, etc.\n• Flexible access to collected data from different front-ends and applications exploring prototype solutions for important use cases addressing the needs of the participating actors.\n• Efficient coordination, search, and manipulation of data flows captured in real-time from different data sources, also known as ‘event streaming’.\n• Durable storage of collected data for later retrieval.\n• Flexible connection to analytics and visualisation frameworks in real-time as well as retrospectively.\n• A focus on short turn-around time for changes in the platform and development of connectors to integrate with existing systems.\nAs multi-modal transport is a distributed and self-organised ecosystem, change cannot be pursued by one single actor. To reach successful outcomes and to contribute to a better world, stakeholders need to co-design solutions that offer incentives to all participants. The living labs under FEDeRATED are providing one such meeting place.\nEditor’s note: This article is an edited version of the original paper by the authors, which includes a full list of references.

It is the system of transmitting, receiving, and storing information, with a motive of controlling a remotely located object, or network system. It is a gamut of most advanced vehicular technologies, which ropes in transportation, road safety, advanced multimedia interface along with telecommunications. Telematics system integration also deals with global (GPS) system, in conjunction with international navigation satellite system. The impact of this branch of technology has created immense impact in the field of commerce, specifically vehicular technologies. In today’s business scenario, organizations have to play with knife edge profit margins. There is very little room for optimization in the manufacturing process, for better margins. The only recognized area of impact remains optimization in the logistics or transportation.\nThis is where telematics chips in with its advanced API system. API or application program interface, is a medium, which is built with many subroutine definitions or clearly defined methods to interact with different softwares. Due to customization in the demand from customers, software as a service organizations, have built this medium which can address these issues, by making it easier for the programmer, to build specific data structure, variables and routines for the program. It is just that curtain, which prevents the user to see the complex codes and skeleton structure of the program and only reveling, a user friendly interface.\nOrganizations managing a fleet may need to compare data from different systems like customer relationship, fuel consumption monitor, and final invoicing to the end user. These are facilitated by the use of API, which inturn reduces internal cost and empowers the employees to automate task, without the concern of duplication of work. In the modern business scenario, the amount of data generated in an organization, every second is huge, along different softwares. Therefore, without the presence of proper technological support the speed of data exchange becomes a daunting task, which prevents the employees to gather real-time information. For example, information which previously needed a person to manually pass it on to the dispatch department and then after forwarding it to the driver may be integrated with the particular vehicle directly. So that the driver can receive the information from the command center instantaneously, saving valuable time and cost.\nTelematics system integration helps in the vehicle tracking, for fleet management companies. It helps the command center to send and receive signal from the driver directly. Any changes in the objective of the trip, can be shared real-time, and the mission executed without any hassle. The command center in the organization may also be interested in the pattern of the vehicle movements, fuels consumption at different speeds, and any possible driver mischief, with the help of this advanced system. Complex fleet management like the cold logistics, which are used to carry frozen material, are increasing inclining towards telematics, to obtain real-time container temperature and track the vehicle. It helps the supply chain personnel to alert the driver of any temperature fluctuation, so that he/she may speed up his/her vehicle to the destination or take course correction measures.\nThis wonderful tool could also be used for container tracking, for better security and possibility of re-assignment of the same after one trip. With transportation becoming multimodal, a system like this helps the user to gather field data in real-time, and take timely mission critical decisions. The system empowers the fleet owner to transplant intelligent warning systems into their fleet. This helps the driver to send emergency broadcast to the nearby vehicles of the same organization, in times of distress. This technology is used extensively in the latest boom in car sharing business."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e7c57a45-78b4-451a-b69e-6847eb6271c3>","<urn:uuid:34edd60c-b469-4b69-9e0f-a426a97c7da4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the economic aspects of biodiversity protection, and how can mindfulness techniques help address the psychological challenges of environmental management?","answer":"Biodiversity protection involves significant economic considerations, as shown in various studies about biodiversity valuation and conservation management. The economic aspects include analyzing willingness to pay for conservation and understanding local communities' dependence on environmental resources. Regarding psychological challenges, mindfulness techniques can help environmental managers by reducing chronic stress and anxiety, improving cognitive thinking, and enabling clearer decision-making. Mindfulness practice allows individuals to view situations more realistically by focusing on the present moment rather than past experiences, which can lead to better environmental management outcomes through improved emotional control and reduced negative thought patterns.","context":["The valuation of biodiversity conservation by the South African Khomani San “bushmen” community\nDownload full text from publisher\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to look for a different version below or search for a different version of it.\nOther versions of this item:\n- Dikgang, Johane & Muchapondwa, Edwin, 2012. \"The Valuation of Biodiversity Conservation by the South African Khomani San “Bushmen” Community,\" Discussion Papers dp-12-10-efd, Resources For the Future.\n- Johane Dikgang & Edwin Muchapondwa, 2011. \"The valuation of biodiversity conservation by the South African Khomani San \"bushmen\" community,\" Working Papers 257, Economic Research Southern Africa.\nReferences listed on IDEAS\n- Oral Capps & Randall A.

We become upset, easily frustrated, and irritable.\nSome people become tearful and overly sensitive. Others shut off emotionally or withdraw which can lead to all types of complications with family, friends, and relationships in general.\nPracticing mindfulness works to clear the mind. It relieves that feeling of being overwhelmed by allowing us to focus on the here and now, on a single moment in time instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.\nBy focusing on the moment, we are less likely to judge a situation based on past experiences, and are better able to view an event more realistically.\nThis allows us to deal with a current situation less emotionally, because we aren't viewing the situation with negative connotations based on past experiences.\nMindfulness practice allows us to control our emotions and reduce our tendency to become upset, hostile or irritable.\n- Mindfulness For Physical HealthMindfulness for Health\nPracticing mindfulness allows us to know and better understand how our bodies work.\nThis helps us to recognize when something is not quite right sooner than we otherwise would, which can result in seeking treatment faster, before a small problem becomes a big one.\nMindfulness mediation can also help people suffering from chronic pain manage their condition better.\nWhen people experience pain on a continual basis they tend to focus much of their attention on the pain they feel or the pain they experienced in the past.\nThey worry that the pain will worsen in the future.\nStudies show that focusing on pain can set up an emotional response where people actually feel more pain than just the physical pain.\nMindfulness practice can divert a person’s focus for a short period of time to something other than the pain.\nFor instance when you focus on your breathing, concentrating on how it feels to draw in each breath and release it, the way your chest and stomach expands, and the rise and fall of your shoulders, your mind lets go of the memory of past pain and the worry about future pain, and people find that the actual pain they are feeling diminishes.\nPart of the reduction in pain is due to do the fact that they relax. Their muscles become less tense.\nPart of the reduction in pain also has to do with the fact that by letting go of the memory of pain, and the worry of future pain, they only feel that pain that is here now, not the emotional pain that contributes to the physical pain.\nMindfulness practice can affect many aspects of our health, and when people feel healthier they can face the world more positively while experiencing less stress and anxiety."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b3cd3c2c-157f-4127-9c49-1d965a648f1a>","<urn:uuid:f9f9e11d-7996-4876-b2cb-bc7b6a5027bb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What problems arise with traditional autoclave sterilization compared to disposable medical products, and how does proper regulated waste disposal address these challenges?","answer":"Autoclave sterilization, while generally effective, has several limitations: the process may not achieve complete sterilization, some plastics cannot be autoclaved due to melting, and it's ineffective against prions that cause diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It also requires significant time and effort to operate. In contrast, modern regulated medical waste disposal systems address these challenges through comprehensive waste management approaches. These include proper segregation of different waste types, specific packaging requirements to prevent contamination, appropriate storage conditions, and various treatment methods beyond just autoclaving. This systematic approach, governed by regulatory bodies, ensures more effective contamination control and risk mitigation in healthcare settings.","context":["As infection control efforts in hospitals and other healthcare settings intensify, medical providers are turning to disposable medical products as a way of ensuring staff and patient safety. Nosocomial infections are infections caused by treatment in a hospital or other healthcare unit. Hospital-associated infections are a serious problem for patients and the healthcare industry. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approximate that there are 1.7 million hospital-associated infections each year that cause nearly 100,000 deaths in the United States. Hospitals, clinics, and doctors’ offices are looking for ways to reduce these tragic statistics, and disposable medical supplies are an essential part of increasing patient safety.\nBefore disposable medical products were widely available, healthcare providers relied on autoclaves to sterilize all equipment. Autoclaves use high heat and intense pressure to sterilize items. The autoclave has been used for over 100 years and is generally very effective. Autoclaves are essential pieces of equipment in hospitals and many other medical settings.\nUnfortunately, the autoclaving process is not always perfect and medical products may not, in fact, be sterile after autoclaving. Some plastics cannot be autoclaved because they would melt. In addition, while autoclave sterilization kills viruses, bacteria, and fungi, it is not effective against prions that cause diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Mad Cow Disease. Even when autoclave sterilization works well, it takes time and effort to run the autoclave. Autoclaves are still used in hospitals, labs, and even tattoo parlors to sterilize equipment that is not disposable. However, supplies that are available in a disposable form are certainly safer and easier to use.\nWhen items such as face masks, syringes, or scalpels are reused, they can spread infections from one patient to another. Many patients in hospitals have weakened immune systems, so the risk from cross-contamination is especially great. Hospital staff members are also at risk of being exposed to infections when they handle or clean used medical products.\nDisposable medical supplies are intended for single patient use, so they do not pose the risk of spreading infection. For example, if a patient needs an IV to replenish lost fluids, the procedure can be safely done using only disposable medical products. All of the products used, from the tourniquet, alcohol swab, and gauze to the stylet, catheter, tubing, and IV bag, are all disposable medical products that pose no risk to the patient or healthcare provider of transmitting an infection from a different patient.\nSterile Disposable Medical Products\nMany disposable medical products are sterile and individually wrapped to provide maximum patient protection. These disposable medical supplies are especially important for patients with compromised immune systems. In these cases, when infection control is a top priority, health care providers should use sterile disposable medical products as much as possible. For instance, if a nurse needs to take a patient’s temperature, a sealed disposable thermometer is a better option than an electric thermometer that has been used with other patients. Catheters, bandages, applicators, tubing, syringes, and more are all available as sterile disposable medical supplies.\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nHealth care providers must take great precautions to protect their health. They may be exposed to many pathogens every day, and proper protective gear is the best way for them to stay safe. Disposable medical supplies are essential to keeping doctors, nurses, and EMTs safe from infections. One of the most important safety products is the disposable glove. Health care providers should always wear gloves and change them frequently. Disposable gloves are available in latex or non-latex and in a range of colors and sizes. Other disposable medical products that are vital for personal protection include face masks, protective isolation gowns, protective shoe covers, and bouffant caps.","Mitigating Risks and Ensuring Compliance. Best Practices in Regulated Medical Waste Disposal. Proper disposal of regulated medical waste is of paramount importance in healthcare settings. Regulated medical waste encompasses various materials, such as sharps, contaminated items, and pathological waste, which have the potential to transmit infectious diseases and pose risks to public health. Appropriate disposal practices ensure the protection of patients, healthcare workers, waste management personnel, and the general community. Responsible management of regulated medical waste is vital to maintain a safe and hygienic healthcare environment.\nSignificance of Mitigating Risks and Ensuring Regulatory Compliance\nMitigating risks associated with regulated medical waste and ensuring regulatory compliance are key objectives in healthcare facilities. Improper disposal of regulated medical waste can result in health hazards, environmental contamination, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Compliance with regulations and adherence to best practices help mitigate these risks, safeguard public health, and maintain a high standard of healthcare delivery. It is imperative for healthcare facilities to implement effective waste disposal practices that prioritize risk mitigation and compliance with regulatory guidelines.\nExploring the Best Practices in Regulated Medical Waste Disposal\nThis article aims to delve into the best practices in regulated medical waste disposal, focusing on strategies that mitigate risks, ensure compliance with regulations, and promote a safe healthcare environment. By understanding and implementing these best practices, healthcare facilities can protect the well-being of their staff, patients, and the community while maintaining regulatory compliance. From waste segregation to treatment and disposal methods, this article will provide valuable insights into the comprehensive approach needed for effective regulated medical waste management.\nDefinition and Classification of Regulated Medical Waste\nRegulated medical waste refers to waste generated in healthcare facilities during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of humans or animals. It includes materials that have the potential to transmit infectious diseases or pose risks to public health and the environment. Regulated medical waste is subject to specific regulations and guidelines to ensure its safe and responsible management. Understanding the definition and classification of regulated medical waste is essential for healthcare professionals to implement appropriate disposal practices.\nExamples of Materials Categorized as Regulated Medical Waste\nRegulated medical waste encompasses a wide range of materials generated in healthcare settings. Examples include sharps, such as needles, syringes, and scalpels, which can cause injuries and transmit bloodborne pathogens. Contaminated items like gloves, gowns, and surgical drapes, which have been in contact with bodily fluids or blood, also fall into this category. Additionally, pathological waste, such as tissues and organs, and microbiological waste, such as cultures and specimens, are considered regulated medical waste. These examples highlight the diverse nature of regulated medical waste and the importance of proper management to mitigate risks.\nPotential Risks Associated with Improper Disposal of Regulated Medical Waste\nImproper disposal of regulated medical waste poses various risks to public health and the environment. Pathogens present in blood, bodily fluids, or contaminated items can cause infections and diseases if not handled and disposed of properly. Exposure to sharps without appropriate containment increases the risk of needlestick injuries, which can lead to the transmission of bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis. Inadequate disposal practices can also result in environmental contamination, with the potential to affect ecosystems, water sources, and wildlife. It is crucial to recognize the potential risks associated with improper disposal of regulated medical waste to prioritize effective waste management practices.\nUnderstanding the definition, classification, and potential risks associated with regulated medical waste is the foundation for implementing best practices in waste disposal. By recognizing the diverse nature of materials categorized as regulated medical waste and the risks they pose, healthcare facilities can develop strategies to mitigate these risks and ensure the safe and responsible disposal of waste.\nOverview of Regulatory Bodies and Guidelines Governing Regulated Medical Waste Disposal\nRegulated medical waste disposal is governed by a comprehensive regulatory framework established by various national, regional, and local regulatory bodies. These regulatory bodies provide guidelines and standards to ensure the safe handling, transportation, treatment, and disposal of regulated medical waste. Examples of regulatory bodies include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), World Health Organization (WHO), and local health departments. These organizations work collectively to establish and enforce regulations that protect public health and the environment.\nKey Regulations and Standards Healthcare Facilities Must Comply With\nHealthcare facilities are responsible for complying with a range of regulations and standards to ensure proper regulated medical waste disposal. Key regulations may include the U.S. EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, and relevant state or local regulations. These regulations cover various aspects of waste management, including waste classification, packaging and labeling requirements, storage conditions, transportation guidelines, treatment methods, record-keeping, and reporting obligations. Compliance with these regulations is critical to maintaining a safe healthcare environment and protecting public health.\nConsequences of Non-Compliance and Legal Liabilities\nNon-compliance with regulated medical waste disposal regulations can lead to severe consequences for healthcare facilities. The consequences may include legal liabilities, fines, penalties, loss of reputation, and potential litigation. In addition, non-compliance puts the health and safety of healthcare personnel, waste management personnel, patients, and the community at risk. Failure to adhere to proper waste disposal practices may result in the transmission of infectious diseases, environmental contamination, and other public health hazards. Healthcare facilities must recognize the potential consequences of non-compliance and take proactive measures to ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate associated risks.\nCompliance with the regulatory framework governing regulated medical waste disposal is imperative for healthcare facilities.

This may include regular assessments of waste segregation, packaging, labeling, transportation, storage, and treatment processes. By monitoring waste management practices, healthcare facilities can identify areas for improvement and address any issues promptly.\nConducting Audits and Inspections to Identify Areas for Improvement\nIn addition to internal monitoring, conducting audits and inspections provides an external perspective on waste management practices. Audits and inspections involve independent evaluators assessing compliance with regulations, standards, and best practices. These assessments may be conducted by regulatory agencies, third-party organizations, or internal audit teams. By performing audits and inspections, healthcare facilities gain valuable insights into their waste management processes, identify gaps or deficiencies, and highlight areas that require improvement.\nAddressing Non-Compliance Issues Promptly and Implementing Corrective Actions\nWhen non-compliance issues are identified during monitoring, audits, or inspections, it is essential to address them promptly and implement corrective actions. Non-compliance may involve inadequate waste segregation, improper packaging, transportation violations, or other breaches of waste management protocols. Healthcare facilities should have a system in place to document and investigate non-compliance incidents thoroughly. Corrective actions may include additional training, process modifications, policy updates, or disciplinary measures. By addressing non-compliance issues promptly and implementing corrective actions, healthcare facilities can improve their waste management practices and ensure ongoing compliance.\nMonitoring and auditing are integral components of effective waste management. Regular monitoring allows healthcare facilities to proactively identify any shortcomings in their waste management processes. Audits and inspections provide an external evaluation, ensuring compliance with regulations and best practices. By addressing non-compliance issues promptly and implementing corrective actions, healthcare facilities can continuously improve their waste management practices, mitigate risks, and ensure a safe and compliant environment for staff, patients, and the community.\nPromoting Sustainable Waste Management Practices\nPromoting sustainable waste management practices is crucial in regulated medical waste disposal. Healthcare facilities can implement various strategies to minimize the environmental impact of waste generation and disposal. This includes reducing waste generation through source reduction initiatives, encouraging recycling, and reusing of materials where possible, and promoting responsible waste management practices throughout the facility.\nExploring Eco-Friendly Alternatives and Waste Reduction Strategies\nIn addition to traditional waste management methods, healthcare facilities should explore eco-friendly alternatives and waste reduction strategies. This may involve adopting greener technologies, such as waste-to-energy conversion systems or on-site treatment methods that minimize environmental impact. Implementing waste reduction strategies, such as implementing digital record-keeping systems or optimizing inventory management, can also minimize waste generation and promote sustainability.\nBenefits of Implementing Sustainable Practices for Healthcare Facilities and the Environment\nImplementing sustainable practices in regulated medical waste disposal offers several benefits. Firstly, it reduces the environmental impact associated with waste disposal, preserving natural resources, and minimizing pollution. Secondly, sustainable practices can result in cost savings through waste reduction and efficient resource utilization. Additionally, healthcare facilities that prioritize sustainability demonstrate their commitment to social responsibility and environmental stewardship, enhancing their reputation and fostering a positive public image.\nBy promoting sustainable waste management practices, exploring eco-friendly alternatives, and implementing waste reduction strategies, healthcare facilities can minimize their environmental footprint while maintaining regulatory compliance. This approach not only benefits the environment but also contributes to cost savings and enhances the overall sustainability of the healthcare industry.

{"question":"How did Cyprian Ekwensi influence Nigerian literature with his city novels, and what themes did his Burning Grass explore about pastoral life?","answer":"Ekwensi significantly influenced Nigerian literature by publishing People of the City (1954), the first major novel by a Nigerian author, which gave a vibrant portrait of West African city life. As for pastoral themes, his novel Burning Grass (1961) provided insight into the life of Fulani people, following a family's story with characters based on real people he had lived with. The novel includes elements like cattle trading, as shown through Mai Sansaye who buys a slave named Fatimeh for six cattle, and deals with seasonal activities like grass burning.","context":["Cyprian Ekwensi Facts\nCyprian Ekwensi (born 1921) was a Nigerian writer who stressed description of the locale and whose episodic style was particularly well suited to the short story.\nCyprian Odiatu Duaka Ekwensi was born at Minna in Northern Nigeria on September 26, 1921. He later lived in Onitsha in the Eastern area. He was educated at Achimota College, in lbadan, the Gold Coast, and at the Chelsea School of Pharmacy of London University. He lectured in pharmacy at Lagos and was employed as a pharmacist by the Nigerian Medical Corporation. Ekwensi married Eunice Anyiwo, and they had five children.\nAfter favorable reception of his early writing, he joined the Nigerian Ministry for Information and had risen to be the director of that agency by the time of the first military coup in 1966. After the continuing disturbances in the Western and Northern regions in the summer of 1966, Ekwensi gave up his position and relocated his family at Enugu. He became chair of the Bureau for External Publicity in Biafra and an adviser to the head of state, Col. Odumegwu Ojukwu.\nEkwensi began his writing career as a pamphleteer, and this perhaps explains the episodic nature of his novels. This tendency is well illustrated by People of the City (1954), in which Ekwensi gave a vibrant portrait of life in a West African city. It was the first major novel to be published by a Nigerian. Two novellas for children appeared in 1960; both The Drummer Boy and The Passport of Mallam Ilia were exercises in blending traditional themes with undisguised romanticism.\nEkwensi's most widely read novel, Jagua Nana, appeared in 1961. It was a return to the locale of People of the City but boasted a much more cohesive plot centered on the character of Jagua, a courtesan who had a love for the expensive. Even her name was a corruption of the expensive English auto. Her life personalized the conflict between the old traditional and modern urban Africa. Ekwensi published a sequel in 1987 titled Jagua Nana's Daughter.\nBurning Grass (1961) is basically a collection of vignettes concerning a Fulani family. Its major contribution is the insight it presents into the life of this pastoral people. Ekwensi based the novel and the characters on a real family with whom he had previously lived. Between 1961 and 1966 Ekwensi published at least one major work every year. The most important of these were the novels, Beautiful Feathers (1963) and Iska (1966), and two collections of short stories, Rainmaker (1965) and Lokotown (1966). Ekwensi continued to publish beyond the 1960s, and among his later works are the novel Divided We Stand (1980), the novella Motherless Baby (1980), and The Restless City and Christmas Gold (1975), Behind the Convent Wall (1987), and Gone to Mecca (1991).\nEkwensi also published a number works for children. Under the name C. O. D. Ekwensi, he released Ikolo the Wrestler and Other Ibo Tales (1947) and The Leopard's Claw (1950). In the 1960s, he wrote An African Night's Entertainment (1962), The Great Elephant-Bird (1965), and Trouble in Form Six (1966). Ekwensi's later works for children include Coal Camp Boy (1971), Samankwe in the Strange Forest (1973), Samankwe and the Highway Robbers (1975), Masquerade Time! (1992), and King Forever! (1992). In recognition of his skills as a writer, Ekwensi was awarded the Dag Hammarskjold International Prize for Literary Merit in 1969.\nFurther Reading on Cyprian Ekwensi\nAmong the studies in which Ekwensi's work and life are discussed are Ulli Beier, ed., Introduction to African Literature (1967); Ezekiel Mphahlele, ed., African Writing Today (1967); Oladele Taiwo, An Introduction to West African Literature (1967); Martin Tucker, Africa in Modern Literature: A Survey of Contemporary Writing in English (1967); and Margaret Laurence, Long Drums and Cannons: Nigerian Dramatists and Novelists, 1952-1966 (1968).","African Classics Every Book Lover Must Have (Part Two)\nBegun a month ago, we present the second part of our list of some African classics every book lover must have.\nA Bend in a River\nby V.S. Naipaul\nPublished by Vintage\nV.S. Naipaul takes us deeply into the life of one man—an Indian who, uprooted by the bloody tides of Third World history, has come to live in an isolated town at the bend of a great river in a newly independent African nation. Naipaul gives us the most convincing and disturbing vision yet of what happens in a place caught between the dangerously alluring modern world and its own tenacious past and traditions.\nby Chimamanda Adichie\nPublished by Heinemann\nChimamanda Ngozie Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus focuses on fifteen-year-old Kambili and her older brother Jaja, who lead privileged lives in Enugu, Nigeria. They stay in a beautiful house, with a caring family, and attend an exclusive missionary school. They’re completely shielded from the troubles of the world. Yet, as Kambili reveals in her tender-voiced account, things are less perfect than they appear. Although her papa is generous and well respected, he is fanatically religious and tyrannical at home. A home that is silent and suffocating. As the country begins to fall apart under a military coup, Kambili and Jaja are sent to their aunt, a university professor outside the city, where they discover a life beyond the confines of their father’s authority. Books cram the shelves, curry and nutmeg permeate the air, and their cousins’ laughter rings throughout the house. When they return home, tensions within the family escalate, and Kambili must find the strength to keep her loved ones together. Purple Hibiscus is an exquisite novel about the emotional turmoil of adolescence, the powerful bonds of family, and the bright promise of freedom.\nSo Long a Letter\nby Mariama Ba\nPublished by Waveland Press\nIn So Long a Letter, Mariama Ba, a long-time women’s activist, exposes the double standards between men and women in Africa. The book takes the form of a long letter written by a widow, Ramatoulaye, to her friend, over the mandatory forty-day mourning period after the death of a husband. Both women married for love and had happy, productive marriages, were educated and had work they loved. However, each of their husbands chose to take a second wife and the women had to make separate decisions. Ramatoulaye decided to stay married, although it meant rarely seeing her husband and knowing that he was squandering money on a young girl, who is her daughter’s friend. Ramatoulaye’s friend divorced her husband and eventually left the country, to settle in the United States. In her letter, Ramatoulaye examines her life and that of other women of Senegal, their upbringing and training, as well as the cultural restrictions placed on them. It is a devastating attack, made all the more powerful by a skillful narrator.\nby Cyprian Ekwensi\nPublished by Heinemann\nThis story is about the Fulani herdsmen of northern Nigeria. Mai Sansaye runs into a beautiful slave, Fatimeh, whom he buys for about six cattle from a rival leader. He guesses that he has a year’s grace before his rival commits acts of aggression toward him, but in the meantime he must contend with his wife Shaita, their sons; Jalla, Hodio and Rikku, as well as their daughter Leibe, and the many problems of life. Rikku, the favoured son, is infatuated with Fatimeh and falls sick when Hodio steals away with her, their father vows to hunt down the couple to heal the boy. Despite his best efforts, he is struck down by the wandering sickness. The story begins and ends with grass burning, a seasonal endeavour.\nby Peter Abrahams\nPublished by Heinemann\nPeter Abrahams gives us an unrivaled peek into the oppressive conditions the black man faces living under a white minority regime. The hopes and aspirations of an entire race seem to rest with the book’s hero Mine Boy. The book also presents a portrait of labour discrimination, appalling housing conditions and one man’s humanitarian act of defiance.\nby Tsitsi Dangarembga\nPublished by Ayebia Clarke Publishing Ltd.\nA young Rhodesian girl, Tambu, dreams of going to school in a family that favours her brother. Breaking with her female destiny to work in the fields and bear children, Tambu realises her ambition of attending her uncle’s mission school. But all is not well. Tambu’s cousin, Nyasha, is aware of the trap of a colonial education, which empowers individuals at the cost of their belonging to family and community. As Tambu’s dream materialises, Nervous Conditions charts Nyasha’s increasingly self-destructive eating disorder in a futile rebellion against patriarchy and history.\nThe Last Duty\nby Osidore Okpewho\nPublished by Longman\nThe Last Duty is a Nigerian novel that focuses on the casualties of war. The book tells the story of the circumstances, deprivations, hardship and the zeal to survive. The central characters are Aku, wife of a man unjustly jailed for suspected pro-rebel activities, Major Ali Idris, a federal commander assigned to protect the village and its citizens, and Toje, a selfish local chief and rubber farmer who uses the circumstances of war to his own advantage. Under the intense pressure of war, their behaviour debases every moral virtue. The novelist uses dramatic monologue to capture their inner conflict that is a feature of the pressure that engulfs them. Most books on war are expected to deal with the physical casualties like the devastation of farms and residences, mass killing of soldiers and civilians, missing children and rape. But this book deals with casualties that are insidious and invisible psychological wounds – the effect of man’s inhumanity to man. The issue is treated with empathy, indicating that under pressure, we may be capable of such despicable actions.\nMarch 18, 2019\nMarch 18, 2019"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c7e0741d-1f6e-43fe-9e8c-ac53ae2324a1>","<urn:uuid:3bc01936-d66c-46e9-bee3-dcf8b2c0f824>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do water management challenges in California and Gujarat compare in terms of their impact on agriculture?","answer":"Both regions face severe water management challenges affecting agriculture, but with different specifics. California is experiencing a megadrought, possibly the worst in 1,200 years, leading to dried-up wells and water restrictions that affect farming. The state is implementing solar panel canopies over water canals as a solution, which could help irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland. In Gujarat, the situation is characterized by depleting groundwater tables, falling about 80 meters in 30 years, with farmers having to continually invest in deeper wells and more powerful pumps. In Gujarat, agriculture accounts for 90% of water use, but crop values barely exceed pumping costs, and seawater intrusion into aquifers is causing irreversible damage.","context":["Water is a constant concern in California, and now the changing climate is bringing even hotter and drier weather. The state is currently undergoing a megadrought, quite possibly the worst in over 1,200 years. Droughts over the past decade have dried up well, fueled massive wildfires and caused officials to implement water restrictions. Now, the government is hoping a new plan could bring some relief to the water-stressed state.\nCalifornia will be the first state in the country to install solar panel canopies over water canals. The $20 million project funded by the government, dubbed Project Nexus, will consist of about 8,500 feet of solar panels installed over the Turlock Irrigation District (TID) canals in Central California. Works will begin next year and to be completed by 2024.\nThe idea is simple. The panels will protect the water from solar rays and stop the water reserves from evaporating too fast and forming vegetative growth while simultaneously providing renewable energy for the local grid. It’s a creative solution to an ongoing climate change-related crisis, and while it’s a proof of concept it could be scaled if the results are considered successful.\n“Project Nexus goes beyond recognizing the linkage that water is used for energy production and energy is used for water treatment and conveyance,” a statement by TID reads. “The solar panels provide shade and wind protection over the water, reducing evaporation and also leading to a reduction in aquatic growth improving water quality.”\nThe science behind the project\nA study from last year outlined the potential benefits of the project. Researchers at the University of California, Merced looked at a larger-scale, solar-canal system in Gujarat, India, and considered what the concept could do for California, with about 4,000 miles of canals that transport water to 35 million people and 5.7 million acres of farmland.\nCovering all 4,000 miles of canals with solar panels would save 65 billion gallons of water per year by reducing evaporation. That’s enough to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or meet the water needs of two million people. The panels would generate about 13GW of power annually, equivalent to one-sixth of the state’s installed capacity.\nBut solar canals are doing much more than generating clean power and saving water: they would also indirectly protect agriculture. They would also prevent more than 80,000 acres of farmland or natural habitat from being converted for solar farms. This is a lot, considering up to 50% of new renewable energy capacity to meet the state’s climate targets could be sited in agricultural areas.\nSolar canal installations can also protect wildlife, ecosystems and land, compared to large-scale solar projects that can do the exact opposite, the researchers said. Solar canals can also improve air quality while curbing aquatic weeds that choke canals. In India, the shade from the panels limited growth for weeks which can restrict water flow.\n“California’s aging power infrastructure has contributed to catastrophic wildfires and multiday outages. Building smart solar developments on canals and other disturbed land can make power and water infrastructure more resilient while saving water, reducing costs and helping to fight climate change,” Roger Bales, study author, wrote in The Conversation.","The Worsening Water Crisis in Gujarat, India\nThis post is based on a White Paper produced by the Columbia Water Center for the workshop ‘Strategies for Sustaining Water, Energy and Incomes in North Gujarat,’ held on Jan. 4 in Ahmedabad, India. It was the kick-off event of an ambitious project to find solutions to the groundwater crisis in Gujarat, funded by the PepsiCo Foundation. More details of the project will follow this overview post.\nFor more than three decades, the farmers in Northern Gujarat State, in India, have produced abundant food crops, and have had a thriving dairy industry. In order to make that happen, they have been using once plentiful underground water resources.\nBecause local aquifers are being replenished more slowly than the water is being withdrawn, groundwater tables have been falling throughout the period, and the situation has become so serious that North Gujarat’s future agricultural success is now in jeopardy. The more the water table falls, the deeper the wells must be, and the more electricity is required to pump the water out – and the more the water table will fall.\nFarmers are the first to suffer: they have to continually invest in deeper wells and more powerful pumps, and even with these investments, the water is less plentiful and of poorer quality.\nThe state government and the utility companies, for their part, have had to finance and generate increasing amounts of expensive electricity for pumping, which they provide to the farmers at a subsidized rate. While the state’s expenditures on energy have been rising steeply, the benefit to farmers has stagnated or even declined, because the amount of water they have access to has in fact decreased.\nThe energy subsidy is currently structured so that farmers pay a flat rate, no matter how much electricity they use. While this type of subsidy provides for the immediate livelihood of the farmers, it also encourages overexploitation of water resources. Farmers have no motivation to do anything other than continue to deepen their wells and pump as much water as possible. The irony is that overusing the water will ultimately result in a complete collapse of the groundwater supply, putting them out of business entirely.\nThe futility of the system is already becoming apparent. In some places in Gujarat, the amount the government pays to subsidize groundwater pumping per agricultural hectare is more than the value of the crops produced.\nLet’s take for example the Mehsana district of Gujarat. In this semi-arid region, agriculture accounts for around 90% of the total water use, followed by domestic and industrial, and more than 80% of the land area is under cultivation. Based on datasets supplied by the Groundwater Resources Development Corporation (GRWDC), ground water levels in the region have declined by about 80 meters in the last 30 years. The current levels are anywhere from 100 meters to 200 meters below the surface. Declines in ground water levels already average about 3 meters/year, and if agricultural use intensifies, this could double in the next decade.\nSome of the water is being withdrawn from aquifers located below sea level. As a result, salt is already being detected as seawater seeps into the aquifers. This is a catastrophic turn of events, as once the seawater begins to intrude into the aquifer, it is irreversible.\nCrop choices in the region tend to maximize cash value, rather than minimize water consumption. Even though more water is being used for irrigation, the value of the crops in fact barely exceeds the energy cost of pumping.\nChanges in rainfall patterns due to climate change may also contribute to deepening the crisis.\nIt is in this setting that the Columbia Water Center and its local partners, including the Government of Gujarat itself, are actively looking for solutions. It is imperative to maintain local incomes and food production, but in the long run that won’t happen without major changes in policy and farming practice. In another blog post, we will look at a series of steps that are being taken in Gujarat this year to begin to reverse the groundwater crisis."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d222ddb8-077b-4195-a7d6-abaee8ce9961>","<urn:uuid:563fe5c6-17fb-4ff4-a881-0ec56c606c5d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do newly discovered evidence claims work in criminal cases, and what are the different legal mechanisms for presenting such evidence?","answer":"Newly discovered evidence can be presented through two main mechanisms. First, as grounds for a new trial motion, which must be filed within two years of final judgment. The defendant must prove the evidence couldn't have been found through reasonable investigation and must show a 'reasonable probability' of changing the trial outcome, considering all other evidence presented. Second, through a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, where the defendant must prove the evidence was newly discovered, couldn't have been discovered in time for a new trial motion, and creates a substantial possibility of a different trial result. The evidence must be evaluated in the context of all evidence against the defendant, and those who pleaded guilty are generally ineligible, except for Alford pleas as of 2018.","context":["Step 13 – Post Trial Motions – What Post-Trial Motions Do You File If There Is A Guilty Verdict?\nFollowing the announcement of the verdict, the defendant has the option to submit post-trial motions on a variety of topics. These are ultimately aimed at some deficiency in the verdict. These motions are exclusively available for a defendant. The state does not get to fail to carry its burden and then try again—a process referred to as double jeopardy. In some instances, the state is allowed to appeal various rulings of the trial court, but those are handled via different motions and mechanisms. Post-trial motions are especially reserved for a defendant that did not receive a fair verdict.\nMotion For A New Trial\nSection 22-3501 allows a defendant to motion for a new trial under some circumstances. The court will grant the motion when it is in “the interest of justice.” This vague standard showcases the large amount of discretion a court has in deciding whether or not to grant the motion. The motion can be made directly after the occurrence takes place or after the verdict has been rendered. Generally, these motions must be made quickly following trial, though that time limited may be extended in certain circumstances. The four most common grounds upon which a motion for a new trial is granted are discussed below.\n- Juror Misconduct\nJuror misconduct can occur when a juror “goes beyond the evidence.” This can be in the form of investigating the crime scene on his own or researching the case online. At first, this may seem like activity an engaged juror should be doing—it certainly is not. Trials are controlled by rules of evidence that have evolved over several years. These rules exist today for good reasons: they keep out dangerously unreliable evidence. It’s easy to imagine a juror doing an online search of a case and finding completely false information. The rules of evidence and the rigors of trial would flush out the weaknesses in such evidence; the computer screen cannot do that. Another common example of this type of misconduct is when an outside source communicates with the jury. Again, the danger is that this information is completely unchecked. These types of misconduct can form the basis for retrying the case with a new jury.\n- Prosecutorial Misconduct\nProsecutorial misconduct is likely the most common reason a new trial is granted. For better or worse, district attorneys are under considerable pressure to get convictions. This can and does lead to some district attorneys incorrectly prioritizing a wrongful conviction over no conviction. The most common area in which a district attorney may commit serious misconduct are closing arguments. In State v. Magdaleno, the district attorney attacked the credibility of the defense attorney by accusing her of lying to the jury. This clearly went beyond what the jury was allowed to consider; the credibility of each witness was at issue and the jury could be asked to believe one account over the other, but attempting to paint the attorney as lying was clearly aimed at inflaming the jury into convicting based on passion. Another common example of occurs when the district attorney calls attention to the fact that a defendant does not testify. The state is not allowed to encourage the jury to make an adverse inference from the defendant exercising the Fifth Amendment. Unsavory attorneys may attempt to subtlety hint at this fact, trying to get the jury to decide the case based not upon the evidence they have heard, but they evidence they have not heard. Experienced defense counsel is always prepared for this “indirect” adverse inference and courts are willing to grant a new trial when such statements are made.\n- Highly Prejudicial Errors\nNo trial is conducted perfectly: errors will happen. However, when an error is so dramatic that it costs the defendant a fair trial in some way, the court can order a new trial in response. In State v. Phillips, the state was ordered to produce taped witness interviews when the witnesses testified to very different facts on the stand. The district attorney claimed to not have the tapes at trial and the judge decided that the varying testimony given did not have to be struck. The Kansas Supreme Court disagreed, and remanded the case for a new trial. The lack of these tapes was so damning to the defendant’s case that the trial was rendered unfair. This is a high standard. Thus, most instances of error, particularly when dealing with ruling based on evidence, will not justify a new trial.\n- Newly Discovered Evidence\nA final reason for granting a new trial is the discovery of new evidence by the defendant. This reason extends the period of time in which a defendant can make a motion for new trial, allowing the motion anytime within two years of final judgment. In State v. Smith, the court set out three things that must be proven to be granted a new trial on these grounds. First, the evidence could not have been found by reasonable investigation on the defendant’s part. Second, the new evidence must be show to have a “reasonable probability” of changing the result of the trial. Though this second fact may sound manageable, it is actually fairly difficult to establish. For example, the defendant in Smith failed to establish this fact do to the other evidence which supported the state’s version of events. To put it another way, the court has stated that discovering the new evidence does not automatically entitle the defendant to a jury to weigh that evidence. Instead, the court must be convinced that the evidence could overcome all the other evidence presented to change the result. Thus, newly discovered evidence does not commonly result in new trials.\nArrest of Judgment\nAnother post-trial motion is the motion for arrest of judgment. This motion seeks to prevent the judgment from being entered by the court following the jury’s verdict. The grounds of this request are very narrow: either the charging documents fail to state a recognized crime or the court lacked jurisdiction over the crime. This motion is a rare bird indeed, as these are among the first things experienced defense counsel will check upon a defendant being charged. Adding to the rarity is the prohibition outlined in State v. Sims: the evidence presented at trial is not considered in deciding the motion. Instead, only the charging documents—the first documents filed in the case—can create the grounds necessary to succeed on this motion.\n- Step 14 – Prepare for Sentencing – What Is A Presentencing Investigation Report And Why Does It Matter?\nGet your questions answered - call me for your free, 20-minute phone consultation (913) 451-9500.","WHAT WE DO\nWe focus on post-sentencing criminal practice, bringing to bear our experience, skills, and creativity to every case as if it is our only case.\nView our areas of practice below. Don’t see what you’re looking for? Need additional assistance? Please contact us here.\nPOST CONVICTION PETITIONS\nIn Maryland, a post conviction is filed after a direct appeal. You raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (trial and/or appellate counsel) or prosecutorial misconduct. You must file in the same court where your trial or plea was heard.\nIf you were convicted after October 1, 1995, you have ten years from the date you were sentenced to file and you must be incarcerated, on parole, or on probation. You may amend with additional claims after you file. You are guaranteed a hearing. The hearing will be before a different judge than the judge who presided over your trial or plea. Typically, if you are successful, you will receive a new trial. If you successfully raise ineffective assistance for failing to file a motion for modification of sentence, you win the right to file that motion belatedly. If your post conviction is denied, you have the right to file an Application for Leave to Appeal with the Court of Special Appeals. If you win, the prosecution has the right to file an Application for Leave to Appeal.\nPETITIONS FOR ACTUAL WRIT OF INNOCENCE\nIn 2009, the Maryland Legislature passed law permitting Maryland defendants to file a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence. In order to prevail a defendant must present 1. Newly discovered evidence 2. That could not be discovered in time to move for a new trial 3. That creates a substantial possibility that the result (of the trial) may have been different.\nThe newly discovered evidence has to be argued in the context of all of the evidence against you. The Petitioner must convince a judge that if the newly discovered evidence was known at the time of the trial, the jury would not have convicted. The Petitioner must also demonstrate that the newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered by the trial attorney exercising due diligence. A 2015 Maryland Court of Appeals decision prevents those who have pleaded guilty from filing Petitions for Writ of Actual Innocence. However, in 2018 the Maryland legislature passed a bill permitting those who pleaded guilty by way of an Alford plea to file. If you lose, you have the direct right of appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. If you win, the prosecution cannot appeal.\nAPPEAL TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS\nIf you are convicted after a trial or if the court denies your Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence or Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence, you have the right of direct appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Maryland has two appellate courts, the Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals, which is Maryland’s highest court.\nThe right of “direct appeal” means the court will hear your case. You must note your appeal within 30 days of the date that sentence was imposed from a trial or 30 days from date of the court’s decision in a Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence or Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence. Noting your appeal means you inform the circuit court that you wish to appeal and you pay the filing fee. After that, the Court of Special Appeals will issue a scheduling order that will inform you when your brief is due, when the State’s brief is due, and the potential dates for oral argument. Oral argument takes place in front of a panel of 3 judges in Annapolis. Criminal defendants are not transported to argument, but the arguments are open to the public. The defendant, now referred to as an Appellant, may raise issues of court error, i.e. whether the trial court made a mistake in overruling or sustaining objections during the trial and its ruling on motions. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are usually not heard at this stage.\nMOTIONS FOR MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE\nAlso known as Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence, this motion MUST be filed within 90 days of the date of your sentence. Typically, you file within 90 days and ask the court to hold it in abeyance or sub curia. That simply means you ask the court to hold the motion and not make a decision right now.\nIf you were sentenced before July 1, 2004, the court can hold the motion indefinitely. If you were sentenced after July 1, 2004, the court has jurisdiction for five years. The court can lower your sentence or leave it the same, but it cannot increase it. The same judge who sentenced you hears your motion for modification of sentence.\nMOTIONS FOR DRUG TREATMENT\nUnder Maryland Health General Article 8-505, 8-507, the court may order a defendant to be evaluated to see if he has a substance abuse problem and is amenable to drug treatment.\nThe first step is to convince the court to order the evaluation, which is conducted by someone from the Maryland Department of Health. If the evaluation indicates that the defendant is a good candidate for treatment, the next step is to persuade the court to suspend the balance of the defendant’s sentence, place him on probation and order him into residential drug treatment at a facility designated by the Department of Health as a condition of probation. Once the residential, inpatient treatment is completed, the defendant remains on probation until he has completed his term of probation. If you lose a Motion for Drug Treatment, generally, you cannot appeal. However, there is no limit on the number of petitions you may file or deadline for filing. A change in the law that takes effect in October 2018 requires defendants convicted of violent crimes to have served 50% of the sentence before a court may order them into treatment.\nPETITIONS FOR WRIT OF ERROR CORAM NOBIS\nThis pleading is similar to a post conviction petition because you raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. You file a coram nobis petition when you are not in custody, on parole, or on probation.\nYou also file a coram nobis if you receive a probation before judgment (PBJ). In addition to alleging an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, you must also demonstrate “a significant collateral consequence.” The court has only recognized two consequences as qualifying as significant collateral consequences, immigration consequences as a result of a conviction such as deportation or enhanced federal sentencing as a result of a prior conviction.\nMOTIONS TO REOPEN\nYou may file a Motion to Reopen if you have lost post conviction. Unlike a post conviction, there is no deadline to file and no limit on the number of Motions to Reopen that you may file.\nHowever, you are not guaranteed a hearing and the vast majority of these Motions are denied without a hearing. You must allege that the lawyer who represented you on post conviction was ineffective because she failed to raise a particular post conviction claim at the time of your initial post conviction. You are arguing that your closed post conviction should be reopened because new counsel has found errors that post conviction counsel made in overlooking specific claims against trial counsel. If you lose, you have the right to file an Application for Leave to Appeal with the Court of Special Appeals. If you win, the prosecution has the right to file an Application for Leave to Appeal.\nMOTIONS TO CORRECT ILLEGAL SENTENCE\nA motion to correct illegal sentence may be filed at any time under Maryland Rule 4-345(a). The illegality must inhere in the sentence itself. What constitutes an illegal sentence that can be addressed by this rule is a fairly complex and nuanced area of the law.\nOne example is a sentence that is in excess of a binding plea. Another example is a sentence that is longer than what was spoken by the court at the time of sentencing. Yet another example is being sentenced for a crime for which you were not indicted that is not a lesser included offense of the crime for which you were indicted. If you lose, you have the right of direct appeal in the Court of Special Appeals.\nPETITIONS FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO COURT OF APPEALS\nIf you lose your appeal in the Court of Special Appeals, you have the option of seeking cert in the Court of Appeals, Maryland’s highest court. The Court of Appeals is not required to hear your case and does not take most cases. First you must file a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the Court of Appeals.\nThe Petition is your opportunity to persuade Maryland’s highest court that your case presents an interesting issue that will potentially impact other cases in the future or will, perhaps, resolve some conflict in the current case law. The petition must be filed approximately 45 days from the date the Court of Special Appeals decision is filed or within 15 days after the mandate is filed. If the Court of Appeals deems your issue “cert worthy” then it will issue a briefing order and schedule oral argument.\nAPPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL\nIf you lose your Post Conviction or Motion to Reopen you have 30 days to file an Application for Leave to Appeal with the Court of Special Appeals. Unlike a direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals does not have to hear your case. The Court of Special Appeals grants Applications for Leave to Appeal in only a tiny number of cases.\nSome estimate the number of grants to be less than 1% of all Applications. In your application, you must persuade the Court of Special Appeals to take the case by arguing that the post conviction court erred in denying your claim. If you persuade the Court, the Court will typically set it in for full briefing and oral argument in the same manner that direct appeals are handled.\nAn attorney may not accompany you to your parole hearing, but an attorney can review your base file, make a presentation to a parole commissioner on your behalf, and submit documents to your file including a home plan, letters of reference, etc.\nGive us a call at (301) 880-7118 or visit our contact page for more information."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:28359bd8-86d2-49db-a992-cc5e468cfbf5>","<urn:uuid:f8f30c31-8fe8-42ed-ace2-d8e17d454989>"],"error":null}
{"question":"SAP序列号和Gantt图表的主要目的是啥？简单说下","answer":"SAP serial numbers primarily serve the purpose of managing serialized stock and tracking inventory, specifically helping to differentiate individual pieces of equipment through unique identifiers. The combination of material number and serial number is always unique, enabling equipment management from a plant maintenance perspective. Meanwhile, Gantt charts are designed as visual project management tools to represent project timetables, track progress, anticipate delays, and efficiently allocate resources. Their main purpose is to provide a visual timeline of all project activities and help keep projects on schedule.","context":["Welcome to the next tutorial of SAP PM course! In this tutorial, you will learn about SAP Serial Numbers and their use for serializing equipment in plant maintenance. We will show how to create serial number profile, assign it in a material master record, and create a new serial number attached to equipment.\nSAP serial numbers functionality helps managing serialized stock. It is mainly focused on tracking of inventory. Serial number is the number which is assigned apart from the material number in SAP MM in order to differentiate between individual pieces and other material items. The combination of a material number and a serial number is always unique. The SAP serial numbers are used in following areas:\nSerializing a piece of equipment enables the equipment to be managed from inventory prospective. When a serial number is assigned to equipment, the equipment is linked with a material and serial number meaning that you can use material serial number to manage the equipment from plant maintenance perspective.\nTo serialize the equipment, a serial number profile must be configured in customization of plant maintenance.\nDefine SAP Serial Number Profile\nSAP serial number profile is a 4-digits number under which defines the conditions of operation for the assignment of serial numbers to equipment. It is configured in the following menu node of SPRO transaction:\nPlant Maintenance and Customer Service > Master Data in Plant Maintenance and Customer Service > Technical Objects > Serial Number Management > Define Serial Number Profiles\nIn SAP serial number profile, you define 4-digits profile number with a corresponding description. Also, there are the following parameters:\n- Serial Number Existence Requirement Indicator: This indicator determines serial number entered for transaction needs to be created first as master record. If you set this indicator, then the serial number must be created as a master record first in the system. If not, then the serial number directly can be created during business transaction.\n- Equipment Category: Equipment category according to their use. The equipment category which the system should propose for the automatic assignment of serial numbers in the case of equipment master records.\n- Stock Check for Serial Numbers: This indicator determines if stock check during serial number assignment needs to be performed or not.\nAssign SAP Serial Number Profile to Material Master Record\nSAP serial number profile has to be assigned to each material master to be serialized. You can assign separate serial number profile to material for each plant because assignment of SAP serial numbers profiles to materials is done at the plant level in material master record.\nNavigate to the following path in SAP Easy Access menu or start the transaction MM02 directly:\nLogistics > Material Management > Material Master > Material > change > Immediately MM02\nThe following screen will appear where you enter MM02 transaction. Enter the material number and click Select Views button.\nChoose Plant data/storage 2 and press Enter.\nOn change material screen, enter the serial number profile which you have configured in the customization.\nClick on Save and SAP serial number profile will be assigned to the material master record.\nCreate SAP Serial Numbers\nSAP serial numbers can be created with a length of 18 characters and support both numeric and alphabetical characters. Serial numbers can be created manually or automatically. Serial number master record can be created prior to the business transaction. If need to create an individual serial number, you can use the transaction IQ01 and if you need to create several SAP serial numbers together use IQ04 transaction.\nThe following information is contained in SAP serial number master:\n- Status information: System status provides you with the information about the current status of SAP serial number. You can also configure a custom status as user status for more information and control over SAP serial numbers.\n- Stock information: It provides the information about plant and storage location of material/equipment.\n- Serial number history: It provides the past information about serial number master.\nTo create SAP serial number, follow these steps. Navigate to the following node in SAP Easy Access menu:\nLogistics > Plant Maintenance > Management of technical objects > Serial Numbers > IQ01 – Create\nOn the initial screen of IQ01 transaction, enter following details:\n|Material Number||<Material Number>|\n|Serial Number||Enter serial number if you have one. If you don’t have one, the system will assign one.|\n|Category||< Equipment category>|\nPress Enter to continue.\nYou can enter SAP serial number specific data and click on Equipment view to create an equipment view.\nEnter the data related to the equipment and click on Save icon. SAP serial number including the equipment view will be created.\nThe created equipment view can be also changed and displayed. Start the following transaction in SAP Easy Access menu:\nLogistics > Plant Maintenance > Maintenance of technical object > Equipment > IE02 – Change\nThe following screen will appear.\nClick F4 and from the selection of input help option select Equipment by serial number list.\nThe following screen will appear where you need to enter details like material and serial number in the input fields.\nPress Execute button the equipment number will found and populated in the corresponding field as shown below.\nPress Enter to change the equipment master record.\nIf you navigate to Serial Data tab, you can view SAP serial number of this equipment.\nDid you like this tutorial?

It enables project managers to track progress, anticipates potential delays, and efficiently allocate resources. In this guide, we’ll go over the fundamentals of Gantt charts and how they may help you with project management.\nORIGINS OF THE TOOL\nIn the late 1800s, Polish engineer Karol Adamiecki developed a visual workflow chart that he called a “her monogram.”\nIn around 1910, Henry Gantt, a management consultant, and the engineer took Adamiecki’s concept to the next stage. His chart was designed to help manufacturing supervisors see whether their work was on, ahead of, or behind schedule, and it formed the foundation of the tool we use today.\nDEFINITION OF A GANTT CHART\nA Gantt Chart is a step-by-step visual timeline of all the activities included in a project. Its two main components – a timeline table and a timeline bar chart – present the information both textually and graphically.\nA Gantt Chart normally includes the project’s start and finish dates, as well as its terminal and summary tasks. Each step is shown graphically as a bar against a horizontal time scale (Gantt Chart History, Gantt Chart Software, and Gantt Chart Information, 2012).\nWhy Use Gantt Charts?\nBecause of the many advantages offered by Gantt charts, thousands of companies use Gantt charts to become more productive, enhance their communications, forecast over the long term, and track results. While some naysayers believe they limit the size of the project that can be tracked, those using Gantt charts note an array of key benefits, including the five listed here.\nREASONS TO USE THE GANTT CHARTS\nWhile there are several reasons to use Gantt charts below are five key reasons they are often advantageous:\nAvoid Completion Confusion: Gantt charts were created to keep users on track, providing a visual timeline for starting and finishing specific tasks. By providing a visual overview of milestones and other key dates, these charts offer a more understandable and memorable method of maintaining timescale-based tasks and deliverables whether tracked on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis.\nKeep everyone on the Same Page: Where there is a visual framework for the work to be done, there are fewer chances for misunderstanding, especially when it comes to highly complex tasks. Using Gantt charts allow all types of stakeholders to have the same information, set mutually understood expectations, and conduct their efforts according to the desired protocol.\nUnderstand Task Relationships: These charts can make clear how various tasks are interrelated and perhaps rely on the completion of another to meet specific objectives. These task relationships revolve around understanding the timing of each task, which then impacts other tasks listed. This can better assure the optimum workflow, maximized productivity and overall project success.\nEffectively Allocate Resources: By being able to look ahead on the Gantt chart, users can discern where resources need to be anticipated, allocated or shared to maximize the use of those resources. The more closely the chart is followed, the better chance there is of keeping project costs within budget while also better assuring on-time completion.\nGet a Handle on the Future: While it is often easy to get caught up in day-to-day tasks as detailed on a chart, Gantt chart advantages include helping decision-makers look farther ahead to ensure each given project is working toward the achievement of the organization’s long-term strategic objectives.\nWhen you set up a Gantt chart, you need to think through all of the tasks involved in your project. As part of this process, you’ll work out who will be responsible for each task, how long each task will take, and what problems your team may encounter. This detailed thinking helps you ensure that the schedule is workable, that the right people are assigned to each task, and that you have workarounds for potential problems before you start.\nThey also help you work out practical aspects of a project, such as the minimum time it will take to deliver, and which tasks need to be completed before others can start. Plus, you can use them to identify the critical path – the sequence of tasks that must individually be completed on time if the whole project is to deliver on time.\nFinally, you can use them to keep your team and your sponsors informed of progress. Simply update the chart to show schedule changes and their implications, or use it to communicate that key tasks have been completed.\nCreating the Gantt Chart\nGantt charts show all the key stages of a project and their duration as a bar chart, with the time scale across the top. The key stages are placed on the bar chart in sequence, starting in the top left corner and ending in the bottom right corner (Figure 1). A Gantt chart can be drawn quickly and easily and is often the first tool a project manager uses to provide a rough estimate of the time that it will take to complete the key tasks.\nSometimes it is useful to start with the target deadline for the completion of the whole project because it is soon apparent if the time scale is too short or unnecessarily long. The detailed Gantt chart is usually constructed after the main objectives have been determined. Below is an example of a Gantt chart.\nGANTT CHART BASIC PROCEDURE\nThe basic procedure must be followed to build a Gantt chart.\n1). Identify the steps or activities needed to complete the project.\n2). Identify milestones within the project.\n3). Identify the expected time required to complete each task.\n4). Identify the sequence of tasks and the order of precedence of tasks.\n5). Draw a horizontal time axis on the bottom of a page.\n6). Select a proper time scale to represent the length of tasks.\n7). Prepare a column on the left side of the paper; write down each activity and milestone of the project in their corresponding order of occurrence.\n8). Activities or milestones that occur at a specific point in time represent them using a diamond under the time the activity must happen.\n9). Activities that occur over a determined period draw horizontal bars, or an empty rectangle starting from the first day the activity will take place and finishing the day the activity ends. Do not fill inside the rectangle.\n10). Each activity or task must be listed in the Gantt chart.\n11). Fill up the diamond or the rectangle as each activity is being performed.\n12). Use a weight or plumb as a vertical marker to illustrate the actual time and progress of the project.\nGantt Chart Considerations\nGantt charts are also modified with additional columns showing details such as the amount of time estimated to perform each task, how many resources are needed to complete each activity and/or the person responsible to execute the activity.\nSpecific meetings or reviewing processes are not recommended to be listed on a Gantt chart because they might occur over a long period. Gantt chart will transmit a clear idea to construction professionals about what must be done to complete a specific task and can promote a healthy scheduling process.\nYou can see an example in Figure 1, below:\nCOMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID WHEN USING A GANTT CHART.\nWhile Gantt charts can be extremely valuable tools for project management, there are certain typical flaws that can impair their usefulness. One error is forgetting to update the chart on a regular basis, which can result in erroneous information and missed deadlines.\nAnother common error is failing to include all essential activities and dependencies, which can lead to incomplete or unrealistic timelines. Overcomplicating the chart with too much detail might also make it difficult to read and understand.\nBy avoiding these typical blunders, you can ensure that your Gantt chart is a useful tool for project management.\nAlso read: How can we assess the needs of the community\nGantt Chart – Gantt Chart History, Gantt Chart Software, and Gantt Chart Information, Retrieved from http://www.ganttchart.com/index.html\nGantt Chart – Wikipedia, Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart\nDoran, George T. “There’s a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management’s goals and objectives.” Management Review 70.11 (Nov. 1981): 35.

{"question":"What are the key differences in control systems between jaw crusher operations and coal mine crushing facilities?","answer":"Coal mine crushing facilities utilize sophisticated control systems operated from dedicated control rooms, where operators monitor parameters like motor power, chamber pressure and tonnage through PLCs and automation systems. They can adjust crusher performance and wear part lifetime through automated monitoring. In contrast, jaw crushers rely more on mechanical control through toggle plates and swing jaw mechanisms. The toggle plate sets the closed setting while still allowing the necessary open-close action for crushing force generation. Jaw crusher control focuses primarily on managing the compression force and protecting against uncrushable materials through mechanical means rather than electronic monitoring.","context":["Coal mining - Underground mining Britannica\nCoal mining - Coal mining - Underground mining: In underground coal mining, the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium, which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata.

{"question":"benefits business + control farm data sharing?","answer":"The business benefits of farm management software include financial gains through efficient resource allocation, improved supply chain management, and better tracking of KPIs. Major companies like Nestle use these platforms to monitor supplier compliance with responsible sourcing standards. Regarding data sharing control, farmers maintain authority over who can access and use their farm data. Any sharing with third parties requires first securing a legally binding commitment to follow the same terms as the original agreement. Farmers must be notified of potential data sales and have the option to opt out. Additionally, contracts must use simple language and clearly specify terms, definitions, purpose of data collection, storage information, and verification mechanisms.","context":["Farm management software – agriculture’s ‘super app’\nFarming is proving to be somewhat of a growth industry for digital data. Improvements in satellite imagery offer a birds-eye view of crop health across the globe. And when governments are warning farmers to be on the lookout for cybercriminals, you can be certain that digital transformation in agriculture is booming. For more evidence, it’s worth looking at the number of software vendors in the farming sector. Results presented at the Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems suggest that food producers have a choice of around 180 different farm management software products from as many as 130 different providers.\nToday, farm management software has evolved into a kind of ‘super app’ for the agricultural industry and brings together a range of key features. Basic functions include budgeting and sales performance, task scheduling, as well as systems for machinery management. And newer capabilities are being added all the time – for example, to improve food traceability and promote quality assurance. Sensors and other precision agritech also make valuable digital contributions that ultimately help bring food to the table.\nConsidering the supply chain, BIS Research – a market intelligence firm headquartered in Fremont, US – breaks the value transfer process down into six elements. These stakeholder groups comprise input companies, farmers, trading & processing companies, food companies, retailers, and, lastly, consumers. “Farm management software, including data analytics, has a huge influence on the entire value chain, starting from managing inputs to the end user,” said Rakhi Tanwar, Principal Analyst at BIS Research, in a recent presentation. “It allows efficient resource allocation as well as helping in the overall management of farming operations.” And the range of use cases are definitely worth exploring.\nThe capability of fertilizers in boosting crop yields has been good news in terms of putting food on the table. But the process has taken its toll on the soil. There are other environmental burdens to consider as well. The chemical production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. But stepping back and reducing the dependency of modern agriculture on chemical fertilizers requires giving farmers a helping hand. And this is driving big investments in field sensors and other technologies, which can provide a much more precise measure of crop health.\nThanks to this digital knowledge – and the analytics that go with it – farm management software can incorporate these useful real-time views. The output gives farmers an up to date digital guidebook that helps them better target fertilizer application so that resources can be used more sparingly. As Tanwar points out, farm management software bridges the gap between the various hardware systems and sensors. And popular solutions automate this data transfer, keeping manual inputs to a minimum.\nBig players in the farm management software space include US firms Agworld, Conservis, Trimble, and Farmlogs; India-based FarmERP; Australian firm AgriWebb; and AGRIVI from the UK.\nAcross all firms, a common theme is the ability of farm management software to raise the game on sustainability. On its blog, AGRIVI references findings from The CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security, which estimates that agriculture and food production contribute up to 29% of global greenhouse gas emissions. We’ve already touched on fertilizer contributions, but there are other greenhouse gas emissions sources to consider too.\nFarm machinery powered by fossil fuels adds to the release of carbon dioxide. And it’s common knowledge that raising livestock is considerably resource-intensive, releasing various greenhouse gases in the process. Plus there’s the loss of carbon locked up in the soil from any land clearing that occurs to create fields for crop planting. The message is a strong one, but the good news is that knowledge-based approaches enabled through farm management software can make a positive impact. Data-driven systems give farmers the tools to prioritize sustainability and confer confidence in the decisions made.\nWhat’s more, there’s lots of innovation making its way through solutions pipeline. FarmERP’s developers are looking at the use of blockchain to ‘track the provenance of agriproducts’. According to the firm, supply chain stakeholders can log into the blockchain platform and make use of the secure ledger to safeguard data from being tampered with. Trimble’s ‘Virtual farm’ puts all farm management software features into a 3D view, simplifying the workflow and making options easy to navigate for users. Tabs include options such as ‘Field Variability’, ‘Weed Management’, and ‘Application Consistency’. There’s also a return on investment (ROI) calculator to highlight the savings that could potentially be realized through precision agriculture.\nThere are major financial gains to be made through the efficient use of farm management software, which explains – in part – why big food producers are investing in platforms for their suppliers. Nestle issued a responsible sourcing standard in 2018 [PDF], and today the multinational uses farm management software to create traceability across its supply chain. The food producer reportedly has 376 factories in 81 countries, and by equipping suppliers with farm management software, it’s able to track KPI’s that relate to its responsible sourcing commitments, such as soil health.\nBig data can attract suspicion in some quarters, but it’s hard to object to digital information being used to nurse the planet back to health and make the future of food more sustainable.","A list of definitions that are relevant to the agricultural sector. For example: what types of data are going to be collected, what is considered to be personal data, agricultural data, individual farm data, raw data, aggregated data, data originator, data provider...\nThe Codes of Conduct\nThe tool features the following clauses from which the users should be able to select a clause if they think it is relevant and proceed to a checkout where the selected clauses can be used as an output to a document.\nThese clauses are not intended to be exhaustive and are no substitute for a robust institutional framework to guide and operationalize decision making concerning privacy, ethics.\nClick the + sign next to Clauses that are relevent to you to start building your Code of Conduct\nIt should be mentioned that farmers own information generated on their farming operations. In particular whoever has produced/collected the data either by technical means or by himself, or who has commissioned data providers for this purpose, has a leading role in controlling the access to and use of data from their business and to benefit from sharing the data with any partner that wishes to use their data. Providers should preserve the ability of the farmer to determine who can access and use individual farm data. However, it would be good for the farmer to agree upon data use and sharing with the other stakeholders with an economic interest, such as the tenant, landowner, cooperative, owner of the precision agriculture system hardware, and/or an Ag Tech Provider(ATP) etc.\nCollection, access and use of farm data should be granted only with the affirmative and explicit consent of the farmer. Via a contractual arrangement the collection, access, storage and use of agricultural data can be occurred only with the explicit informed permission of the data originator. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. In order to obtain freely given consent, it must be given on a voluntary basis. The element “free” implies a real choice by the farmer. Any element of inappropriate pressure or influence which could affect the outcome of that choice renders the consent invalid. For consent to be informed and specific, the farmer must at least be notified about the provider’s identity, what kind of data will be processed, how it will be used, to whom it will be disclosed and the purpose of the processing.

{"question":"How do the American Psychological Association and IAEVG differ in their primary organizational missions?","answer":"The American Psychological Association's primary mission is to promote the advancement, communication, and application of psychological science to benefit society and improve lives, specifically focusing on making a positive impact on critical societal issues and elevating public understanding of psychology as a science. In contrast, IAEVG's mission focuses on the global provision of educational and vocational guidance by competent professionals, helping people make lifelong choices and decisions across their life roles, particularly in relation to labor market dynamics and workplace preparation. While both organizations aim to benefit society, APA concentrates on psychological science advancement, while IAEVG emphasizes vocational and educational guidance services.","context":["IAEVG Ethical Guidelines\nProposed Revision adopted on 29 November, 2017 by the IAEVG General Assembly, Mexico City, MEXICO.\nOriginal version approved by the IAEVG General Assembly, Stockholm, Sweden, August 1995\nThe International Association for Educational and Vocational Guidance (IAEVG) is committed to the global provision of educational and vocational guidance, provided by competent and recognized professionals. IAEVG members facilitate the dignity, freedom, and integrity of people in making lifelong choices and decisions at all ages, across their life roles, as they anticipate, prepare for, enter into, face and cope with the dynamics of the labour market and the workplace.\nIAEVG members recognize that vocational choices and career development have an impact that reaches beyond the individual, including responsibilities to families, communities, and the larger society and environment. National and global economies and the structure of the labour market influence individual’s and families’ opportunities and constraints related to career directions, decisions and sustainable careers. Thus, members have important roles for influencing the social discourses in institutions and networks that shape the nature of policies and services, the theories and tools that are used, and the resources available to clients and the public. In turn, members are engaged in the process of defining and redefining the nature of services and the goals and targets of organizations concerned with educational and vocational guidance. Thus, social justice is a foundation for supporting clients and the public and for shaping the organizational structures where members deliver educational and guidance services.\nThe IAEVG Ethical Guidelines are dedicated to supporting members in their practices to enhance the worth, dignity, potential, and uniqueness of those persons whom IAEVG members serve. Through joining IAEVG, members agree to the conscious and deliberate application of ethical standards of conduct. The Guidelines provide a reference for (a) making decisions and actions as individual practitioners, (b) planning agency policies and services, (c) informing the public of expected standards of professional practices and behaviour, (d) providing evaluative criteria for self-assessments, peer evaluation, and supervision to ensure quality standards in service provision, and (e) seeking organizational support for professional development.\nThe Ethical Guidelines are intended to stimulate the professional development of IAEVG members in their ethical behaviour, through identifying minimum essentials and aspirational goals for ethical behaviour. The Guidelines cannot address every possible ethical conflict that IAEVG members experience in their national or cultural contexts. However, the Guidelines can be used to create ethical guidelines in the countries and local regions for which these may be applied and adapted.\nEthical Responsibilities to Clients\n1 IAEVG members take into account the holistic needs of clients (educational, vocational, personal and social) as they interact in the planning process, the adjustment to education and training, occupations, and careers, and/or clients’ capacity to fully engage with services, and seek additional resources, including relevant experts, to address clients’ needs.\n2 IAEVG members accept the primary obligation to mutually respect the dignity of each person to whom educational and vocational guidance services are rendered. This obligation includes acceptance of the rights of the individual to make independent and socially just choices, to take responsibility for decisions reached, to engage in self-direction and self-development, and to preserve confidentiality. However, in situations where clients hold antisocial values that are of danger to themselves or others, it may be necessary for the practitioner to indicate what his/her professional values are and to what extent he/she supports social conventions. Members are responsible to behave according to laws and policies that pertain to client rights and limits of confidentiality.\n3 IAEVG members are aware of their values and attitudes, in order to avoid the unnecessary imposition of their personal values and strive to take into account the worldviews of their clients. Members refrain from consciously dictating or coercing client choices, values, lifestyles, plans, or beliefs (e.g., general views on economic life) that represent the worldview of the practitioner or other people, but not the client's worldview. In particular, they avoid all forms of stereotyping and discrimination, e.g., racism, sexism, ageism, classism, and pro-actively work to overcome the impact of these forms of oppression on clients’ access to and full participation in meaningful education and employment.\n4 IAEVG members inform clients, orally or in writing, of the purposes, goals, techniques, policies and ethical guidelines under which educational and vocational guidance is provided, conditions in which consultation with other professionals might occur, and legal or policy constraints which relate to how services are provided. In doing so, members consider the limits of confidentiality when working with minors and other vulnerable persons. Any limits on confidentiality set by others will be discussed with the client before proceeding, supporting the client to choose personal responses to such limits and involvement. Disclosure of confidential information normally requires the client's expressed consent and must be considered in light of potential harm to the client or others.\n5 IAEVG members avoid conflicts of interests which compromise the best interests of their clients when they engage concurrently in direct roles with clients such as career counselling, serve as representatives of paid employment exchanges or as paid recruiters or intermediaries for education and training institutions/organisations. Where potential conflicts of interests occur, they should be made known to the client as soon as possible, and preferably before commencing service provision.\n6 IAEVG members use relevant standards to select and administer assessment and provide interpretation of results, including the cultural specificity and relevancy of assessment protocols. Such practitioners provide explanations of the content, purposes, and results of tests in language that is understandable to clients. Members recognize that emerging techniques and service environments (e.g., technology-assisted assessment or career guidance programs; distance guidance and counseling) require background training and continuing familiarity with the professional literature.\n7 IAEVG members promote the benefits, to clients, of new techniques and those that are empirically validated, in supporting their clients to make informed choices about service provision. This includes the use of appropriate technology and/or social media resources when research or evaluation warrants such use. Members ensure that the use of technology and/or social media resources or other techniques are appropriate for the individual needs of the client, that the client understands how to use the technique or process involved, and that follow-up assistance is provided, if needed. Members of IAEVG recognize how technology and distance guidance and counselling have a unique impact on issues such as informed consent, limits of confidentiality, data security, identity verification, cyber-bullying, professional boundaries, and record keeping. Members advocate for equitable access to technology and/or social media resources by members of under-represented groups, and to non-discriminatory, current and accurate information whenever technologies are used.\n8 1. IAEVG, members, in representing their professional competencies, training and experience to individual clients as well as to organizations for which consultation is requested, provide information that is clear, accurate, current, and relevant and does not include misleading or deceptive statements or materials.\n9 IAEVG members function within the scope of practice relative to their training and experience. IAEVG members make appropriate referral when their professional assistance cannot be provided or continued, or when services requested are beyond the scope of practice for which the IAEVG member is qualified to provide.\n10 IAEVG members who work as independent practitioners are transparent about their professional fees and other costs for services, e.g., assessment material. Members structure their fees to provide reasonable access to services and/or provide appropriate referrals. In providing independent services, members respect intellectual property, brands, and patents on the use of material for commercial purposes. Seeking fees for services does not outweigh the responsibilities for practitioners to work within their qualified scope of practice.\n11 IAEVG members demonstrate social responsibility for increasing access to vocational and guidance services, and for providing relevant and beneficial professional services. In striving for social justice, members recognize the obligation to advocate for the provision of equitable opportunities in educational and vocational guidance without prejudice to persons, including diversity on dimensions such as social class, educational background, age, gender, race/ethnicity, religious beliefs, abilities, sexual orientation, and their intersections.\n12 IAEVG Members avoid all forms of oppressive social practices such as discrimination, and actively work directly with clients and the public, and on their behalf, to address oppressive social and structural inequalities in education and employment systems.\nAttitudes to Colleagues and Professional Associates\n1 IAEVG members proactively develop and maintain cooperative relationships with professional colleagues and administrators in order to facilitate the provision of optimal educational and vocational guidance.\n2 IAEVG members inform colleagues and administrators about aspects of the provision of educational and vocational guidance such as confidentiality and privacy guidelines.\n3 IAEVG members provide professional colleagues and administrators with accurate, objective, concise and relevant information about the needs of the clientele they serve and the public, while respecting confidentiality. Members also provide data that may be used in the evaluation and presentation of outcomes related to service provision.\n4 IAEVG members cooperate with their professional colleagues in implementing the Ethical Guidelines in the procedures and practices of their work setting. When concerns arise as to the ethical behaviour of professional colleagues, whether IAEVG members or not, the member should discuss such concerns with the colleague or use available institutional channels, such as agency administrators, local or national associations, to address the concerns and remedy potential harm to clients or the public.\n5 IAEVG members, in cases where ethical issues are unclear or ambiguous, will consult in a confidential manner with a professional association or colleagues to attempt to clarify the issue or develop strategies to rectify the conditions that caused the problem. Failing that possibility, practitioners should directly contact the Secretary General of IAEVG to seek clarification, advice or to raise a query of professional ethics.\nBehaviours Towards Government, Employers, Community Agencies, and Community Members\n1 IAEVG members familiarise themselves with current relevant national and regional policies for education, training, employment, social inclusion, which provide the context for their work.\n2 IAEVG members are encouraged to liaise proactively with parents, community elders and leaders, and other representatives of local populations who may have a significant influence on career choices and service access.\n3 IAEVG members identify the needs of clients and the public to overcome structural and social barriers to accessing relevant, timely, and equitable service provision. Members use their knowledge to advocate for educational and vocational guidance services and policies that are ethically rendered and relevant to client needs in cooperation with policy-makers, legislators, and/or the administrative personnel of publically and privately funded organizations.\n4 IAEVG members insist that professional guidance entails more than providing information and/or job placement activities and services. Members take a stand, individually and collectively, on public policies that pose barriers for their clients and the public, and that limit their capacity to deliver high quality services.\n5 IAEVG members support their professional associations in efforts to educate and inform administrators, legislators, members of other organizations, and the public, of the accepted qualifications and training expectations of competent practitioners of educational and vocational guidance.\n6 IAEVG members engage employers to work collaboratively in the development of workplaces that invest in training, respectful and safe workplace conditions, and opportunities for enhancing the career development of employees. While recognizing employers’ needs for flexibility, employees also need workplace conditions that provide security and meaningful work.\nResponsibilities to Theory and Research\n1 IAEVG members participate in research and report findings using procedures that are consistent with the accepted ethical and scientific standards of educational and psychological research practices. When client data are used for statistical, evaluative, research or program planning purposes, the IAEVG member ensures the confidentiality of the identity of individual clients, and seeks client permission of such data.\n2 IAEVG members use their knowledge to inform theory and its applicability to clients and the public. Such knowledge can also be used to inform relevant research directed at improving conditions in the lives of clients and the public.\n3 IAEVG members strive to conduct research in ways that inform individuals, groups, and personnel within organizations who have participated in the research, with the intention of contributing to their understanding of the research results and ways that the results can be applied.\n4 IAEVG members share in the improvement of educational and vocational guidance by mobilizing research knowledge and dissemination to colleagues, professional associations, policy-makers, organizations, and society at large.\nResponsibilities for Professional Learning and Development\n1 IAEVG members obtain the initial educational and vocational guidance training and maintain a process of continuous professional development and learning to be a qualified and competent practitioner.\n2 IAEVG members seek opportunities to support their personal professional development and participate in networks that influence the topics and resources made available for professional development.\n3 IAEVG members continue to reflect in their practice both the humanistic principles that underlie ethical behaviour as well as attention to the changing social and political contexts that have ethical implications for practice. Reflections may include questions and discussions about the nature of our work; who are our clientele (students, parents, workers, employers, society as a whole); and what are the ethical issues of importance in these relationships? How do different forms of intervention (individual counselling, group work, technology-assisted programs, and consultation with management on behalf of workers) differ in ethical concerns? How should educational and vocational guidance services ethically respond to the global tensions between economic and environmental issues in the working lives and workplaces of clients? How can practitioners actively address issues of equity, social justice, and sustainable careers? What is our role in supporting individuals and families while also supporting the sustainability of systems and economic structures in society?\n4 IAEVG members are responsible for monitoring and maintaining their professional competencies and for ensuring that they are able to provide competent services to diverse clientele, taking into account people’s cultural contexts, effectively using contemporary assessment processes, theories, intervention techniques, and technology and social media resources. IAEVG members strive to be current with innovations and trends in the local and global contexts of educational and vocational guidance and counseling and do so with a commitment to addressing social inequities.\n5 IAEVG members seek and participate in regular supervision through which to increase the knowledge and skills required to effectively discharge their professional responsibilities and to develop goals for continuous life-long learning. Peer-supervision is encouraged in countries and contexts where formal supervision arrangements are not available. IAEVG members are also encouraged to provide supervisory and consultation expertise to their colleagues.\nIAEVG members are also encouraged to refer to the following documents that relate to the content outlined in the Ethical Guidelines:\nAvailable on the IAEVG Website, https://iaevg.com/\n1.

{"question":"How do TCP and UDP differ in their approaches to reliability and data delivery?","answer":"TCP and UDP have fundamentally different approaches to reliability and data delivery. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable delivery by managing message acknowledgment, retransmission, and timeouts. It makes multiple attempts to deliver messages and re-sends lost data. TCP also guarantees ordered delivery by buffering out-of-order data until it can be properly arranged. In contrast, UDP is a connectionless protocol that offers no reliability guarantees - messages may be lost, arrive out of order, or get duplicated with no built-in mechanism for acknowledgment or retransmission. UDP is simpler and more lightweight since it doesn't track connections or handle reliability mechanisms. BBR, a recent improvement to TCP developed by Google researchers, enhances TCP's reliability by using mathematical modeling to determine optimal data transmission rates and prevent congestion.","context":["What is TCP?\nSince the beginning of the its existence, the internet has expanded in scope, traffic, content, and a myriad of other ways. The protocols that make up the internet’s backbone have mostly remained the same since they were developed in the 1980s. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was one of the first networking protocols defined during the internet’s development, and specifies how data should be transmitted and received. TCP implementations, initially developed in the 1980’s, attempted to discover the right rate at which to send data by constantly trying to send more until reaching the point that not all of the data arrived at its destination, and then backing off on the amount being sent. Multiple TCP connections would share links, because each connection’s attempts to use more and more bandwidth would end up with each claiming part of the available bandwidth. For over 30 years, TCP has been how everyone connects to services on the internet, and its canonical implementation has been held up as the gold standard method for how network capacity can be shared amongst competing users. Recently, a group of Google researchers, including TCP pioneer Van Jacobson, developed a better algorithm for congestion control. BBR, or Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (Round-Trip Time), directly measures and models the network bottleneck in order to determine the right rate at which to send data. It uses analytical math, instead of the more traditional “guess and check” method used by older implementations of TCP. This modeling-based approach can more fully exploit existing network capabilities, leading to increased connection bandwidth without needing to upgrade network hardware. This represents a critical upgrade for today’s internet which handles exponentially increasing amounts of data.\nHow Does BBR Make the Internet Work Better?\nBBR prevents traffic congestion by measuring how fast the network can actually deliver data, and then using that rate to construct a model of the network’s capabilities. This model is then used to determine how much data can be sent at a time. By using this model (and repeatedly re-measuring to verify that the model remains correct) BBR-based TCP can transmit data at the right rate without causing congestion and loss of in-flight data. Even more, this model indicates that there is a lot of spare network capacity that older implementations of TCP are unable to utilize. By discovering this available capacity and making it available for use, BBR unlocks network capabilities that have always existed, but have never before been easily used. Using BBR TCP means that the right rate of traffic transmission is much more quickly discovered and that less traffic has to be re-sent. Additionally, the BBR TCP rate is frequently faster than the rate discovered by older TCP implementations. This makes for a faster everything – measurement, connection, etc., and increases accuracy of measurement. Additionally, this update can be implemented on just the server side, and so doesn’t require patches for individual browsers or smartphones. The move to BBR-based TCP has already started to happen without most of us even noticing.\nHow Does BBR Affect Measurement Lab\nM-Lab is already planning to do the work on the platform side to support BBR based TCP measurement, which will allow for more accurate and faster speed tests at the scale that M-Lab already supports.\nA BBR-based version of our NDT speed test should allow users to more accurately determine their network download capacity, and should allow them to do so in network contexts (high-latency networks, networks with high packet loss) that were previously infeasible for accurate testing. The more accurate version of NDT should be rolled out transparently to users - the main difference they will notice is that their download speed might improve. We will also be working with partners to develop new testing clients which should be able to determine correct download speeds in much less time than the 10-second test interval that NDT currently requires. We do this in an effort to continue to measure the end-to-end capacity available to internet users - the rollout of BBR-based TCP on servers across the internet means that we need it on our servers as well. Because BBR-based TCP implementations have different internals from older TCP implementations, the schema for our saved TCP data will change correspondingly. We will work with our data partners to ensure a smooth transition from the old-style results to the new ones. Right now, there are more than 250,000 download speed tests performed against M-Lab’s software infrastructure every day. Thanks to BBR, those tests are all going to get an upgrade.","In computer networking, the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core communication protocols of the Internet protocol suite used to send messages (transported as datagrams in packets) to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. Within an IP network, UDP does not require prior communication to set up communication channels or data paths.\n|Developer(s)||David P. Reed|\n|OSI layer||Transport layer (4)|\nUDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may instead use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.\nUDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.\nUDP is a simple message-oriented transport layer protocol that is documented in RFC 768. Although UDP provides integrity verification (via checksum) of the header and payload, it provides no guarantees to the upper layer protocol for message delivery and the UDP layer retains no state of UDP messages once sent. For this reason, UDP sometimes is referred to as Unreliable Datagram Protocol. If transmission reliability is desired, it must be implemented in the user's application.\nA number of UDP's attributes make it especially suited for certain applications.\n- It is transaction-oriented, suitable for simple query-response protocols such as the Domain Name System or the Network Time Protocol.\n- It provides datagrams, suitable for modeling other protocols such as IP tunneling or remote procedure call and the Network File System.\n- It is simple, suitable for bootstrapping or other purposes without a full protocol stack, such as the DHCP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol.\n- It is stateless, suitable for very large numbers of clients, such as in streaming media applications such as IPTV.\n- The lack of retransmission delays makes it suitable for real-time applications such as Voice over IP, online games, and many protocols using Real Time Streaming Protocol.\n- Because it supports multicast, it is suitable for broadcast information such as in many kinds of service discovery and shared information such as Precision Time Protocol and Routing Information Protocol.\nApplications can use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. An application binds a socket to its endpoint of data transmission, which is a combination of an IP address and a port. In this way, UDP provides application multiplexing. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16-bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65535. Port 0 is reserved but is a permissible source port value if the sending process does not expect messages in response.\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has divided port numbers into three ranges. Port numbers 0 through 1023 are used for common, well-known services. On Unix-like operating systems, using one of these ports requires superuser operating permission. Port numbers 1024 through 49151 are the registered ports used for IANA-registered services. Ports 49152 through 65535 are dynamic ports that are not officially designated for any specific service, and may be used for any purpose. These may also be used as ephemeral ports, which software running on the host may use to dynamically create communications endpoints as needed.\nUDP datagram structureEdit\nA UDP datagram consists of a datagram header followed by a data section (the payload data for the application). The UDP datagram header consists of 4 fields, each of which is 2 bytes (16 bits):\n|0||0||Source port||Destination port|\nThe use of the checksum and source port fields is optional in IPv4 (pink background in table). In IPv6 only the source port field is optional.\n- Source port number\n- This field identifies the sender's port, when used, and should be assumed to be the port to reply to if needed. If not used, it should be zero. If the source host is the client, the port number is likely to be an ephemeral port. If the source host is the server, the port number is likely to be a well-known port number from 0 to 1023.\n- Destination port number\n- This field identifies the receiver's port and is required. Similar to source port number, if the client is the destination host then the port number will likely be an ephemeral port number and if the destination host is the server then the port number will likely be a well-known port number.\n- This field specifies the length in bytes of the UDP header and UDP data. The minimum length is 8 bytes, the length of the header. The field size sets a theoretical limit of 65,535 bytes (8-byte header + 65,527 bytes of data) for a UDP datagram. However the actual limit for the data length, which is imposed by the underlying IPv4 protocol, is 65,507 bytes (65,535 bytes − 8-byte UDP header − 20-byte IP header).\n- Using IPv6 jumbograms it is possible to have UDP datagrams of size greater than 65,535 bytes. RFC 2675 specifies that the length field is set to zero if the length of the UDP header plus UDP data is greater than 65,535.\n- The checksum field may be used for error-checking of the header and data. This field is optional in IPv4, and mandatory in most cases in IPv6. The field carries all-zeros if unused.\nChecksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of a pseudo header of information from the IP header, the UDP header, and the data, padded with zero octets at the end (if necessary) to make a multiple of two octets.\nIn other words, all 16-bit words are summed using one's complement arithmetic. Add the 16-bit values up. On each addition, if a carry-out (17th bit) is produced, swing that 17th carry bit around and add it to the least significant bit of the running total. Finally, the sum is then one's complemented to yield the value of the UDP checksum field.\nIf the checksum calculation results in the value zero (all 16 bits 0) it should be sent as the one's complement (all 1s) as a zero-value checksum indicates no checksum has been calculated. In this case, any specific processing is not required at the receiver, because all 0s and all 1s are equal to zero in 1's complement arithmetic.\nThe differences between IPv4 and IPv6 are in the pseudo header used to compute the checksum, and that the checksum is not optional in IPv6. Under specific conditions, a UDP application using IPv6 is allowed to use a zero UDP zero-checksum mode with a tunnel protocol.\nIPv4 pseudo headerEdit\nWhen UDP runs over IPv4, the checksum is computed using a \"pseudo header\" that contains some of the same information from the real IPv4 header.: 2 The pseudo header is not the real IPv4 header used to send an IP packet, it is used only for the checksum calculation.\n|0||0||Source IPv4 Address|\n|4||32||Destination IPv4 Address|\n|12||96||Source Port||Destination Port|\nThe source and destination addresses are those in the IPv4 header. The protocol is that for UDP (see List of IP protocol numbers): 17 (0x11). The UDP length field is the length of the UDP header and data. The field data stands for the transmitted data.\nUDP checksum computation is optional for IPv4. If a checksum is not used it should be set to the value zero.\nIPv6 pseudo headerEdit\nAs IPv6 has larger addresses and a different header lay-out, the method used to compute the checksum is changed accordingly:\nAny transport or other upper-layer protocol that includes the addresses from the IP header in its checksum computation must be modified for use over IPv6, to include the 128-bit IPv6 addresses instead of 32-bit IPv4 addresses.\nWhen computing the checksum, again a pseudo header is used that mimics the real IPv6 header:\n|0||0||Source IPv6 Address|\n|16||128||Destination IPv6 Address|\n|36||288||Zeroes||Next Header = Protocol|\n|40||320||Source Port||Destination Port|\nThe source address is the one in the IPv6 header. The destination address is the final destination; if the IPv6 packet does not contain a Routing header, that will be the destination address in the IPv6 header; otherwise, at the originating node, it will be the address in the last element of the Routing header, and, at the receiving node, it will be the destination address in the IPv6 header. The value of the Next Header field is the protocol value for UDP: 17. The UDP length field is the length of the UDP header and data.\nReliability and congestion controlEdit\nLacking reliability, UDP applications may encounter some packet loss, reordering, errors or duplication. If using UDP, the end-user applications must provide any necessary handshaking such as real-time confirmation that the message has been received. Applications, such as TFTP, may add rudimentary reliability mechanisms into the application layer as needed. If an application requires a high degree of reliability, a protocol such as the Transmission Control Protocol may be used instead.\nMost often, UDP applications do not employ reliability mechanisms and may even be hindered by them. Streaming media, real-time multiplayer games and voice over IP (VoIP) are examples of applications that often use UDP. In these particular applications, loss of packets is not usually a fatal problem. In VoIP, for example, latency and jitter are the primary concerns. The use of TCP would cause jitter if any packets were lost as TCP does not provide subsequent data to the application while it is requesting re-sending of the missing data.\nNumerous key Internet applications use UDP, including: the Domain Name System (DNS), the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).\nVoice and video traffic is generally transmitted using UDP. Real-time video and audio streaming protocols are designed to handle occasional lost packets, so only slight degradation in quality occurs, rather than large delays if lost packets were retransmitted. Because both TCP and UDP run over the same network, in the mid-2000s a few businesses found that an increase of UDP traffic from these real-time applications slightly hindered the performance of applications using TCP such as point of sale, accounting, and database systems (when TCP detects packet loss, it will throttle back its data rate usage).\nQUIC is a transport protocol built on top of UDP. QUIC provides a reliable and secure connection. HTTP/3 uses QUIC as opposed to earlier versions of HTTPS which use a combination of TCP and TLS to ensure reliability and security respectively. This means that HTTP/3 uses a single handshake to set up a connection, rather than having two separate handshakes for TCP and TLS, meaning the overall time to establish a connection is reduced.\nComparison of UDP and TCPEdit\nTransmission Control Protocol is a connection-oriented protocol and requires handshaking to set up end-to-end communications. Once a connection is set up, user data may be sent bi-directionally over the connection.\n- Reliable – TCP manages message acknowledgment, retransmission and timeouts. Multiple attempts to deliver the message are made. If data gets lost along the way, data will be re-sent. In TCP, there's either no missing data, or, in case of multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped.\n- Ordered – If two messages are sent over a connection in sequence, the first message will reach the receiving application first. When data segments arrive in the wrong order, TCP buffers the out-of-order data until all data can be properly re-ordered and delivered to the application.\n- Heavyweight – TCP requires three packets to set up a socket connection before any user data can be sent. TCP handles reliability and congestion control.\n- Streaming – Data is read as a byte stream, no distinguishing indications are transmitted to signal message (segment) boundaries.\nUser Datagram Protocol is a simpler message-based connectionless protocol. Connectionless protocols do not set up a dedicated end-to-end connection. Communication is achieved by transmitting information in one direction from source to destination without verifying the readiness or state of the receiver.\n- Unreliable – When a UDP message is sent, it cannot be known if it will reach its destination; it could get lost along the way. There is no concept of acknowledgment, retransmission, or timeout.\n- Not ordered – If two messages are sent to the same recipient, the order in which they arrive cannot be guaranteed.\n- Lightweight – There is no ordering of messages, no tracking connections, etc. It is a very simple transport layer designed on top of IP.\n- Datagrams – Packets are sent individually and are checked for integrity on arrival. Packets have definite boundaries which are honored upon receipt; a read operation at the receiver socket will yield an entire message as it was originally sent.\n- No congestion control – UDP itself does not avoid congestion. Congestion control measures must be implemented at the application level or in the network.\n- Broadcasts – being connectionless, UDP can broadcast - sent packets can be addressed to be receivable by all devices on the subnet.\n- Multicast – a multicast mode of operation is supported whereby a single datagram packet can be automatically routed without duplication to a group of subscribers.\n- Comparison of transport layer protocols\n- Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)\n- List of TCP and UDP port numbers\n- Micro Transport Protocol (μTP)\n- Reliable Data Protocol (RDP)\n- Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP)\n- UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol\n- UDP flood attack\n- UDP Helper Address\n- UDP-Lite – a variant that delivers packets even if they are malformed\n- Kurose, J.

{"question":"What's the average annual real estate appreciation rate in the US? Looking for hard numbers!","answer":"The national real estate appreciation values average around 3.5% to 3.8% per year.","context":["What Is Liquidity?\nREtipster does not provide tax, investment, or financial advice. Always seek the help of a licensed financial professional before taking action.\nWhat Does Liquidity Mean in Business?\nLiquidity is the ease at which an asset or security can be bought or sold in the market at or near its fair market value. It also refers to the degree to which an asset or security is used in transactions.\nSimply speaking, cash or currency is the most liquid of all assets because it has an objective value and it is a medium commonly used in the exchange of goods and services. Currency has a value that is recognized by all parties that function within that same monetary system.\nAt the same time, certain types of assets do not have this same objective value (such as a house, a car, or jewelry). In order for these assets to be converted to cash and “liquidated,” they must be sold to another party who is willing to pay for the asset’s value. It can take an unpredictable amount of time to find this type of buyer and as such, these assets are not considered liquid.\nIs Real Estate Liquid?\nReal estate is considered to be illiquid (the opposite of liquid) because it does not have an objective value that every buyer will agree with. In normal market conditions, the owner will have to list the property for sale, find the right buyer, negotiate and agree on a price, carry out property inspections, and close on a sale. This entire process may take months, sometimes even years for the seller to receive their sale proceeds.\nIn real estate, it is difficult to predict when and how properties will sell. In some cases, properties may even depreciate in value, and the property owner may have to sell the property at a lower price than when it was purchased.\nDespite the disadvantage of low liquidity, real estate offers other benefits to investors that are not available with any other type of investment. The opportunity to leverage other people’s money (OPM) allows an investor to own, control, and monetize 100% of property while investing a much smaller portion of their own money.\nReal estate also offers significant tax write-offs through depreciation and other maneuvers like the 1031 exchange. Since real estate does not have an objective value, it presents an opportunity for investors to buy properties below market value and adding sweat equity to increase the property’s value, so they can resell for a significant profit in the future. These characteristics can help investors by acting as a hedge against inflation, effectively diversifying their portfolios.\nIn addition, property appreciation and cash flow from rentals are well-known strategies to earn income from real estate. In some markets, investment properties can appreciate by as much as 10%.\nFinally, real estate investment trusts (REITs) are liquid real estate investments. Most REITs are publicly traded and can be bought and sold just like stocks. The disadvantage is that the investor has no physical ownership of the property.\nBY THE NUMBERS: National appreciation values average around 3.5% to 3.8% per year.\nFactors That Determine Real Estate Liquidity\nDifferent factors influence how quickly and easily a property may sell in the market.\nSome properties are more liquid than others. For example, residential properties often sell faster because there are more buyers in the market looking for homes, whereas commercial real estate is much more expensive and there are far fewer buyers in the market for these properties at any given time. Homes (particularly single-family units) also require less due diligence and lower transaction costs. However, the property’s condition is also a big factor; freshly renovated properties are generally more liquid, for instance.\nProperties in a convenient and prime location appeal most to buyers. A rental property located in popular districts with easy access to great schools, public transportation, parks, groceries, and malls sells quickly. Safety, utility, and developer brand recall may also improve the liquidity of a property.\nThe time it takes to close a deal and the overall costs of the transaction also affect the liquidity of the property. This includes the time to finalize the paperwork and all legal obligations and the total costs of the taxes, broker’s fees, registration fees, and other maintenance costs. The smoother and the fewer overhead costs there are, the more liquid the property is.\nFinally, the market dictates the general liquidity of real estate. Like any other investment, there are good and bad times to sell depending on how “hot” the market is. The hotter the market, the more liquid real estate is; the colder the market, the more illiquid. Real estate investors often call a hot market a seller’s market and a cold market a buyer’s market.\nThis table explains the correlation between liquidity and other factors in the market:\n|Hot (Seller’s Market)||Cold (Buyer’s Market)|\n|Price||Higher than listing||Lower than listing|\nIs There Liquidity Risk in Real Estate?\nCertain types of real estate may also suffer from liquidity risk, which describes properties that are more difficult or take longer to sell.\nVarious factors contribute to the liquidity risk of a specific property, such as high carrying costs, undesirable locations, or the general state of the market. If the investor needs to raise the money immediately, they will be forced to sell the property for less than its fair value.\nHowever, there are ways to capitalize on liquidity risk. Investing in a property with a long time horizon may bypass volatility and changes in the market. Doing so may allow the property to be sold later when the investor feels it can sell; for example when the neighborhood is gentrified, or development has begun to ease access to the property.\nInvestors, however, must consider that market conditions will not always be favorable. In some cases, there will be no “favorable” times at all. When the opportunity presents itself, they should take the chance and sell the high-risk property instead of missing the only window they could sell it.\n- Liquidity is the speed and efficiency at which an asset or security can be traded at or near its market value.\n- Cash is the most liquid because it has an objective value and it is the most commonly used medium of exchange.\n- Real estate is highly illiquid. However, real estate has a low or negative correlation with other asset classes, making it a good hedge against inflation due to its appreciation and cash flow potential.\n- Factors that determine the liquidity of a property include location, condition of the property, transaction costs, and the state of the local market. Some properties have inherently high liquidity risk, however.\n- Nicolas, S. (2021.) What Investments Are Considered Liquid Assets? Investopedia.

{"question":"What are the renal side effects of risperidone and tenofovir, and how should they be monitored?","answer":"For risperidone, patients should inform their doctor if they have kidney disease before starting treatment. For tenofovir, particularly tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, it can cause significant renal toxicity including Fanconi syndrome with type 2 renal tubular acidosis and phosphate wasting. It's not recommended for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/minute. Monitoring should include regular checks of eGFR, urinalysis for glucose and protein, and protein:creatinine ratio. Additionally, patients taking tenofovir-based regimens should avoid nephrotoxic drugs like NSAIDs due to the risk of acute renal failure.","context":["Risperidone is a antipsychotic medicine. It works by changing the effects of chemicals in the brain.\nWhat is it?\nRisperidone belongs to a group of medicines called antipsychotics. These medicines work on the balance of chemical substances in the brain.\nYou may have been prescribed risperidone to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia or a similar mental health problem affecting your thoughts, feelings or behaviours. These problems are called psychoses. It is also given to treat aggressive behaviour problems in some people where these could become a danger to self or to others.\nBefore taking this medicine\nYou should not use risperidone if you are allergic to it. Risperidone is not approved for use in psychotic conditions related to dementia. Risperidone may increase the risk of death in older adults with dementia-related conditions.\nTo make sure this medicine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:\n- heart disease, high blood pressure, heart rhythm problems;\n- coronary artery disease or recent heart attack;\n- diabetes (or risk factors such as obesity or family history of diabetes);\n- a history of low white blood cell (WBC) counts;\n- liver or kidney disease;\n- a history of seizures;\n- a history of breast cancer;\n- low bone mineral density;\n- trouble swallowing;\n- Parkinson's disease;\n- if you are dehydrated; or\n- if you also take blood pressure medicine.\nSome people with mental illness have thoughts about suicide. Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits while you are using risperidone. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.\nThe risperidone orally disintegrating tablet may contain phenylalanine. Talk to your doctor before using orally disintegrating tablets if you have phenylketonuria (PKU).\nIt is not known whether risperidone will harm an unborn baby.

Tell each of your health care providers about all medicines you use now and any medicine you start or stop using.","Prescribing for patients taking antiretroviral therapy\n- Yasmin Hughes, Louise Tomlins, Tim Usherwood\n- Aust Prescr 2022;45:80-7\n- 1 June 2022\n- DOI: 10.18773/austprescr.2022.026\nCurrent first-line antiretroviral therapy comprises a combination of drugs that are generally well tolerated. Adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions, renal and liver toxicity, rhabdomyolysis, hyperlipidaemia, weight gain and neuropsychiatric disorders.\nMost drug–drug interactions related to antiretroviral therapy involve drug absorption, metabolism or elimination. Some interactions may increase toxicity or reduce the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy potentially resulting in treatment failure.\nRoutinely checking for adverse drug effects and potential drug–drug interactions is an important part of the care of people taking antiretroviral therapy. This includes asking about the patient’s use of over-the-counter and complementary medicines.\nAntiretroviral therapy is recommended for everyone living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) starting from the time of diagnosis. The aim is to suppress the viral load and maintain immune function. A suppressed viral load also prevents HIV transmission.\nIn Australia, antiretroviral therapy is prescribed by accredited S100 prescribers. GPs may see patients taking antiretroviral therapy and should be aware of the implications for prescribing. These include encouraging adherence to therapy and being alert for adverse effects and drug interactions.\nThe six main classes of antiretroviral drugs (Table) target various steps in the HIV replication cycle (Fig.) If drugs are used individually, resistance rapidly develops, so antiretroviral therapy is given as a combination of drugs. Most commonly the combination includes a ‘backbone’ of two nucleoside/ nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus an integrase strand inhibitor (the preferred initial third drug for most people with HIV), a protease inhibitor, or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Entry inhibitors and fusion inhibitors are reserved for when standard treatments have failed.\nTable - Classes of antiretroviral therapy\n|Maraviroc||• Not routinely used.|\n|(CCR5 antagonist)||• Only indicated for CCR5-tropic strains of HIV.|\n|Enfuviritide||• Not routinely used.|\n|• Twice daily subcutaneous injections, high rate of injection-site reactions.|\n|Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors|\n|Abacavir||• Hypersensitivity reaction, check for HLA-B*5701 allele before prescribing.|\n|• Potential increased cardiovascular risk, avoid if cardiovascular risk factors.|\n|Lamivudine Emtricitabine||• Also used to treat hepatitis B in combination with tenofovir to avoid the development of hepatitis B virus resistance.|\n|• Generally well tolerated.|\n|Tenofovir alafenamide||• Can cause renal toxicity – avoid if eGFR <30 mL/min.|\n|• Potential weight gain and raised lipids.|\n|• Drug interactions with rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin and phenobarbital (may reduce exposure to tenofovir).|\n|• Used with another drug to treat hepatitis B co-infection.|\n|Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate||• Reduced renal function – avoid if eGFR <60 mL/min.

This interaction is seen with statins, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, direct-acting oral anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and some antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone and flecainide). Cushing’s syndrome has been reported in patients taking cobicistat or ritonavir with fluticasone, budesonide or mometasone, which are predominantly metabolised by CYP3A enzymes (inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical, and intraocular corticosteroids). Beclomethasone is not metabolised by CYP3A4 and so is suitable to use.\neGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate\nNSAIDs non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nCYP cytochrome P450\nHIV primarily infects host immune cells, mainly CD4 T-cell lymphocytes. After successful binding and fusion with the CD4 cell (1,2), the virion’s single- stranded RNA is transported to the cell’s interior. Here it is reverse transcribed (3) by the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme into double-stranded DNA. This is integrated into the host DNA by viral integrase (4), and then transcribed into RNA (5), which is then translated into viral polyproteins (6) which are cleaved by viral protease. The viral proteins (reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease) are combined with viral genomic RNA and assembled into viral packages (7) which bud from the host cell (8), forming new virions which are released (9) and which then infect other host CD4 cells.\nCreated with BioRender.com\nAdapted from ‘HIV Replication Cycle’, by BioRender.com (2021). Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates/t-5f32d8b236677100ac51c32e-hiv-replication-cycle\nThe current regimens are generally well tolerated. This is important because adherence to treatment is essential. Some patients may have an increased risk of adverse effects because of comorbidities such as reduced renal function.\nNucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors are the backbone of today’s antiretroviral therapy. They inhibit the reverse transcription of viral RNA to double-stranded DNA (Fig.). The usual combinations are abacavir/lamivudine, tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. Emtricitabine and lamivudine have had fewer reported adverse effects than other nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.1-3\nTwo-drug regimens (e.g. dolutegravir/lamivudine or rilpivirine/dolutegravir) are increasingly being used when certain criteria are met. The first long-acting injectable antiretroviral therapy (cabotegravir/rilpivirine) is now available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\nAntiretroviral drugs are also used to prevent HIV infection. A regimen for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. For post-exposure prophylaxis tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine can be used with the addition of dolutegravir, raltegravir or rilpivirine for higher risk exposures.\nSome antiretroviral drug combinations include ritonavir or cobicistat to inhibit the cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes that metabolise protease inhibitors and elvitegravir. This inhibition boosts the plasma concentrations of these antiretroviral drugs, allowing lower doses to be used. As many drugs are metabolised by the CYP system, the pharmacokinetic boosters are particularly prone to cause drug–drug interactions. Before prescribing a new drug for a patient taking antiretroviral therapy, drug interactions should be checked via the University of Liverpool’s HIV Drug Interactions website. If there is any doubt, it is best to contact the prescribing doctor or a specialist in HIV medicine as certain drug interactions may lead to a failure of antiretroviral therapy.\nAbacavir can cause a potentially lethal, multisystem hypersensitivity reaction within six weeks of starting treatment.4 Patients who have the HLA-B*5701 genotype are especially susceptible, so genotypic screening is needed before prescribing abacavir.\nAbacavir has been associated with an increased risk of ischaemic cardiovascular events in some cohort studies.5-8 However, other studies and meta-analyses concluded that abacavir does not confer a higher risk of cardiovascular events compared to regimens without abacavir.9 While the data remain conflicting and no plausible biological mechanism explains the increased risk, most experts and international guidelines recommend avoiding abacavir in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.10-12\nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. It has been associated with renal toxicity, including Fanconi syndrome manifesting as type 2 renal tubular acidosis and phosphate wasting.13-15 The drug is not recommended for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 mL/minute. Monitoring of renal function is essential and includes the eGFR, urinalysis for glucose and protein, and the protein:creatinine ratio. Renal monitoring (six-monthly eGFR) is also recommended in PrEP users, although the risk of toxicity in this group is much lower than in people living with HIV.16-18 Reduced bone mineral density has been reported so tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided in patients with osteoporosis.19-20\nRenal and bone effects occur to a lesser extent with tenofovir alafenamide as serum drug concentrations are lower, however this formulation should be avoided in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/minute. Tenofovir alafenamide has previously been reported to cause greater weight gain, especially when combined with dolutegravir, compared to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Whether this is an effect of weight gain with tenofovir alafenamide, weight loss with tenofovir disoproxil, or simply represents better gastrointestinal tolerability and improved health is uncertain.21-22\nTenofovir disoproxil fumarate and tenofovir alafenamide are first-line drugs for hepatitis B management. In patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis B, dual therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir alafenamide in combination with either lamivudine or emtricitabine is used to avoid the development of hepatitis B virus drug resistance. These patients also require a third drug with activity against HIV, for example bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine. Patients with hepatitis B should be advised on the importance of adherence as stopping their hepatitis B antiviral therapy can result in a flare of hepatitis.\nIntegrase strand inhibitors are highly effective with few adverse effects and are recommended for most patients in combination with nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Possible adverse effects include headache, nausea and diarrhoea. Several studies have concluded that integrase strand inhibitors, particularly dolutegravir, lead to greater weight gain than other classes of antiretroviral therapy, but the mechanism and clinical significance are unclear.23-26\nBictegravir, dolutegravir and raltegravir can increase serum creatine kinase and there are case reports of rhabdomyolysis with raltegravir.27-29 Serum creatine kinase should be checked in those presenting with myalgia and specialist advice sought as the patient may require switching to a different regimen.\nBictegravir, dolutegravir and certain other drugs (e.g. rilpivirine, cobicistat) inhibit creatinine excretion in the proximal renal tubule. This causes a physiological, but clinically unimportant 10–20% increase in serum creatinine within the first eight weeks of treatment. Aside from measuring serum creatinine to establish a new baseline when starting therapy, no further action is required.\nIntegrase inhibitors have rarely been associated with central nervous system effects, such as insomnia and headache. A meta-analysis reported no significant effect of dolutegravir on the risk of suicide-related adverse events.30\nThe most prescribed drug in this class is rilpivirine which is generally well tolerated, however it needs to be taken with a meal to facilitate its absorption. An important adverse effect is prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG which also has implications for drug–drug interactions. Rilpivirine may also exacerbate existing psychiatric conditions, but has fewer neuropsychiatric adverse effects than efavirenz.\nEfavirenz, although rarely used nowadays, can cause dizziness and vivid dreams. Taking it at bedtime on an empty stomach reduces insomnia and dizziness. It can also cause or worsen depression and increase the risk of suicidal ideation.31\nGastrointestinal adverse effects may occur with any antiretroviral therapy, but are most common with protease inhibitors, especially when in combination with a booster drug (cobicistat or ritonavir). Troublesome diarrhoea may be managed with loperamide after exclusion of other causes.\nHyperlipidaemia is a common adverse effect of protease inhibitors, especially ritonavir-boosted regimens. This may require drug treatment in addition to optimising diet and exercise.32 Simvastatin is contraindicated with boosted regimens as there is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and pravastatin should be started at low doses with careful dose titration to the lowest effective dose with measurement of creatine kinase if indicated. The maximum dose of these statins is reduced when they are taken with boosted regimens.\nIt is crucial to regularly review treatments, including over-the-counter or complementary medicines, in patients taking antiretroviral therapy and to check for potential interactions using the University of Liverpool HIV Drug Interactions website. Drug interactions may not be specific within antiviral classes and may not be easily recognised. If there is any doubt, seek specialist advice as drug interactions can result in antiretroviral therapy failing to suppress viral replication or can lead to serious and potentially fatal toxicity.\nThere are specific drug interactions that need to be highlighted to minimise the risk of toxicity or failure of antiretroviral treatment.\nThe concentrations of renally eliminated drugs such as aciclovir, valaciclovir, aminoglycosides and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be increased when taken with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Acute renal failure after starting high-dose NSAIDs has occurred in patients taking tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.33 Patients taking tenofovir-based regimens, including PrEP, should be advised not to take NSAIDs and to check with a pharmacist before using over-the-counter medicines.\nThe organic cation transporter 2 is involved in the renal excretion of drugs including metformin. Dolutegravir inhibits this transporter so co-administration doubles the concentration of metformin.34 The US prescribing information advises that the daily dose of metformin should not exceed 1 g when starting metformin or dolutegravir.\nThe absorption of integrase strand inhibitors is impaired by co-administration of antacids and mineral supplements containing polyvalent cations such as aluminium, magnesium, calcium and iron. These bind and chelate integrase strand inhibitors, impairing their ability to bind to the active site of the HIV integrase enzyme.35,36 To avoid this interaction, antacids and supplements containing polyvalent cations should be taken separately from the integrase strand inhibitor. For example, dolutegravir should be taken two hours before or six hours after products containing polyvalent cations.37\nThe absorption of rilpivirine and atazanavir requires an acidic pH so drugs such as proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists reduce absorption.38 Proton pump inhibitors are contraindicated with rilpivirine as they can cause a failure of therapy. If a patient is taking a proton pump inhibitor with rilpivirine, seek immediate specialist advice. H2-receptor antagonists should only be taken 12 hours before or at least four hours after rilpivirine.\nRitonavir and cobicistat are potent CYP3A inhibitors so they increase the concentration of drugs metabolised through the same pathway including some steroids. Iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression can occur in patients taking ritonavir or cobicistat with steroids such as fluticasone, budesonide or mometasone.39 This interaction has been observed with inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical, and intraocular corticosteroids.40-42 Seek expert advice if this drug interaction is suspected. As beclomethasone is not metabolised by CYP3A4, it is suitable to use with ritonavir or cobicistat-boosted regimens.\nThe concentrations of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil are increased by boosters (ritonavir and cobicistat), increasing the risk of adverse effects such as priapism and hypotension. A reduced dose (e.g. sildenafil 25 mg) and no repeat dosing within 48 hours is advised.\nHIV primarily affects CD4 T-cell numbers and function but also impacts other parts of the immune system, increasing the risk of some infections, many of which are vaccine-preventable. However, patients older than five years with CD4 T-cell counts below 200/microlitre should not be given live attenuated vaccines, such as measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.43 In addition, responses to certain vaccinations, for example hepatitis B vaccine, may be reduced and so increased doses are recommended. The Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine provides excellent guidance on vaccination.\nVaccination against COVID-19 is advised for people living with HIV. No safety or efficacy data have emerged to cause concern that they are at any greater risk of adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccination.44 There are no interactions between COVID-19 vaccines and antiretroviral drugs.45 The Australian Technical Advisory Group recommends that a third primary dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be offered to those with advanced HIV (CD4 counts <250/microlitre) or those with a higher CD4 count unable to be established on effective antiretroviral therapy.46\nMost current first-line antiretroviral drugs are well tolerated by patients. However, there are important drug interactions and adverse effects that prescribers should be aware of. The safest approach is to check for drug interactions each time using the University of Liverpool HIV Drug Interactions website.\nPeople living with HIV have an increased risk of poorer outcomes from some vaccine-preventable conditions. Immunisation is recommended when possible.\nConflicts of interest: Louise Tomlins has received speaker fees for Gilead Sciences.

The marsh has two regions, the Great Sippewisset Marsh to the north and Little Sippewisset Marsh to the south, separated from each other by a narrow tongue of land (Saconesset Hills). The marsh extends into an estuary in which the intertidal zone provides a dynamic environment that supports a diverse ecology, including threatened and endangered species such as the roseate tern (Sterna dougallii). The ecology of the salt marsh is based in and supported by the microbial mats which cover the ground of the marsh.\nThe Sippewissett Salt Marsh houses a diverse, laminated intertidal microbial mat around 1 cm thick. The mat is characterized by regular influx of sea water, high amounts of sulfide and iron, and the production of methane. The mat contains four or five distinctly colored layers. The color of each layer can be attributed to the microbial community composition and the biogeochemical processes they perform at each of the layers. The mats are often coated by green macro- and microalgae that adhere to the surface. The top, green-brown layer is composed of cyanobacteria and diatom species. A blue-green intermediate layer is formed by Oscillatoria species. Purple sulfur bacteria are found in the pink central layer. Below the pink layer, an orange-black layer is formed predominately by a single species of purple sulfur bacteria, Thiocapsa pfennigii, and spirochetes. The thin, bottom layer is made up of green sulfur bacteria belonging to the Prosthecochloris genus, though this layer is not always present. Below the mat is iron sulfide-rich sediments and remnants of decaying mats.\nThe top 1 mm of the green layer is often gold due to the dominant cyanobacteria and diatom species. Specific cyanobacteria identified are Lyngbya, a sheeted cyanobacterium, and Nostoc and Phormidium, which are filamentous cyanobacteria, and Spirulina spp. Diatom species identified include Navicula. Below this top gold layer extends 5 mm and is dominated by Lyngbya and Oscillatoria species The green layer is also composed of green sulfur bacteria which oxidize sulfur during their growth and are strict photolithotrophs.\nThe pink layer extends 3 mm below the green layer. The color is due to the presence of carotinoids which are the primary pigments of the phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria. Amoebobacter, Thiocapsa, Chromatium, and Thiocystis are among the species of purple sulfur bacteria identified. Purple sulfur bacteria can use a number of different electron donors for their anaerobic phototrophic growth, including: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, and molecular hydrogen. Their diverse use of many electron donors makes this layer stand out in the microbial mat community.\nThe bottom layer makes up the lower 2 mm of the mat before the depth drops below the chemocline. The black color is due to the high amounts of iron sulfide generated by the green sulfur-reducing bacteria. The layer consists mostly of green sulfur bacteria belonging to the Prosthecochloris genus, which are a small group of prosthecate bacteria containing many knobby projections. Organisms in this layer decompose organic matter formed by the upper layers, thus recycling the matter.\nThe thin, bottommost layer lies below the chemocline and contains fewer organisms than the slightly thicker black layer. The gray color is due to the presence of pyrite. Here, the empty shells of diatoms can be found. Microbial species here are dominated by methylotrophic methanogens which generate the methane observed in the salt marsh. This layer is not active year round; the organisms are largely dormant in the winter.\nThe metabolism of the organisms throughout each layer of the microbial mats are tightly coupled to each other and play important roles in providing nutrients for the plants and animals that live in the marsh. The cyanobacteria and diatom algae present in the mat are aerobic photoautotrophs whose energy is derived from the light with oxygen as the electron acceptor and use hydrogen gas and iron as electron donors.\nThe Sippewissett Salt Marsh has served as a hallmark for studies done on estuarine environments. Scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Boston University Marine Program, and the Marine Biological Laboratory have been studying Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh extensively since 1970 to gain a better understanding of microbial diversity and the effects they have on geochemical cycling and nutrient cycling for other organisms. The Sippewissett salt marsh is of particular importance for research, as it is one of the few generally undisturbed salt marshes in New England.\n- United States Fish and Wildlife Service. \"Northeast Coastal Areas Study Significant Coastal Habitats (Sippewisset Marshes)\".

Semi-variable costs start with a fixed rate that changes to variable pricing based on usage or specific conditions, like conference call services charging fixed rates initially then switching to tier pricing based on volume. Cost-plus contracts, on the other hand, have the project owner cover all expenses (labor and materials) plus a predetermined fee for contractor profits and overheads. The main difference is that semi-variable costs can fluctuate based on usage patterns, while cost-plus contracts ensure all costs are covered plus a guaranteed fee, though they often include maximum cost limits.","context":["Learn something new every day\nMore Info... by email\nAlso known as a semi-fixed cost or a mixed cost, a semi-variable cost is a type of charge that progresses from a variable cost to a fixed cost or vice versa over time. One of the more common models for this type of pricing matrix is for the client to be charged a fixed rate at the onset of a contract and continue to enjoy that fixed rate for a specified period of time. When certain events spelled out in the contract come to pass, the cost switches to a variable approach that is calculated using the provisions found within that contract. A similar application of a semi-variable cost involves providing a client with a set of basic services that is covered by a monthly fixed payment, while offering other ancillary services that the client may choose to use for additional costs above and beyond that basic fixed rate.\nOne of the easiest ways to understand how a semi-variable cost functions in a contract situation is to consider a company that has agreed to two-year contract with a conference call firm. The terms of the contract may call for extending a specified rate for basic conference call services for the first six months of that contract, in anticipation of the client gradually increasing the amount of business volume generated. At the end of the six months, the provider may determine that business volume has grown to the point of implementing tier pricing, which basically allows the client to enjoy a lower rate during billing periods in which the total usage exceeds a certain amount. If the customer’s usage fluctuates from one billing period to the next, the actual cost per minute per line of conference call usage will also fluctuate, rather than being billed out at the same rate each month.\nThere are both benefits and potential drawbacks to the use of a semi-variable cost. When the arrangement allows customers to pay less for goods and services rendered over time, it can have the benefit of keeping operational costs lower for those customers. Providers may also benefit from this arrangement, in that customers who know they can obtain a lower variable cost by purchasing more may do so, allowing the provider to sell more units of product. One down side to this arrangement is that some customers will not need additional products and will not be interested in tracking the changes in costs from one period to the next, which in turn may prompt them to look for providers who offer flat rate pricing instead. At the same time, if those clients are not motivated to buy more units, the benefits of the semi-variable cost model may be lessened for the providers, possibly to the point of doing the business more harm than good.\nOne of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted.

The expenses are labor and materials, including margin profits and overheads. The contractors labor charges are agreed upon before the project kicks off. The contract is common among construction companies. Another term for a cost-plus contract is a cost-reimbursement contract.\nHow Does a Cost-Plus Contract Work?\nGenerally, in a cost-plus contract, a construction company usually obtains all the materials and services it requires throughout the stages of construction, and the contractor forwards the costs to the owner of the project. The part of plus is basically the fixed fee that parties discuss and agrees on in advance, to cover margins for overhead and profits. So, this type of contract is a representation of a win-win deal on the part of the contractor because the owner of the project covers all the costs and risks. However, it is also important to note that most cost-plus contracts contain a maximum cost that contractors should not surpass. They are in the form of open books, where the owner of the project is free to see how the expenses look like. This type of contract differs from a fixed-price contract. With a fixed-price contract, the owner of the project pays the contractor the agreed amount only. It does not consider any other extra incurred expenses. The main function of a cost-plus contract is to ensure that contractors do not experience cost overruns, especially in situations where defining costs ahead of time is difficult. A good example is a cost for development activities and research.\nWhy use Cost-Plus Contracts?\nThe United States government usually use cost-plus contracts when they want to contract the military defense contractors to work on new technologies for United States defense. They prefer this type of contract because it enables them to choose contractors with the best qualifications rather than ending up with contractors with the lowest bids but with poor qualifications. The award-fee cost-plus contract is also preferred because it ensures project quality. It holds contractors accountable for the quality of work they produce. On the other hand, a cost-plus contract, such as incentive-fee contract, provides contractors with larger profits, especially those who exceed given performance targets. Generally, although cost-plus contracts are developed to prevent things such as overruns, there has been criticism that some types of cost-plus contracts such as cost-plus fixed fees contracts do not prevent overruns.\nTypes of Cost-Plus Contract\nThere are four types of cost-plus contracts, and all of them pay every allocable, allowable, and reasonable cost that contractors incur. Also paid is any other profits or fee, although this one varies depending on the type of contract. The four types of cost-plus contracts include the following:\n- Cost-plus fixed-fee: Here, the contractor is only paid a predetermined fee as per the parties' as initially stipulated in the contract.\n- Cost-plus incentive fee: This includes a larger fee awarded mostly to contractors who exceed performance targets, including project savings.\n- Cost-plus award fee: Here, the work performance determines the fees the contractor gets. For some contracts, payment objective performance determines the contractor's fees.\n- Cost-plus percentage of cost: This is a fee that comes up when the cost of the contractor goes up. Note that this type of contract does not provide the contractor with an incentive to control the project costs. So, in most cases, contractors incur extra expenses that force them to increase their charges.\nWhen to Use Cost-Plus Contract\nA cost-plus contract can be of use when there is a need for flexibility to make some changes in the course of project implementation. So, for those individuals or companies that operate on a tight budget, a lump-sum price can be a better option for them. The reason is that you cannot avoid the ultimate cost of a project with cost-plus pricing. Also, cost-plus contracts can be useful in situations where parties find it difficult to assess the projects overall cost but operating on a flexible budget. In this case, it is wise to use a cost-plus contract as long as there is mutual trust between the owners of the project and the contractor. Also, this type of contract can work well if the parties come up with a meticulous record-keeping, including a well-defined and executed contract. A good example where a cost-plus contract may be useful is when there is a project that needs implementation, but enough details are not there to help do detailed work cost estimates.\nAdvantages of Using a Cost-Plus Contract\nA cost-plus contract has the following benefits:\n- It is budget-friendly, especially for contractors. For instance, they can easily decide which materials to use without worrying about their costs. The reason is that there is no time when the costs incurred on the project will be charged on the contractors paycheck. With a cost-plus contract, the owners of the project cover all project costs, including any other additional costs that may come up.\n- Since putting together estimates for some projects may prove to be difficult, a cost-plus contract can help in reimbursing costs as project implementation progresses. Contractors are not worried about flawed estimate ruining project implementation as cost-plus contracts always accommodate extra costs they may incur to complete the project.\n- With a cost-plus contract, it is easy to cap or limit the number of money contractors spend on a project. This can help the owner of the project or property to work with a tight budget.\nDisadvantages of Using a Cost-plus Contract\nThere are various disadvantages that arise when an individual or property owner fails to cap the cost-plus contract. Some of these disadvantages are as follows:\n- A contractor always has to justify the project's expenses. For this reason, the contractor must work hard to keep track and expenses. So, those contractors who are disorganized are likely to encounter a lot of problems.\n- There is a problem when it comes to indirect cost accountability. Contractors incur costs related to administrative and rent. To be sincere, these are not expenses contractors will be okay with. So, contractors need to be keen and ensure that they also cater for indirect costs.\n- Since the cost-plus contract operates through reimbursement, it means that contractors have to use their money to pay for whatever expenses they incur. So, since those in the construction industry have a cash flow problem most of the time, cost-plus contracts can cause hitches in project implementation if they don't take appropriate measures.\n- Profits for those using this kind of contract are pre-determined. Contractors enter a contract aware of how much profit they will get. The contract has all the details, including the contractor's fees. So, it is impossible for contractors to make extra profits by cutting expenses as the money will already be reflected and reimbursable. Cutting costs will instead bring down their profits.\n- Cost-plus contracts are likely to create room for conflict of interest when it comes to contractors leading to inflated prices for the property owners. Note that the cost-plus works in a way that when the project has many costs, it creates additional expenses.\nIt is because the contractor will definitely increase his charges, which the owner of the project must pay. So, unless the cap is put on spending as an incentive, project owners should be ready to spend more on their projects.\nHow to Protect your Business\nGenerally, a cost-plus contract enables contractors to recover costs related to the project they are handling. However, if there is no good record keeping to help them keep track of those costs, there is a likelihood that they wont be able to recover them. The following tips can help contractors to avoid such problem:\n- Contractors should learn how to negotiate critical items that are likely to cause disputes\n- Contractors should ensure that they control the use of material during project implementation. In most cases, a cost-plus contract leads to material misuse, an act that may force a contractor to acquire unexpected additional material.\n- Contractors should avoid exploiting the project owner. They need to be honest in their dealings but also ensure that they do not experience cost exploitation\n- Finally, contractors should learn how to control both soft and hard costs\n- Bundle of Rights\n- Absorption Rate\n- Fair Housing Act\n- Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\n- Housing and Urban Development (HUD)\n- Design Build Contract\n- Building Permits\n- Construction Surety Bond\n- Acquisition, Development, and Construction Loan (ADC)\n- Flipping (Real Property)\n- Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan\n- Building Residual Method\n- Accessory Dwelling Unit\n- Property Management\n- Real Estate Investment Fund"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:904c1033-29d9-4f09-b460-8712aff5aae2>","<urn:uuid:4eccc234-3e7b-447c-9b73-8e4d8278854f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do consumer product recalls compare to food recalls in terms of their reporting and oversight mechanisms?","answer":"Consumer product recalls and food recalls have different oversight mechanisms. Consumer product recalls are primarily overseen by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), while food recalls are managed by both the FDA and USDA. For consumer products, individuals must report product-related injuries to the proper safety agency. For food recalls, there are multiple reporting channels - consumers can contact their local health department, report to the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, or follow the CDC's reporting instructions. Food recalls are typically voluntary and initiated by manufacturers, though the FDA can shut down food production facilities if there's a significant public health threat. Both systems aim to protect public safety, with recalls being classified based on the level of hazard posed to consumers.","context":["A government safety agency estimates that deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the nation more than $1 trillion annually. The majority of the serious product recalls in the U.S. each year involve children’s toys, cribs, sleepers, heaters, strollers, food, auto and pharmaceutical industry products.\nOnce a product is released and is in widespread use, unforeseen safety issues can lead to a recall. Sometimes companies discover a problem and recall products on their own. Other times, a company is forced to recall a product after consumers, safety agencies and lawyers raise concerns.\nBecause so many products are put to market every day, several large U.S government safety agencies work to regulate safe commerce. These include:\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also work alongside these agencies, and alert the public when they discover a potential consumer and public health hazard.\nA product recall is a warning to consumers after the discovery of safety issues or product defects that could endanger consumers or patients, or place manufacturers and distributors at risk of legal action.\nUnfortunately, some products on the American market pose dangers for months or even years before a recall is issued, often only when a company is forced to recall a product or when legal pressure mounts from a Product Recall Lawyer. Common consumer product recalls often include the following:\nJoe Lyon is a highly-rated Cincinnati Product Liability Attorney representing plaintiffs nationwide in a wide variety of catastrophic injury and civil litigation claims.\nA product recall issued by a company or safety agency is a recommendation to return a product to the manufacturer due to a faulty product or a consumer safety issue. The U.S. Consumer Protection Agency works to protect the public from defective products that have the potential to cause injury by burns and fires, electrocution, toxic exposure, and inherent design defects.\nMany products produced abroad and imported into the U.S. must meet safety guidelines regardless of where they are manufactured. Manufacturers or retailers may be held responsible for any injuries sustained by consumers, and can be accountable by product liability laws.\nIt is important to note that not all product recalls are handled by the U.S. Consumer Protection Agency. The FAA oversees aerospace safety, the FDA handled drugs and medical devices, and the NHTSA handles automotive products. A few other government agencies handle the remainder, including contaminated foods.\nSerious injury caused by consumer products can prompt safety agencies to either issue a warning to recall a consumer product. It is crucial for individuals, manufacturers, and retail distributors to report serious injuries that occur from use of a defective product. Be sure to always report a product-related injury to the proper safety agency.\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) aims to protect the public from risks of injury or death associated with the use of the thousands of types of consumer products. They work to ensure the safety of products like commonly pose dangers, such as home gym equipment, children’s toys, clothing, cribs, power tools, and household chemicals.\nConsumers and families face potential injury from products that pose fire, electrical, chemical, and mechanical hazards. The most common hazards that prompt product recalls include the following:\nFood safety is a huge issue through the nation each year. According to the CDC, one in six Americans get sick from contaminated food each year. More than 3,000 annual deaths are attributed to food-related illnesses, most of which are preventable.\nThe CDC works with the Food and Drug Administration to identify health risks in consumables, but the outbreaks are sometimes overwhelming and spread too quickly to prevent public health risks.\nWhen an FDA-regulated product like a drug or medical device is either defective or potentially harmful, the FDA is responsible for issuing product recalls, which is the most effective means for protecting the public.\nThe FDA is usually alerted of an issue when a company discovers a problem, the agency inspects a manufacturing facility and determines the potential for a recall, or the FDA receives reports of health problems through various reporting systems.\nIn many cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contacts the FDA, often after the drugs and devices have already injured or possibly caused the death of unknowing consumers. FDA guidelines categorize all recalls into one of three classes, according to the varying seriousness of the hazard:\n• Drugs for human use\n• Drugs for animal use\n• Medical devices\n• Radiation-emitting products\n• Blood and blood-related products\n• Transplantable human tissue\n• Animal feed\n• Contaminated foods\nDefective drugs and unregulated nutritional supplements fill the U.S. market each year, endangering consumers and American patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiates weekly recalls for defective drugs, often after injuries have occurred and lawsuits are filed against negligent drug makers and pharmaceutical companies.\nThe FDA recalls defective drugs for a myriad of safety issues, including a lack of pre-market testing, drug contamination, and drug injuries reported by patients. Sometimes only after hundreds or thousands of adverse event reports are filed by doctors and patients are drugs taken off the market, discontinued or voluntarily recalled by manufacturers.\nWarning labels and “black box” warnings may be applied, and consumers are left wondering if the drug they have been taking for years may be dangerous or the root cause of an existing injury or illness.\nPharmaceutical companies tend to understate the risks of a drug and hype the benefits of a drug, in order to sell more and build profits. Even as the FDA works to regulate the giant drug market, their efforts often lag and injury cases must be filed by plaintiffs and an Ohio defective drug lawyer and product liability attorney.\nIn the auto industry, the number of product recalls has increased recently. Low priced production often leads to a hit in quality throughout the supply chain. As a result, technical failures are more likely to occur now than in the past.\nIn a recent, massive consumer product crisis, nearly 70 million Takata air bag inflators are under recall in the U.S. The defective Takata air bag inflators show a high risk of ruptures during air bag deployment.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says the risk posed by the airbag inflators in recalled vehicles is grave, and it is critical they be repaired now to avoid more deaths and serious injuries. Eight confirmed U.S. fatalities have been found due to Takata ruptures.\nThe oversight of the CPSC, FDA and NHTSA has contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years, however, each year many new dangerous products still hit the market and face recalls.\nBecause of the risks posed, and the negligence of manufacturers, there are thousands of pending lawsuits against makers of unsafe consumer products. Victims of hazardous products, such as contaminated food, faulty drugs and medical devices, and defective auto parts may have claims against a company and receive compensation. Contact an experienced attorney to find out what legal options may be available.\nProduct liability law holds manufacturers responsible for a large portion of liability regarding injuries directly related to defective or faulty consumer products.\nAmerica’s manufacturers have a moral and legal duty to ensure the safety of all products they market and distribute. More importantly, they have a responsibility to properly warn consumers of any defect their product may contain and issue prompt safety recalls.\nIn the event of an injury or death, compensation can be sought to cover medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost wages, as well as punitive damages against a manufacturer for negligence and a disregard for the safety of consumers.\nFor a complete investigation and to build the strongest case possible, contact an attorney with considerable experience in product liability law and product recalls.\nMany product recall lawsuits have had a positive impact on consumer health and safety, and we have witnessed improved lives and prevented future injuries as companies are forced to recall products and change designs and warnings as a result of litigation.\nFollowing an injury caused by a recalled consumer product, a claim may be filed. Product liability lawsuits typically contain a cause of action for strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty.\nSafety agencies and companies themselves are responsible for recalling products when they pose safety and health risks. Common recalled consumer products include food, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, ATVs, automobiles, toys, home appliances and power tools.\nA product may be considered by law “defective” if it is unreasonably dangerous for its intended use. If a consumer is injured in part because of a product defect, legal action can be taken. Plaintiffs may sue a manufacturer, distributor, or retailer if they were aware of risk and failed to warn the public.\nThe manufacturer is likely liable for a product that fails or has an improper warning attached to it. Distributors and others in the supply chain may be liable as well.\nNot always, but if a product is recalled and a consumer suffers an injury due to the product defect, a lawsuit can be filed to recover compensation for the injury.\nDefective products that are sold to consumers present safety hazards for adults and children. Cheap and defective products may pose fire and burn risks; electrocution, strangulation and choking risks; and severe health risks. The manufacturers of inferior consumer products have a duty to foresee potential injury and properly design and test products before they are released to the public.\nCompanies must properly warn consumers of any risks associated with their products. Any failure to protect consumers or recall a product that results in an accident or injury can lead to lawsuits filed by plaintiffs and a product recall lawyer.","According to federal data, one in six Americans (or 48 million people) is sickened and 3,000 die from foodborne diseases each year. The unfortunate fact is these figures are likely to be far higher, as most food illnesses go unreported. The five pathogens causing the majority of foodborne illnesses that lead to hospitalizations are salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter, toxoplasma gondii, and E. coli 0157.\nWhere is this happening? You don’t have to look far. Month after month brings more news of food contamination or a foodborne illness outbreak. What’s going on? Our industrialized food system has major holes in its oversight and health and safety processes, and is the root cause of many of these outbreaks.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for the regulation and safety standards of approximately 80 percent of the food supply in the U.S., as well as the safety of pet foods. The remaining 20 percent, primarily meat, poultry and some egg products, is regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).\nTypically, recalls are voluntary and initiated by manufacturers and distributors, but FDA does have the authority (thanks to the new Food Safety Modernization Act) to shut down operations at food production facilities if it deems that there is a significant threat to public health.\nRecalls are classified according to their potential seriousness. Both FDA and FSIS classify recalls according to this system :\nClass I – A Class I recall involves a health hazard situation in which there is a reasonable probability that eating the food will cause health problems or death.\nClass II – A Class II recall involves a potential health hazard situation in which there is a remote probability of adverse health consequences from eating the food.\nClass III – A Class III recall involves a situation in which eating the food will not cause adverse health consequences.\nHow do you find out about food recalls?\nFoodSafety.Gov is a great resource for food recalls and food safety alerts.

{"question":"How do Belleville washers and GFCIs differ in their approaches to electrical safety, and what are their specific applications?","answer":"Belleville washers and GFCIs serve different safety purposes. Belleville washers are force indicators for electrical connections, flattening at a desired force level, though they're not always necessary if proper high force is used. They must be installed correctly as they can be ineffective if placed upside down. In contrast, Ground-Fault Circuit-Interrupters (GFCIs) are designed to detect current leakage in electrical circuits and trip when leakage exceeds 5/1000 of an ampere. GFCIs come in three types: receptacle replacements, portable units, and circuit breakers. They are particularly important in wet environments and outdoor settings to prevent ground fault accidents, which can occur when someone touches an energized object while in contact with the ground, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.","context":["Torque and force are not the same.\nThe secret to making and keeping reliable electrical connections is contained in two elements: start with clean contact surfaces, and apply high force.\nClean contact surfaces are a function of cleaning procedures, including joint compounds, and will be covered in a future article. Application of high force is the subject here.\nThe trouble comes about because the terms “torque” and “force” are incorrectly used interchangeably. Force is NOT torque. Force is a function of torque. The expression which describes the relationship is\nF = T/K\nNote that the equation has a variable, K, that includes the coefficient of friction. The higher the friction, the lower the force for the same torque. Torque is a convenient way to get at force and is usually specified in making an electrical connection. Force is considered inconvenient to measure.\nTorque can be misleading\nConsider the following. Suppose you are given a torque value for an electrical connection and suppose that the connection is frozen due to corrosion, arcing, etc. Obviously, the recommended torque will not assure a good connection. Thus, relying on torque to judge the quality of an electrical connection can be misleading.\nLevels in uncertainty in the accompanying section “Force Variations by Methods of Tightening Connections” are taken from mechanical engineering sources and represent a rough estimate of the percent variation encountered when trying to tighten a connection using different methods.\nYou can see there is a wide variation in accuracy depending upon the method and that many of them are fairly inaccurate. In fact, when considering life safety, torque values are rarely mentioned.\nWhat is the correct force? When a connection is tightened, the joint electrical resistance drops as the force increases, up to a certain point. Beyond that certain amount of force, a marked decrease in resistance no longer occurs; the resistance remains fairly constant even with increased force. That certain amount of force is the minimum value of force needed.\nIn bolted connections, I have found that the forces associated with SAE Grade 5 hardware produce this correct value.\nApplying proper force\nTo assure you are applying the proper force in a connection, there are a few methods which can be utilized:\n•Low and consistent K factor by the use of lubrication. You can produce repeatable, high forces in the connection. To safely use lubricants, run tests in the shop before applying on the job.\nA well-lubricated fastener is stressed to a higher force for the same torque than an unlubricated one. Check that the fastener does not fracture at the higher force. Having conducted tests, then apply the selected torque to the lubricated threads.\n•Belleville washers. These are not always required in electrical connections and are often questionable. The washer must flatten at the proper force and many applications do not use a high enough force. In addition, since the bow in the washer is difficult to see, Bellevilles are sometimes installed upside down. If a proper high force is utilized in the connection, I have found that a Belleville is usually not necessary.\nBut a Belleville is an excellent force indicator and therefore can solve the force/torque dilemma. If you choose a Belleville that flattens at the desired force, you then can proceed with implementing the connections and not worry about a torque value.\n•Direct tension indicators. As mentioned previously, in mechanical connections where life safety is a subject of concern (e.g., buildings, bridges, etc.), torque is not mentioned. Instead measurement of force is required.\nA common procedure is the use of direct tension indicators. These are washer-like devices that feature protrusions (bumps) which flatten as a function of force applied to the connection. A feeler gauge is used to announce when the proper force is reached. Later inspection is simple through the use of a feeler gauge. Since the indicators are designed for use with steel, make sure the bumps are put against a hardened steel washer, not a copper or aluminum bus.\nThese devises are available for 1/2 in. hardware and larger. It is possible to use the 1/2 in. indicator with smaller hardware by requesting the force/gap characteristics from the manufacturer and then selecting the proper feeler gauge for the desired force. Make sure the gauge is narrow enough to fit between the bumps. MT\nNorman Shackman, P.E., is based in Kent. CT.

Human tissues and body fluids are relatively good conductors because of high water content.So if a person touches an energized bare wire or faulty equipment while grounded, electricity will instantly pass through the body to the ground, causing a harmful, potentially fatal, shock.\n8EFFECT OF VARIOUS VOLTAGE & CURRENT ON HUMAN BODY Electrical CurrentVoltage at 10000ohmsVoltage at 1000ohmsMaximum power(watt)Physiological effect0.001A10V1V0.01WThreshold of feeling an electric shock,pain.0.005A50V5V0.25WMaximum current which would be harmlessV10-20V1-4WSustained muscular contraction “can not let go”current0.05A500V25WVentricular interference respiratory difficulty.AVVWVentricular fibrillation can be fatal6A60000V6000V400000WSustained ventricular contraction followed by normal heart rhythm.

Whenever she touch it The current went through her body as a result, causing cardiac arrest and death.\n13Ground-Fault Circuit-Interrupters (GFCI’s)GFCI’s are to be used when using electrical equipment in a wet environment.GFCI’s are designed to detect any leakage of current in an electrical circuit.GFCI’s turn off or “trip” the circuit whenever the leakage is greater than 5/1000 of an ampere.For comparison two 60 Watt light bulbs draw a total of 1 ampere of current.\n14Three types of GFCI’sA GFCI receptacle used in place of standard receptacle.A portable GFCI plugs into a standard receptacle.A GFCI circuit breaker combines leakage current detection with the function of a circuit breaker.Whenever working in a wet area, or outdoors, employees should use one of these types of GFCI’s.\n15Electrical Burns Most common nonfatal electrical injury. Types: Internal: “deep tissue”.Skin: “entry” and “exit” points.Arc: “flash” burns from heat and radiant energy.Common sites of visible skin burns are the hands and feet.\n16Circuits may produce electrical burns with relatively massive amounts of tissue destruction by heating the tissues.This is due to the physical property of friction from the passage of electrons and by destruction of cell membranes by producing holes in the membranes.\n17FallsInvoluntary muscle contractions can “throw” workers and cause falls.If working at elevation, the fall may cause serious injury or death.\n18Example of fallsA worker fell from the top of a 12-story building and landed on the concrete below. A short-circuited electric drill was found dangling from the building's top floor.Detectives discovered that the grounding prong was missing from the drill's plug.A nail was lodged in the rubber tread of the work boot, allowing electricity to flow through the victim's body to the ground.The electrical current caused muscle contractions strong enough to throw the man from the building, resulting in death.\n19Fire In the United States 25% of fires are caused by electricity. A build-up of dust, trash and spider webs increases the potential for fire to start in the electrical system.Unprotected light bulbs in work areas are another potential hazard. They can be hit, broken and cause a fire.Electrical wiring can be hit when drilling holes or driving nails in walls causing a fire.\n20Many fires result from defects in, or misuse of the power delivery system. Wiring often fails due to faulty installation, overloading, physical damage, aging and deterioration by chemical action, heat, moisture and weather.Such wiring should be replaced and new circuits installed.Typical home and office electrical systems run like this:The electrical service enters the house and connects to a main electrical panel.From the main electrical panel, wires run in different directions throughout the house/building to power lights, outlets, ceiling fans, air conditioners, and various other direct-wired electrical appliances.\n21Typical home and office electrical systems run like this: The electrical service enters the house and connects to a main electrical panel.From the main electrical panel, wires run in different directions throughout the house/building to power lights, outlets, ceiling fans, air conditioners, and various other direct-wired electrical appliances.\n22To keep the wire from getting too hot and starting a fire, circuit wiring attempts to contain the amount of electrical load on the branch circuit by limiting the number of potential electrical appliances that can be running at the same time on that circuit.For example, only so many outlets are put on one branch circuit or larger pieces of electrical equipment are put on circuits dedicated to that equipment only.The homeowner or worker can plug in and run too many appliances on the same circuit at one time and overload the circuit.\n23Each circuit must be protected by a fuse or circuit breaker that will blow or “trip” when its safe carrying capacity is surpassed.If a fuse blows or circuit breaker trips repeatedly while in normal use (not overloaded), check for shorts and other faults in the line or devices.Do not resume use until the trouble is fixed.\n24It is hazardous to overload electrical circuits by using extension cords and multi-plug outlets. Use extension cords only when necessary and make sure they are heavy enough for the job.Avoid creating an “octopus” by inserting several plugs into a multi-plug outlet connected to a single wall outlet. (CDC)\n25Dimmed lights, reduced output from heaters and poor television pictures are all symptoms of an overloaded circuit.Keep the total load at any one time safely below maximum capacity.When using a high wattage device such as a heater, iron or power tool, turn off all unnecessary lights and devices.Try to connect into a circuit with little electrical power demand.\n26Electrical Hazard Control Extension cords should only be used on a temporary basis in situations where fixed wiring is not feasible.DO NOT use extension cords as permanent wiring. They may not be able to carry the load.However, if it is necessary to use an extension cord, never run it across walkways or aisles.It causes a potential tripping hazard.It wears down the insulation.\n27Wall receptacles should be designed and installed so that no current-carrying parts will be exposed, and outlet plates should be kept tight to eliminate the possibility of shock.Replace or repair electrical appliances that over heated, sparked, shorted out, smoked or have damaged cords or cracked equipment.\n28If wires are exposed, they may cause a shock to a worker comes into contact with them. Cords should not be hung on nails, run over or wrapped around objects, knotted or twisted. This may break the wire or insulation.Short circuits are usually caused by bare wires touching due to breakdown of insulation.Electrical tape or any other kind of tape is not adequate!Cords in areas of water or other conductive liquid must be approved for those locations.\n29When the outer jacket of a cord is damaged, the cord may no longer be water-resistant. The insulation can absorb moisture, which may then result in a short circuit or excessive current leakage to the ground.These cords should be replaced immediately.Electric cords should be examined on a routine basis for fraying and exposed wiring.\n30Electrical cords should be examined visually before use on any shift for external defects such as: fraying and exposed wiringloose partsdeformed or missing partsdamage to outer jacket or insulationevidence of internal damage such as pinched or crushed outer jacketIf any defects are found the electric cords should be removed from service immediately.\n31Pull the plug not the cord Pull the plug not the cord. Pulling the cord could break a wire, causing a short circuit.\n32Plug your microwave or any other large appliances into an outlet that is not shared with other appliances.Do not tamper with fuses as this is a potential fire hazard.Do not overload circuits as this may cause the wires to heat and ignite insulation or other combustibles.\n33Keep office equipment properly cleaned and maintained. Ensure lamps are free from contact with flammable material.Always use lights bulbs with the recommended wattage for your lamp and ceiling fixtures.Be aware of the odor of burning plastic or wire.Always follow the manufacturer recommendations when using or installing new office equipment.Wiring installations should always be made by a licensed electrician or other qualified person.All electrical appliances should have the label of a testing laboratory."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7b195eae-2f5b-4748-89b7-7ff2bed5834d>","<urn:uuid:a46e66a2-66df-4a1a-beea-e7e3b76836ad>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the core values and development objectives of both the Canadian and Australian cadet programs?","answer":"Both programs focus on youth development and leadership. The Canadian Cadet Program aims to develop self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-awareness in youth, while improving their physical fitness and academic studies. It emphasizes creating well-rounded, community-minded individuals ready to become future leaders. The Australian Air Force Cadets focuses on fostering initiative, leadership, discipline, and loyalty. It aims to develop qualities of leadership, self-reliance, good citizenship, and character. Both programs achieve these goals through structured activities - the Canadian program through community service and citizenship activities, and the AAFC through practical training in areas such as aviation, drill ceremonies, and outdoor activities. Both emphasize leadership development and preparing youth for community life.","context":["Become a Cadet\nWhat if you were told that there was a dynamic, structured youth program that offered Canadian youth a variety of interesting and challenging activities?\nWhat if you were told that this same program developed in youth an increased level of self-confidence, self-esteem and self-awareness?\nCadets are motivated to improve their physical fitness, to work harder at their academic studies and to give back to their communities through volunteerism and citizenship activities.\nThe Cadet Program also has a direct impact on Canadian society as a whole. Cadets have the opportunity to take part in various leadership roles throughout the program. There is definite value in having well-rounded, community-minded, experienced young people who are ready to assume their places as tomorrow’s leaders and decision makers.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe Cadet Program is funded by the Department of National Defence in partnership with the civilian Navy League, Army Cadet League and Air Cadet League of Canada. The civilian sponsor requires local community support to meet its obligations that include accommodations, training aids and equipment and program enhancements not otherwise provided. Parents and Cadets are expected to participate in and contribute to fundraising as required by the League’s local sponsoring element.\nThe Department of National Defence/Canadian Armed Forces assumes costs (including uniform and travel) for Cadets. Consequently, membership in the Cadet Program provides thousands of Canadian youth with unique opportunities free of charge that they might not otherwise experience — making the Cadet Program a viable option.\nWho can join?\nTo be eligible for membership as a Cadet one must:\n- be a legal resident of Canada:\nNOTE: A legal resident of Canada is a Canadian citizen, a landed immigrant, or, the dependant of a person who is lawfully resident in Canada on a temporary basis for the purpose of education or employment.\n- provide proof of provincial health insurance coverage or equivalent;\n- be at least 12 years of age;\n- not have attained 19 years of age;\n- normally be in good physical condition;\n- not belong to another corps or squadron; and\n- be acceptable to the Commanding Officer (CO) of the cadet corps or squadron.\nThe CO of the cadet corps or squadron shall review and approve all membership applications; however, he/she shall consult with the Regional Cadet Support Unit (RCSU) when there is uncertainty as to whether an application meets the basic membership standards or an application requires special consideration such as:\n- application from a youth who is not yet a legal resident of Canada; and\n- application from a youth who has a medical, physical or mental condition specified in Part 2 of the CF 1158 that cannot be accommodated as outlined in the What about medical, physical and mental conditions section below.\nWhat about medical, physical and mental conditions?\nIn that a minimum standard of medical fitness has not been established for membership of a cadet in a corps or squadron, a person with a medical condition or who is mentally or physically challenged may become a member at the Commanding Officer’s discretion.\nThe Commanding Officer of the Cadet Corps or Squadron shall ensure that:\n- the parent or guardian describes the medical, physical or mental condition at part 2 of form CF 1158;\n- the corps or squadron has the physical facilities and the staff required to provide cadet training in light of the medical condition or the mental or medical challenge;\n- the ability of the corps or squadron to provide effective training to other members will not be reduced; and\n- the parent or guardian and the prospective cadet are aware that minimum medical fitness standards do exist for attendance at Cadet Summer Training Centres (CSTC) and for the Exchange Programmes. The parents or guardians shall be informed that cadets with a medical condition may not be permitted to attend summer training. This fact must be clearly understood by all parties prior to accepting a person with a medical condition, or who is mentally or physically challenged as a member of a cadet corps or squadron.\nBut I’m not 12 years of age yet?\nYou have to be at least 12 years old and under 19 to join the Cadet Program.\nIf you are under 12 years of age but wish to participate in a Cadet Program, “Navy League Cadets” aimed at youth aged 9-13 is a program run entirely by one of our civilian partners, the Navy League of Canada.\nHow do I join Cadets?\nThe Cadet training year follows that of the school calendar year, beginning in September and ending in May/June (depending on the Cadet Corps or Squadron). “Corps” are for Sea and Army Cadets and “Squadrons” are for Air Cadets!\nMost Cadet Corps and Squadrons will host recruiting nights in September and again in January. If you are shy and want to join with the greatest number of youth, September and January are your best months to join as there will be other youth equally as shy and new.\nSaying that, you may join at anytime during the cadet training year (September to May June), however, if you are interested in attending summer camp or want to progress to the next proficiency level/star/phase the following year – you will need to have joined NO LATER THAN March 31.\nOnce you have chosen which element (Sea, Army or Air Cadets) interests you the most, you will then want to find the Cadet Corps (Sea or Army) or Squadron (Air) that is closest to you (or perhaps the one that your friends are already members of).\nTo help you find the Corps or Squadron closest to you, please visit the Corps and Squadron Directory. You may either enter your city, postal code or may even type the Cadet Corps or Squadron number if you know it. For best results, we recommend that you use your postal code.\nRemember, Corps are for Sea and Army Cadets and Squadrons are for Air Cadets!\nAt this point, you know which element you would like to join and where it is. You should also have been able to see which evening and time that they meet at and perhaps even a contact number. You are welcome to contact them to find out further information and details or you may attend on the evening and time that they meet.\nNow that you are ready to join Sea, Army or Air Cadets, you will need to go and visit the Corps or Squadron that you have chosen to join. Upon joining you will need to bring a few things with you which include:\n- a photocopy of the birth certificate or equivalent; and\n- a photocopy of the health insurance card (where available).\nThe Cadet Corps or Squadron will also provide you with a few forms that will need to be completed and signed. These completed forms, along with the photocopies of your health insurance card and birth certificate start your Cadet Personnel Record. Your Cadet Personnel Record is stored safely and securely at the Cadet Corps or Squadron that you are joining. There is no need to send forms or documentation anywhere!\nAccess to Cadet Personnel Records are restricted to those individuals authorized in writing by the Commanding Officer (CO) of the cadet Corps/Squadron pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act.\nCadets/parents/legal guardians shall have access to the cadet’s file by asking the CO or the Administration Officer of the Cadet Corps or Squadron.\nCadet Personnel Records are kept until the date at which the cadet reaches the age of twenty-five. The files may only be destroyed at that time in accordance with the Defence Administrative Orders and Directives (DAOD) on the Management of Recorded Information and the Treasury Board Policy on the Management of Government Information.\nWhen you leave or age-out of Cadets, make sure to ask for a copy of your Cadet Personnel Record. You never know if you will need it in the future and it makes for a great keepsake!\nNow that you have completed all the necessary forms, have the proper documentation and have been accepted for membership – welcome to the Cadet Program!\nExperiences that you cannot get anywhere else are about to begin!

Algae have figured out a way to increase the efficiency of carbon fixation. They gather most of their Rubisco into a ball-shaped microcompartment called the pyrenoid, which they flood with a high local concentration of carbon dioxide. A team of scientists at Princeton University, the Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford University and the Max Plank Institute of Biochemistry have unravelled the mysteries of how the pyrenoid is assembled. These insights can help to engineer crops that remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while producing more food.\nA warming planet\nOur brains house extremely complex neuronal circuits, whose detailed structures are still largely unknown.

ABI views the Earth with 16 different spectral bands (compared to five on the previous generation of GOES), including two visible channels, four near-infrared channels, and ten infrared channels. These different channels (wavelengths) are used by models and tools to indicate various elements on the Earth’s surface or in the atmosphere, such as trees, water, clouds, moisture or smoke.\nIt provides three times more spectral information, four times the spatial resolution, and more than five times faster temporal coverage than the previous system.\nABI is a mission critical payload for the GOES-R Series, providing more than 65 percent of all mission data products currently defined.\nABI is a multi-channel passive imaging radiometer designed to observe the Western Hemisphere and provide variable area imagery and radiometric information of Earth’s surface, atmosphere and cloud cover. The instrument has multiple scan modes. In mode 4, or continuous full disk mode, the ABI produces a full disk (Western Hemisphere) image every five minutes. In mode 3, or flex mode, the ABI concurrently produces a full disk every 15 minutes, a CONUS image (resolution 3000 km by 5000 km) every five minutes, and two mesoscale domains (resolution 1000 km by 1000 km at the satellite sub-point) every 60 seconds or one sub-domain every 30 seconds. Mode 6, or 10-minute flex mode, which became the default operating mode for GOES-16 and GOES-17 in April 2019, provides a full disk image every 10 minutes, a CONUS (GOES-16) / PACUS (GOES-17) image every five minutes, and images from both mesoscale domains every 60 seconds (or one sub-domain every 30 seconds). All ABI bands have on-orbit calibration. Learn more about mode 6 in the User Information section of the website.\nABI is used for a wide range of applications related to weather, oceans, land, climate and hazards (fires, volcanoes, floods, hurricanes and storms that spawn tornadoes).\nABI improves every product from the previous GOES imager and introduces a host of new products.\nIt tracks and monitors cloud formation, atmospheric motion, convection, land surface temperature, ocean dynamics, flow of water, fire, smoke, volcanic ash plumes, aerosols and air quality, and vegetative health. ABI’s data enables meteorologists to pinpoint and track developing storms in much greater detail. Future products will also help the aviation industry with aircraft icing threat detection and turbulent flight condition predictions.\nBenefits from the ABI include improved tropical cyclone forecasts, fewer weather-related flight delays and airline incidences with volcanic plumes, improved production and distribution of electricity and natural gas, increased efficiency in irrigated water usage in agriculture, and higher protection rates for recreational boats in the event of a tropical storm or hurricane.\nDuring post-launch testing of the GOES-17 ABI instrument, an issue with the instrument’s cooling system was discovered. The loop heat pipe (LHP) subsystem, which transfers heat from the ABI electronics to the radiator, is not operating at its designed capacity. The consequence of this is that the ABI detectors cannot be maintained at their intended temperatures under certain orbital conditions. Inadequate cooling of the infrared channels leads to partial loss of imagery during some of the overnight hours before and after the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.\nExtraordinary recovery efforts greatly improved data availability from the GOES-17 ABI. As of April 2021, the instrument is delivering 94% of the data it was intended to provide. This decrease in data availability, from a peak of 98% after instrument recovery efforts, was expected due to graduation degradation of the ABI cryocooler and thermal surfaces over time. The team will continue to assess ABI performance and provide updates on when to expect degraded imagery due to saturated channels. Learn more about the GOES-17 cooling system issue and its effects on imagery.\nBased on recommendations from the GOES-17 ABI cooling system anomaly Independent Review Team, the GOES-T and GOES-U ABI radiator/loop heat pipes have been redesigned to decrease the chance of future cooling system anomalies. The new design utilizes a simpler hardware configuration that eliminates the filters that are susceptible to debris.\nABI Scan Mode Demonstration\n|Attribute :||ABI||Current GOES Imager|\n|Spectral Coverage||16 bands||5 bands|\n|0.64 µm Visible||0.5 km||~ 1 km|\n|Other visible/near-IR||1.0 km||n/a|\n|Bands (>2 µm)||2 km||~ 4 km|\n|Full Disk||6 per hour||Scheduled (3 hrly)|\n|CONUS||12 per hour||~4 per hour|\n|Mesoscale||30 or 60 sec||n/a|\n|Visible (reflective bands)|\nOne-minute infrared imagery of the powerful storm system that brought hail and tornadoes to the Southeastern U.S. on April 5, 2017.

{"question":"I work at an environmental consultancy firm. What is EMS implementation progress in SMEs, and what are Owens Corning's environmental footprint achievements?","answer":"Regarding SME implementation of Environmental Management Systems (EMS), it remains a major challenge despite significant EMS uptake in large corporations. SMEs, which account for 99.9% of private sector enterprises in the UK and contribute up to 70% of industrial pollution, face several barriers including limited resources and perceiving EMS as bureaucratic. As for Owens Corning's environmental achievements, they have made significant progress on their 2020 footprint goals, meeting 5 out of 6 targets. Specifically, they achieved a 31% intensity reduction in primary energy, 48% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 29% reduction in fine particulate matter, 59% reduction in toxic air emissions, and 42% reduction in water consumption. However, they continue to be challenged by their waste-to-landfill goal, achieving only a 6% intensity reduction against a 70% target.","context":["The damaging slipstream on the environment from the activities of concern organisations is far from being negligible. Over the old ages, turning planetary environmental consciousness has resulted in legislative and regulative specifications set to impel concern corporations toward environmental stewardship. Harmonizing to Blair ( 2002 ) , business/industry is the aggregation of houses who operate basically the same series of procedures that result in a related set of merchandises ( whether touchable merchandises or services ) that a 3rd party wants to purchase. With this definition in head, the footings “business” , “enterprise” , “organisation” , “corporation” , and “company” are used interchangeably in this paper.\nUnder many authoritiess, the enforcement of environmental statute law has impelled many industries to be proactive in following voluntary pollution bar patterns ; instead than covering with environmental harm caused, industries seek to extinguish beginnings of pollutants from fabrication and service procedures ( Morrow and Rondinelli, 2002 ) . Such proactive response to the environment by organisations has evolved into several tools for measuring, foretelling and hence forestalling environmental harm which can be caused by anthropogenetic activities. The Environmental Management System ( EMS ) stands out as a proactive tool and is recognised to be effectual if introduced into an organisation which has, had, or may hold an impact on the environment ( Werner, 2000 ) .\nAn EMS is a continual rhythm of planning, implementing, reexamining and bettering the procedures and actions that an organisation undertakes to run into its concern and environmental ends. It is a system that manages the environmental public presentation of an organisation, every bit good as other concern benefits. It is purposed at doing organisations more environmental proactive and efficient ( Emilsson, 2002 ) .\nHarmonizing to Starkey ( 1998 ) , the recognition of EMSs has led to the development of national and international criterions that provide organisations with a generic model to implementing an EMS within their organisation. Through the establishing of an EMS, the company can show to clients and the populace that they take environmental impacts earnestly. As a consequence, environmental factors have become progressively of import in strategic considerations for endeavors of any size.\nInitially, environmental direction had been an issue largely for the large organisations ( Hillary, 2004 ) . They have the necessary resources to engage specialised people in order to turn to environmental affairs, and have recognised environmental direction as a manner to cover with environmental related jobs and besides to pass on to concerned stakeholders that environmental affairs are non neglected in company ventures ( Biondi et.al, 1997 ) .\nBy virtuousness of direction systems, environmental public presentation in big endeavors has improved well in recent old ages. But more and more attending is being turned toward the smaller houses ( Aragon-Correa, 2008 ) . An ever-increasing figure of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) are deriving involvement in environmental direction systems.\nSMEs play a cardinal function in the national economic system, doing of import parts to economic growing and using important Numberss of people. Harmonizing to BERR, 2008, SMEs accounted for 99.9 % of the 4.7 million private sector endeavors estimated in the UK at the start of 2007. Although little in size, their great Numberss make their accrued environmental impact important. The environmental impact of little houses is non known at national degree, but it is frequently and widely quoted to lend up to 70 % of all industrial pollution in the UK ( Hillary, 2004 ) . Furthermore, SMEs frequently have low or no consciousness of environmental affairs and therefore the potency for betterment is important ( Fresner, 2004 ) .\nHillary ( 2004 ) indicated that despite the significant consumption of EMSs as direction tool, preponderantly in big corporations, their uptake and execution in the SME sector still remains a major challenge. Recent surveies revealed that environmental actions undertaken by corporations are reciprocally relative to company size: this implies that the house size is one of the major determiners of a company ‘s green scheme ( Bianchi, 1998 ; Del animation, 2003 ; and Pimenova, 2004 ) . The few empirical analyses and instance surveies that have been done on corporate EMSs tend to concentrate chiefly on big corporations and comparatively few surveies have explored EMS execution in SMEs ( Morrow and Rondinelli, 2002 ) . This may be closely related to the focal point on big corporations because of their greater degree of impact on the environment.\nIt is of import to perpetrate little houses to environmental protection because jointly, their environmental impact is really important. Review of academic literature has revealed that little endeavors experience many jobs in their working with EMSs ; it is merely justified to research farther on why SMEs construction might non interact good with the more formal EMS criterions and their application.\nDespite being a voluntary criterion, there is a demand to determine whether EMS acceptance by SMEs is an result of their ain inducements to be environmentally friendly ( pro-active ) or they are forced by certain fortunes ( re-active ) to take action. The grounds ( pro-active/motivation or re-active/drivers ) that specifically bring about the development and execution of EMSs in SMEs has non been adequately addressed by research literatures ( Bianchi, 1998 ; Morrow and Rondinelli, 2002 ) . Many little houses have recognised the necessity to get down working with EMS, and some besides feel a force per unit area from clients to attest their EMS. There is besides a turning apprehension that the environmental competency of an organisation is an of import portion of the overall competency and is perceived to be an of import factor when endeavoring for greater fight in the comparative market ( Del animation, 2003 ) . The ground for few SMEs following EMSs may change in footings of attitudes, consciousness and limited resources.\nMoore, ( 2009 ) outlined that nevertheless strong the motive or driver may be to implement an EMS, SMEs still face terrible jobs as they try to implement and attest the EMS. Many SMEs perceive EMS as bureaucratic and have jobs in understanding to the full the EMS criterions ( Hillary 2004 ) . The criterions were originally designed to suit the demands of big fabrication companies, and do non adequately address indirect environmental facets. These indirect facets, in bend, are frequently the most of import facets for service companies whence most SMEs supply services. As admitted by Hillary ( 2004 ) , it is hard to generalize the jobs ( barriers ) of implementing EMSs in SMEs due to the diverseness of SMEs, but research has been devoted to categorize, analyse and propose different methods to get the better of the bing barriers to execution and enfranchisement of EMS in little houses.\nThe issue of existent benefits accruing to corporations following EMSs has been widely discussed in academic literature ; but yet to be adequately explored are possible linkages between the grounds ( pro-active/motivation or re-active/drivers ) for developing EMSs, and the widely reported benefits accruing to certified corporations ( Gonzalez- Benito and Gonzalez- Benito, 2005 ) . Implementing an EMS is an uninterrupted procedure and a long-run venture. SMEs will easy remain the class of EMS acceptance when they can see touchable benefits of the procedure associating to their initial grounds for implementing the criterion. Harmonizing to Miles ( 1999 ) , this deficit of lessons learned and existent benefits has impeded promoting more SMEs to take a formal EMS as a tool for covering with organisational environmental challenges. Establishing the nexus between motivation/driver, and emerging benefit of EMS execution, is therefore imperative for farther research.\nWith sustainable development in head, the important impacts of SMEs need particular attending, and prosecuting them in environmental betterment is critical ( Hillary 2004 ) . It is indispensable to perpetrate little houses to environmental protection because jointly, their environmental impact is really important. Review of academic literature has revealed that little endeavors experience many jobs in their working with EMSs ; it is merely justified to research farther on why SMEs construction might non interact good with the more formal EMS criterions and their application.\nIn attempt to promote EMS acceptance by SMEs, it is hence necessary for more research in issues refering motives and drivers for following EMS, methods of get the better ofing bing barriers, and associating touchable benefits with initial grounds for EMS execution.\nThe overall purpose of this research is to better EMS execution in SMEs and is designed to lend to the grounds available in this subject. Therefore the aims of this research include:\nIdentify possible grounds ( motives and drivers ) for following EMS and enfranchisement by SMEs ;\nExplore and sort the chief bing barriers to execution and enfranchisement of EMSs in SMEs ; and\nEstablish the correlativity between grounds, and benefits achieved as a consequence of EMS execution in SMEs.\nA conceptual model for this research will be outlined in chapter 2 ; which is developed from the academic literatures reviewed. This reappraisal discusses the above mentioned purpose of the undertaking. Chapter 3 outlines the methodological analysis used to roll up informations for the research and justifies the applied method. In chapter 4, the study consequences will be presented, analysed and discussed in relation to the literature reappraisal. The concluding chapter will be an overall decision on the chief findings and recommendations.\nThe environment is the beginning for all natural stuffs but besides the sink for waste. Since the 1960s, there has been a turning involvement in the environment, particularly in the harm being done to the environment ( Welford, 1998 ) . This involvement is attributed to the economic development achieved in many instances by utilizing resources at an unsustainable rate. This state of affairs initiated the necessity for a agencies that makes development and environmental protection compatible. The construct of sustainable development emphasizes the mutuality between the environment and development.\nIn its simplest signifier, sustainable development is defined as development that meets the demands of the present coevals without compromising the ability of future coevalss to run into their ain demands ( WCED, 1987 ) . This definition stresses the ethical rule of equity between the present and future coevalss. It besides insinuates that it is possible to do development and environmental protection campatible. Sustainable development, as a construct, integrates societal, economic and environmental facets in undertaking three primary issues – environment, equity and future. However, schemes are needed to interpret conceptual theories of sustainable development into practical ways of accomplishing it over clip ( Welford, 1998 ) . These indispensable schemes chiefly apply to corporate houses, who play a critical function in announcing sustainable development. In a corporate context, the developments of susbstitutes for non-renewable resources and inventions which cut down waste and utilize energy more expeditiously are cardinal patterns that relate corporate houses to sustainable development.\nHow Does Sustainable Development Concern Corporate Firms\nIrrespective of their size, corporate houses are cardinal histrions in the phase of sustainable development since their activities have impacts ( positive and negative ) on the tripod facets of sustainability – economic, societal and environment. Their activities have environmental impacts – through development of resources, transit and fabrication procedure ; economic impacts – through act uponing consumer demand and the market ; and societal impacts – through influencing employment rates ( Diesendorf, 2000 ) . Welford ( 1998 ) implied that corporations, through proper direction integrating environmental considerations, which counteract unsustainable patterns ( such as home ground and biodiversity debasement, waste coevals, pollution, etc. ) , are cardinal to sustainability. Corporations can cut down their overall impacts by bettering or redesigning merchandises and procedures to hold minimum environmental impact ; every bit good as better the quality and efficiency of their internal operations. This efficiency will intend bring forthing more with less resource and pollution every bit good as meet client demands. Corporations can besides affect sustainable development on their clients by making penchant for merchandises and services consistent with sustainability and besides selectively let go of cognition to the public through corporate coverage, to demo their attempt toward sustainability ( Diesendorf 2000 ; Hart 2001 ) .\nHart ( 2001 ) , connoted that environmental jobs can endanger the being of concern since concern corporations depend on the environment invariably supplying sufficient resources including renewable and non-renewable resources, whence a debauched environmental quality will fall abruptly of this map and would merely predicate negative impacts on the concern, e.g. the depletion of the ozone bed led to a planetary prohibition on the production of halons and, as a consequence, this prohibition spells day of reckoning for concerns who fail to accommodate to new state of affairs ; in the instance where there is serious H2O pollution and scarce H2O resource, pollution cleansing operation would give concerns extra cost ( Hart 2001 ) . It is apparent that concerns non merely have important impacts on sustainable development but besides depend on it.","Since 2010, Owens Corning has made significant progress against our second set of 10-year environmental footprint goals, but our work is not done. We continue to look for opportunities to shrink our environmental footprint through continuous reduction of resource use and environmental emissions from our operations.\nIn October of 2015, we announced we had met our greenhouse gas and toxic air emissions goals ahead of schedule. We decided to increase our 2020 commitments of 50 percent and 75 percent reductions for these environmental impacts respectively, and incorporated science-based greenhouse gas target-setting methodology into our strategy. While we’ve met or made steady progress on five of our six 2020 footprint goals, we continue to be challenged by our waste-to-landfill goal.\nMore details about our footprint reduction strategy and progress is available in our annual Sustainability Report (PDF).\nWe focus on six key aspects:\nWe take a holistic approach to energy management, encompassing product development, manufacturing, operations worldwide, and all levels of our workforce. Our strategy revolves around developing innovative, energy-saving products and implementing programs aimed at reducing our energy usage and shifting toward renewable energy sources. We ensure that the total energy needed to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity from the power generation source to the end user (referred to as primary energy) is factored into the company’s energy consumption metrics.\nGreenhouse Gases (GHG) Emissions\nWe believe that the impact of human activity on global climate change is an ongoing challenge, requiring the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) around the world. Recognizing the variety of activities both upstream and downstream of our operations, we follow multiple approaches to determine the amount of GHG emissions generated throughout our value chain – and seek innovative ways to reduce GHG from our own operations.\nFine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) Emissions\nOwens Corning is committed to reducing its impact on the environment through many mechanisms and is committed to the reduction of PM2.5 emissions at its facilities globally. Particulate Matter is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air while PM2.5 is those particles that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.\nToxic Air Emissions (TAE)\nOwens Corning defines Toxic Air Emissions to include the following: hexavalent chromium, formaldehyde, manganese, polycyclic aromatic compounds and ammonia. This shift in focus for air emissions acknowledges our past successes and our concern for pollutants that carry greater air quality concerns.\nWaste to landfill reduction is our largest challenge. Our businesses are continually seeking opportunities to reduce waste at the facility level and their performance is being reported at the enterprise level. To achieve our targets, we conduct periodic reviews to assess the progress and take necessary corrective actions.\nOwens Corning relies on high-quality water for many of its manufacturing processes. However, several factors, including regional water scarcity, limited water availability, and rising water costs, pose risks for our operations and business expansion plans. We are committed to minimizing water consumption and potential contamination from the production, use, and disposal of our product.\nEnvironmental Footprint Reduction Goals and Progress\nThe company's six aspects are shown in the footprint graphic below. The 2010 baseline year is shown as the dark blue outside border of the spider chart, representing 100 percent of each aspect. The pink center footprint indicates the company's 10-year intensity goals.

{"question":"As a health professional concerned about agricultural workers, I'd like to understand how the risks faced by female farmworkers compare to those of the general farmworker population. What are the unique challenges women face versus the common hazards all farmworkers experience?","answer":"While all farmworkers face significant occupational hazards like exposure to pesticides, extreme weather conditions, machinery risks, and musculoskeletal injuries from physical labor, female farmworkers encounter additional unique challenges. One of the most significant distinctions is that women report fear of sexual abuse more frequently than male migrant workers. Many women remain silent about sexual assault due to fears of termination or deportation, especially considering that nearly 50% of migrant agricultural workers are undocumented. Furthermore, when women do report abuse, the process is usually lengthy and not financially sustainable for low-income migrating families. Beyond safety concerns, female farmworkers also face the double burden of working alongside men in the fields while also handling domestic responsibilities like cooking, helping children with homework, and childcare after their workday. Additionally, like all farmworkers, they face poor occupational health and safety conditions, inadequate diet, and barriers to accessing affordable health services they may be eligible for.","context":["A woman is a very central, matriarchal, and necessary part of the traditional Hispanic household. Oftentimes one thinks of migrant workers as young men coming to the country to work in the fields. The women who accompany them are too often seen as passive passengers on the dangerous journey many migrant workers face each season.\nThe month of March honors Women’s History Month. It is important to take time and show recognition for the strong women in the fields who are much more than a passive voice accompanying their male counterparts.\n“There is no question,” great civil rights and farmworker activist Dolores Huerta says, “that our women are strong. They work right alongside the men in the fields.” And when the day’s labor is done the women go home, cook for their families, help their children with homework or if they’re younger, bathe and feed them. It is very rare that the female farmworker takes time for herself, and she rarely asks for it. There is too much work to be done.\nMs. Huerta is right, there is no question whether America’s farmworking women are strong. The question is; how do we give this silent population a voice?\nAccording to Cultural Survival there is little known information on the health status of migrating women in the United States. Undocumented female workers face unique barriers, among them, poor occupational health and safety, poor diet, and most are unfamiliar with the affordable health services they are eligible for.\nThe barriers mentioned above do not exclusively affect women. However, one fear that women have reported more frequently than migrant men is the fear of sexual abuse. Many migrant women do not report cases of sexual assault because they fear repercussions. Nearly 50% of the migrant agricultural workforce are undocumented immigrants; too often women remain silent because of their fear of termination or deportation.\nIn the rare occasion that a woman reports abuse, it is usually lengthy process that is not sustainable or affordable for a low-income migrating family.\nIt goes without saying that sexual abuse can cause physical and emotional harm to our women in the fields, especially when abusers are not charged for their crimes.\nSo what can we do to help our mothers, sisters, and daughters in the fields?\nCommunity Health Workers and Promotoras de Salud can go out in the fields and educate both men and women on what constitutes as sexual abuse. There are some laws that protect our female farmworkers as well.\nAbuse in the fields is unacceptable. Abuse in the fields without knowing how to access health services is unacceptable.\nThe National Center for Farmworker Health is calling on Migrant and Community Health Centers to increase their number of farmworkers served to 2 million by the year 2020. No one should fear their mortality or safety because of lack of access to primary and preventative health care services.\nFind out other ways you can get involved to help women in the fields raise their voices.\nPhoto Credit: iStock\nIt is Christmas season and we see Christmas trees everywhere. Christmas trees are put up each year, yet many don’t stop to reflect on the hard work and consequences that agricultural workers experience in order for these trees to be in our homes.\nPrior to the 1950's, most Christmas trees were cut from the forest. Today, according to the National Christmas Tree Association, more than 90 percent are grown on farms growing nearly 350 million Christmas trees in the U.S. alone. There approximately 15,000 farms growing Christmas Trees in the U.S. and employing over 100,000 people full or part-time in the industry.\nWith the high demand for Christmas trees during this season, agriculture workers working the pine trees become essential for the industry. However, they are exposed to the dangers of pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, along with other occupational health risks.\nWhen we see Christmas trees during this season, it’s uncommon to stop and think of the dangers farmworkers face while working. Yet, more shocking is the fact that many of them have not received any health care services. For example, North Carolina is the leading producer of Fraser fir trees, one of the best selling Christmas tree species, but in 2014, in North Carolina only 10.5% of agriculture workers received health care services.\nDue to a low percentage of agricultural workers in the U.S being served by health centers, NCFH and NACHC have launched the Ag Worker Access 2020 campaign calling on every migrant health center grantee to increase the number of agricultural workers served by 15% each year over the next five years. NCFH has developed resources and tools to help health centers achieve this goal. Every agricultural worker deserves to be aware of his or her health care opportunities, accounted for in their health center, and receive quality health care services. They work the soil of this country for all of us to have food on our tables, and even to make our home look beautiful with a Christmas tree during the holiday season. So, join us in making this Ag Worker Access 2020 campaign a success and most importantly making sure all agricultural workers and their families receives health care services.\nIn this holiday season, learn how you can help ensure agricultural workers are informed of the health care services available to them. And remember, if you have a beautiful decorated Christmas tree in your home…thank a farmworker.\nBy: Joanna Arevalo\nVideo: Robyn Levine, USA, 2011.\nThe National Center for Farmworker Health\nImproving health care access for one of America's most vulnerable populations","Farm work ranks as one of the most hazardous occupations in the U.S., and yet farmworkers are the least protected workforce in our nation. Farmworkers have very few federal workplace safety protections in comparison to other occupations, but they are exposed to a multitude of environmental hazards that are potentially harmful to their health and well-being.\nAgricultural work is physically demanding; therefore, the risk of accidents is increased by fatigue, poorly designed tools, difficult terrain, exposure to extreme weather conditions, and poor general health associated with working and living in remote communities. These problems are compounded by the fact that working and living conditions are often intimately linked.\nFarmers and farmworkers suffer disproportionately from respiratory diseases, hearing loss due to deafening noise, skin conditions, a variety of cancers, ergonomic problems, chemical toxicity, and heat-related illnesses. Even if they can’t be eliminated entirely, there are precautions that can be taken to minimize or eliminate these potential hazards.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that farmworkers suffer as many as 300,000 acute illnesses and injuries from pesticide exposure each year. More than 4,800 deaths are reported annually in the workplace, from which 570 are in the agriculture sector.\nWhat is the leading cause of death for farmworkers?\nTractor rollover – which is why AFOP Health & Safety imparts tractor safety training to the agriculture community. Daily, about 243 agricultural workers suffer a serious injury which causes time off work. Five percent of these injuries result in permanent impairment.\nOther serious safety and health hazards farmworkers face are:\n- Lack of adequate drinking water and restrooms\n- Musculoskeletal injuries from stooping, lifting, and cutting\n- Farm machinery and equipment like tractors, ladders and sharp tools\n- Exposure to pesticides\n- Extreme weather\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) most recent figures, there were 4,821 fatal occupational injuries in 2014 (the latest figures available), 239 (5%) more than reported in 2013. The majority of these injuries occur in a handful of sectors representing the most dangerous ways to earn a living in the country. Despite the danger involved in the farm work occupation, their annual compensation does not balance the associated risks. BLS estimates that the median pay of a farmworker is $22,540 annually.\nOf course, some agricultural employers pay a fair wage to their employees. Too many, however, still do not.\nStronger laws and genuine enforcement are needed. This includes addressing the problem of lack of inspectors in the agriculture sector. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) summarized farmworker labor law exclusion, noting the following:\n- In many states, it is not required that farmworkers have workers’ compensation or overtime pay\n- On smaller farms and in short harvest seasons, farmworkers are not entitled to federal minimum wage ($5.85 per hour).\n- Child labor laws are riddled with exemptions in agriculture, like that children may perform farm work as young as 10 years of age (16 is the minimum age for most non-agricultural jobs)\n- In some states, farmworker children are exempt from the state’s compulsory education laws.\n- Many state health and safety laws exclude farmworkers.\n- Farmworkers are not covered by the National Labor Relations Act and thus have no standardized union protection against unfair labor practices – except in the handful of states that have chosen to enact NRLA-type protections to them\nDespite the injustices, farmworkers often don’t complain about violations due to of fear of employer retaliation. When limited legal protection and fear of punishment is coupled with the natural hazards of the fields, preventable workplace injuries and illnesses are too common for comfort. Through AFOP Health & Safety Programs trainers, we educate workers on how to file complaints anonymously in hopes that workers can fight the fear and raise their voice.\nWe all eat; therefore, we all need the farmworker community.

{"question":"How do flooded lead-acid batteries compare to disposable batteries in terms of maintenance requirements?","answer":"Flooded lead-acid batteries and disposable batteries have different maintenance needs. Flooded lead-acid batteries require regular refilling with water to maintain proper function. In contrast, disposable batteries are single-use and require no maintenance during their lifetime - they are simply used once and then must be taken to a collection point when depleted. Disposable batteries also have the advantage of losing their charge more slowly through self-discharge compared to rechargeable batteries.","context":["What Types of Batteries Are There?\nThere are different ways of classifying batteries.\nDisposable versus rechargeable\nDisposable batteries are also known as single-use or primary batteries. You can only use them once. Once a disposable battery is discarded, you cannot recharge it and you have to take it to a collection point. We use disposable batteries mainly in electronic devices that use little energy, such as the remote control of your television, clocks and calculators. These batteries lose their charge a little more slowly (self-discharge) than rechargeable batteries. We use them in smoke detectors and flashlights, for example.\nRechargeable batteries can be found in laptops, mobile phones, cameras, tablets, etc. When they are used, we can simply recharge them. Did you know that you can extend your batteries’ life if you recharge them correctly? A rechargeable battery can be charged up to 1,000 times and so winds up being cheaper for certain applications.\nThe best-known battery is the AA battery (also known as penlite or mignon battery). It is the typical cylindrical battery found in toys, remote controls, the computer mouse, bike lamps, flashes and compact cameras.\nThe little brother of the AA is the AAA or triple A battery. This pencil battery or microbattery is used in same sorts of applications as its larger variant.\nLastly, in the A series you have the very thin AAAA battery. This is used for very thin applications such as flexible flashlights and in a stylus used to write on a tablet.\nLet's just stay in the “mini-department” of the battery world for a while. The flat button cell also has a thin shape, on which the poles are really close to each other. This battery is ideal for kitchen scales and alarm clocks.\nThe more rectangular 9-volt battery is recognizable from its protruding poles. You can use it in smoke detectors, older remote controls and cordless microphones, among other things.\nBattery packs come in two versions: the “naked” and the “clothed” version. This battery is used mainly in industrial settings. Battery packs with a jacket can be safely collected at school, whereas the ones without a jacket or a damaged jacket cannot.\nA traction battery is used for electric vehicles. You can find them in forklift trucks, pallet trucks and mechanical sweepers.\nThe above is a sampling of the range of batteries based on their format. But as you will suspect, the full list is even longer.\nWould you like to learn about a bunch of other batteries?\nYou can read all about how a battery works in this blog post. There, we learn that a battery must be of a specific composition to be able to give off energy. Here are some of the most common batteries:\nA zinc-carbon cell battery is used primarily for applications that require little energy, such as a clock or remote control. This is a primarybattery.\nAn alkaline battery is also a disposable variant that can be used in toys. This battery provides 3 times more energy than the above-mentioned zinc-carbon cell.\nThe lithium-ion battery is currently the most popular battery: it holds a lot of energy and it is rechargeable. You will find these in your smartphone and laptop, among others.\nFinally, the lead-acid battery is found in the motor of many cars. This battery was invented back in 1859 and was then the first battery that could be recharged.\nWhatever batteries you use, if they are used or can no longer be recharged, you should not let them lie around the house. They contain valuable metals that can be given a new life in countless surprising applications. Moreover, with time they can begin to leak.\nDo you want to make sure you collect your batteries safely?","Batteries are used whenever electrical energy is needed but there is no direct connection to the public electricity grid. A battery can convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy. Depending on the battery system, this converting process is irreversible or reversible. When the process is irreversible, the battery is called a primary battery. The reversible batteries are called secondary batteries and can be recharged up to 1000 cycles(i.e. lead acid battery- checken). A lead acid battery is rechargeable and is commonly used as a result of its good properties like low maintenance and suitable for many purposes. Furthermore they are easily available and are relatively cheap.\nLead-acid batteries either start or power cars, trucks,buses, boats and trains all over the world. This usage is well known but during the last years another usage is increasing. Solar panels are becoming cheaper and an enormous boost is seen in the adaption of solar applications in rural areas in developing countries where no electrical grid is available. As lead acid batteries are still the cheapest way to store energy, almost all these solar applications contain a lead acid battery.\nHowever, lead is a very toxic metal and once the battery is not useful anymore, it is of the utmost importance that proper collection and recycling takes place. In order to effectively understand the issues about lead acid batteries in the solid waste stream and the benefits of diverting them to recycling, it is important to know some technical aspects of the lead acid battery, the public health and environmental risks associated with disposing of them, recycling methods and relevant legislation developed to minimize risks involved with the use and recycling.\nLead Acid Battery cells consist of a lead (Pb) electrode nd a lead oxide (PbO2) electrode immersed in a solution of water and sulphuric acid (H2SO4). When the battery is connected to a load and energy is generated,the lead combines with the sulphuric acid to create lead sulphate (PbSO4), and the lead oxide combines with hydrogen and sulphuric acid to create lead sulphate and water (H2O). As the battery discharges, the lead sulphate builds up on the electrodes, and the water builds up in the sulphuric acid solution.When the battery is charged, the process reverses, with the lead sulphate combining with water to build up lead and lead oxide on the electrodes.\nGenerally there are two types of Lead-acid storage batteries, based on their method ofconstruction: flooded or sealed. Flooded (or wet) lead acid batteries are those where the electrodes/plates are immersed in electrolyte and regular refilling with water is necessary to safeguard proper activity. In a sealed lead acid or valve-regulated Lead acid (VRLA) battery the electrolyte is immobilized. All lead acid batteries produce hydrogen and oxygen gas (gassing) at the electrodes during charging through a process called electrolysis. These gases are allowed to escape a flooded cell, however the sealed cell is constructed so that the gases are contained and recombined.\nThe grid structure in both batteries is made from a lead alloy. A pure lead grid structure is not strong enough and therefore other metals like antimony, calcium, tin, and selenium in small quantities are alloyed for added strength and improved electrical properties.\nThe battery lifetime is defined as the period of time in which a battery is capable of being recharged and retain the charge applied.Once the battery is no longer capable of being recharged or cannot retain its charge properly, its lifetime reaches its end and it becomes a `used battery`for the application it was designed for (UNEP, 2003).\nThe lifetime of a lead acid battery is very dependent on its rate, conditions and kind of use. It is estimated to be between 1 up to 5 years.\nThe typical lead acid battery comprises of: metal grids, electrode paste, Sulphuric acid, connectors and poles of lead alloy, and grid separators made up of PVC (see table 1). The battery components are contained in a corrosion and heat-resistant housing usually composed of plastic (polycarbonate, polypropylene, or polystyrene) Component\nLead (alloy) components (grid, poles)\n25 - 30\nElectrode paste (fine particles of Lead oxide and Lead sulphate)\n35 - 45\nSulphuric acid (10 - 20 % H2SO4)\n10 - 15\n5 - 8\nOther plastics (PVC, PE, etc.)\n4 - 7\n1 - 3\nOthers materials (glass, etc.)\nReturning used lead acid batteries to the recycling loop has along tradition. Thanks to the compactness of the battery, its high lead proportion and relatively high metal prices, it has been worthwhile for consumers to return their own or collected car batteries to the scrap trade or secondary smelters. This is also the case in low-income countries and return rates of up to 80% can be achieved normally through an informal collection system of scrap dealers, secondary lead processors and consumers (Vest, 2002).\nWhy recycle lead acid batteries?\nThe benefits of recycling of lead acid batteries are numerous.Unless we recycle used batteries certain toxic components pose a potential risk to the environment and human health. Moreover recovering scrap batteries has the advantages that it is easier and much less energy intensive than producing new lead from ore (the production of recycled lead requires 35-40% of the energy needed to produce lead from ore.) Recycling also reduces dispersal of lead in the environment and conserves mineral resources for the future when done in a proper way (Thornton, 2001).\nHowever recycling of used lead acid batteries according international guidelines is not a simple process which can be done in small scale enterprises. Certain measures need to be taken to prevent negative impact to people and environment. The processes involved in recycling of used lead acid batteries will be summarized below following the descriptions in the technical guidelines for the Environmentally Sound Management of Waste Lead-acid Batteries (UNEP, 2003).\nUsed acid lead batteries must be collected, transported and stored with proper care, in order to avoid adverse health effects and environmental contamination. Special measures need to be taken at collection points and batteries should NEVER be drained at collection points as no guarantee can be given for safe treatment of the sulphuric acid with all hazards involved with the drainage to health and environment.\nThe recycling technology\nThe recycling process can be divided into three major processes:\n1. Battery breaking\n2. Lead reduction\n3. Lead refining.\nBatteries must always be drained before they enter the recycling process. They should only be drained to a purpose built effluent treatment plant so that the acid can be treated and neutralized. Next the batteries are broken in a hammer mill or another type of crushing machine. Manual battery breaking should be avoided due to the health and safety risks associated with this practice.\nThe pieces from the breaking process are placed in a tank, where the dissimilar densities of the materials cause some to sink (lead), some to float (hard rubber and plastic) and liquids to go into solution (battery acid).From here, the materials are separated and treated individually.\nThe plastic is cleaned and transported to a plastic recycler. The acid is neutralized.\nThe battery scrap obtained from the breaking process is a mixture of several substances: metallic lead, lead oxide, lead sulphate and other metals such as calcium, copper, antimony, arsenic, tin and sometimes silver. In order to isolate the metallic lead from this mixture, these materials are charged into a furnace together with appropriate fluxes & reductants, drosses, returning slags and process dusts for smelting. Off-gases from the smelting furnace are filtered and the dust collected is returned to the furnace. The metal tapped from the kiln is transferred to refining kettles and processed to produce commercial quality lead.\nAs a smelting plant stops at the stage of the reduction plant, it will produce what is known as hard or antimonial lead. If the plant wants to produce soft lead, other metals like copper, antimony, arsenic and tin have to be removed. The refining process is applied in several steps in kettles with addition of specific agents. After this process the soft lead can be poured into moulds called “ingots”. These ingots are sold on the local or international market.\nPollution control measures\nIn the recycling plant, effective control measures need to be implemented, both to protect the health of workers and to prevent pollution of the environment. Good plant design, with reduction of the potential for the emission of contaminating substances, is of utmost importance, and the newer smelting processes are inherently much cleaner than traditional blast furnaces.Pollution abatement technologies, including the treatment of exhaust gases and liquid effluents, need to be installed.\nThose mostly exposed to releases within the plant are the workforce. Control measures such as maintaining minimum standards of air quality within the works, medical surveillance of employees, use of protective equipment, and provision of conditions of good hygiene in general, is necessary to avoid occupational lead exposure.\nHealth and environment\nWhile using the lead acid battery for electricity, hazards exist during refilling of the flooded batteries. Harmful effects can occur during production and after its useful life, during recycling. At the end of its life the battery is classified as a hazardous waste under the Basel Convention and should be handled accordingly in order to prevent damage to human health or to the environment (UNEP, 2003).\nLead is considered as one of the most toxic heavy metals. Its useis restricted and banned in some applications, like gasoline additives and tubes for drinking water (CE, 2000). Today, it is known that exposure to lead can cause adverse effects on many parts of the body. The organs potentially most affected are the brain and nervous system, kidneys, blood, and there productive system of both sexes. Lead in certain forms is also considered a possible carcinogen. Of particular concern is that relatively low levels can affect the developing fetus and young children, impairing their mental development and causing a small but measurable decrease in IQ. However,clinical symptoms are only found in very highly exposed individuals (who are usually exposed at work) and this is now extremely rare in the Western World.\nNext to lead, also emissions of Antimony and Arsenic can take place which both are known as toxic substances. Furthermore Arsenic is known as carcinogenic (CE, 2000). Sulfuric acid is a highly corrosive acid which can destroy tissues of living organisms (UNEP, 2002).\nThe manufacturing as well as the recycling (smelting) of lead acid batteries can have negative impacts on the environment (Avellaneda dela Calle, 2002):\nAir: Emission of lead (and other heavy metals) dust and fumes.\nSoil: Spilling and leaking of acid from the batteries directly to the soil. Leaching\nof acid and lead salt due to improper processing.\nWater: Spilling and leaking of acid to water surfaces.Direct dilution of lead salts in water or through rain water when present in soil.\nThese emissions can pollute the soil and poison the ground water with negative effects on the ecosystems (plants, animals, humans).\nAs used lead acid batteries are regarded as hazardous waste, various laws, decrees and guidelines are developed on international and European level to deal with these materials. For used lead acid batteries often specific legislation is developed in combination with household batteries.\nOn an international level the Basel convention is very important for both used lead acid batteries. Furthermore the Secretariat of the basel Convention has set up guidelines for a safe treatment of used lead acid batteries.\nIn March 1989, the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, was adopted.The treaty entered into force in 1992. Drawing on the principles of environmentally sound management, the convention seeks to protect human health and the environment from the risk posed by hazardous wastes. This will require changing the economic equation for wastes in order to motivate the producers of hazardous wastes and people who benefit from the associated goods to take action. To do this, the convention sets out a three step strategy (UNEP 2002):\n1. Minimizing the generation of wastes.\n2. Treating wastes as near as possible to where they were generated.\n3. Minimizing international movements of hazardous wastes.\nThe aim is to cut the amount of hazardous substances - in particular, mercury, cadmium and lead - dumped in the environment; this should be done by reducing the use of these substances in batteries and accumulators and by treating and re-using the amounts that are used.\nRecycling of lead acid batteries is not a simple activity which can be done in small enterprises. Constructing,commissioning and operating a modern environmentally sound recycling plant is a very expensive undertaking. Not only does the initial capital investment run into many millions of dollars, but there is an ongoing, and essential, cost over head to cover environmental and hygiene control systems. Any modern recycling plant must have a constant and high throughput of used lead acid batteries. Local governments should focus on an environmentally safe collection of used lead acid batteries and delivery to an environmentally sound smelter,even if this means that used batteries have to be exported to achieve this goal."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e452545b-819f-4495-b236-0ac2133f5e3f>","<urn:uuid:17b3e75e-fda7-403c-9b8f-08727f682e70>"],"error":null}

These two types of memory have different speeds and can affect the overall performance of a computer. In this article, we will explore the differences between DDR4 2666 and DDR4 3200 and which one would be a better choice for your needs.\nDDR4 2666 vs DDR4 3200: What’s the difference?\nThe key difference between DDR4 2666 and DDR4 3200 is their clock speeds. DDR4 2666 has a clock speed of 2666MHz, while DDR4 3200 has a clock speed of 3200MHz. Clock speed refers to the speed at which data is transferred from the computer to the memory and back.\nAnother difference between the two types of memory is the timings. DDR4 3200 has tighter timings than DDR4 2666, which means that it can move data more quickly. Tighter timings generally translate to better performance, especially in applications that require a lot of memory access, such as gaming and video editing.\nApart from the above, DDR4 3200 also facilitates overclocking of the memory which enables to achieve even faster speeds than the native 3200MHz as compared to DDR4 2666.\nDDR4 2666 vs DDR4 3200: Which is better for gaming?\nWhen it comes to gaming, faster clock speeds and tighter timings can lead to better performance. In general, DDR4 3200 is better for gaming than DDR4 2666. This is because it can move data more quickly, which results in faster load times and smoother gameplay.\nFor gamers who are looking to build a high-performance system to play the latest games, DDR4 3200 would be the better choice. However, for gamers who are on a budget, DDR4 2666 could be a good option.\nDDR4 2666 vs DDR4 3200: Which is better for video editing?\nVideo editing is another task that requires a lot of memory access. When it comes to video editing, DDR4 3200 is generally better than DDR4 2666. This is because tighter timings can result in faster rendering times and shorter import/export times.\nFor professional video editors who work with high-resolution footage, DDR4 3200 would be the better choice. However, for casual video editors, DDR4 2666 would be sufficient.\nDDR4 2666 vs DDR4 3200: Which is better for everyday use?\nFor everyday use, the difference between DDR4 2666 and DDR4 3200 may not be noticeable. Both types of memory provide fast and reliable performance, so the choice comes down to personal preference and budget.\nIf you use your computer for browsing the web, streaming videos, and other basic tasks, DDR4 2666 would be sufficient. However, if you use your computer for more demanding tasks, DDR4 3200 could provide a noticeable performance boost.\nIn conclusion, DDR4 2666 and DDR4 3200 have different clock speeds and timings that can affect the overall performance of a computer. DDR4 3200 is generally better for tasks that require a lot of memory access, such as gaming and video editing. However, for everyday use, DDR4 2666 would be sufficient. The choice between the two comes down to personal preference and budget.\nKeywords: DDR4, DDR4 2666, DDR4 3200, clock speeds, timings, gaming, video editing, performance, everyday use, budget."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2bf0a986-ff63-4feb-8343-a40990daefdb>","<urn:uuid:aa6d9f87-3d88-4c98-b854-f919b005b331>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to reach the Soconusco region following natural landmarks?","answer":"The Soconusco region can be reached by following these natural boundaries: It is located between the Pacific Ocean (to the southwest) and the Sierra Madre mountains (to the northeast). The region is bounded by two large estuary-lagoon systems: the Cantileña and Guamuchal Manchon swamps. The area is approximately 60 km long and 30 to 40 km wide, containing the greatest concentration of fertile land on the Pacific coast of Mexico and Guatemala.","context":["Soconusco Archaeological Project\nRobert M. Rosenswig, Principal Investigator\nThe Soconusco is the name given to the coastal plain and piedmont between the Pacific Ocean and the Sierra Madre mountains of southeast Chiapas and an adjacent section of Guatemala. The focus of this paper is the southeastern half of the Soconusco that is approximately 60 km long and 30 to 40 km wide. This region is defined on all sides by geographic barriers. To the southwest is the Pacific Ocean, to the northeast are the Sierra Madre Mountains and to both the northwest and the southeast are two large estuary-lagoon systems: the Cantileña and Guamuchal Manchon swamps (see Voorhies 2004: 6-13, 20-21). The relatively small area between the two swamp systems contain the greatest concentration of fertile land on the Pacific coast of Mexico and Guatemala and today is used to grow a variety of fruit crops. The area to the northwest contains poor gravelly soils with lower rainfall and is less productive agricultural lands (Lowe 1977: 202). In fact, the area between Pijijiapán and Tonalá was called the despoblado del Soconusco in colonial times due to its extremely low population (Orellana 1995: 11). Today the area is still sparsely populated and used mainly to graze cattle. To the southeast of the land between these swamps, the coastal plain becomes wider and the piedmont is further from the ocean. In this region, there are no swamp systems and the soils contain so much clay that maize is still not grown today (Neff et al. 2006: 397). It is thus not surprising that a disproportionate quantity of significant developments on the Pacific coast of Mesoamerica transpired in the southeast part of the Soconusco between these two large swamp systems (see Rosenswig in press).\nFour major rivers transect the land between these two swamps. From north to south these rivers are the Coatán, the Cahuacán, the Suchiate, and the Naranjo. These rivers originate on the piedmont and drain the watersheds of the Tacaná and Tajamulco volcanoes. A number of smaller streams originate on the coastal plain and form a series of mangrove estuary systems parallel to the ocean where water flow is insufficient to break through the barrier beaches. These rivers create a dynamic set of microenvironments. There are a number of detailed descriptions of the Soconusco environment (Coe and Flannery 1967: 9-15; Lowe et al. 1982: 55-62).\nCuauhtémoc Zone Survey and Excavations\nNo previous work has been published from the Cuauhtémoc zone of the Soconusco. Philip Drucker (1948) passed through this area and conducted some of the first reconnaissance in the area. From 1963 to 1974, Carlos Navarette conducted reconnaissance in this part of the Soconusco and the Early Formative sites of Capulin and Dorado are shown on New World Archaeological Foundation publications (e.g., Lowe 1975: fig. 1). In addition, employees of Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Antropología y Historia (INAH) national registry of sites revisited sites reported by Navarette and carried out survey in the estuary region between Puerto Madero and the Suchiate River (Clark 1994: 95). No excavations were carried out at any sites in the region, nor were sites encountered during reconnaissance published.\nThe site of Cuauhtémoc had long been known by Antonio Arazate (of the Museo Regional del Soconusco in Tapachula) and visited by John Clark and Michael Blake in the 1980s. In 1996, the site was trenched to begin cultivating bananas. This disturbance revealed layers of artifact rich middens and numerous burials. The site’s 5 m high central mound was leveled at this time. That year, Alejandro Tovalín of the Centro Regional INAH, Chiapas spent two weeks excavating four test pits in the site. John Clark also visited the newly disturbed site at that time, made surface collections and drew a number of sketch maps of artifact distribution. Clark documented occupations dating to many Early Formative phases and numerous surface remains from the early Middle Formative Conchas phase. Based on this information, and at the suggestion of Clark, I selected the Cuauhtémoc site and surrounding area for research (Rosenswig 2005).\nCuauhtémoc was systematically surface-collected in 2001 to test the survey methodology and a 220 m section of one of the deep drainage canals that cut through the site was profiled. In 2002 and 2003, excavations documented how the site was built on a raised sand levee that would have kept inhabitants above the level of the seasonal flooding. This desirable location would have originally attracted people to settle at the site during the Barra phase. The Cuauhtémoc site was occupied until the end of the Conchas phase and never reoccupied. In 2002, two months of systematic surface survey was carried out in the area around Cuauhtémoc.\nIn order to provide a more complete settlement history of the area, an expanded program of survey in the Cuauhtémoc zone will undertaken beyond the coastal plain. More of the coastal plain will be surveyed in the manner discussed above to increase the 28 sq m coverage. Second, the estuary swamp system between the Suchiate and Cahuacán Rivers will be surveyed The low hills behind the costal plain, that begins 14 km from the Pacific Ocean, form the fourth environmental land-use zone planned for surveyed. In this zone, a large number of late Middle Formative and Late Formative sites and a large Late Postclassic period site have been documented in unsystematic reconnaissance. Systematic survey will be undertaken here without the sub-surface exposure provided by trenching that has occurred on the coastal plain. The piedmont, which has been heavily impacted by modern development, is the fifth zone where survey is planned.

{"question":"How do climbing houseplants differ in their growth patterns, and what safety considerations should pet owners keep in mind when selecting them?","answer":"Climbing houseplants show various growth patterns - some like philodendrons can be climbers with long internodes requiring support, creepers that grow along soil, or tree-like forms with thick trunks. However, when it comes to pet safety, many common climbing plants pose risks - philodendrons can cause oral irritation and difficulty swallowing, while ivy varieties can lead to mouth and stomach irritation, excessive drooling, and swelling. Pet owners should instead consider safe alternatives like the Boston Fern or Spider Plant, which offer similar vertical growth potential without toxic effects.","context":["Climb, creep or stand?\nPhilodendron is one of the largest genera in the family Araceae, a family which includes many of the world's favorite house or indoor plants. While one of the most common of the Philodendron species is the little vining one with the heart-shaped leaves, the genus is actually a large group of plants ranging from relatively small jewels to practically tree-sized monsters living in the tropical rain forest environment. Grown mainly for their foliage, many of these plants have proven to be durable under indoor conditions and as such have earned their place on the list of favorite house plants.\nPhilodendron plants can be grouped loosely into several types, based on the way that they grow. The ones that have the longest internodes, or sections of stem between leaves, are the climbers, and require some kind of totem or other support on which they can climb. These are propagated easily by cuttings including several nodes of the long stems. Another type is the creepers, which do not climb but rather grow along the surface of the soil. Their internodes are much shorter than those of the climbers and while they do not require anything to support vertical growth, they do require enough growing space to creep around in. The plant in the thumbnail picture above, right, Philodendron gloriosum, is an example of the creeper type. Thirdly comes the \"tree\" Philodendron, so named not because they climb, but because they have thick trunks and grow upright in a tree-like form.\nAnd Everything in Between?\nThe three types I mentioned above are not totally exclusive, as intermediate types are found. For example, I know of at least one Philodendron that creeps until it reaches an upright surface, after which it begins to climb. Others have such short internodes that they are called \"self-headers\" because they tend to form a rosette of leaves. Some of the \"tree\" types will grow upright, but if near a tree or even a stalk of bamboo, their roots will stretch out and encircle it like a prehensile tail. One species I have, Philodendron mello-barretoanum, even uses some roots as tensioned guy wires to support the very heavy trunk. Stems can be smooth, green or colored, spotted, fuzzy or even thorny. And then you have the numerous hybrids that combine characteristics from several of the types into one plant!\nLeaf shapes and sizes are amazingly varied, ranging from simple green heart or lance-shaped leaves to gigantic twice or thrice pinnate ones. Color is present on some, ranging from dark, almost black, red to pink, orange, chartreuse, and different splotchy types of variegation. Veins can be white, silvery or green, and petioles can come in a variety of colors as well. Although most people that grow these plants do not grow them in expectation of blooms, some species can produce spectacular red, white, creamy or pink inflorescences in amongst the rich tropical foliage. The photo above, left is a bloom found on Philodendron pinnatifidum (a self-header) and the photo at right is from Philodendron callosum (a creeper). Both are plants I have been growing for years. When growing Philodendron under indoor conditions, blooming is much less likely, but if you have a greenhouse or can grow these in the ground outdoors, you can be surprised to see the blooms on occasion.\nAll in all, this genus of plants is wonderfully diverse and a valuable addition to any home decor, greenhouse, or garden where they can be grown outdoors. In future articles I will spotlight a few of the species you are likely to have the opportunity to obtain and grow.\nImage Credit: LariAnn Garner","House plants not only dress up your home, adding a little outside in, they also help to purify the air – which is great for the whole family, 2 and 4-legged. The thing is, while some might look beautiful, not all of those beauties are pet safe house plants. In fact, many of them can be harmful to our furry friends.\nSo, is there a way to get the beauty without the risk? Of course. There are plenty of pet safe house plants that you don’t have to worry about keeping with animals in the house.\nAnd – we mentioned NASA in the title. Well, a few years ago, NASA did a clean air study looking at the best air purifying plants out there. We’ll be sure to note the ones NASA approved!\nPet Safe House Plants\nPick 1, pick 5 – pick them all! We could all use a little more nature inside!\n1. Boston Fern – This lush, leafy green is perfect for any room. Ferns like indirect light, evenly moist soil, and high humidity. Just remember – not all ferns are safe. Other ferns, like the maidenhead fern, are ok, but imposters like the asparagus fern (actually part of the lily family) are no good! NASA APPROVED\n2. African Violet – With its purple and pink hues, the African violet is beautiful with the added bonus of being low maintenance! It thrives without bright light and some moist soil.\n3. Baby Rubber Plant – Shiny and compact, the a baby rubber plant is a great pet-friendly option. It thrives in indirect sunlight and needs only minimal watering. Note: Just be careful – some rubber tree plants (such as Japanese/Chinese/jade rubber plant and Indian rubber plant) are toxic to cats and dogs. NASA APPROVED\n4. Prayer Plant – This striped leafy green is perfect for small spaces like bookshelves and end tables. Its red, cream, and green leaves curl up at night, giving it its name. It’s also really easy to take care of, growing best in medium or low light, and you can even let the soil dry out a bit between waterings.\n5. Areca Palm – This is NASA’s top pick for air purification. Not only does it filter xylene and formaldehyde out of the air, it also acts as a really powerful natural humidifier. Take good care of these plants; water them regularly and repot every few years to give them fresh soil. Keep in mind, these plants can grow quite large, so you probably won’t be able to keep them on a table or countertop for very long. NASA APPROVED\n6. Parlour Palm – Want to add something with a bit of height? The parlous palm is low-maintenance (Yay!) – it grows best in bright, indirect light, but also tolerates low light. It can get as tall as 8 feet, but 4 feet is more the norm. NASA APPROVED\n7. Spider Plant – Don’t let the name scare you; these lush green plants are lovely to look at. And as far as air purification, they pack a powerful punch against formaldehyde and xylene. They’re well known as easy-to-care-for plants. They need a little water, some indirect sunlight, and some well-drained soil. NASA APPROVED\n8. Cast Iron Plant – All known as the barrow plant, this hardy and nice to look at. It doesn’t mind low light, humidity, irregular watering, and even fluctuations in temperature.\n9. Haworthia – This one looks sort of like an aloe vera plant, but without the risks that may come with aloe. Plus, it’s a succulent, so it’s relatively easy to maintain. And its small size makes it the perfect countertop addition.\n10. Gerber Daisy – If you’re looking to add a little color, the daisy is an easy flower to go with. It needs some sunlight, moderate temps, and moist soil, and the flowers will bloom for up to 6 weeks. NASA APPROVED\n11. Friendship Plant – Named because it’s easy to split and share, the friendship plant tolerates medium and low light, loves humidity, and usually doesn’t grow taller than 12 inches. If you’re a fan of terrariums, this is a good go-to.\n12. Money Tree – A common housewarming gift, this plant is said to bring luck and fortune to the owner. But it also brings powerful air purifying qualities. Keep this little tree to clear out benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene.\nHouse Plants to Avoid\nIf there are pet safe house plants, that has to mean there are ones that are not safe, right?\nUnfortunately, not all plants we’d like to bring inside are great for our animals. These are some of the most common house plants that can be toxic to our pets:\n- Lilies – including the peace lily, calla lily, Easter lily and tiger lily, are highly toxic and potentially fatal to cats. Some types are also toxic to dogs. These bad boys are seriously bad: vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, stomach pain, depression, difficulty swallowing, kidney damage, kidney failure, and multiple organ failure are all possible results.\n- Ivy – inside or out, many popular ivy plants, including English ivy and Devil’s ivy/Golden Pothos, have moderate toxicity to pets. With ivy, watch out for mouth and stomach irritation, excessive drooling or foaming at the mouth, swelling of the mouth, tongue and lips, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n- Philodendrons – these popular houseplants may look great, but they can be toxic, causing oral irritation, pain and swelling of the mouth, vomiting, or even difficulty swallowing.\n- Elephant Ear – recognizable by its large, broad leaves, this plant’s harmful toxins can result in burning/swelling of the mouth and tongue as well as difficulty in swallowing, vomiting, and increased drooling. In some cases it can cause breathing difficulties and even death.\nStick to the approved list, and to be extra safe, try to keep pets away from house plants, even if they’re considered safe.\nThe Veterinarious team is made up of pet owners, pet lovers, and pet experts from around the globe!

{"question":"Do both autism and schizophrenia involve changes in visual processing in the brain?","answer":"Yes, but in different ways. In autism, brain areas normally associated with visual tasks become active during language-related tasks, showing an increased reliance on visual thinking and processing. For schizophrenia, while visual processing differences are not explicitly discussed, the condition involves structural changes in temporal lobes and reduced gray matter in regions like the superior temporal gyrus, which can affect various types of sensory processing including visual information.","context":["|Researchers Gain Insight Into Why Brain Areas Fail To Work\nTogether in Autism\nBasis For Why People With Autism Think In Pictures\nResearchers have found in two studies that autism may involve a lack of connections\nand coordination in separate areas of the brain.\nIn people with autism, the brain areas that perform complex analysis appear\nless likely to work together during problem solving tasks than in people who\ndo not have the disorder, report researchers working in a network funded by the\nNational Institutes of Health. The researchers found that communications between\nthese higher-order centers in the brains of people with autism appear to be directly\nrelated to the thickness of the anatomical connections between them.\nIn a separate report, the same research team found that, in people with autism,\nbrain areas normally associated with visual tasks also appear to be active during\nlanguage-related tasks, providing evidence to explain a bias towards visual thinking\ncommon in autism.\n“These findings provide support to a new theory that views autism as a failure\nof brain regions to communicate with each other,” said Duane Alexander, M.D.,\nDirector of NIH’s National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. “The\nfindings may one day provide the basis for improved treatments for autism that\nstimulate communication between brain areas.”\nThe studies and the theory are the work of Marcel Just, Ph.D., D.O. Hebb Professor\nof Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and\nNancy Minshew, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology at the University\nof Pittsburgh School of Medicine and their colleagues.\nThe research was conducted by the Collaborative Program of Excellence in Autism,\na research network funded by the NICHD and the National Institute on Deafness\nand Other Communication Disorders.\nPeople with autism often have difficulty communicating and interacting socially\nwith other people. The saying \"unable to see the forest for the trees\" describes\nhow people with autism frequently excel at details, yet struggle to comprehend\nthe larger picture. For example, some children with autism may become spelling\nbee champions, but have difficulty understanding the meaning of a sentence or\nAn earlier finding by these researchers described how a group of people with\nautism tended to use parts of the brain typically associated with processing\nshapes to remember letters of the alphabet. A news release detailing that finding\nappears at http://www.nichd.nih.gov/new/releases/final_autism.cfm.\nParticipants with autism in both current studies had normal I.Q. There were\nno significant differences between the participants with and without autism in\nage or I.Q.\nThe first of the two new studies recently was published online in the journal\nCerebral Cortex. In that study, the researchers used a brain imaging technique\nknown as functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, to view the brains of\npeople with autism as well as a comparison group of people who do not have autism.\nAll of the study participants were asked to complete the Tower of London test.\nThe task involves moving three balls into a specified arrangement in an array\nof three receptacles. The Tower of London is used to gauge the functioning of\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nThis brain area, located in the front, upper part of the brain, deals with\nstrategic planning and problem-solving. The prefrontal cortex is the executive\narea of the brain, in which decision making, judgment, and impulse control reside.\nA little further back is the parietal cortex, which controls high-level visual\nthinking and visual imagery, supporting the visual aspects of the problem-solving.\nBoth the prefrontal and parietal cortex play a critical part in performing the\nTower of London test.\nIn the normal participants, the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex tended\nto function in synchrony (increasing and decreasing their activity at the same\ntime) while solving the Tower of London task. This suggests that the two brain\nareas were working together to solve the problem.\nIn the participants with autism, however, the two brain areas, prefrontal and\nparietal, were less likely to function in synchrony while working on the task.\nThe researchers made another discovery, for the first time finding a relationship\nbetween this lower level of synchrony and the properties of some of the neurological “cables” or\nwhite matter fiber tracts that connect brain areas.\nWhite matter consists of fibers that, like cabling, connect brain areas. The\nlargest of the white matter tracts is known as the corpus callosum, which allows\ncommunication between the two hemispheres (halves) of the brain.\n“The size of the corpus callosum was smaller in the group with autism, suggesting\nthat inter-regional brain cabling is disrupted in autism,” Dr. Just said.\nIn essence, the extent to which the two key brain areas (prefrontal and parietal)\nof the autistic participants worked in synchrony was correlated with the size\nof the corpus callosum. The smaller the corpus callosum, the less likely the\ntwo areas were to function in synchrony. In the normal participants, however,\nthe size of the corpus callosum did not appear to be correlated with the ability\nof the two areas to work in synchrony.\n“This finding provides strong evidence that autism is a disorder involving\nthe biological connections and the coordination of processing between brain areas,” Dr.\nHe added, however, that the thickness, or extent, of connections between brain\nareas may not be the basis for the disorder. Although the neurological connections\nbetween the prefrontal cortex appear to be reduced in autism, the brains of people\nwith autism have thicker connections between certain brain regions within each\n“At this point, we can say that autism appears to be a disorder of abnormal\nneurological and informational connections of the brain, but we can’t yet explain\nthe nature of that abnormality,” Dr. Just said.\nIn the second study, published online in the journal Brain, the researchers\nexamined the extent to which brain areas involved in language interact with brain\nregions that process images. Dr. Just explained that earlier studies, as well\nas anecdotal accounts, suggest that people with autism rely more heavily on visual\nand spatial areas of the brain than do other people.\nIn this study, the researchers used fMRI to examine brain functioning in participants\nwith autism and in normal participants during a true-false test involving reading\nsentences with low imagery content and high imagery content. A typical low imagery\nsentence consisted of constructions like “Addition, subtraction, and multiplication\nare all math skills.” A high imagery sentence, “The number eight when rotated\n90 degrees looks like a pair of eyeglasses,” would first activate left prefrontal\nbrain areas involved with language, and then would involve parietal areas dealing\nwith vision and imagery as the study participant mentally manipulated the number\nAs the researchers expected, the visual brain areas of the normal participants\nwere active only when evaluating sentences with imagery content. In contrast,\nthe visual centers in the brains of participants with autism were active when\nevaluating both high imagery and low imagery sentences.\n“The heavy reliance on visualization in people with autism may be an adaptation\nto compensate for a diminished ability to call on prefrontal regions of the brain,” Dr.\nThe second study also confirmed the observations in the first study — that the\nprefrontal and parietal brain regions of the cortex in people with autism were\nless likely to work in synchrony than were the brains of normal volunteers. The\nsecond study also confirmed that the extent to which the two parts of the cortex\ncould work together was correlated with the size of the corpus callosum that\nDr. Just and his colleagues are conducting additional studies to ascertain\nthe nature of the abnormality of the connections in the brains of people with\nThe NICHD sponsors research on development, before and after birth; maternal,\nchild, and family health; reproductive biology and population issues; and medical\nrehabilitation.

Although an exact cause of the disease has not yet been discovered, researchers are aware that a number of factors may contribute to its development. Genetics, environment, brain structure, and brain chemistry can each be analyzed and broken down separately.\nWhat Causes Schizophrenia?\nThere are a number of possible causes, but scientists have not been able to pinpoint an “exact” cause. There may be a number of contributing factors that play role in the development of this debilitating disorder. These contributing factors include: genetics, environment, brain chemistry, and brain structure.\nAlthough scientists have associated specific things as being linked to schizophrenia, the causes remain a mystery. As research advances and we look at this disease from all angles, it is hoped that better treatment options and ultimately cure will be discovered.\nThe fact is that if a person has one or more parents with schizophrenia, the likelihood of that individual developing schizophrenia increases drastically. When looking at severe disorders like schizophrenia, there is typically a strong genetic link.\n- 10% risk – If you have a first-degree relative with the disease.\n- 40% risk – If you have an identical twin with the disease.\nNote: 60% of individuals that develop schizophrenia have no close relative with the illness.\nThis risk is lower than I would’ve suspected. I find that 10% risk is pretty low for having a first degree relative with the disease; my estimations would’ve been greater.\nIn regards to a genetic link to schizophrenia, it is nearly impossible to pin down an exact DNA sequence or gene for causing the disease. There are certain mutations and genes that we know are implicated. Scientists have developed hypotheses linking variations such as the:\n- Histone H3\n- Zinc finger protein 804A\nInterestingly enough, there appears to be an overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I’m a huge advocate for genetic research because I believe that if we are going to get serious about curing this disease, we are going to need to permanently normalize / fix the genetics that are causing the symptoms.\nGeneticists and researchers have questioned how schizophrenia developed and evolved in the first place. Some think that as language continued to evolve, certain genes also evolved and individuals actually started hearing voices. Obviously this is a maladaptive evolution in the eyes of many – including those coping with the disease.\nAs you should know, genetics are only part of the equation. If a person grows up in impoverished living conditions, the likelihood of mental health problems increases. In my mind, genetics are the trickiest and single most influential factor in diseases like schizophrenia. Although environment should still be analyzed, I feel as though if you have favorable genetics, the likelihood of developing this disease drops drastically.\nKey environmental factors in schizophrenia\n- Parenting styles: No major link\nParenting styles have been analyzed in individuals with schizophrenia and they had no major influence on the development of this disease. Individuals with supportive parents generally cope better with their disease in comparison to those with neglectful or hostile parents. Similar findings have been made in an array of mental illnesses.\n- Urban environment: Increased risk (2x)\nGrowing up as a child in an urban environment has a significant link between increasing risk of schizophrenia by 2x. I’m wondering if this could be as a result of the increased stress associated with urban living in comparison to a more relaxed suburban or rural lifestyle. Maybe the stress activates or deactivates certain genes which would otherwise be dormant in adult life? I can only hypothesize.\n- Drug abuse: Possible increased risk\nThe drug that is most linked to increased risk of schizophrenia is cannabis (marijuana). There is evidence that use of marijuana contributes to earlier onset of the disease in those that are susceptible. Some argue that it there is actually a causal link between cannabis and schizophrenia. For further reading, check out the article “Can Smoking Marijuana Cause Schizophrenia?”\nAmphetamines and uppers like cocaine that release high amounts of dopamine into the brain can trigger a psychotic episode – but this is not the same thing as schizophrenia. This is called amphetamine induced psychosis – and is similar, but will eventually subside when the individual goes through a full blown amphetamine withdrawal. Perhaps the most interesting fact is that individuals with schizophrenia tend to use nicotine at significantly greater rates than the general population. Many famous people with schizophrenia have a history of drug abuse prior to onset of the illness.\n- Social isolation: May increase risk\nOne factor that has been investigated regarding schizophrenia is that of “social isolation.” Researchers have wondered whether the isolation can be a direct contributing cause of the disease developing or whether it is merely a side effect of the disease. There’s a chicken vs. egg type argument here in regards to social isolation and schizophrenia.\n- Infection in womb: Increased risk\nMothers that are infected with viruses in the womb may put their offspring at greater risk for development of schizophrenia. Thus far scientists have discovered that in 30% of people with acute schizophrenia, a virus in the HERV-W retrovirus family was found.\n- Birth Season (Winter / Spring): Increased risk\nThere is an increased risk of 5% to 8% of developing schizophrenia as a baby born in a winter or spring season in the northern hemisphere. Some hypothesize this may be due to the likelihood of developing a virus in utero increases during these times of the year.\n- Big families: Slightly increased risk\nIn bigger families that have short gaps between births of their children (<2 years), there seems to be slightly greater risk of developing infections, which could lead to the development of schizophrenia.\n- Parasite: Possible increased risk\nCertain studies have linked toxoplasmosis to schizophrenia. The interesting aspect of this is the fact that this parasite can go undetected in the nervous system for years. This parasite is primarily transferred to humans by cats. It can take many years for its effects to fully reach the brain.\n- Other factors: May increase risk\nSeveral other factors including: immigration, viruses, malnutrition, hypoxia, racial discrimination, familial dysfunction, unemployment, poor housing conditions, and high amounts of stressors have all been hypothesized to be contributing factors.\n3. Brain chemistry\nDifferences in brain chemistry have been studied comparing those affected with schizophrenia to normal test subjects. In most studies comparing those with schizophrenia to those without, fMRI and PET were used to compare brains.\nDopamine hypothesis – This suggests that psychosis is a result of dopaminergic neurons that are misfiring or dysfunctional. This is one of the most popular hypotheses in regards to brain chemistry causing schizophrenia. Generally it is widely accepted that an overload of dopamine is what causes positive symptoms such as: hallucinations and delusions.\nGlutamate – Significantly low amounts of glutamate receptors (NMDA receptors) have been found in those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Due to the fact that an array of cognitive problems are linked to reductions in glutamate function, many have suggested these receptors may play an important role in the condition.\nLack of hemispheric synchrony – There is some evidence that points to the fact that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are unable to communicate with each other for the transfer of information and general functioning.\nNeural circuitry – Is altered in those with schizophrenia – particularly in the mesolimbic pathway. Most think that excess activation of the D2 receptors lead to causing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. PET scans have provided evidence supporting overactivation of the D2 receptors.\n4. Brain structure\nAltered brain connectivity – Individuals with this disease experience altered brain connectivity compared to normal subjects. The dysfunctional interaction between brain regions has been proposed to be a central feature of the illness.\nAmygdala & limbic dysfunction – Deficits in amygdala reactivity and connectivity between amygdala and subgenual cingulated have also been implicated.\n- Frontal lobes\n- Temporal lobes\nNote: Most differences in people with schizophrenia tend to have significant functioning differences in the frontal lobes, hippocampus, as well as temporal lobe regions of the brain.\nBrain volume – Those with schizophrenia tend to have significant reductions in overall brain volume. In fact, they tend to be even more severe than individuals affected with Alzehimer’s disease in the frontal cortex and temporal lobes. Studies have been done comparing the brains of identical twins – one with schizophrenia and the other disease free. These comparisons have been able to show that smaller brain volume is a factor in those with schizophrenia. This smaller volume reduces ability to think, memorize, and concentrate on tasks.\nGray matter – Decreased gray matter has been found in several brain regions of those with this illness including: middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulated. Interestingly enough is the fact that there is a negative correlation between positive symptoms and gray matter volume.\nWhite matter – Reduced amounts of white matter have been discovered in brain regions of those with schizophrenia compared to others.

For example, when analyzing a ball's motion, derivatives can determine exact speeds at any moment - the first derivative gives velocity and the second derivative gives acceleration. For ocean temperatures, data from 65 marine ecosystems shows increasing heat extremes, with an average of 12 ecosystems experiencing unexpected warming events annually in recent years, up from an expected 6-7. These temperature changes severely impact marine life - even a 0.5°C rise can cause coral death, not just bleaching, leading to rapid erosion of the coral skeleton by algae and bacteria.","context":["Infinitesimal Calculus 2: The Changes in Change\nThe mathematics of change are quite interesting. In a naive sense, we can often describe a change by a simple collection of data points. For example, let’s think about a little boy rolling a ball across the floor. The boy pushes the ball, and four seconds later, the ball has come to be 2 meters away from him. Given these data points, we may attempt to connect them in some meaningful analytical manner– perhaps by saying that the ball rolled at a speed of half a meter per second. But even this is a somewhat naive bit of information, as it only really tells us something about the completed journey. Mathematicians are greedy, however; they want to be able to know about every point of the ball’s travel, at any arbitrary moment in time.\nWe can use a function for just such a purpose. A function is a specific mathematical tool which allows us to describe an entire set of data points all at once which we symbolize as (read “ of “). We encode the data by means of a mathematical formula. For example, our exemplary rolling ball might well have been encoded by the function , where the represents the time, in seconds, that the ball has been rolling, and the value of the function, tells us the distance in meters which the ball has traveled in that time. In this particular function, the coefficient of tells us the rate at which distance changes as time passes– that is, a meter per second. When the boy first rolls it, the ball is traveling at a meter per second; when it finishes it had been traveling at a meter per second; and at any single point during the journey the ball is traveling at a meter per second.\nHowever, this is a very simple example. It describes a situation involving a constant velocity. Things become a bit more muddied when the rate at which a change occurs is, itself, changing.\nOur example above describes a linear function. Linear functions are so named because they can be graphed on a Cartesian plane to form a straight line. The equation for a linear function is of the form , where represents the y-intercept (the point at which the line crosses over the y-axis of the plane) and where represents the slope of the line (the rate of change for the function). Utilizing the function from our example, , we have a slope of , an intercept of 0, and we can produce the following graph:\nIt’s very easy to see, intuitively, that this line’s slope, or rate of change, is constant throughout the whole function. We don’t even need to see the equation which generated this graph to see that this is the case, if we presume that the line on the graph is actually as straight as it appears. That very straightness is precisely what we mean by a constant rate of change. As such, it is perfectly clear that the graph has the same slope at as it does at or or . Regardless of how far along the graph we look, it will always have the same rate of change.\nHowever, this is not true of all graphs. When a function ceases to be linear, the rate of change of that function ceases to be constant. Take, for example, the following graph of the function :\nLet’s pretend that, instead of rolling the ball across a flat floor, the little boy has instead set the ball atop a ramp and let go. The ball starts moving slowly, but builds up more and more speed as it moves farther and farther from the boy. After four seconds, the ball is two meters away from the boy– just as in our first example– which means that the ball still traveled a meter per second, overall. However, it seems entirely clear that the ball was not moving at that speed at every single moment in the journey, the way it had when the boy rolled it across the floor. At the start of its roll, the ball is moving much slower than a meter per second, while at the end it is moving much faster than a meter per second.\nThis introduces a very interesting, and very important, question: how can we tell what the rate of change is at any given point? What is the instantaneous rate of change?\nFor example, let’s say I want to know how fast the ball is moving precisely 3 seconds after the boy has set it rolling. A person might think that they can simply determine how far the ball has gone in that time– meters– and then divide that distance by the time– 3 seconds– to conclude that the ball is traveling at of a meter per second. However, this has the same problem as the whole 4 second journey: the ball seems to be traveling slower than of a meter per second at the start and faster than of a meter per second toward the end.\nOne way in which we know this fact is by looking at how far the ball travels between the second and third seconds of its journey. So, after two seconds, the ball is a meter from its starting point. After three seconds, it is of a meter from the starting point. This indicates that the ball traveled of a meter in one second. But this, again, falls prey to the same problem we’ve been having: the ball seems to be moving more slowly than of a meter per second at the 2 second mark and more swiftly at the 3 second mark. We’re closer to the speed of the ball at 3 seconds than we were before, but we still haven’t determined it, quite yet.\nWe can continue to take smaller intervals of time in order to find better and better approximations of the speed of the ball at the 3 second mark. For example, using the distance the ball moves between the 2.5 second and 3 second marks, or the 2.75 second and 3 second marks, or the 2.99999999998 second and 3 second marks. We can come really, really close to the answer we’re trying to find by doing this, but we don’t end up with the exact answer– and mathematicians are not happy to settle for an inexact answer.\nLet’s think about what we are doing in these approximations.\nIf the ball had traveled at a constant speed from the start, at time 0, to the 3 second mark, then its journey could be represented with line . The slope of this line is — which is the approximate speed we determined when considering the ball over this period. Similarly, the line has a slope of , our approximation from the 2 second mark to the 3 second mark. If we were to calculate the slope of , our approximation would get even better. Visually, in the graph above, we can see that the linear graphs are getting closer and closer to the parabolic graph– but there’s always some tiny bit of space between the two.\nAlgebraically speaking, what are we doing in these approximations? How can we translate this problem into our mathematical language?\nWell, we are taking the distance which the ball has traveled after 3 seconds– which, in our math language, is — and we are subtracting the distance which the ball had traveled at an earlier time– say, or or — to find the distance which the ball has traveled between those two times. We are then dividing this distance by the amount of time which has elapsed between the two points: seconds or second or seconds.\nNow let’s try to generalize this. We have our function, . We are looking at the difference between the value of the function at some point, , and the value of the function at some subsequent point, ; we are then dividing that difference by the difference in our two points, — which is just . So, this leads us to the expression .\nAs we have seen, the smaller the gap between our two -values, the closer our approximation becomes. Naturally, we might then think that we can find an exact solution to our problem if we just remove the gap, entirely– that is to say, what happens if we set equal to zero in the expression that we found, above? However, we very quickly come to a problem if we do that. Evaluating the expression, we’ll see that . This is certainly problematic– any middle school child should be able to point out that we simply cannot evaluate that .\nBut what if we had some number which wasn’t zero, and yet that number was infinitely close to ? In such a case, we could reasonably assume that our answer is infinitely close to being correct.\nThankfully, in the first part of this series, we learned that we do have such numbers: the infinitesimals. So now, if I replace the from our above expression with any arbitrary infinitesimal– let’s call it — we’ll find that evaluates to something infinitely close to the answer which we are looking to find. For the exact answer, as we mentioned, we would like to have been able to replace the with zero; but now we can be clever. Instead of trying to do undefined operations of math, dividing zero by zero, we can find the Real number solution which is infinitely close to our evaluated expression, which (as you will recall) is called the standard part of the expression. By taking the standard part of , we can find the exact answer to our problem.\nLet’s go back to our rolling ball, now, to see how we can put this into use. We want to find the exact speed of the ball at the 3 second mark. Translating this into our expression, we get:\nSo, precisely at the 3 second mark, we now know that the ball is traveling at exactly of a meter per second. However, we can do even better than this. As mentioned earlier, mathematicians are greedy. We don’t just want to know what’s going on at a few of the points; we want to know what is going on at all of the points. So, rather than solving for some particular value of , such as 3, we can solve the expression for all values of , like so:\nThis new function, , is called the derivative of our original function. We denote the derivative of with an apostrophe, written as and often read as “-prime of .”\nThe derivative is a very powerful tool. It gives us a way of describing the instantaneous rate of change for all points of a given function. When discussing speed or velocity, as we have been doing for our exemplary ball, the derivative of the function for distance gives a function describing velocity. The derivative of the function describing velocity will, in turn, give us a function describing acceleration. Taking the derivative of that function will then tell us how quickly our acceleration is, itself, increasing or decreasing– and so on and so forth. When we take derivatives of derivatives, like this, we refer to them as second, third, fourth derivatives (and so on). So, as we have now seen, the second derivative of a distance function is an acceleration function.\nThe derivative was developed by mathematicians for the express purpose of describing the changes in change. By its use and exploration, we can conquer a great many problems which are incredibly difficult– or even impossible– without this wonderful tool. And, at the very heart of the derivative lie the infinitesimals– these numbers between our numbers– which give this mathematical tool its power.","Indian Ocean coral, bleached, but able to recover.

Ocean heat waves can devastate coral reefs and other ecosystems – and these too are on the increase.\nHeat extremes on the high seas are on the increase, with ocean heat waves disturbing ecosystems in two hemispheres and two great oceans, US scientists report.\nAnd these same sudden rises in sea temperatures don’t just damage coral reefs, they kill the corals and start the process of reef decay, according to a separate study by Australian researchers.\nAndrew Pershing of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute and colleagues report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they examined data from 65 marine ecosystems over the years 1854 to 2018 to work out how frequently ocean temperatures suddenly rose to unexpected levels.\nThey found such deviations from the average in the Arctic, North Atlantic, eastern Pacific and off the Australian coasts. They expected to find evidence of occasional hot flushes. But they did not expect to find quite so many.\n“Severe marine heatwave events can have a far more severe impact than coral bleaching – the animal dies and its underlying skeleton is all that remains”\n“Across the 65 ecosystems we examined, we expected about six or seven of them would experience these ‘surprises’ each year,” Dr Pershing said. “Instead, we’ve seen an average of 12 ecosystems experiencing these warming events each year over the past seven years, including a high of 23 ‘surprises’ in 2016.”\nIntense and sudden changes in sea temperatures affect crustaceans, algae, corals, molluscs and many millions of humans who depend on the oceans for income. And a new study by researchers from Australian universities reports that even a rise of 0.5°C is reflected in deaths during an outbreak of coral bleaching.\nCorals live in symbiosis with algae: ocean warming periodically disturbs this normally beneficial relationship. The coral animals evert (turn out) the algae and once-lurid reefs will bleach, and become more vulnerable to disease.\nCorals support the world’s richest ocean ecosystems so such changes are a challenge, both to the survival of biodiversity and to local incomes from the tourism linked to the beauty of the reefs.\nVery warm water\n“What we are seeing is that severe marine heatwave events can have a far more severe impact than coral bleaching: the water temperatures are so warm that that the coral animal doesn’t bleach – in terms of a loss of its symbiosis – the animal dies and its underlying skeleton is all that remains,” said Tracy Ainsworth of the University of New South Wales.\nThe researchers report in the journal Current Biology that they used computer tomography scanning techniques to explore the marine destruction. In 2016, more than 30% of the northern part of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef experienced temperatures higher than those in which corals can survive.\n“We find that the skeleton is immediately overgrown by rapid growth of algae and bacteria,” said Bill Leggat of the University of Newcastle, a co-author.\n“We show that this process is devastating not just for the animal tissue but also for the skeleton that is left behind, which is rapidly eroded and weakened.” − Climate News Network\nAbout the Author\nTim Radford is a freelance journalist.

{"question":"Hi! I am new to baseball and wonder how different vintage baseball catching is compared to modern baseball catching - what are the key differences in equipment and rules?","answer":"The key differences between vintage and modern baseball catching are significant. In vintage base ball from the 1860s, players (ballists) catch barehanded without any gloves, and an out is called when the ball is caught after the first bounce. This was because catching barehanded was much easier on a bounce than in the air. In modern baseball, catchers use heavily padded fingerless mitts specifically designed to reduce the sting from pitchers' throws and are reinforced to withstand heavy use throughout the game. The evolution from catching on bounce to catching fly balls directly led to the introduction of baseball gloves, as catching fly balls barehanded could really sting.","context":["On a green pasture a group of nine people in blue uniforms take up their positions. Their formation looks similar to the players on a baseball field. Except on this field there are no pitcher’s mound, dirt infield, dugouts or stands for spectators.\nOn one end of the pasture a man in a gray wool uniform and maroon cap paces intently with a bat on his shoulder. Behind the man with the bat stand a barn, a cabin and a gentleman who appears to be in charge. However he’s not dressed like an umpire but nattily attired in a top hat, vest and tie. On the opposite end of the pasture there is no outfield fence, just a line of trees leading into the woods.\nSuddenly the man in the top hat (the Judge) bellows “Striker to the line!” and the game is afoot. The game (or match) looks very similar to baseball but with a few differences: The pitcher (or bowler) throws underhanded as in a softball game, none of the field players (or ballists) wear gloves and an out is called when the ball is caught after the first bounce. When a ballist scores a run (or tally) his teammates yell out a hearty “Huzzah!” The game they are playing is not baseball as we know it today, but the game of base ball in its original form–when base ball was two words. (Sportswriters would condense the name to baseball in the late 1800s.)\nToday, vintage base ball is part athletic competition and part living history, like a reenactment at the Alamo. The game is played by the rules of base ball in the 1860s, long before there were ballparks or stadiums. Participants play in period uniforms, use period terms and have nicknames like Pepper, Cornbread or Cactus. Spectators who attend a game can enjoy a friendly competition and also learn about the origins of America’s favorite pastime and how the game evolved over time.\nFor instance, in vintage base ball a batter is out when the ball is caught after the first bounce. Barehanded, it is much easier to catch a ball on a bounce than in the air. Back in the early days of base ball, catching the ball on one bounce became commonplace. Fans (or cranks) began to heckle the ballists by calling them Muffins for making the easier play. This led to a rule change that only balls caught on the fly would be counted as outs. Catching a fly ball barehanded can really sting, so this rule led to the addition of a baseball glove.\nVintage base ball has become quite popular, with almost 500 teams in the United States and Canada. Here in the metroplex there are vintage teams in Farmers Branch (the Mustangs), Carrollton (the Elite), Irving (the Estelle) and Rockwall (the Retros). Recently the Heritage Farmstead Museum and the Plano Conservancy for Historic Preservation have partnered to start a team in Plano. The Plano Cats will make their 2016 debut at the Farmers Branch Historical Park’s Base Ball Festival on April 2nd.\nThe Plano Cats are currently looking for ballists to join their team for the April 2nd festival and for other games throughout the year. The team is open to males and females, 18 and over. No previous experience is necessary. It’s all about having a good ol’ time.","Our guide covers the basics of baseball and softball gloves: position, materials, construction and more.\nHow To Buy A Baseball Glove\nGloves, like the hands they fit, come in a variety of sizes. Baseball and softball gloves also are geared to fit both the position you play and the level of your game. Keep these factors in mind when you decide which style, size, features and materials best suit your game.\nGloves by Fielding Position\nGloves are made to better help you field your position. A key element in determining the size mitt you buy is the position you play in the field.\n- A fingerless mitt (it does not have individual fingers)\n- Has heavy padding to reduce the sting from the pitcher’s throw\n- Reinforced to withstand the heavy use throughout a game\n- Also resembles a mitten, but has less padding than the catcher’s mitt\n- It is longer to help the first baseman field throws from infielders\n- A shallow pocket allows the first baseman to quickly retrieve the ball from the mitt\n- A five-fingered glove with a shallow pocket\n- A youth size is between 9 – 11 inches\n- Adults 10 1/2 to 11 1/2 inch is the typical baseball size\n- Softball infielder gloves have a deeper pocket to accept the bigger ball\n- Second basemen need a smaller glove to help make those quick throws while still having control\n- Shortstops use something in the middle for grounders and quick throws\n- Third basemen need a larger glove\n- Usually sized at 12 to12 1/2-inches for adults, about 11 inches for children\n- A deeper pocket to handle balls hit high in the air\n- Longer length to give as much reach as possible\n- If you plan to play several positions, find a glove that provides the most control for a variety of outfield positions\n- Generally larger both in the pocket and length to help players handle the larger ball\n- If you play both baseball and softball, and you only want to buy one glove, select a softball glove\nFind the Features that Fit Your Game\nToday’s gloves have different features built-in to help your game and to suit your ability. Here are the key features constructed into gloves and what to consider in finding the glove that suits you.\n- The size of the pocket depends on your position\n- Shallow pockets really help middle infielders quickly grab the ball and throw\n- Deeper pockets help outfielders shag down fly balls\n- Softball players also need a bigger pocket to catch the bigger ball\n- Different styles of webbing are available to either help you better field your position or to fit your preference\n- A closed web is preferred for pitchers who want to hide the ball from the batter\n- Outfielders and third basemen like the extra support from a closed web\n- An open web helps middle infielders get the ball out of their gloves quicker to make throws\n- There are two choices of backs, open or closed\n- The type of back is matter of personal preference, but some styles fit some positions better\n- The open back leaves a space open across the glove’s back\n- Middle infielders prefer this for the flexibility\n- Outfielders prefer a closed back with a “finger hole” for extra support\n- Wrist adjustment\n- Gloves come with an adjustment to keep it snug. Not all gloves have these “fit systems.”\n- A D-ring fastener allows you to pull on the lacing and make the glove tighter or looser\n- A Velcro fastener although it may wear quicker, offers convenience of pulling and adjusting to fit your comfort level\n- A Lacing adjustment allows you to loosen or tighten the wrist fastener with leather laces.\n- A Buckle system adjusts the glove with a buckle similar to an adjustable hat\n- The amount of padding in the pocket depends on the position played\n- The catcher’s mitt has more padding to handle hard throws from a pitcher\n- Glove makers have been adding more padding for other positions as well to help players handle the sting of hard-hit balls\n- There also may be padding in the wrist area to make the glove more comfortable\nGloves come in a variety of materials, with the difference being in the feel and durability.\n- Materials of choice for gloves\n- Leather offers the best comfort, control and feel\n- The better the leather, the better the glove\n- Treated leather\n- Leather is treated and softened with chemicals for faster break-in and increased durability\n- Treated leather also reduces the care needed for the glove and helps the glove keep its shape\n- Synthetic materials\n- A lighter, less-durable material\n- Less expensive, good for youngsters\n- Won’t withstand the wear and tear of playing ball nearly as well as leather\nFit the Glove to Your Hand\nAlthough age is also a factor, the position you play is the most important consideration in choosing a baseball or softball glove.\n- Youth models are smaller to help kids maintain control\n- Avoid the urge to buy a bigger glove that you’ll grow into\n- Kids under the age of 8 should stick with a glove from 9 to 11 inches\n- Kids from 8 to early teens, consider an 11-inch glove\n- Beginners also benefit from the added control that they get from smaller gloves\nHigh School/ Adult\n- Outfielders need 12 to 12 1/2 inch gloves with deeper pockets\n- Infielders need smaller gloves (10 1/2 to 11 1/2 inch) with shallower pockets for better control and quicker ball transfer\n- Pitchers can go with a slightly larger glove than infielders but still need a small enough glove for fielding and throwing quickly\n- Softball players require gloves that are slightly longer in length and deeper in the pocket to help field the bigger ball\nBuying a Ball\nBalls come in different sizes, materials and hardness.\n- Most baseballs are 9 inches in circumference\n- Leagues for under-10 year old players may use a slightly larger ball\n- Softballs typically are 12 inches in circumference, while some women’s and youth leagues usually an 11 inch ball\nBalls are manufactured out of leather or synthetic leather. There are also safety balls for younger players.\n- Leather is used in the Major Leagues and other upper-level leagues\n- Synthetic leather is used primarily for balls in the Little League age group and younger\n- “Safety balls” are engineered to play like a real ball without the sting of a hard ball. Known as “Reduced Injury Factor” or RIF balls, they roll and bounce like their harder cousins, but don’t hurt as much if the player gets hit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8da18f05-aed0-4b6e-a931-6adaf5bfdded>","<urn:uuid:3aa3442b-7751-41d8-a8d5-c7a38a6e2fbb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do salt marshes protect coastlines, and what role do they play in carbon sequestration?","answer":"Salt marshes protect coastlines by buffering upland surfaces from wave and storm impacts, erosion, and coastal flooding. They can expand and keep pace with increasing ocean levels by trapping nutrients and sediment to form peat. In terms of carbon sequestration, salt marshes are vital blue carbon ecosystems that can capture and store carbon in their biomass and soil at rates up to 35 times faster than tropical rainforests. This makes them highly efficient carbon sinks that contribute significantly to climate change mitigation through their natural processes.","context":["Table of Contents\nSalt marsh refers to a coastal ecosystem in the upper coastal intertidal zone between open salt water and land whose tides experience floods on a regular basis. The mean elevation of the salt surfaces has to build up to keep in pace with the continuous increase in sea level and developments of salt marsh organic composition. If the rates of sedimentation in salt marsh do not surpass the actual loss in elevation due to the steady increase in the sea level and salt marsh substance, it will drown. When drowning occurs, the surface of the marsh area becomes slightly tidal which can cause numerous changes on the habitat. Such changes include conversion of vegetated salt marsh which tends to increase the flat mud.\nSalt marshes, particularly in Northeast parts of the United States, serve as a critical habitat for many species of both plants and animals. The marshes perform a variety of ecologically vital chemical functions including inorganic and organic waste retention. They also, lead to removal and transformation of global carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen biogeochemical cycling. They cause sediment entrapment along with buffering of upland surface from wave and storm impacts, erosion, and coastal flooding.\nSouth Carolina features more salt marsh acreage as compared to any other coastline state in the United States of America. These salt marshes are due to a high rate of the fall and rise of tides which, cause bold changes in levels of salinity, water depth, and temperature. Frequency, salinity and extent of flooding influence the types of animals and plants found there.\nSalt marshes form an integral part of coastal estuaries along the Maine state. The marshes are lying low and are open plains with abundant grasses. They are colorful bands, which have a relationship with tidal pools and creeks. They result from the relationship among different varieties of salt marsh plants, which proliferate in response to a certain mode of tidal ups and downs. The salt marshes flourish depending on its ability to link to the sea. Various plants form the basis of the exceptionally productive salt marsh ecosystem. The marshes are always in small and large patches along the Maine’s tidal coastlines.\nSalt marshes of Maine have regional character. Along the southwest coastline, large marshes form meadows protected by barrier beaches, which are similar to salt marshes in Connecticut and Massachusetts. They can be found along the landward openings of protected coves in the further east especially along the upper vicinity of tidal rivers.\nA salt marsh refers to muddy seashores with rich vegetation that they feature. It is an area that presents in itself a transitional layer between salty water and land. The salt marshes develop on coasts, estuaries, and bays, where tidal rises and falls lead to gentle and light erosion. Such sheltered conditions lead to the formation of fine particles materials like clays, silts, and mud which begin binding together. Particles eventually transform from suspended state and start to deposit. These processes occur continuously, implying that the length of the mud enlarges with time and, therefore, the surface is exposed to out of the water condition over longer periods.\nThe above process necessitates the seeds of plants, which are carried out by water or wind, to germinate while attaching their roots solid into the ground. The impact of these first plants in terms of the developing salt marsh affects its physical condition. Plants help in binding together mud and oxygen transmission. They also trap more sediment; their decomposition over winter supplements nutrients, organic matter, and minerals to the composition of muddy soil.\nSalt marshes of the northeast of the United States of America are home to extremely many plants and animals. Birds like Clapper Rail are present in such areas. Invertebrates like Grass Shrimp, Mammals like Marsh Rabbits, and Reptiles like Diamondback Terrapin inhabit the salt marshes. The marshes are extremely productive environments. There is abundant grass, herbs, and low shrubs which dominate the view. The importance of shat marsh to the animals, which inhabit the area, is that some animals like birds, crabs, snails, and fish can take shelter among the plants and in shallow water. Most of the species have evolved traits that enable them to tolerate salt water. Most marshes have sedge that provides food for animals.\nSalt waters are necessary because they provide significant breeding and feeding grounds for many animals and act as nurseries for fish such as Pacific Salmon. Microorganisms break down marshes from plants; tidal currents take them offshore. These materials are helpful to the floating plankton that provides food for fish and marine mammals. The wildlife found in the salt marine provides valuable tourism, education, recreation, and research opportunities for scholars.\nBenefit from Our Service: Save 25% Along with the first order offer - 15% discount, you save extra 10% since we provide 300 words/page instead of 275 words/page\nAnimals like rodents, birds, and fish live in the salt marshes. Mammals and other categories of animals inhabit the marshes. These animals have developed special features that help them live in a salty environment.\nThe importance of salt marshes from Carolina up to Maine is identical in many forms. Salt marshes protect against waves and sea level rise. This is because salt marshes are able to expand and keep pace with the increasing ocean level since they trap nutrients and sediment, which enable them to form peat.\nSalt marshes provide a nursery area for fish, crustaceans, and insects. There is a lot of food of which fish and insects feed, and the area protects them from predators, thus enabling them to proliferate. The salt marshes have vegetation that bacteria consume. The decaying plants and microbes provide food for insects, fish and mussels. The other importance is that salt marshes lead to spatial migration of plant community zones; this depends on the relative sea level rise rate, the acceleration rate as specific to zone and location, and the availability of land at a suitable base elevation. Migration of animals like birds is highly common in salt marshes; they migrate to such places every autumn and spring.\nThe observations from the experiments establish that the level of carbon monoxide produced by Toyota which has 6 cylinders is the highest. This is as a result of the many numbers of cylinders and the age of the vehicle. Presence of carbon monoxide in larger quantity implies a low rate of internal combustion. Volkswagen produced in 2013 produce the highest amount of carbon dioxide; this is because its engine allows complete combustion since the car is still new and powerful. Nissan Quest of 2000 produces the largest amount of Nitrogen. This is a result of incomplete combustion of gasoline. The age of the car has a relationship to the amount of carbon dioxide produced. Cars made between 2000 and 2008 record 0.7% level of emission. Vehicles made in 2000 have the same level of carbon monoxide emission. Number of cylinders and fuel do not a play part in determining the amount of emissions.\n- Source of carbon monoxide\nCarbon monoxide results from incomplete combustion, which takes place; this is due to partial oxidization of fuel to carbon dioxide.\n- Carbon dioxide\nCarbon dioxide is a product of perfect combustion in the internal engine of a car. Fuel burns to result into the water and carbon dioxide.\n- Nitrogen dioxide\nIt results from the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the air due to increase in pressure and temperature in an engine of a car.\nGasoline is the fuel that burns in the internal engine of a car. It gets into the tailpipe through fuel evaporation thus sneaking into the environment. Evaporative emission can occur due to diurnal where, gasoline evaporation intensifies as the temperature increases during the day, heating the fuel tank which emits gasoline vapors.\n- Sulfur Dioxide\nIt results from incomplete combustion in the internal engine of a car. It has an adverse effect on the environment.\nBook The Best Top Expert at our service\nYour order will be assigned to the most experienced writer in the relevant discipline.

When somebody inhales carbon monoxide, it reacts with oxygen carrying hemoglobin of the blood. This reaction is unsuitable in human bodies.\nEarly symptoms of carbon monoxide include fatigue, headaches, and nausea. Symptoms like physical weakness and flu are a result of exposure to carbon monoxide.\nHealth dangers of nitrogen dioxide gas include throat, eye, and nose irritation. Gas may cause respiratory and lung infections in children. It may lead to increase in bronchial reactivity in asthmatic individuals. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may experience decrease in lung function.\nThis is because automobile exhaust emissions lead to emission of harmful gases in the environment. Automobiles emit gases like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, gasoline, and carbon dioxide among other gases that are harmful to the environment. Another reason why it must take place especially in the urban areas is because such areas have the largest number of automobiles compared to rural areas; thus why, the air quality control authorities must concentrate on automobiles.\nVIP support ensures that your enquiries\nwill be answered immediately by our Support Team.\nExtra attention is guaranteed.\nThe converter is a device that uses the basic reduction processes to help reduce the pollutants of a car. The catalytic converter achieves this by converting carbon monoxide fumes into non-harmful gases. It contains a metal housing that has a ceramic honeycomb-type interior. This interior has a thin wall channels that have a wash coat of aluminum oxide. The catalytic converter relies on simple reduction and oxidation reactions to convert carbon monoxide into less harmful gases, which are environment friendly.\nRelated Informative essays\n- Making a Change\n- California Pizza Kitchen\n- Unit II Problem Solving\n- The Paradox of Choice\n- RN Interview Assignment\n- Motivational Inteviewing\n- Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n- The Fundamental Causes of the Second World War\n- How did Industrialization Impact American Society?","When we think about carbon and climate change, our minds often go to fossil fuels, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, there’s another side to the carbon story that’s just as important – the role of coastal ecosystems in storing and sequestering carbon. This is where the concept of “Blue Carbon” comes into play.\nThe Role of Blue Carbon in Climate Change\nCarbon Sequestration in Coastal Ecosystems\nBlue carbon refers to the carbon captured and stored by the world’s coastal and marine ecosystems. These ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, act as carbon sinks, capturing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In fact, they can sequester carbon at a rate up to 35 times faster than tropical rainforests.\nThe Blue Carbon Initiative\nRecognizing the importance of these ecosystems, the Blue Carbon Initiative was launched to promote their conservation and restoration. The initiative brings together governments, research institutions, NGOs, and communities to protect and restore these vital ecosystems, which not only help in climate change mitigation but also provide numerous other ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, water purification, and coastal protection.\nCoastal Ecosystems and Blue Carbon\nMangroves are one of the most important blue carbon ecosystems. These unique trees, which grow in intertidal zones, have complex root systems that trap sediments, slowing down water flow and allowing organic material to settle. This creates a carbon-rich soil that can store significant amounts of carbon.\nSeagrasses, another vital blue carbon ecosystem, are flowering plants that grow in shallow coastal waters. They have the ability to capture and store large amounts of carbon in their roots and sediment, making them highly efficient carbon sinks.\nSalt marshes, found in the intertidal zone of coastal areas, are another important blue carbon ecosystem. These marshes are highly productive, with plants that capture and store carbon in their biomass and soil.\nThreats to Blue Carbon Ecosystems\nOne of the main threats to blue carbon ecosystems is coastal development. As coastal areas become more developed, these ecosystems are often destroyed or degraded, leading to the release of stored carbon back into the atmosphere.\nPollution, especially nutrient runoff from agriculture and sewage, can also harm blue carbon ecosystems. Excess nutrients can lead to algal blooms, which deplete oxygen levels in the water, harming seagrasses, mangroves, and other organisms.\nClimate change poses a significant threat to blue carbon ecosystems. Rising sea levels and temperatures can lead to the loss of these ecosystems, while increased storm intensity can cause physical damage.\nConservation Efforts for Blue Carbon Ecosystems\nTo counter these threats, various restoration projects are underway to bring back lost or degraded blue carbon ecosystems. These projects involve planting mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, and are often done in collaboration with local communities.\nPolicy measures, such as designating protected areas and creating incentives for conservation and restoration, are also crucial in protecting blue carbon ecosystems. By recognizing the value of these ecosystems, we can ensure their conservation and restoration, leading to long-term benefits for the climate and biodiversity.\nThe Future of Blue Carbon\nThe concept of blue carbon is still relatively new, but it’s gaining recognition and momentum. As we continue to understand the importance of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation, we can expect more efforts to conserve and restore them. With collaboration between governments, researchers, NGOs, and communities, we can protect and enhance these vital ecosystems for future generations.\n- Biology Niche: Exploring the Fascinating World\n- Biofuels: The Future of Sustainable Energy\n- Biodiversity: Exploring Nature’s Tapestry\nIn conclusion, blue carbon is a crucial part of the global carbon cycle, with coastal ecosystems playing a key role in capturing and storing carbon. By conserving and restoring these ecosystems, we can mitigate climate change while also enjoying other ecosystem services. The future of blue carbon is promising, and with continued efforts, we can ensure these ecosystems are protected for generations to come.\nWhat is blue carbon?\nBlue carbon refers to the carbon captured and stored by the world’s coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes. These ecosystems act as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate climate change by sequestering large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nWhy are coastal ecosystems important in capturing carbon?\nCoastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, are crucial for capturing carbon because they have unique properties that allow them to trap and store carbon in their biomass and sediments. These ecosystems can sequester carbon at a rate up to 35 times faster than tropical rainforests, making them highly efficient carbon sinks.\nWhat is the Blue Carbon Initiative?\nThe Blue Carbon Initiative is a global program that aims to promote the conservation and restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems to enhance their capacity to capture and store carbon. The initiative brings together governments, research institutions, NGOs, and communities to work towards protecting and restoring these vital ecosystems for climate change mitigation and other ecosystem services.\nWhat are some threats to blue carbon ecosystems?\nCoastal development, pollution, and climate change are the primary threats to blue carbon ecosystems. Coastal development can lead to the destruction or degradation of these ecosystems, while pollution, especially nutrient runoff, can harm their health. Climate change, with rising sea levels and temperatures, can also result in the loss of these ecosystems and increased storm intensity can cause physical damage.\nHow can we protect and restore blue carbon ecosystems?\nTo protect and restore blue carbon ecosystems, conservation efforts include restoration projects, policy measures, and community involvement. Restoration projects involve planting mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, often in collaboration with local communities. Policy measures, such as designating protected areas and creating incentives for conservation and restoration, are crucial in protecting these ecosystems. Additionally, raising awareness and involving local communities in conservation efforts are essential for the long-term success of these initiatives."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:869692c7-f2b9-4588-8289-14ef8e6547ee>","<urn:uuid:98890e9d-0424-4365-bfae-27add36ce21c>"],"error":null}

However, as a general rule of thumb, your tie should be long enough to reach the center of your belt buckle.\nSo if you’re taller than average, you may want to go with a long tie; if you’re shorter than average, a shorter tie may be a better option. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide what looks best!\nOne thing to note about tie sizes is that every inch counts. One quick tip: whether you’re wearing a diamond-tipped or a square-tipped tie, make sure that the tip touches your belt buckle when standing upright.\nIf the tie goes even an inch below your buckle, it is considered too long. You also want to avoid leaving the tip of the tie swinging above your waist such that your shirt’s fabric is seen.\nBesides, having the tip of the tie at the waist allows you to do normal errands without many bathroom mistakes. There are reduced chances of zipping it up, for instance.\nLearn more about what is the proper size of your tie (video)\nHow do I know my tie length?\nRelated: Hat size chart and conversion table\nWhile the average tie length is 57 inches or thereabout, it may not be what you need if you fall on the shorter or taller side of the scale.\nWe understand how taxing the process of finding the right tie for you is. You want to work with a length that will not appear too big, forcing you to make many loops.\nThe length of the tie also depends on the length of your upper body. While people of average height may adjust the length of their ties by reducing or adding knots, shorter people than average will need to buy ties that are shorter than average.\nThe size of your collar will also influence the number of loops you make, hence, determining the length of your tie. Likewise, taller people than average will need to get longer ties than average.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat length tie Do I need 58 or 62?\nThis is determined by a few factors such as the length of your torso, your body size, and of course your preference. 58 is the normal tie length that is pulled off by most men.\nIn many cases, shorter men than average prefer getting this length because they prefer making a big knot. (Short men look strong in big knots).\nIf you’re of average height and prefer making a big knot, consider getting an extra long tie length which is 62 inches. Just be sure the tip hits your buckle. Otherwise, a 62-inch tie is meant for taller men.\nWhat size tie is in Style 2022?\nThe most selling ties in 2022 are between skinny, and slim body types. A skinny tie ranges from 2.25 to 2.5 inches in width, whereas the slim one is between 2.5 and 3.0 inches wide.\nThere has been a significant demand for these two tie sizes this year more than the previous year.\nWhat is a size 8 tie?\nA size 8 tie is donned by boys below 6 years. Please refer to the tie size guide against their age and their widths.\nHow wide should a man’s tie be?\nMen’s tie sizes vary with their body sizes and preferences. One more thing, the lapel of your jacket also determines the width. The general rule for this apparel has it that the wider your jacket’s lapel the wider the tie and vice versa.\nHowever, an average man should not wear a tie wider than 3.5 inches. Skinny ties mostly go well with slim men.\nFor bow tie lovers, be sure to get a bow tie length and width that syncs with your body.\nPlease refer to the bow tie length chart that guides you to what’s best for you.\nHow long is an XL tie?\nAn XL tie ( extra long tie) is specifically designed for tall and big men. They are more than 61 inches long and are preferred by men taller than 6 foot 3 inches. They are also a perfect fit for men who love thick knots.\nThree quick tips to always remember when getting a tie: the size of your jacket’s lapel should determine the width of your neck tie; your necktie size should always be proportional to your body size, and your tie tip should hit the belt buckle. If not wearing a suit, try a 3” tie width.\nGoing by the above three tips will give you a sharp and balanced look.\nThat’s it!

{"question":"how does BOX in ONE defense work?","answer":"BOX in ONE is a man down defense formation used in 6 on 5 situations. It consists of 4 long sticks forming a square (box) in front of the crease with defenders in top Right, Top Left, Bottom Right and Bottom Left positions. The ONE refers to having a short stick in the center of the box covering potential cutters and any offensive player in the crease area.","context":["Face Off Terms\nLINE UP – This term represents the pre-game lining up of starting teams on the field. Each team lines up across from one another, with their left shoulder facing the side of the field being defended. The goalies will stand with his back to the goal he is defending, and the referee will instruct the goalies to meet at mid-field to shake hands. After this the players take their position for the face-off.\nMARK UP – Lining up directly next to your opponent on the face-off wing, with the intention of defending the other player and not allowing him to get an easy ground ball.\nPLAY UP – Lining up on the offensive half of the face-off wing. The intention of this alignment is to put us in a position to start a fast break opportunity off the face-off.\nPLAY DOWN – Lining up on the defensive side of the face-off wing. The intention of this alignment is generally to prevent a fast break by the opponent.\nSTRONG SIDE – Represents the rake side (left side) of the face-off man or the ball carrier.\nWEAK SIDE – Represents the right side of the face-off man or the ball carrier.\n1-3-2 – This will be our general offensive setup. In this structure there will be 2 Midfielders near the top of the restraining box, and one on the crease. The Attackmen will be set up with one at X (X is the attack position directly behind the goal) and one each on either side of the goal, about 10 yards off the goal pipe and 2 yards above the goal from the GLE. Other common offensive formations from X are 1-4-1 and 2-1-3\nCREASE – This is the circular line surrounding the goal, and is intended to protect the goalie. No offensive player is ever allowed inside this area; the result is a change of possession or the negation of score. Defensive players may run through the crease, for example when covering their men, but not if they have possession of the ball.\nCUT/POP/V-CUT – The act of making a move on the defender for the purpose of getting open for a pass. This usually entails stepping toward the defender to make him move one way, then quickly popping away in the opposite direction, at a slant, to create space to easily get open and catch the ball.\nDODGE – This is the act of making as move with the ball. A dodge can be used to simply change direction while in possession of the ball, or to make a move to the goal by attempting to beat your defender.\nFEED – The act of passing to an open or cutting teammate for the purpose of assisting on a goal.\nGOAL LINE EXTENDED (GLE) – This stands for Goal Line Extended. It’s the theoretical line that extends from the goal line to the sideline.\nISO – Short for isolation, this is the act of intentionally drawing your defender away from the goal with the intent to beat him one-on-one to become a shooter or feeder.\nPICK – This is the act of stepping in front of the defender of another player so that your teammate can get open for a pass & shot. As is basketball, a moving pick is a violation.\nSHOW – This term is an instruction for the named player or position to get in a better position to receive a pass or to appear to be in position to defend.\nX – This represents the area directly behind the goal, and is a common area for attackers to initiate scoring opportunities.\n“GET IN THE HOLE” – The coach will call this when we’re playing defense in an unsettled situation and he wants all defenders to sprint back to the inside of the restraining box in front of the goal (the hole) and play defense “inside / out”. (See the philosophy section for explanation on “Inside / Out”)\n“NUMBER UP” – All defensive players should call out the number of the man they are covering.\n“I’VE GOT BALL” – This should always be called out by the defender who is covering the man with the ball.\nOFF BALL DEFENDER- These are the defenders closest to the ball carrier, but not defending the ball carrier. If you are an Off Ball Defender, you must be prepared to do two things: TALK (tell the ball defender where you are) and SLIDE (get ready to cover the ball carrier if he beats our defender).\n“BACK LEFT”– This should always be called out by the Off Ball Defender who is left of the man covering the ball. “Help Left” should be called repeatedly to ensure the defender of the ball that he has back-up to his left in the event he gets beat.\n“BACK RIGHT” – This is the same concept for the Off Ball Defender to the right side of the man covering the ball. Call out “Help Right” repeatedly.\n“STICKS UP” - All defenders should play with their sticks in the air blocking passing lanes. The coach will call this if he senses that the defense is playing with sticks facing the ground or at the side.\n“CLEAR THE CREASE” – Called out by the goalie and indicates that there is a ground ball in the crease area and all opponents should be physically (and legally) cleared out so that we or the goalie can get possession of the ground ball.\n“CUTTERS/CHECK STICKS” – This indicated that someone is making a cut through the crease area with the intent to receive a pass and score. Crease defenders should be ready to check the stick of their opponent when this is called. Stick and body checks are legal if done within 5 yards of the ball without slashing. At the youth level body checks resulting in a player being knocked to the ground are illegal.\n“DROP-IN” – You are playing your man too far from the goal. You should back off your man and put yourself in a position to slide and help your teammates.\n“HOLD” – The goalie will call this when an offensive player with the ball is getting too close to the goal and is a potential shooter. This call should alert the ball defender to force the ball carrier out of shooting range.\nRED “#” – This will be called when the coach wants the man covering the ball to aggressively defend the man with the ball with the intent to take the ball away. The coach will call RED and then the number of the defender guarding the man with the ball. Example: RED 4 (#4 defends his man and the adjacent defenders shut down the outlet passes). The defenders adjacent (right & left) to the man covering the ball should shut down their men, closely defending them with the intent of keeping them from getting a pass from the man with the ball.\n“SLIDE” – This is the act of leaving your man to defend the ball if the defender adjacent to you was covering the ball and has been beat. This term also applies to filling in for a fellow defender who has left his man to play the ball.\n“I’M HOT” –This is what the defender should call to indicate he will be making the slide.\n“BOX in ONE” – This will be our general man down defense – when we lose a player to a penalty and have a 6 on 5 situation (or worse). We will often have 4 long sticks and 1 short stick on our Man Down Defense. BOX stands for having the 4 long sticks forming a square in front of the crease with a defender in the top Right, Top Left, Bottom Right and Bottom Left positions. ONE stands for having the short stick in the center of the box covering potential cutters and any offensive player standing in the crease area (usually called “String”).\nTransition Game Terms\n“BREAK!” or “CLEAR!” – This is called out by the goalie after a save is made. It should alert all players to break out for an outlet pass now that we have possession.\nRIDING – This is the concept of defending the opposing team after they gain possession in their defensive half of the field by a change of possession or after a save by the opponent’s goalie.\nCLEARING – This is the concept of getting the ball out of the defensive zone into our offensive half of the field after a change of possession or save by our goalie.\n“GET IN THE HOLE!” – The coach will call this when we’re playing defense in an unsettled situation and he wants all defenders to sprint back to the inside of the restraining box (the hole) and play defense “inside / out”. (See the Defensive Philosophy section for explanation on “Inside / Out”)\n“[I GOT] BALL” – The ball is on the ground and you’re going to go after it.\n“[I GOT] MAN” – The ball is on the ground and you are playing the man to give your teammate a better opportunity to get the ground ball.\nMAN UP/MAN DOWN – This describes the situation where a team needs to play minus one player for a period of time due to a penalty. Technical fouls are served for 30 seconds and personal fouls one minute. Other infractions such unsportsmanlike conduct or an illegal stick can result in longer penalties the discretion of the official(s).\nMIDDIES! – Hearing this indicates that we want to substitute our midfield line. If you are a midfielder, hustle on/off the field."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0cd5819b-1fe8-458b-b34e-8ce9b5e6dca0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a chemistry student, I'm curious: what's the key difference between how molecular forces work in liquids versus gases according to kinetic theory?","answer":"In liquids, there are weak molecular forces that hold the particles together while still allowing them to slide past one another. In contrast, in gases, the molecular forces are negligible because the particles have higher kinetic energy that overcomes the attractive forces between them. This is why gases easily spread out and don't stay in open containers, while liquids maintain a definite volume even though they can flow.","context":["Key words: States of Matter, solid, liquid, gas, plasma, heat, temperature, energy, molecular forces, water, ice, steam, molten metal, Helium, ionized, Sun, Physics, Ron Kurtus, School for Champions. Copyright © Restrictions\nStates of Matter\nBy Ron Kurtus (revised 18 August 2013)\nMatter exists on Earth in three major states or phases: solid, liquid, gas. These states describe distinct physical characteristics of the material and are a function of temperature and pressure.\nAt very high temperatures, matter becomes a plasma or ioinzed gas. Some scientists designate a plasma as a fourth state of matter. There are also other forms of matter at both very high and very low temperatures that may be considered states of matter.\n(See Exotic States of Matter for more information.)\nMajor physical characteristics define each state and primarily concern volume and shape. Kinetic energy of the molecules and attractive forces determine the physical characteristics of each state. Many common materials can be seen in the various states of matter.\nQuestions you may have include:\n- What are the physical characteristics of the states of matter?\n- Why do the characteristics change?\n- What are some examples of materials in different states?\nThis lesson will answer those questions. Useful tool: Units Conversion\nThe primary physical characteristics of the various states of matter are the volume and shape of the material. They are what really define the state. Other characteristics—such as color—may be different in the various states of matter, but they do not define the state as do volume and shape. Gravity has an effect on the shape of liquids and gases.\nThe solid state of matter is when the material has a definite volume or size and distinct shape at a given temperature.\nAt room temperature, a piece of iron at has a shape and size that does not change. Ice is another solid, but its temperature must be below 0o C (32o F).\nMost solid materials expand with increasing temperatures, but they retain their shape.\nA liquid has a definite volume, but it takes the shape of its container with the help of gravity.\nFor example, if you pour water into a cup or container, it will take the shape of that container. If you put water in a balloon, the water will take the shape of the balloon, no matter how you change the shape of the balloon.\nOn the other hand, in outer space, where there is no gravity such as in the Space Shuttle, water might float out of its container. Its shape will vary, but its volume will remain constant if the air pressure and temperature are constant.\nMost liquids expand with an increase of temperature and constant air pressure.\nThe volume of a quantity of gas is dependent on its temperature and the surrounding pressure. If affected by gravity, it will take the shape of its container, but much of it will also spread out into the surrounding area.\nAssuming little or no convection or circulation, a heavier gas will settle to the bottom. For example, carbon dioxide gas (CO2) is heavier than air. If a quantity of CO2 is put in a cup, it sink to the bottom and take the shape of the cup. After a while, some of the CO2 will mix in with the air, due to convection—perhaps becoming part of a solution with the air.\nThis can be demonstrated using Dry Ice (frozen CO2) and pouring the \"smoky\" gas into a cup. It will settle to the bottom but will soon dissolve into the air.\nIf you put a gas in a cylinder and apply pressure with a piston, such as you might do with a tire pump, the volume of the gas can change considerably. This is not the case with water or a solid. Their volumes may change only slightly with an increase of pressure.\nReasons states have characteristics\nThe reason the various states of matter have their particular physical characteristics and behave in the way they do is a result of the motion of the molecules and the attraction between them.\nTheories and forces\nThe Molecular Theory of Matter, Theory of Heat and the Molecular Attraction Force affect the states of matter.\nMolecules in motion\nThe Molecular Theory of Matter and the Theory of Heat state that molecules are in constant motion. The greater the temperature, the greater the kinetic energy and thus the faster the molecules are moving. This also applies to substances made up of only atoms, such as iron or pure aluminum.\nBut also, Molecules are often attracted to each other, due to the Molecular Attraction Force. This force is strongest among similar molecules or atoms. It is a form of electrostatic attraction that also is the factor in static electricity.\nFight between the two\nThe kinetic energy of the molecules or atoms tends to spread them apart, while the molecular attraction tends to pull them together. The temperature or energy will then determine which force wins out.\nMolecules in solids vibrate\nIf the kinetic energy (and thus the velocity) of the molecules of a material is so low that the molecular attraction between the molecules is much stronger than the forces pulling the molecules apart, the material will be a in solid state of matter. That means the molecules become fixed in place and often line up in a crystalline arrangement. The molecules or atoms still have some energy, but their movement is confined to just vibrating in place or rotation.\nAt the very lowest temperature possible—Absolute Zero (0 degrees Kelvin or 0o K)—all motion stops and the atoms and molecules do not vibrate or even spin.\nMolecules in liquids loosen structure\nIf the the molecules of the material have enough kinetic energy and are moving fast enough, they can break out of the constraints of a defined structure. The energy overcomes the much of the molecular force. This force is now only strong enough to hold the material together in the form of a liquid.\nMolecules in gases run free\nWith a gas, the molecules (or atoms) are more energetic and are moving rapidly. Their kinetic energy is greater than the attractive force between them. Thus, a gas will easily spread and not stay in an open container.\nExamples with different materials\nLook at various materials to see their different states.\nA good example of how matter can exist in different states is water. It is normally a liquid at room temperature, but if you cool it below 32o F (0o C), it will freeze and become the solid we call ice. If you heat water above 212o F (100o C), it will boil and turn into a gas we call steam.\nYou've seen pictures of molten iron in a foundry. They heat the iron to a very high temperature, such that it turns into a glowing, yellow liquid. If iron was placed in an extremely hot environment like on the Sun's surface, it would boil and turn into a gas.\nHelium is a gas at room temperature, but if it is cooled to a few degrees above Absolute Zero (degrees Kelvin), it turns into a liquid. It is the only liquid that cannot be solidified at atmospheric pressure by simply lowering its temperature. Scientists have been only able to solidify liquid Helium at the extreme pressures of 25 atmospheres. (1 atmosphere = 14.7 pounds per square inch).\nLiquid Helium has some very strange properties. For example, if it is poured in a flask, it will first settle at the bottom of the flask and then start to climb up the sides and soon flow out of the container.\nThere are three accepted states of matter: solid, liquid, gas. There may be a fourth state, called the plasma state. As the energy of the moving molecules overcomes the molecular attraction forces, the material will change its state from solid to liquid to gas. The solid iron, liquid water and helium gas are examples of different states of matter at room temperature.\nBe observant of what happens to learn why it happens\nResources and references\nQuestions and comments\nDo you have any questions, comments, or opinions on this subject?

It can be defined as anything which has mass or occupies space. Matter is classified by its state and type, of which there are three main types – solid, liquid and gas. These lead us to the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Matter.\nParticle Arrangement in Matter\n- Particles in the solid state are closely packed, in a regular arrangement, known sometimes as a lattice.\n- Particles in a liquid state are not as closely packed and are irregular in their arrangement.\n- In a gas, particles are separated.\nForces Between Particles\n- In the solid state, the forces are strong enough to keep the particles in a fixed position. Particles do, however, vibrate and rotate in their positions.\n- In the liquid state, there are weak forces which hold it together. The greater energy of the particles and the weaker forces allows for the disruption of the lattice and particles are, therefore able to slide past one another.\n- In the gaseous state, particles possess even higher energy levels and the forces which hold the gas together are negligible. This explains why gases are able to isolate themselves completely from one another and have no fixed size or shape.\nChanges in State\nChanges in state (also called phase transitions) involve heat energy being supplied to or removed from the substance. Increasing the amount of heat energy in a substance increases its kinetic energy since temperature is a measure of the amount of kinetic energy possessed by a substance. In a solid, heat energy causes the particles to vibrate at a greater rate until they possess sufficient energy to break away from their fixed position and become a liquid (known as melting). The temperature at which this occurs is called a substances melting point. As heat is removed from the liquid, the particles return to their closely-packed, fixed positions, this process is called freezing.\nWhen heat energy is supplied to a liquid, the particles also take on more heat energy which causes them to move around at a greater speed. Fast-moving particles at the surface of the liquid eventually have sufficient energy to escape from the liquid and move into the gaseous state. Here, these particles move rapidly, at a large distance from the other particles. This process is known as vaporisation. The point at which a substance moves from the liquid to the gas state is known as its boiling point. As heat is removed from the substance the particles move closer together once more, this process is called condensation.\nSome substances e.g. iodine crystals are able to change from a solid directly into a gas, without moving through the liquid state. This process is called sublimation. Deposition is the reverse of sublimation and occurs when a substance moves directly from a gas to a solid, omitting the liquid state. An example of this can be seen in sub-zero temperatures, where water vapor in the air changes directly into ice, without first becoming a liquid.\nSelect the best answer for each of the following questions.\n- Which of the following is an example of a molecule, but not a compound?\n- Which of the following is the correct definition for an atom?\n- The smallest building block of matter\n- The smallest building block of matter that retains the chemical properties of the element.\n- The smallest, indivisible building block of matter.\n- The purest type of matter.\nDecide whether the following statements are true or false.\n- All molecules are compounds, but not all compounds are molecules.\n- Compounds are pure substances.\nTheobromine, is a bitter alkaloid of the cacao plant found in chocolate. It has the chemical formula C7H8N4O2.\n- Calculate how many atoms are in two molecules of C7H8N4O2.\nPlasma – the 4th State of Matter\nPlasmas, like gases, have no fixed shape or volume. A gas can reach the plasma state when its atoms become ionized. This occurs when the atom loses some or all of the electrons leaving a positively charged nucleus. This process is known as ionization and explains why plasmas are able to conduct electricity since the electrons are free to move around. Recombination occurs when plasmas return to the gaseous state.\nNeon signs are an example of plasma. The electricity flows through the glass tube containing the gas, stripping the atoms of their electrons. The electricity promotes the electrons to a higher energy level. As the electron returned to its former energy level the excess energy is carried away as a photon, which we see as coloured light.\nVideo Lesson States of Matter\n- Decide if the following are true or false.\n- Solids possess a greater level of kinetic energy than gases.\n- The forces which hold a liquid together are weaker than those which hold a solid together.\n- Some solids exist in a regular structure known as a lattice.\n- Gases have a fixed shape when in a container.\n- Decide whether energy needs to added or removed for each of the following changes of state.\n- Decide which of the properties described below can be attributed to solid, liquid or gas.

{"question":"How did Latin American avant-garde art and Mexican muralism differ in their approaches to political expression?","answer":"While both movements engaged with political themes, they approached political expression differently. Latin American avant-garde artists often expressed political views through personal and experimental means, as exemplified by Diego Rivera including Lenin in his 'Man at the Crossroads' mural despite client disapproval. In contrast, Mexican muralism was more directly political, emerging as a government-backed program that evolved into an independent movement. Mexican muralists explicitly aimed to educate the common people about cultural identity, solidarity, and resistance, with artists like Siqueiros depicting socialist themes and the struggles of the proletariat in a direct way. Both movements were influenced by political circumstances, but Mexican muralism was more deliberately focused on public education and social change through accessible art.","context":["Avant-garde is a French term originally used to describe “the foremost part of an advancing army or naval force” (Oxford English Dictionary Online-vanguard), but has since been appropriated to indicate “new and experimental ideas and methods in art” (Oxford English Dictionary Online-avant-garde). The Latin American avant-garde art has a rich and colourful history that often remains overlooked by Western academia. It is characterized by an awareness of and reaction to the region’s turbulent and sometimes violent social and political history.\nAvant-garde artists are seen as being on the forefront of the boundaries of artistic practice, experimenting before the public is able to catch up. They are not bound by the strict rules of academic realism that was so popular in the past and thus have the luxury of depicting subject matter that is not instantly recognizable. This opportunity for personal subjectivity promotes aesthetic experimentation leading to evolution of the artistic process (Ramirez and Olea, 2004). The avant-garde rises to the challenge of resolving various conflicts within the creation and appreciation of art. In Paraguay, for example, artists sought to resolve “the opposition between the autonomy of form and the expression of meaning” (Sullivan, 1996). Latin American avant-garde artists deserve the same level of acclaim awarded to Western artists.\nWhat is specifically Latin American cannot be easily designated, but the term has come to signify artists residing in Latin America and artists from Latin American who currently reside in other regions (Sullivan, 1996). The vast amount of ethnicities, cultures and experiences denies the possibility of a universal artistic style, thus all Latin American artists cannot be confined to a particular movement.\nA key element of Latin American culture, which in turn is represented in its art, is hybridization. A mix of ethnicities come together to contribute different elements, creating a rich and unique culture. Although Western artistic practices have been key in igniting artistic experimentation in Latin America, Latin American art remains its own distinct entity and is not derogative of or lesser than Western art. Indigenous, or pre-Colombian, art also contributed techniques and inspiration for avant-garde practices, but it too is a separate genre.\nArtistic experimentation in Latin America is known for expressing strong values concerning the social realities experienced by its people. To use Diego Rivera as an example highlights his method of involving the integration of his personal political values into his art. A supporter of communism, Rivera included Vladimir Lenin in his mural “Man at the Crossroads,” despite disapproval from his American clients. The mural was destroyed before its completion but Rivera went on to recreate it back in Mexico (Lucie-Smith, 1993). There also exists in Latin American culture a shared experience among many a sense of marginalization and dislocation, whether literal or not. Cuban artist Ana Mendieta, for example, was sent away from her family during her childhood to the United States. This sense of exile never left her and is a recurring theme in her work (Sullivan, 1996). These are two examples of artistic practice that push established boundaries and draw the public forward with it.\nAnother way that the political circumstances affect artistic development is the state of the government. The multiple coup-d’états in Brazil not only influenced the opinions of artists but also determined how free they were to express them. Under the rule of Brazilian dictator Getúlio Vargas from 1930 to 1945, for example, there was state support for art because it was seen as a promotion of nationalism (Sulllivan, 1996). Consider a different region: Rivera’s murals in Mexico may not have been so successful if they had not been sanctioned by the state. The political circumstances have a significant effect on the direction and strength of artistic experiment.\nWriter Ferreira Gullar said that “avant-garde art should spring from an analysis of a given country’s social and cultural characteristics, never from advanced ideas imported intact from the developed countries to which they properly apply” (Traba 1994). This sentiment describes the appropriation of Western art into the Latin American avant-garde. Artists work with and further develop movements that are prominent in Western art into their own experimentation, changing Western practices into one that reflects Latin America. As well as partaking in these established movements, the Latin American avant-garde creates some of its own, such as Constructive Universalism – the combination of a variety of movements such as Americanism; Primitivism and Classicism – and Muralism (Sullivan, 1996).\nBecause of the many influences of different ethnicities from within the continent, Latin American art production is a fluid and malleable process of hybridization, using the land’s colonial history and the indigenous, European and African ancestral elements of the culture and people to contribute to the overall artistic practices. Foreign influence also comes in the form of immigration and international study. This hybridity is what makes the Latin American avant-garde unique from the artistic experimentation present in other areas of the world. Avant-garde art in Latin America pushes the limits through a process of being inspired and influenced from both within and beyond its own culture.\nAvant-garde art in Latin America is its own ground-breaking discipline, not a derivative of Western practices. As a result of the varied ethnicities and influences that became a part of the culture as the region broke away from its colonial past, this hybridization unique to Latin America presents a particular cultural experience that influences artistic practices. Avant-garde experimentation also benefits because of a personal experience with the shared political circumstances that often lead to social unrest. This awareness is expressed in many of the works of the region. Latin America possesses a strong avant-garde that deserves its own recognition alongside Western art with artists who use their political awareness and personal or cultural hybridized backgrounds to push artistic experimentation forward.\nChaplik, Dorothy.

Spurred by the Mexican Revolution and succeeding civil war, it sought to reunify the country, but also educate the common man through powerful messages of cultural identity, solidarity, oppression, resistance and progress.\nAlthough it started as a government-backed program, it evolved into a fiercely independent movement that intersected art and politics. It also liberated art from the confines of museums and galleries, bringing it into the public space and making it available to all.\nThe Emergence of Mexican Muralism\nRecognized as the first major political, social and cultural uprising of the 20th century, the Mexican Revolution marked a true break from the past and ushered in a more egalitarian age. Allowing art to speak in its name, it also influenced the country’s biggest art movement.\nAs the nationwide revolt against the regime of dictator Porfirio Díaz was slowly building up, a small intellectual circle led by Antonio Curo, Alfonso Reyes, José Vasconcelos, José Guadalupe Posada and Gerardo Murillo, also known as Dr. Atl, had proposed a manifesto that called for a new art movement in Mexico which would speak to the interests and realities of its people. Proposing a uniquely Mexican artistic voice, this 1906 document came to be an important precursor of the Mexican muralist movement.\nAs the civil war ended and Díaz was overthrown in the 1920s, the new government strived to establish a new era for Mexico and its newly empowered people. As the majority of the country was illiterate, art became an important vehicle for communicating this new identity in the making—an identity based on the country's rich tradition and a sense of moving forward into the modern age.\nBringing together some of the best Mexican artists of the time, the government commissioned murals that aimed to inspire an overall sense of national pride and cultural beauty within the communities as a whole. However, since the artists were given a full freedom of expression, they were often pushing a more radical agenda in their images, resulting in ideological conflicts with their patrons.\nThe Mural as a Vehicle for Change\nMuralism has had a long tradition in the history of Mexico, with its deepest roots dating to pre-Hispanic traditions of the Olmec people. The Mexican Muralist movement brought this ancient medium back and elevated it to a respected art form that had a strong social potential. With its grand scale, innovative iconography and socially relevant message, these murals reoriented history, recovered lost stories and forged new narratives for the people of Mexico.\nGracing the walls of public buildings all around the country, these grandiose works of public art spoke of the social justice, the values of the Revolution, the indigenous Mexican culture, the mixed-race mestizo identity and the pre-Columbian cultural history. Executed in the realistic pictorial style, they portrayed Aztec warriors fighting for their independence from Spanish colonialists, humble peasants fighting in the Revolution, common laborers of Mexico City, and the people of mixed-race.\nAs stated in the Manifesto of the Syndicate of Technical Workers, Painters and Sculptors from 1924, the artists of the movement rejected \"all the ultra-intellectual salon art of the aristocracy and exalt the monumental expression of art because such art is public property.\" Indeed, their murals were, above all, free and accessible to all, undermining the traditionally dominant art market.\nLos Tres Grandes\nAlthough the movement stretched out all the way through the 1970s, the most significant pieces were produced between the 1920s and the 1950s. Working across the country, muralists used art as a political weapon in popular struggles for resistance, state modernization, civic participation, artistic freedom and cultural imperialism.Many of them were socialists or communists, believing in the power of the working classes and in the equal distribution of wealth.\nAlthough hundreds of Mexican artists contributed to the movement, on the forefront of the movement were David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jose Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera—known internationally as \"Los Tres Grandes\" or \"The Big Three.\"\nThe most prolific and historically recognized mural painter in this period, Rivera combined European Modernism and elements of Cubism with the country's traditional bright colors to depict the diversity of the country’s population. His works tackled a variety of themes, ranging from the country's indigenous past to its daily life.\nAn artist who fought in the revolution, Orozco drew from European expressionism to create a dreary depiction of the human suffering, the horrors of war and the fear of a future dependence on technology.\nAnother artist who fought in the Revolution, Siqueiros used progressive techniques and materials and a style often described as futurist to convey progress through the combination of science and machinery.Young and radical, he often depicted socialist themes in a direct way, such as the oppression and struggles of the proletariat.\nDespite their different personalities, ideologies, styles and spheres of influence, all three agreed that art was the highest form of expression that should be a vital part of Mexico's new post-revolutionary identity. For them, art was supposed to serve as a vehicle for education and the progress of society. Over time, their murals transcended borders, engaging major issues that emerged throughout the Americas during the 20th century.\nMexican Mural Painting in the United States\nBesides finding their way into other parts of the Americas, such as Guatemala, Ecuador and Brazil, Mexican mural painting expanded to the United States, especially though the work by Los Tres Grandes. This resulted from the rising ideological disagreements between the artists and the Mexican government who increasingly attempted to impose more control over their themes and subjects. Siqueiros was even exiled from Mexico in 1932 and moved to Los Angeles. Besides exposing their work to a larger audience, their visits to the U.S. had a direct influence upon the development of the country's public art painting.\nOrozco, who was the first to travel to the states in the 1920s, created a mural at Pomona College in Claremont, California as well as in San Francisco and New York. Diego Rivera created important pieces all around the country, most notably in Detroit on the city's automobile industry, while Siqueiros' significant murals still adorn the facades of Los Angeles. While living in the U.S., Siqueiros even held art classes in New York in 1936 dedicated to teaching would-be anti-fascist artists about radical new painting methods and materials. One of his students was Jackson Pollock, whom he encouraged to pursue his art experiments that would become the roots of Abstract Expressionism. Among most politically controversial murals was Rivera's Man at the Crossroads, originally painted at the Rockefeller Center in New York under the sponsorship of Nelson Rockefeller. It was immediately whitewashed by its patron for the inclusion of Lenin's portrait.\nThe movement was also the main inspiration for the Public Works of Art program introduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, established to create employment for artists and craftspeople during the Great Depression. With the Depression providing an environment for public art with social content, the project brought together 3,600 artists to create morale-lifting murals and sculptures for public buildings across the country.\nThe Mexican Muralism movement directly inspired the emergence of Chicano art in 1960s California, established to empower Mexican-Americans through the articulation of their history, aspirations and struggles. For them, the recovery of Mexican Muralism was part of a larger recovery of heritage and identity after a century of deliberate deculturalization by the dominant society. As a result, there is still a variety of vibrant murals across the country that investigate identity, indigenismo, pre-Columbian society, and the fight for farmers' rights.\nThe Lasting Impact and Legacy\nEmerging at the intersection of art and politics, the Mexican Muralist movement reintroduced mural painting back into mainstream 20th-century art, especially as an expression of cultural and social values and as a vehicle for change. Art, which was previously available to a few wealthy collectors, was brought back to the public sphere, becoming accessible to all.\nMexican Muralism opened many doors for the street art and graffiti movement of today as it proposed public art as a freeing medium and a legitimate form of artistic expression that can convey meaning and ideas. In Mexico and South America, the mural continues to be a dominant art form, with a variety of street art projects proliferating across the continent. All around the world, public art continues to demonstrate the transformative power that was first recognized by these groundbreaking Mexican artists, challenging the social, cultural and political establishments. It continues to empower and inspire communities to articulate strategies of change outside of traditional institutions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e03b0e63-fe19-4363-b8e1-8f6e10c5661f>","<urn:uuid:ddc02192-697b-4836-9edd-f9aa9522d56c>"],"error":null}

A Confederate officer, who rode upon this situation\nas it was transpiring, recalled: \"Several engineer officers were superintending the construction of a line of\nrude breastworks...Ten or twelve negroes were engaged in the task of pulling down a rail fence; as many more occupied in carrying\nthe rails, one at a time, and several were busy throwing up the dirt...The [Blacks] thus employed all wore good gray uniforms\nand I was informed that they belonged to the only company of colored troops in the Confederate service, having been enlisted\nby Major Turner in Richmond. Their muskets were stacked, and it was evident that they regarded their present employment in\nno very favorable light.\"\nOn April 10th, as Confederate prisoners were being marched from Sailor's Creek and elsewhere to City Point\n(present day Hopewell) and eventually off to Northern prison camps, a Union chaplain observed the column. This incident\nalong the retreat to Painesville, seems to be the only documented episode of \"official\" Black troops serving the Confederacy\nin Virginia as armed an unit under fire.\nAfrican-Americans also accompanied the Confederate army on the retreat with the First Regiment Engineer Troops\nand provided yeoman service. One member of this unit remembered that they mounded roads, repaired bridges and cut new parallel\nroads to old ones when they became impassable. When this was not possible, an engineer officer would post a group near the\ntrouble spot to extricate wagons and artillery pieces.\nWhen Lee surrendered his army at Appomattox, thirty-six African-Americans were listed on the Confederate paroles.\nMost were either servants, free blacks, musicians, cooks, teamsters or blacksmiths. A Black woman was to become the only civilian\ncasualty in the final fighting at Appomattox. Hannah stayed behind with her husband in the home of Doctor Coleman located\non the battlefield and was mortally wounded by an artillery round. A Union chaplain remembered: \"she was sick\nwith fever and unable to be moved. As she lay upon her bed, a solid shot had passed through one wall of the house at just\nthe right height to strike her arm, and then passed out through the opposite wall.\"\nConfederates paroled at Appomattox Court House include thirty-nine slaves and free blacks:\nQUARTERMASTER'S DEPARTMENT OF THIRD CORPS ORDINANCE TRAIN: 16 Slaves (unnamed) in public service.\nBATTALION: Musicians Enlisted for the War: Joe Parkman Co.

Although enlistments began in 1862, it was not until 1864 that recruitment of blacks gathered momentum. Eventually,\n178,982 men served in 166 regiments in the Union Army. These regiments, designated United States Colored Troops (U.S.C.T.),\nsaw service throughout the South; however, the largest number in any one theater fought in the campaigns against the Army\nof Northern Virginia.\nU.S. Colored Troops in the Retreat to Appomattox The union armies under Lt. General Ulysses S. Grant would\nsever Confederate General Robert E. Lee's supply line to Petersburg on April 2, 1865. Lee would be forced to evacuate the\nConfederate Capital of Richmond and the fortified supply center of Petersburg thus beginning his final campaign of the war.\nWhile most of the United States Colored Troops in the Federal Army were involved with the occupation of Richmond\non the morning of April 3rd, some did enter Petersburg when it fell on the same day. Brigadier General William Birney's second\ndivision, XXV Corps, operating south of the Appomattox River, would be among the first units to come into the city from the\nwest. It was noted that the 7th U.S.C.T. regiment, recruited in Maryland, and the 8th U.S.C.T., from Philadelphia, were on\nthe skirmish line that morning and with those who marched into the evacuated railroad center. The 7th's commander, Lt. Colonel\nOscar E. Pratt, wrote: \"I entered the city of Petersburg at 6 a.m., amidst the joyous acclamations of its sable\ncitizens.\" There were seven Black units (approximately 2,000 men, or 3% of the Federal force) which made the\njourney all the way to Appomattox Court House with Major General Edward Ord's Union Army of the James and arrived in time\nto be involved in the final fighting.\nOn their way they passed through the settlements of Blacks & Whites, Nottoway Court House, Burkeville\nJunction, Rice's Station, and Farmville. From the latter point they stayed south of the Appomattox River and traveled via\nWalker's Church (present day Hixburg) to Appomattox. These regiments were of Colonel William W. Woodward's brigade, the 29th\nand 31st U.S.C.T., along with the 116th U.S.C.T., assigned to them from another brigade. Colonel Ulysses Doubleday's brigade,\n8th, 41st, 45th, and 127th U.S.C.T., were also present. The first brigade, under Colonel James Shaw, Jr., would not arrive\nuntil the day after the surrender, having marched ninety-six miles in four days. His brigade was detached from the others\nand sent back to Sutherland Station for a period of time, causing their delay.\nOn the morning of the 9th at Appomattox Court House, the Black units were sent forward to support other Federal\nunits in the closing phase of the battle. Consequently, only Woodward's brigade participated in the final advance on the Confederate\nline. Some of Doubleday's skirmishers did proceed forward, and the only casualty for the U.S.C.T. brigades was Captain John\nW. Falconer of Company A, 41st U.S.C.T. - a white officer. He was mortally wounded and died on April 23rd. According\nto Surgeon-in-Chief Charles P. Heinchhold: \"during the entire campaign, the U.S.C.T.'s lost 4 men killed, 1 officer\n(mortally) and 30 men wounded, a total of 35 casualties.\"\n\"We, the colored soldiers, have fairly won our rights by loyalty and bravery -- shall we obtain\nthem?

Description:\nThe Civil War stands vivid in the collective memory of the American public. There has always been a profound\ninterest in the subject, and specifically of Blacks' participation in and reactions to the war and the war's outcome. Almost\n200,000 African-American soldiers fought for the Union in the Civil War. Although most were\nilliterate ex-slaves, several thousand were well educated, free black men from the northern states. The 129 letters in this\ncollection were written by black soldiers in the Union army during the Civil War to black and abolitionist newspapers. Continued\nThey provide a unique expression of the black voice that was meant for a\npublic forum. The letters tell of the men's experiences, their fears, and their hopes. They describe in detail their army\ndays--the excitement of combat and the drudgery of digging trenches. Some letters give vivid descriptions of battle; others\nprotest racism; while others call eloquently for civil rights. Many describe their conviction that they are fighting\nnot only to free the slaves but to earn equal rights as citizens. These letters give an extraordinary picture of the war and\nalso reveal the bright expectations, hopes, and ultimately the demands that black soldiers had for the future--for themselves\nand for their race. As first-person documents of the Civil War, the letters are strong statements of the American dream of\njustice and equality, and of the human spirit.\nReading: Black Union\nSoldiers in the Civil War. Description: This book refutes the historical slander\nthat blacks did not fight for their emancipation from slavery. At first harshly rejected in their attempts to enlist in the\nUnion army, blacks were eventually accepted into the service—often through the efforts of individual generals who, frustrated\nwith bureaucratic inaction in the face of dwindling forces, overrode orders from the secretary of war and even the president.\nBy the end\nof the Civil War, African American soldiers had numbered more than 180,000 and served in 167 regiments. Seventeen were awarded\nthe nation’s highest award for valor and heroism--the Medal of Honor.\nTheirs was a remarkable achievement whose full story is finally revealed.\nThe Sable Arm: Black Troops in the Union Army, 1861-1865 (Modern War Studies).

Description: Although countless books\nhave been written about the Civil War, the role of black troops has been consistently underrepresented until recently. Nearly\n180,000 of them fought--mostly for the North, but a handful even took up arms for the slaveholding South. Many wanted to serve\nat the start of the conflict, but a variety of factors kept them on the sidelines. Until Lincoln's\nEmancipation Proclamation in 1862, many Union leaders--including the president--held that the war was not about slavery. Racist\nviews caused some to question further the value of black soldiers; there was also genuine concern about how Confederates would\ntreat captured blacks. Continued below...\nBut, as Noah Andre Trudeau reveals,\nblack soldiers demonstrated bravery and professionalism from the moment they suited up. He recounts well-known events, such\nas the 54th Massachusetts'\nattack on Fort Wagner,\nas well as less familiar ones, such as blacks' involvement in the war's last directed combat one month after Lee's surrender.\nThere were atrocities, too: in 1864, Confederates slaughtered black prisoners of war at Fort Pillow (Southern historians once disputed\nthis brutal act of cold-blooded murder, but most scholars accept it as true today).

The Weir 30 skimmer has significantly greater oil removal capability compared to the Grease Grabber.","context":["Efficient Removal of Floating Grease and Heavy Oil\nThe Abanaki Grease Grabber is a dependable and effective means of removing floating grease and oil from water, under the most demanding conditions. The Grease Grabber makes use of the differences in specific gravity and surface tension between oil and water. These physical characteristics allow the skimmer belt to attract grease, oil, and other hydrocarbon liquids as the belt passes through the surface of the water.\nThe skimmer belt specifically selected for your application (see Belt Selection page). Texture pinch rollers pull the belt over the idler pulley and through the angled wiper blades, where grease is removed before passing through the pinch rollers. The grease is rolled off into a heated hopper, which maintains fluidity for easy drainage through a 4\" ID discharge port. Belt tension is maintained by the weight of a free riding tail pulley. The tail pulley is tethered to the underside of the Grease Grabber to prevent accidental loss.\n- Removes floating grease and oil from water\n- Elevates skimmed grease up to 100 feet or more, for easy discharge into drums\n- Removes up to 160 gallons of grease per hour\n- Reduces fluid disposal costs\n- Helps meet government requirements for water discharge\n- Large,160 gph, removal capacity\n- High temperature capability\n- Requires only a 28\" X 9\" (71.12cm x 22.86cm) mounting area\n- Maintains skimming efficiency with fluctuating fluid level\n- Fast set-up, easy cleaning, and minimal maintenance\n- Operates in turbulent liquids (with optional tail pulley, belt cage and tether assembly)\nRugged Construction for Harsh Conditions -The construction of the Grease Grabber has a rugged simplicity that is designed to last 20 years or longer.

The weir skimmer selectively recovers oil over the top of the central weir sited just below the slick’s upper surface by gravity’s force into a primary reservoir where it is pumped to storage. The Weir Oil Skimmer system consists of a pump + floating system + powerpack + hose reel + remote control.\nWith a self-adjustable weir, the forward motion of the skimming system provides the flow into the skimmer. Depending on the weir opening’s size, the skimmer will accept most of what it encounters, allowing it to handle highly viscous oils. Advancing Weir Skimmer typically recovers large volumes of water; oil/water separation should be considered to increase overall efficiency. The weir skimmer creates a current that induces the weir’s oil flow, and this concentrating effect increases recovery efficiency.\nThe Weir Oil Skimmer system is usually all hydraulically operated; optional diesel, gas, or electric hydraulic power packs, pneumatic or electric power, and manual or remote operation are possible. With the Continuous self-floating umbilical and thruster system, Weir Oil Skimmer gets the motion capability up to 150 meters.\nThe pump can be integrated or external for Weir Skimmer and removed from the skimmer, and used as a tanker offloading pump.\nThe integrated centrifugal screw pump does not require priming, handle viscous oil, is tolerant of most types of debris, and do not form oil/water emulsions.\nAn external pump can install to the weir skimmer. The skimming head of the weir skimmer is typically small and maneuverable, allowing its use in confined spaces such as among dock pilings.\nThe skimmer handles all oil types, from light diesel fuel to heavy crude oil mixed with debris.

{"question":"How to understand what determines the type of biome in a specific region?","answer":"Only two primary factors determine what biome exists in a given region: temperature and precipitation. These can be analyzed using a Whittaker diagram, where average annual temperature is shown on the x-axis and average annual precipitation on the y-axis. For example, areas that are hot and dry become deserts, while areas that are hot and wet become tropical rainforests. Areas with intermediate values of temperature and precipitation can become tropical seasonal forests, tropical savanna, grasslands, taiga, or temperate forests.","context":["Mastering Environmental Science Focus on Figures Video Transcript\nThis is a transcript of the video on the Educator Features page.\nHi, this is Justin St. Juliana from Cornell University, and in this Focus on Figures video, we'll be looking at this group of graphs to learn what they can tell us about biomes. Biomes are large regions of the earth defined by the plant communities that live there. And as you can see, there are a variety of biomes scattered around the earth. Yet, interestingly, only two factors primarily determine what biome is in a given region -- temperature and precipitation.\nToday, we'll explore both this central figure known as the Whittaker diagram as well as the figures on the periphery known as climatographs or climate diagrams. Let's start by exploring how temperature and precipitation interact on the Whittaker diagram.\nOn the x-axis of this graph, we have average annual temperature. Although temperatures may fluctuate over the course of the year, these values represent the yearly averages. On our graph, as we move from the right to the left, we go from areas of low temperature to areas of high temperature.The second major factor is the average annual precipitation. As we go from the bottom to the top, the amount of precipitation increases.\nNow that we know the axes, let's take a look at how this relates to the biome with a given temperature and precipitation combination.\nAs you might expect, at an extreme, such as areas that are hot and dry, we find deserts. In areas that are hot and wet, we find tropical rainforests. And in areas that are cold and dry, we find tundra. At intermediate values, we find tropical seasonal forests, tropical savanna, grasslands, taiga, and temperate forests.\nNow that we know the basics of this graph, we can explore each biome in more detail by looking at something known as a climatograph. Let's examine these graphs using a temperate deciduous forest as an example.\nAt the top of climatographs, we find some basic information: the name of the biome, the location, average annual temperature, and average annual precipitation. The key aspect of the climatograph is that it allows us to look at the location month by month. So in the graph space on the x-axis, we see the months listed from January to December. On the right axis, we have the temperature in degrees Celsius. On the left axis, we have precipitation in millimeters. For any given month, we see the average monthly temperature indicated with the red line and total monthly precipitation indicated with the blue bars.\nIn the case of this temperate deciduous forest, temperature fluctuates during the year as seasons change, but precipitation in the form of rain and snow remains fairly constant, at about 100 millimeters per month. A climate diagram will be associated with a given biome. For example, a tropical rainforest has high temperature and precipitation year round, whereas this taiga has highly seasonal temperature and precipitation.\nAs you can see, the climatographs differ for each biome. Both the graphs we explore today use information about temperature and precipitation to evaluate what biome is in a given region.\nNow that you understand this topic, consider where you live. What's the average annual temperature? What's the average annual precipitation? What biome are you in? What would a climate diagram look like for your region?\nThanks for watching."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1910c8cc-408b-49a6-a347-aff0cd0fa72e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between buying a car from a dealer vs privately when it comes to warranties and guarantees, similar to how horse sales handle guarantees?","answer":"When buying from a dealer, cars must be of merchantable quality, fit for purpose, and as described, providing consumer law protection. In contrast, private car sales generally do not come with warranties, similar to how most horse sales are conducted without guarantees. However, in horse sales, buyers can specifically request written warranties about the horse's characteristics to be included in the contract, while with private car sales, buyers have little recourse beyond civil court action if problems arise. The key protection in both cases is getting professional inspection before purchase - a mechanic for cars and a vet check for horses.","context":["How to Understand Horse-Related Contracts\nBy Karen L. Weslowski, LL.B., Litigation Lawyer\nTraditionally, business in the horse industry has been conducted on the basis of a handshake. However, written contracts are becoming more common in the purchase and sale of horses as well as the provision of services such as training, leasing, breeding and boarding. Depending upon the wording of the contract, written contracts can provide greater certainty as to the rights and obligations of all parties involved. Given the increasing use of contracts in the horse business, horse owners may find it useful to arm themselves with some basic knowledge of contract law. This article will discuss the basic elements of a contract, provide readers with some tips on drafting a contract for the purchase and sale of a horse and finally, discuss one of the most commonly used contracts in the horse business, the breeding contract.\nBasic Elements of a Contract\nA contract is an agreement, either written or oral, with specific terms between two or more people (or corporations) in which there is a promise to do something in return for a valuable benefit, known in the law as “consideration.” In order for a contract to exist, the following things are required:\n1. An Offer\nAn offer signifies the willingness by one person to enter into a contract with another person. Sometimes there is uncertainty as to whether an offer was truly made. If no offer was made, there will be no enforceable contract. For instance, what if a potential buyer says to a seller of a horse that “they would pay $5,000.00 for the horse.” Does that constitute an offer to purchase the horse for $5,000.00 or is it merely an expression of what the potential buyer thinks the horse is worth?\nIf a dispute arises between the parties as to whether an offer was made, the Court will look at the language of the offer or the conduct of the person in making the offer to see if there is any evidence of that person’s intention to enter into a binding contract.\n2. Acceptance of the Offer\nIn order for a valid contract to exist, there must be acceptance of the offer which results in a “meeting of the minds.” For instance, in a boarding contract, the buyer and the seller must agree on the price of board. If they do not, there is no “meeting of the minds.”\nIf there is a dispute between the parties, a Court will look at whether an objective, reasonable bystander would find that the parties entered into a contract. The subjective beliefs and intentions of the parties are not considered by the Court in determining whether there was a “meeting of the minds.”\n3. Valuable Consideration\nIn order to be legally enforceable, there must be an exchange of “valuable consideration” between the parties. “Valuable consideration” means that both parties are giving something to the other. For example, in the purchase and sale of a horse, the sale price paid by the buyer constitutes the “valuable consideration” to the seller and receipt of the horse is “valuable consideration” for the buyer. The amount of the consideration does not generally have any effect on the validity of the contract. A contract can be valid even if the consideration is only a dollar.\n4. Certainty of the Contractual Terms\nSometimes there is confusion as to what the parties to the contract actually agreed to do. In order to be enforceable, the terms of a contract must be certain. In other words, upon reading the contract, it must be clear as to what the parties agreed to as part of the contract.\nDrafting a Contract for Purchase and Sale\nContracts do not need to be in writing to be enforceable. However, if a dispute arises, it is often difficult to prove the existence and terms of an oral contract. As such, when possible, contracts should be put in writing. If the parties wish to draft their own contract without the assistance of a lawyer, the following information should be included in the contract. This information is required, at a minimum, in order to satisfy the basic requirements of a contract discussed above. Depending upon the value of the horse and the terms of the sale, the parties may require additional terms and conditions not discussed below.\n1. The Names of the Parties to the Contract\nThe contract should include the full names and addresses of all the parties to the contract. It is helpful to identify the parties by their respective role in the contract. For instance, in a contract for the purchase and sale of a horse, the contract should indicate which person is the seller and which person is the buyer.\nIf the horse is registered, the name of the seller on the contract must be the same person listed as the horse’s owner on the registration papers, otherwise the seller’s right to sell the horse could be questioned. At the time of the sale, the buyer should also ensure that the appropriate papers are signed in order to transfer the horse’s registration from the seller to the buyer.\n2. Identify the Horse\nWhen drafting contracts for the purchase and sale of a horse, a detailed description of the horse should be included. Include the horse’s name, age, breed, colour, markings and registration number (if any). The parties may also wish to attach a photograph of the horse to the contract.\n3. The Terms of the Sale\nIn a contract of purchase and sale, the following terms should be included:\n- The sale price;\n- If the sale price is paid in full at the time the contract is signed, set that out;\n- If the sale price of the horse is to be reduced on account of a trade between the seller and buyer, set out the terms of the trade clearly (including what is being traded and its value);\n- If the contract allows for payment by instalments, the contract should clearly set out when each payment is due, if any interest charges apply and how interest will be calculated, who is to retain possession of the horse until the sale price is paid in full and what happens if the buyer fails to make the payments as required by the contract; and\n- If there are any terms about the delivery of the horse, those terms should be included (for example: is the seller going to deliver the horse to the buyer and if so, will the buyer reimburse the seller for those expenses?).\n4. Date the Contract\nInclude the date of the contract because the date can often become important if a dispute later arises with respect to some aspect of the contract.\nRelated: Understanding Leasing Contracts\n5. Guarantees or Warranties\nA new car comes with a warranty which guarantees aspects of the car’s parts and performance. However, the same cannot be said of a horse. Most often, horses are sold without any promises by the seller as to the horse’s characteristics or ability. Buyers are more likely to require written contracts which contain specific representations and warranties about the horse. For instance, if, in buying a horse, a buyer relies upon a particular statement by the seller (for example: the seller tells the buyer that the horse is a “proven broodmare” and the buyer purchases the horse to use as a broodmare), the buyer may wish to have the seller’s statement included in the contract. In the event the horse is not a proven broodmare, the buyer has greater recourse against the seller for misrepresenting the qualities of the horse. For this example, the wording could be as follows: “The seller represents and warrants that the horse (state the horse’s name and registration number, if any) is a proven broodmare.”\nProvided the seller receives the sale price in full, the seller may not be as concerned with the terms of the contract, or whether it is even in writing. However, in order to protect themselves from future claims by an unsatisfied buyer, a seller may wish to include a disclaimer in the contract which expressly states that the horse was sold “as is” with no warranties or representations regarding the horse’s performance, ability or soundness. When showing a horse for sale a seller may make oral statements to the buyer about the horse (for example: “this horse is bombproof”).\nIn order to fully protect themselves, a seller may wish to include a statement in the contract that any previous oral statements by the seller are not binding and do not constitute representations or warranties. If the seller does not include such a term, a disappointed buyer could later take legal action against the seller on the basis that the seller misrepresented the horse to the buyer. A seller may also wish to include an “entire agreement clause”, which specifies that the only terms of the contract are those written terms contained in the contract.\n6. The Vet Check\nIf the buyer declines to have the horse vet checked before buying it, the seller may wish to include a term to this effect in the contract. This protects the seller in the event that the horse goes lame shortly after the sale (unless it can be proved that the seller misrepresented the horse’s soundness to the buyer).\nIf the buyer is paying for the horse in instalments, the seller should require the buyer to place insurance on the horse at the buyer’s expense until the horse is fully paid for. The minimum amount of the insurance should be the amount of the unpaid balance. The seller should be named as the loss payee on the insurance policy.\nAll of the parties to the contract should sign it.\nBreeding contracts are commonly used in the horse business and can differ from other types of contracts because of the terms and conditions they contain. Whether you are the stallion owner or the broodmare owner, it is helpful to have an understanding of the standard terms of a breeding contract.\nMare owners must ensure that all conditions of a live foal guarantee, such as vaccination of the mare, are satisfied. Photo: iStock/Kerrick\nFor the mare owner, one of the most important terms of the breeding contract is the live foal guarantee. This term of the breeding contract should be read carefully as the protection provided by the guarantee can vary depending upon the wording used. Some breeding contracts specify that a “live foal” is simply a foal that stands and nurses. However, other breeding contracts impose a temporal aspect to the live foal definition (for instance: “a live foal means a foal that stands and nurses without assistance for a period of at least 48 hours from the time of birth”). Obviously, the better guarantee for the mare owner is the definition of a live foal that stands and nurses without assistance for a period of at least 48 hours from the time of birth. In order for the live foal guarantee to apply, breeding contracts may require mare owners to satisfy certain conditions, such as vaccinating the mare for Rhinopneumonitis in the fifth, seventh and ninth months of the mare’s pregnancy. If the mare owner fails to do so or fails to provide proof of the vaccinations to the stallion owner, the live foal guarantee may not apply. Mare owners should ensure that they read their breeding contract thoroughly and ensure that all conditions necessary to satisfy the live foal guarantee are met.\nAs well, if the mare fails to conceive, in order to rebreed the mare, the breeding contract may require that the mare owner notify the stallion owner and provide written certification by a veterinarian. The failure to do so may void the mare owner’s right to rebreed the mare. Mare owners may also wish to consider whether the breeding contract allows them to substitute a different mare to rebreed in the event that the first mare does not conceive within the breeding season specified in the contract. Mare owners should be aware that breeding contracts may impose a re-handling fee for rebreeding.\nWhen drafting their breeding contract, stallion owners will want to ensure that their contracts contain such terms as a limitation of liability clause, which provides that the stallion owner is not legally responsible for any sickness, death, disease or injury suffered by the mare and/or foal during the time the mare and/or foal is in the stallion owner’s custody.\nAs well, if the stallion is being shown, stallion owners may wish to include a term in their breeding contract which allows the stallion to be removed from the farm for the purpose of showing. It may be that a mare comes into heat when the stallion is away at a show and the mare is unable to be bred. To avoid any problems arising from this scenario, the contract would specify that it is the mare owner’s responsibility to check on the availability of the stallion for breeding during these times.\nMain photo: iStock/Ferrantraite","Cars - your rights when things go wrong\nIf you buy a second hand car from a dealer, you have some protection under consumer law. However, if you buy privately, you do not have the same consumer rights because the person selling the car is not selling it as part of their business.\nYour rights when you buy from a dealer\nWhen you buy from a dealer, the car should be:\n- Of merchantable quality – it should be of reasonable, acceptable quality given the age and history of the car\n- Fit for the purpose intended and roadworthy\n- As described – it should match the description given verbally or in an advertisement.\nIt is an offence for a dealer to provide misleading information about the car including its history, specification and any repair work needed. A dealer must not give you misleading information about themselves such as any authorisation they claim to have, their after sales service or any code of practice in place. It is also an offence under consumer law for a dealer to withhold information when selling a car. There are a number of things to watch out for when buying a second hand car. Our car buyer’s checklist (pdf) will also help you to ask the right questions.\nYour rights when you buy privately\nYou do not have the same consumer rights if you are buying a car from a private seller. Generally, private sales do not come with a warranty so you should ask a mechanic to check the car before you buy it. You should always get the seller’s address or telephone number so that you can contact them if you have problems later on. Always know what to look out for when buying privately. Use our handy downloadable car buyer's checklist (pdf) to help you keep track and make sure you get all the answers you need.\nIf you buy a car from a private seller and discover a problem, there may be little you can do beyond taking a civil case through the courts. Because of this you should be very careful when buying from a private seller and you really need to be aware of what you’re buying. Remember, a private seller may not have all the answers, so it is important for you to have the car checked by a mechanic.\nCar clocking is where a car’s mileage has been adjusted to show that it has done less miles than it actually has. Car clocking puts the safety of road users at risk as the more wear and tear on a car the higher the risk of a breakdown or accident. It is illegal to sell a clocked car. If you believe you have been sold a clocked car or that the seller misrepresented the mileage you should report this as soon as possible to the Gardaí. You can also contact us. We investigate all complaints and take action where warranted. However, we cannot investigate a suspected clocked car if you have had it for more than two years, or if the garage which sold it to you has closed.\nBe careful - are you buying a car that is still under a finance agreement?\nCheck the registration documents of a second hand car to make sure that it is not already owned by a finance company. If this is the case, the person trying to sell you the car does not actually own it and does not have the right to sell it to you – even though they may have the log book and registration documents. If you buy a car under an existing car finance agreement, you run the risk of the car being repossessed by the owner (the finance company). There is a much higher risk of this happening if you buy from a private seller so be sure to check. Hire Purchase Information Ltd keeps records of cars subject to HP agreements. You can request a copy of a vehicle finance report through their website for a small fee.\nWhat to do if something goes wrong\nIf you feel you have been misled about any aspect of the car or if something goes wrong after buying the car, you should:\n- Contact the seller immediately and ask what they intend to do about the problem. If the car is under warranty, check the terms and conditions to see what it says about the seller’s obligations. Your normal consumer rights may still apply.\n- If the seller is a member of the Society of Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), the contract you signed when buying the car may require you to go through the SIMI complaints process. The investigation and complaints service of SIMI deals with complaints relating to:\n- buying used vehicles from SIMI member companies and\n- service or repairs of vehicles by SIMI member companies except those subject to a manufacturer’s warranty claim. For more information, check out the website www.simi.ie.\n- If your contract does not require you to go through the SIMI complaints process, or if you’ve gone through the process and you disagree with the outcome, you can take legal action to try to get a resolution to the problem. If your claim does not exceed €2,000, you have the option of making a claim against the seller through the Small Claims procedure.\n- If you bought a car privately, you cannot go through the Small Claims procedure because you cannot take a case against another consumer. However, you can still consider legal action by consulting with a solicitor.\n- The Small Claims procedure does not deal with cases relating to finance agreements, including hire purchase agreements, as you do not own the car until you make the last payment.\n- You may want to get an independent mechanic to check the car out on your behalf and write a report on the fault that has occurred. If the report states that the fault should not be occurring in a car of its age and condition then you may be able to use this report to make a claim against the garage."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:81a32a48-c557-4de2-b7cf-94ff6106cea2>","<urn:uuid:8a0fc998-8361-48d0-8f20-035f30103c55>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For a manufacturing facility looking to improve efficiency, what is the relationship between proper manual handling practices and measurable business performance?","answer":"Manual handling practices directly impact both worker safety and business performance. Poor handling techniques can lead to musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), causing pain, discomfort, and inability to work, particularly when workers perform repetitive tasks or work under time pressure. To measure the business impact, companies should track specific metrics before and after implementing proper handling procedures and training. These measurements should include performance indicators like production rates and accident statistics. For example, with proper training costing around $20,600 for 20 workers, companies can see a 10% increase in productivity and 20% decrease in errors, resulting in potential savings of $80,000 in one year. This improvement comes from combining proper material handling techniques, like using mechanical aids and choosing lighter materials, with well-planned training programs.","context":["Simple Guide to Manual Handling and Lifting explained\nIt’s not always the big dramatic injury risks, like plummeting through a roof, that need to be watched out for – though they get the most attention.\nMore everyday pain, discomfort, and inability to work is caused by simple things done often – like a bit of lifting the wrong way, too much twisting, or trying to move something a bit too big.\nHave You Experienced Musculoskeletal Disorder?\nNot surprisingly, the construction industry has the highest rates of musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) in all the UK. MSD is basically injury to muscles, joints, tendons or the spine, leading to all sorts of aches and pains. And sometimes permanent disability.\nThe biggest culprit? Manual handling.\nThis basically means lifting, pushing and pulling, lowering ad carrying. And the workers most at risk are scaffolders, bricklayers, ground workers, electricians, demolition workers and general labourers. So pretty much everyone in the industry.\n“I’m in Construction – how the heck do I avoid lifting things!?”\nFirst, like all health & safety, be aware. Just knowing which activities should be come with some care – and more importantly, your workers knowing – will reduce the chances of injury!\nRisky Jobs & Working Conditions\nInjuries come from three things in combination;\n– Your physical ability\n– The weight or force needed for the job\n– The environment, including the weather\nThe 9 big MSD culprits\nWatch out for these, and start thinking along the same lines – you’ll notice plenty of risks on your work site!\n- Bending and twisting, common in plastering\n- Lifting, carrying, lowering heavy materials, like roof tiles\n- Pushing and pulling heavy things, like barrows\n- Smaller but very repetitive tasks, like brick, block, kerb or slab-laying, pipe work, etc.\n- Working in awkward positions, like crouching or bending\n- Working in restricted places, like tucked up in a roof void\n- Time pressure on jobs, leading workers to take risks and try to use brute force\n- Lack of mechanical assistance\n- Working too long without breaks\nYou can see these conditions are quite easy to watch out for once you start taking them seriously. And when you educate your workers to a degree where they start taking it seriously too, then you’ll suddenly see cases of MSD dropping quickly.\nAs always the HSE has a very detailed five-step procedure to mitigating and limiting manual handling risks as much as possible. You can go through it here: MSD and Manual Handling\nBut in the mean time, here are;\nSix Quick Top Tips for Knocking MSD on the Head\n- Choose lighter materials where possible. Avoid the heavy stuff if you can. This goes for bags of things too, like cement and sand.\n- Use mechanical aids wherever possible, and encourage their use and careful maintenance. Use lifting equipment for any lifting.\n- Plan the site layout in advance to avoid the need for much lifting and carrying. For example, have loads placed next to machinery instead of across the site.\n- Think about which workers are best suited to which jobs, considering size, strength and training.\n- Avoid all repetitive lifting where possible. Such as moving heavy blocks or lintels.\n- Train your workers really well, in all of this and how to use the right mechanical or machine aids.\nThere you have it. If you apply these with care, you’ll do a great deal of good.\nAnd your workers’ backs will thank you for it too!\n- Muscoskeletal Disorder is very common in construction. The main cause is manual handling. Especially manual handling done badly.\n- Watch out for repetitive movements, and movement that requires great bodily force.\n- Choose lighter materials, prepare in advance so lifting will be avoided, use mechanical aids.\n- Train your workers well!\nNow it’s your turn\nDo you have any questions about manual lifting?\nOr have you implemented procedures to reduce the risk on your sites?\nLet us know, we’d love to chat.","Return-on-Investment (ROI) in Training Workers\nby Ron Kurtus (revised 6 April 2012)\nA company may see the need to train some of its workers to have new skills, to reflect new company policies, or to avoid workplace problems. In order to determine the return on the investment required to train the workers (ROI), a specific purpose for the training must be stated and measurements must be made before and after the training.\nTraining workers, managers and other personnel in-house can be a costly proposition. Not only must a company pay the wages of the trainers, but training takes workers off the job. To justify this training expense, management usually wants to see what sort of return they are getting on their investment.\nTo determine the return-on-investment (ROI), distinct goals must be set for the training and measurements made before and after.\nQuestions you may have include:\n- What determines the initial measurements?\n- What are the costs and savings in training workers?\n- What is an example of the ROI?\nThis lesson will answer those questions.\nMeasurements must be made before the training starts to really determine what sort of ROI there is from the training. Measurements must be translated into dollars. The question here is how much does it cost the company for the person to do a certain amount of work?\nThese measurements are also useful in determining the need for training and are part of the process of selling the idea to management. Unfortunately, training decisions are sometimes based on a \"gut feeling\" instead of true measurements.\nMust reflect objective\nThese initial measurements must reflect the objective of the training, which is usually improved performance or reduction of losses. The objective may also be to increase the usefulness or value of the workers to the company through learning new skills.\nPerformance measurements are essentially how much work is completed in a given time. It could be how many units are made on the assembly line, how long it takes a secretary to type a memo, or how many sales a salesperson closes in a month.\nThe same measurement must then be done after the training.\nMeasuring result of new skill\nIf a new skill is to be learned, its overall value to the company must be determined. Secretaries may have to learn to use spreadsheet software, assembly workers may need to learn to use new machinery, and managers may need to project management skills.\nThe productivity of an area of work—and not the individual worker—must be measured before and after new skills are taught.\nMeasuring losses and waste\nSafety, equipment maintenance, and personnel issues are important areas to reduce losses due to personal injury, insurance rates, equipment failure, and lawsuits. The goal of the training is to reduce the losses and to verify that reduction.\nAccident statistics in a work area is a good example of information on which to base any improvements due to the training. It is necessary that such information be available before the training starts. It is also useful in analyzing the type of training necessary.\nOften initial loss or waste metric can be indicated in the cost of doing business in an area. Reduction of losses should then be reflected in reduced costs after the training.\nMeasuring result of soft skills\nThe training of managers on \"soft skills\" such as listening and empowering the workers are not easily measured. The effectiveness of a manager is often measured on how well his or her workers perform. Sometimes managers are judged on their political skills, despite the performance of their workers.\nIt is very difficult to measure the results of training in soft skills, and many companies wonder if it really is worth the investment.\nTranslating into money\nThese initial measurements must be translated into dollars over a period of time to late. What it is saying is how much a person is worth to the company.\nTraining cost and ROI\nAfter initial measurements are made, the actual cost of training the workers must be calculated, measurement of performance or such must be repeated, so that the ROI can be calculated.\nCost of training\nThe cost of in-house training consists of the hourly cost of the trainers, the hourly cost of the workers, and the lost work of the workers. In cases where workers are at distant facilities, travel costs and per diem for the trainers must be added. The assumption is that the training is done in the facility, but if it is done outside, those costs must also be added in.\nHourly cost consists of hourly pay (or equivalent hourly pay, if a salaried employee) plus the burdened amount to cover insurance, benefits and such. In some cases, overhead is also included in this cost.\nCost of lost work\nWhen an employee is not working, the company may be losing money due to lowered production. In the case of sales representatives, there may be lost sales opportunities during that training period.\nThe return-on-investment calculation Management wants to see some sort of return from the money spent on training their personnel. Final measurements must be made to verify the improvement and a comparison made to establish a ROI.\nSuppose a company wanted to reduce the lost sales from 20 of their salesmen. They send these salesmen to five days of skill-based sales training. Before they were sent to training, their manager notes that they only close 50% of sales demonstrations.\nEach salesman sells about $200,000 worth of goods of which the company makes 10%.\nCost of workers\nThe salesmen make a $40,000 per year salary, with burdened wages (adding in FICA, insurance and such) of $52,000 per year.\nIf each worker is making a burdened wage of $800 per week, the output for the work done is $800,000 for 50 weeks.\nSuppose the company charges $900,000 for the services provided by these workers, but due to $20,000 worth of mistakes, their profit is $80,000 for the year for the 20 workers.\nConsider a 5-day training session for 20 workers with one trainer:\n1. Cost of trainer\nIf the trainer is making $40,000 per year, the burdened wages (adding in FICA, insurance and such) would be around $52,000 or $1000 for the week.\n2. Cost of training material\nPurchasing the training material could be $100 per student or $2000 for the 20 workers. Preparing training material in-house cost more up-front, but would them average out to be less in the long run.\n3. Cost of wages paid during training\nIf each worker is making a burdened wage of $800 per week, the cost in wages for the training session would be $16,000.\n4. Cost of lost opportunities\nFinally, the company loses money when workers are off the job because of lost opportunities or production. Suppose they only make 10% profit from the work done. That adds another $1600 to the cost of the training.\nThe total cost of training the 20 workers for a week in this example is: $20,600.\nSuppose after the 20 workers attended the 5-day training session and when they returned to work, their new skills resulted in a 10% increase in production and a 20% decrease in errors.\nA typical example for training 20 employees is that if the workers are now only 10% more productive, the result is a savings of $80,000 in one year.\nThe ROI would be $80,000 for a $20,600 investment or about a 4X ROI.\nAlso, improved safety training may show no immediate impact, but it reduces the potential of extremely costly lawsuits or insurance payments in the future.\nDefining a training goal and making initial measurements are very important in establishing the ROI from training. You must also establish the cost of the training and make measurements over a period of time to verify its value.\nDefine what you want to do before doing it.\nResources and references\nQuestions and comments\nDo you have any questions, comments, or opinions on this subject?

{"question":"I'm looking to buy a house in a warm climate - can someone tell me how Caribbean traditional houses and Spanish style homes compare in terms of keeping cool? 🏠","answer":"Both Caribbean traditional houses and Spanish style homes are well-adapted to warm climates, but they use different cooling strategies. Caribbean buildings traditionally feature deep wraparound verandahs to catch breezes and provide shade, porches looking toward water, and windows with shutters for ventilation. They also use stone walls to store the cool of the night. Spanish style homes, on the other hand, rely on clay or terra cotta roofs with half-moon shaped shingles for natural insulation and heat reflection. They feature numerous small windows throughout to maintain airflow, avoid heavy draperies and carpets, and use hardwood or tile flooring. Both styles effectively manage heat through natural ventilation and climate-appropriate materials.","context":["Losing the Plot\nWords by Steve Mouzon and Juliet Austin\nArchitecture is a powerful storyteller. Making spaces into places, local narratives are woven into the foundations, creating built landscapes that are alive and constantly evolving. Prior to World War II, you would have been hard pushed to find an architecture anywhere on earth so well-attuned to regional conditions, climate and culture as in the Caribbean. However, with the dawn of new technology, an increase in social and financial mobility and the power of tourism, the voice of the Caribbean vernacular has all but been silenced, relegating its architecture to a stylised pastiche.\nIncreasingly, Caribbean buildings are being torn down and replaced with construction that could be from anywhere rather than somewhere. Today, a new building in most Caribbean cities might pass for one in any number of US states. Walk through many of the region’s cities, and you will notice two things: most of the old buildings are falling down, and the new ones look like they were lifted straight out of Orlando’s sprawl. These uninspired structures have no business being in the Caribbean. Yet perhaps the most mind-numbing aspect of this homogeneity is the monumental disconnect that has lead to an increasing loss of regional identity.\nTHE BUCK STOPS HERE\nModernist architects of the early twentieth century advocated for an international architectural style not formed by any particular place, but rather by an industrial aesthetic. They promoted ‘factory made’ architecture: clean lines and sparse surfaces. New materials and technology certainly lead to a revolution of ‘better’ buildings but not to the evolution of better places. With the architect assuming the role of authority, the living tradition of island wisdom was sidelined.\nConcurrently, the construction industry’s attempt to remodel itself, rejected locally sourced materials and adopted a similar industrial paradigm. Locally-available materials suited to climatic conditions and environmental factors were eschewed in favour of prefabricated items, signalling the end of individuality. No matter the differences in geographical characteristics, the unique demands for shelter and comfort dictated by temperature, topography or history. No matter the patterns of colonial rule or cultural influences. Contemporary architecture embraced a stylised Caribbean ‘look’ driven by the desire to encapsulate the ‘pleasure islands’ as a global icon. ‘Cookie-cutter’ architecture was born, flaunting Victorian gingerbread and a bright palette of colours so often mistakenly recognised as the Caribbean vernacular.\n“IN THIS BRIGHT FUTURE, YOU CAN’T FORGET YOUR PAST…”\nArchitect, Frank Lloyd Wright once commented that, “Without an architecture of our own, we have no soul in our civilisation.” Fortunately, some areas have avoided the fate of placeless architecture – some by being too poor in recent years to pull down their buildings and rebuild, others due to dedicated preservation efforts.\nArchitect, Frank Lloyd Wright once commented that, “Without an architecture of our own, we have no soul in our civilisation.” Fortunately, some areas have avoided the fate of placeless architecture – some by being too poor in recent years to pull down their buildings and rebuild, others due to dedicated preservation efforts.One such place is Dunmore Town on Harbour Island, The Bahamas. Situated just north of Eleuthera, Harbour Island looks east across the vast Atlantic, with almost no other lands between itself and Europe. There, Bahamian cottages are compact in plan, framed with porches looking toward the water to catch the sea breezes. Slender chamfered porch posts are connected with benches, enabling the porch to seat twice as many people as it otherwise might. Lit and ventilated with dormer windows, almost every cottage has an upper level tucked under the roof. Windows feature solid shutters to protect against hurricane winds, with the open shutters increasing the horizontal proportion of the dormers and accentuating the low sheltering feel of the cottages.\nSimilarly, Grand Cayman’s Pedro St. James is the finest building in the Cayman Islands. Long sitting in ruins, it was meticulously restored in recent decades from old photographs showing its ancient condition. Heavy masonry piers ring the lower level, while upper level columns are built of chamfered wood. Deep wraparound verandahs catch breezes coming from all directions making it possible to sit comfortably in their shade even on the hottest afternoon. Storing the cool of the night in the stone walls, louvers protect against the absorption of heat during the day.\nIn Trinidad de Cuba, economic austerity means that little has changed since the Cuban Revolution of the late 1950’s. Consequently, the historic centre is a treasure trove of heavy masonry courtyard buildings laid out in classic Spanish colonial fashion. Walls are earth tones and ochres above a more darkly-toned base, with windows and shutters in saturated greens or blues. Often the largest living spaces, heavily planted courtyards generate shade and are embellished with fountains which cool the air.\nLOOKING INTO THE SEEDS OF TIME\nIt would seem, therefore, that paradise is not all lost. With architecture returning to its roots, with designs that speak of people and places, there seems a growing willingness to adopt traditional wisdom in order to evolve contemporary structures shaped, as in times past, by climate, culture and locale. With history hiding in plain site, the endless anthology of Caribbean design stands ready to be reclaimed in favour of a more authentic telling.\ncomments powered by Disqus","Spanish style homes are a familiar sight in warm, coastal regions of the Southwest. They offer a rustic yet elegant look reminiscent of the early Colonial dwellings built by the first Spanish settlers. As Spanish style homes continue to gain popularity in the real estate market, more and more people are wondering just what sets Spanish style homes apart from the rest.\nClick here to learn about other House Styles.\nThe History of Spanish Style Homes\nSpanish style homes have their root in architecture that first came into style hundreds of years ago. Colonists from Spain first brought their architectural style with them across the ocean when they began to emigrate to the U.S. in search of wealth. Catholic missions of the time also helped to create modern Spanish style homes.\nTo this day, many homes in the Southwest of the United States are fashioned in the Spanish colonial style. They’re especially predominant in areas that historically have a heavy colonial influence, such as California and Florida. However, thanks to their popularity, you can find Spanish style houses throughout the world.\nWhy are Spanish Style Homes Gaining Popularity?\nSpanish style homes have a unique charm that attracts people from all walks of life. They speak to a simpler time, with a design resembling ancient wattle and daub structures and a layout reminiscent of the Colonial era.\nMany Spanish style homes are still to this day built of local materials. This helps to benefit the local community, especially local artisans and craft workers. Since construction material is readily available locally, Spanish style homes can also be easier and cheaper to repair.\nBecause they’re typically built in warmer regions, Spanish style homes have perfected natural cooling and airflow. Even without the AC on, many houses are made to keep air flowing and prevent heat from building up indoors.\nMost Spanish style homes feature windows throughout the house to keep a healthy breeze flowing through. Spanish style homes also avoid carpets and heavy draperies that may end up raising internal temperatures. Instead, flooring is usually hardwood or tiling, at least in main living room spaces.\nThe roof is the key to natural climate control within Spanish style homes. Most are made clay or terra cotta, which has natural insulative and reflective properties. The shingles are also designed in a half-moon shape, which further helps to promote airflow and allows rising heat to escape.\nSpanish Vs. Mediterranean Style Homes\nMediterranean and Spanish style homes tend to be very similar in appearance, and it can be easy to get the two confused. Both are inspired in part by Colonial Spanish architecture, with arched windows and doors, stucco walls, red clay roofs, and plenty of outdoor space.\nWhile they might share similarities, however, the two styles are also vastly different. Spanish style homes embrace banks and curves, often with an asymmetrical facade. Mediterranean homes, on the other hand, tend to have straight, clean lines and rely on symmetry. They don’t feature the same curved walls and turrets that grace the facades of many Spanish style homes.\nUnlike Spanish style homes, most Mediterranean houses have an open floor plan. They’re often more spacious. While many Spanish style homes have just a single floor, Mediterranean homes are likely to have a second.\nChoosing Between Different Types of Spanish Style Homes\nThere’s no single style that ultimately defines all Spanish style homes. Often, the term encompasses a wide range of architectural styles. Though the different types of dwellings are similar in design, they all boast key differences that may make certain Spanish style homes a better choice for some than others.\nInspired by the Spanish missions of the 17th and 18th centuries, this style has some of its roots in the oldest Spanish architecture. These homes often somewhat resemble a monastery, with a smooth, flat facade, arched walkways, and even bell towers.\nMission revival designs are often more ornamental than other Spanish style homes. They typically feature trimming and carved accents, often made of terracotta, to match the roof. These houses may also feature extensive stone or masonwork, especially outside.\nSpanish Colonial Revival\nInspired by the work of prominent architect Bertram Goodhue in the early 1900s, Spanish colonial revival homes offer a new take on the classic colonial look. They often feature many ornamental and decorative elements and may take influence from multiple cultures in their design.\nThe colonial revival home itself is also often designed to be both fashionable and functional. Often, designs feature spiral columns, heavy, carved doors, and trimmed tiles, which aren’t often seen in other Spanish style homes.\nPueblo Revival homes embrace simplicity. They’re modeled after the houses of poor Spanish colonists as opposed to wealthy settlers. They often feature little ornamentation, instead opting for a smooth, stark facade.\nInstead of stucco, the walls of Pueblo revival homes are often made of either real or fake adobe. If the walls are painted, it’s usually in earth tones. Edges around the building are rounded to give it a soft, natural look.\nAs the name suggests, this type of house came about during the days when New Mexico was just a U.S. territory. It features influences from Eastern U.S. architecture of the time, including double-hung windows and brickwork.\nMonterey Revival homes are popular in California, especially in Southern regions. They’re often larger than typical Spanish style homes, with many boasting two floors. A second-story balcony is a common fixture in the Monterey Revival style.\nWhat Makes a House Spanish Style?\nIt’s fairly easy to identify Spanish style homes. They have several distinctive design features that make them stand out from the surrounding architecture, including both exterior and interior spaces.\nOutside, the clearest identifier of Spanish style houses is the roof. Most have a bright red, rust-colored roof thanks to using clay or terracotta tiles, though some newer houses may have shingles made of concrete instead. Often, patios, courtyards, and the interior living spaces of Spanish style homes use tiling made of the same reddish material.\nWhile traditional Spanish style homes had walls made of adobe or mudbrick, nowadays, most are made of cheaper, lighter, and more durable stucco. While some houses leave the stucco bare for a rustic look, many homes have facades painted in light, neutral colors.\nInstead of sticking to straight, simple walls, many Spanish style homes incorporate curves into their design. It’s not uncommon to see a house boasting an asymmetrical tower or turret along the side.\nOne of the most striking features found in many Spanish style homes today is the exposed wooden beams known as vigas. The ends of these beams are exposed along the edge of the roof, creating a unique, eye-catching pattern.\nInitially, these were an integral part of the construction of Spanish style homes. Back when they were made of heavyweight adobe, wood beams were used to add extra support around the roof. Nowadays, however, vigas beans are primarily used for aesthetics.\nDoorways and windows are typically arched in Spanish style homes. Windows are usually small but numerous to allow plenty of light and air into the house. The most ornate outer decor is reserved for areas around doors and windows, leaving the rest of the facade looking clean and unadorned.\nInside, Spanish style homes are usually small and cozy. They’re often just a single story high, though they may be larger in rare cases. The interior usually has a color scheme similar to the facade, with plenty of bright, neutral colors.\nSpanish style homes offer a uniquely rustic charm reminiscent of the homes of the very first Spanish settlers. From Mission revival houses to Monterey style dwellings, Spanish style homes are a Southwestern classic on the real estate market."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a8c9246f-6f49-41e9-b5ce-dedc4ae30544>","<urn:uuid:a0d21630-222f-499f-9287-a32e2c40a730>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Por qué está aumentando la epidemia de alergias y cómo se relaciona esto con la contaminación moderna? 🌍","answer":"The rising allergy epidemic is attributed to the vulnerability of the developing immune system to modern life challenges, including pollution. Research shows that air pollution is a significant environmental factor, with over 90% of the world's children breathing toxic air daily. The immune system's response to these pollutants can lead to allergies and chronic inflammation. Scientists are actively investigating how pollution affects immune development and its role in disease development. This is particularly concerning as pollution can cause respiratory conditions, worsen symptoms of asthma and other respiratory conditions, and lead to skin problems such as irritation and allergies. The impact is especially significant in urban areas, where exposure to traffic, power plants, and other combustion sources is highest.","context":["Our research within the Immunology Centre of Excellence focuses on the prevention and/or treatment of inflammation, allergy, infections and/or non-communicable diseases in later life. Our mission can only be reached with a solid pre-clinical research program, using state-of-the-art in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo techniques. In addition, we are closely involved in the design, measurements and interpretation of immunological data from clinical studies. We develop and execute many of this work in collaboration with national and international academic, industrial and governmental partners.\nWith 40 years of innovation and scientific discoveries and more than 600 publications in peer-reviewed journals in the field of immunology, we are committed to deliver high-quality, safe nutrition. We use a range of research tools, from preclinical studies to proof of concept and multicenter, efficacy clinical studies, and collaborate closely with both national and international academic partners and healthcare providers.\nAllergy is directly related to the immune system, and as such is referred to as an ‘immune-mediated’ disease. To increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying allergy development, improve treatment options and better understand the influence of nutrition in this process, we have a large pre-clinical allergy programme.\nGeneral Immune modulation\nWe investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the immune modulation and prevention of allergy with pre-, pro- and synbiotics, the effectiveness of allergy treatment and the induction of tolerance to harmless antigens.\nUntil recently, the focus of allergy management has been on allergen avoidance. Infants with cow’s milk allergy are advised to eliminate cow’s milk from their diet. If this does not resolve the allergy, infants are given formula that is free of cow’s milk proteins, existing of hydrolysed proteins (peptides) or amino acids in very severe cases., Next to the proven efficacy of avoidance in severe cases of cow’s milk allergy, there is now increasing evidence that supports the benefit of controlled exposure to allergens, leading to the development of tolerance against harmless antigens. At Danone Research & Innovation, we have an extensive pre-clinical research programme focusing on tolerance development in both the allergy prevention and management setting.\nIt is thought the rising allergy epidemic is due to the vulnerability of the developing immune system to challenges related to modern life,1 including pollution, the use of antibiotics and C-section deliveries. We are investigating the effects of pollution on the developing immune system and how this influences the development of diseases, such as allergy.\nNew ingredients and immune development\nWe work hard on identifying and unravelling the mechanisms behind new nutritional components, such as pre-, pro-, syn- and postbiotics, human milk oligosaccharides and amino acids, that could positively influence immune development and the active immune response. We investigate the effects of these ingredients on the development of infections, autoimmune disorders and allergy.\nOne of the crucial determinants of immune fitness is the ability to manage inflammation. Inflammation is a necessary response of the immune system, predominantly to manage infections, however, chronic inflammation can lead to allergy or autoimmune disorders. We are investigating the effects of amino acids on inflammation development in allergy, mucositis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\nBiomarker discovery, validation and measurement\nTo be able to unravel and understand the mechanisms of inflammation, immune development and the effects of ingredients, in both the pre-clinical as well as the clinical setting, it is crucial to know what to measure and how this correlates with prevention or treatment of disease. To further our understanding in this field, we have a large Biomarker Discovery program. In this program state-of-the-art techniques are used, such as proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics, in which we analyse large data sets using systems biology and machine learning approaches.\nIn addition, we assure the immune-related measurements performed in our clinical studies are fully validated according to ISO standards, so we can deliver high-quality results.\nAs an example of our discovery programme, we investigated the role of immunoglobulin free light chains (Ig-fLC) in several different inflammatory conditions. During the synthesis of immunoglobulins, Ig-fLCs are produced in excess over heavy chains and they might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease, however, the exact mode of action is still unknown. We have demonstrated that in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, both lung disorders, Ig-fLC concentrations are increased in serum and broncho-alveleor lavage fluid of these patients and that Ig-fLCs are present within affected lung tissue.1Groot Kormelink T, et al. PLoS ONE. Published on 2011;6(9):e25392\nIn eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE), an allergic disorder associated with male gender was found that serum Ig-fLC appeared higher in females than in males, adding another gender difference to the biology of EoE.2Knipping K, et al. Acta Paediatr. Published on 2014;103(7):766-74 Very recently we investigated whether Ig-fLCs could be a marker for disease severity in adult atopic dermatitis patients. Although serum concentrations were high, no differences in concentrations were found in patients before and after treatment of the atopic dermatitis.3Thijs JL, et al. Clin Transl Allergy. Published on 2016;6:44 This indicates that Ig-fLC indeed seems to play a role in inflammatory diseases but the mechanism still has to be unraveled.","Air pollution has become a global health problem, especially in urban areas. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), household air pollution was responsible for 3.8 million premature deaths in 2016, including over 400,000 deaths of children under the age of 5 years. Did you know more than 90% of the world’s children breathe toxic air every day? India is considered to be one of the top 10 highly polluted countries in the world. In fact, a recent study  has reported that around 99% of India’s population encounters air pollution levels that exceed the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines, indicating almost every one of us are breathing polluted air.\nAre You At Risk Of Air Pollution?\nAir pollution is known to be emerging as an invisible killer in recent years with an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. Although it threatens people of all ages, right from infants to elders, children are most vulnerable.\nUnlike adults, children’s lungs are not fully developed, which increases the risk of inflammation and organ damage caused by pollutants. Also, their immune system is not properly developed thereby further increasing their risk of suffering from severe health complications due to pollution. They breathe faster than adults, taking in more air and, with it, more pollutants. Also, kids have shorter and narrower airways and they breathe through their mouths often. This increases the risk of breathing in more pollutants and dust, which gets absorbed and settled in the lungs, respiratory tract and blood vessels.\nNewborns and infants spend the most time on the floor where some pollutants reach peak concentrations. They do spend most of their time indoors, which increases the susceptibility to household air pollution. As compared to adults who spend most of the time in the office, children spend much time outside, playing and engaging in physical activity in potentially polluted air from traffic, power plants, and other combustion sources. The risk is also high during pregnancy as exposure to air pollutants before conception can also impose latent risks on the fetus that can lead to illness and other health problems that last a lifetime.\nAir pollution can:\n-Increase the risk of respiratory conditions right from pneumonia to lung cancer\n-Worsen the symptoms of wheezing, asthma, bronchitis, COPD, and other respiratory conditions\n-Lead to impaired lung development in kids\n-Increase the risk of retinopathy and ocular problems such as dry eyes, eye pain,\n-Lead to skin problems such as irritation, redness, hives, and allergy\n-Increase blood pressure and heart rate thereby putting you at risk of heart disease\n-Cause serious complications in the immune system\n-Have damaging effects on the nervous system including cognitive impairment in kids\n-Up the risk of low birth weight babies and preterm delivery in pregnant women\nTips to protect yourself against pollution\nHere are a few simple ways to fight air pollution and protect your family from the harmful effects of air pollution.\n1. Stay indoors, preferably in the morning\nAvoid going for morning walks and outdoor activities as air pollution is said to be worse in the morning. So exercising outdoors in the early hours can do more harm than good as you might end up breathing polluted air. As kids tend to play outside, it is important to restrict their playtime when the pollutant levels are high.\n2. Use anti-pollution masks/nasal filters\nPoor quality of air makes it important to use a mask. But paper masks, stoles/handkerchiefs, and surgical masks offer no significant protection against the harmful air pollutants. Opt for N95/N99 respiratory masks which filter out particulate matter and help you to breathe cleaner air. Nasal filters also work effectively in filtering polluted air.\n3. Prefer public transport or carpooling\nOpt for public transport or carpooling instead of private vehicles to reduce traffic and pollution. This way you can do your bit in reducing pollution in your city. Avoid areas that are highly congested to lower the risk of pollution.\n4. Invest in indoor plants\nIndoor plants have been found to absorb the poisonous gaseous contaminants through their leaves and roots and help you to fight indoor pollution. Invest in indoor plants such as aloe vera, peace lily, spider plant and bamboo palm that you can add to your workplace and house.\n5. Use air purifiers\nOne of the most simple and effective ways to improve indoor air quality and prevent the health risks associated with household pollution is to buy an air purifier. Using air purifiers can significantly reduce the level of pollutants in your room and help you breathe clean air.\nAir pollution is an alarming global health crisis with grave consequences on the health right from kids to elders. However, with simple tips and tricks, you can fight pollution at home and help your family breathe clean air because #Hawa Saaf Ho Na Ho, Lungs Saaf Hone Chahiye for a healthy life.\n(The article is reviewed by Dr. Swati Mishra, Medical Editor)\n1.

Here are 11 health risks for pets you can eliminate right now.\nFlowers and plants that pose a health risk to pets\nWhile they may be pretty, lilies are one of the most poisonous plants for cats. Petside suggests keeping them out of the house (or better yet, purchase artificial flowers). Be aware of symptoms of lily poisoning which include vomiting, lethargy, and loss of appetite. Call your vet as soon as possible if you think your pet has ingested lily. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) says that without immediate care, cats who eat lily may develop life-threatening kidney failure within 36 to 72 hours of ingestion. (By the way, here are 50 secrets your pet wishes they could tell you.)\nHoliday poinsettias are also dangerous for pets, though not as worrisome as the lily. This doesn’t mean your pet should eat this pretty red Christmas decoration, since doing so will likely lead to stomach pain and discomfort, including vomiting.\nThe ASPCA’s compiled a searchable plant database of dangerous plants (listing over 400 items). Check it out if you are considering bringing a new plant home.\nPsst—this is why cats are afraid of cucumbers.\nFoods that pose a health risk to pets\nChocolate might have plenty of health benefits for humans, but it’s a harmful food for pets. Petside says most adults know this, but that it’s adults’ responsibility to make sure children know, too. Keep little ones from giving chocolate to pets and do your best to supervise.\nAll kinds of candy—including candy wrappers\nToo much sugar can give your pet a bellyache, but worse, if wrappers are swallowed, your pet risks tearing of the esophagus or intestines. Clean up as best and frequently as you can when candy is being unwrapped.\nMore harmful foods\nYour pets should also steer clear of chewing gum, grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, avocados, onions, garlic, salt, raw yeast dough, and fatty foods.\nNext, learn to read the signs your dog is mad at you.\nHoliday health risks for pets\nEaster and Christmas decorations\nPlastic eggs, if ingested, can rip tears in the digestive system. Likewise, spoiled hard boiled eggs, if ingested, can make pets ill. Easter grass and tinsel are attractive, but deadly. Pets who attempt to eat these garlands and garnishes can choke, or lethally damage their intestines. At Easter, try real grass or crumpled paper instead. At Christmas, cat-proof your tree by avoiding tinsel.\nOther holiday safety tips for pets:\nNew Year’s: Forego confetti and keep an eye on balloons. If they deflate, they become a choking hazard.\nValentine’s Day: Keep their paws off the chocolates and far from the flowers.\nThanksgiving: Throw turkey bones in the trash.\nHalloween: Use flameless candles, and keep candy out of harm’s way.

Check out these surprising reasons your dog is anxious.\nBatteries (and other small items) can be health risks for pets\nMany small items can lead to choking—even things you would never expect your pet would attempt eating. Be mindful of buttons, small batteries, twist ties, and rubber bands. In the bathroom, keep hairpins, cotton swabs, and dental floss out of reach from your pet. Cut down on clutter throughout your home with these organization tips from Marie Kondo.\nHealth risks for pets in the garage\nIf your pet is your shadow and frequently follows you around the house, remember that garage and storage areas need special attention, too. Keep cleaning supplies, antifreeze, fertilizer, de-icing materials and pesticides in a place pets can’t easily access. “Products containing metaldehyde, such as some slug pellets and firelighters, are extremely toxic, and should be kept away from pets,” according to Blue Cross. “Antifreeze and de-icer fluids taste sweet, but are also poisonous.” (As if having a furry companion wasn’t enough of a reason to grin, did you know that your dog actually loves when you smile?)\nBones pose a health risk for pets\nWhile eating meat off the bone might be tastier, if your pet gets a hold of one of those bones it could be bad news. Just like hazardous objects that might be laying around the house, it’s especially important to keep an eye on where your food leftovers end up. “Cooked bones splinter and can cut your dog’s mouth,” says Dana Humphrey, A.K.A. The Pet Lady. “If swallowed, they can puncture their stomach or esophagus too.” The same goes for bone “toys” you find in pet stores—which is why you should never, ever buy one.\nLearn how to read your dog’s facial expressions.\nSticks can be a health risk for pets\nYour dog might love to play fetch, but you might want to think twice before you pick up that stick outside. Sticks, especially small ones, can pose as serious choking hazards. Instead, Blue Cross suggests throwing a plastic, indestructible object that’s too big for your pet to accidentally swallow.\nPsst—this is why dogs spin around before they poop.\nIt’s easy to forget that trash cans can be health risks for pets, too. Your garbage can might have bones, chocolate, coffee grounds—essentially, a checklist of dangerous items that your fur baby should be nowhere near. “Make sure your garbage pail comes with a secure lid so you don’t have to worry about Fido or Fluffy getting their paws on discarded rib bones or leftover chocolate cake,” says The Pet Lady, Dana Humphrey.\nThink you’re raising a four-legged genius? Here’s how to tell if your dog is smart.\nMedication can pose a serious health risk for pets\nJust like humans, if you take medication that isn’t meant for you, it’s probably not a good idea. Human medication isn’t meant for your pets, and might even cause more harm than good. “Painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol are particularly dangerous,” says Blue Cross. “Vitamin and mineral supplements can also be dangerous, particularly iron tablets and products containing zinc.” The same concept applies to different animals: never give your dog cat medication, and vice versa.\nBe sure to check out the ASPCA site for tips on keeping your pet safe and poison-proofing your home.\nNext, find out the secrets your dog’s tail is trying to tell you."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:df7cd97c-227a-4119-8a58-264de3ca6990>","<urn:uuid:1082d9f9-b7d7-4f14-ac3d-56dd4f59394c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the principles of learning and practicing routines compare between horse training and ballet pirouettes?","answer":"In both disciplines, mastery requires breaking down complex movements into individual elements before combining them. For horse training, handlers work on each skill separately until both horse and handler are emotionally, intellectually and physically fluent before chaining them into a routine. Similarly, in ballet, dancers must master individual positions (first position, fourth position, plié, relevé, passé) before attempting a complete pirouette. Both emphasize the importance of precision and patient practice - horses typically need 3-6 repeats over three days to learn patterns, while ballet dancers are advised to practice patiently as multiple pirouettes are very difficult to master. Both also stress the importance of core strength and balance, with horses needing to be as precise as their handlers, and ballet dancers requiring strong core muscles and ankle strength for controlled movements.","context":["Photo: Standing with ‘no intent’ at halt is part of these five chained tasks.\nThis is the first of a series of movement routines we can do with only a fence and an open working area. The routines put together many of the individual skills and movements that my resources have looked at so far.\nThe key purpose of these routines is to encourage handlers to work on the precision of their signals in a relaxed manner. The routines require the handler to pay close attention to refining his/her signals to improve timing, clarity and softness. A horse can only be as precise as we are precise. A horse can only be as soft as we are soft.\nEach routine has five elements that are chained together into a pattern of movement. Horses are pattern learners and, like all of us, like to know what will happen before it happens. We tend to forget that horses living natural lives in the wild are totally in control of all their actions.\nWe can increase the positive feeling of ‘certainty’ by teaching these routines in a light-hearted but methodical way. Boots usually picks up a new pattern after three-six repeats over three days. Some horses will be quicker, and some will take longer.\nOther reasons for playing with these routines:\n- They are a way to keep skills we have already taught current in our repertoire.\n- They give a way of interacting with our horse when time is short, we don’t have time to set up objects and obstacles, we don’t have access to objects and obstacles, or we are past the point of lugging around heavy rails and other objects.\n- They include movement tasks we can do between working on stationary tasks, so giving the horse a good mix of activities.\n- They make excellent cool-down routines after energetic riding or groundwork.\nI’ve called them ‘routines’ because gymnasts first learn the individual elements of a performance and then form the elements into a ‘routine’. First each element is mastered emotionally, intellectually and physically. Then the routine is put into brain memory. Then it is practiced until it is also in muscle memory.\nAll this is a little bit tricky because doing a routine with a horse involves two brains and two sets of muscles.\nAfter jotting down a plan for a possible routine, I try it out with Boots multiple times. The feedback I get from Boots and myself always shows that the initial plan needs a lot of changes. Most of the changes concern my body position plus when and how I give the signal for each part of the action.\nSmooth execution of a series of five individual tasks chained together:\n- ‘Walk on’ and ‘halt’ repeated three times;\n- Change of direction and side of horse (so horse remains nearest the fence);\n- ‘Stay’ while handler backs away from the horse to the end of rope (keeping a drape in the rope);\n- Horse Waits for ___ seconds;\n- Smooth ‘walk on’ and ‘halt’ transitions staying shoulder-to-shoulder. (See Related Resources 1 at the end of this post.)\n- Handler has developed a clear ‘No Intent’ signal so the horse knows when standing quietly is what is wanted.

(See Related Resources 3 at the end of this post.\n- Horse and handler agree on clear ‘stay’ signals. (See Related Resources 4 at the end of this post.)\n- Horse has learned to ‘wait’ until handler gives a new signal or clicks&treats. (See Related Resources 5 at the end of this post.)\n- Handler and horse agree on a clear ‘recall’ signal. (See Related Resources 6 at the end of this post.)\nENVIRONMENT AND MATERIALS\n- A work area where the horse is relaxed and confident.\n- Ideally, the horse can see his buddies, but they can’t interfere.\n- The horse is not hungry.\n- Halter and 10′ (3 m) or longer lead.\n- A safe fence line to work alongside. It can be straight, curved or the inside or outside of a round pen fence.\n- Since I don’t find memorizing a sequence of tasks easy, I use a ruler as a fence and practice the movements with my small toy hippopotamus. Then I walk the sequence outside by myself, practicing the signals I will use, accompanied by an invisible unicorn.\n- While working out the plan with Boots’ help, I’ve usually managed to confuse her to some extent, so once the plan feels right, I wait a few days before starting to do the final version with her. Meanwhile we have been practicing the tasks separately.\n- For the first task, walk as few or many steps as you like. I walked only a few steps in the video to make it easier to film. Vary how long you stand at halt before asking for the next walk transition. Work to get the ‘walk on’ transition with raising your chest, breathing in deeply plus your voice signal. Work on refining your body language and voice signal for each halt.\n- How often you click&treat depends on where you are with each skill. I always begin with click&treat for each portion of each task. As the horse gets the hang of what we are doing, I move the click point along so the horse does more for each click&treat. I like to eventually be able to do the whole chain with one click point at the end.\n- As with everything, we keep the sessions short in among other things we are doing. I often do it just once, sometimes twice and rarely three times in a row.\n- There is no need to rush through the chain of tasks. Walk slowly. Give the horse time put the pattern into his mind and from there into his muscle memory.\n- Stay’ means that the horse understands that you can walk away while he stays put. ‘Wait’ means that the horse is able to keep standing still for a specific length of time until you click&treat or give another signal. They may appear to be the same at first glance, but teaching/learning ‘Wait’ with duration is a skill set that goes beyond the idea of ‘stay’ for a short period.\n- For the ‘wait’ task, gradually work up to ten seconds, but be sure to stay well within the time the horse is comfortable with. Better to recall sooner rather than after the horse moves. If he moves, go back to working on the ‘wait’ task by itself for several days. In the video clip, you will note that on the day we filmed at liberty, Boots found it hard to relax into the ‘wait’. There was a lot of commotion including a huge noisy hedge clipping machine working close by.\n- The more time we spend playing with exercises like this, which look relatively simple on the surface, the more positive spin-offs there will be to the other things we do with the horse.\n- Memorize the sequence of tasks.\n- Play with each of the skills separately until you and the horse feel fluent. This might take one session or a long time if some of the tasks are new to you.\n- Walking with the horse nearest the fence, chain the first two tasks together (3 x walk & halt plus change of direction and sides).\n- When 3 is smooth, chain the last three mini-tasks together (stay plus wait plus recall).\n- When both 3 and 4 are going well, chain it all together.\n- Always adjust your rate of reinforcement (how often you click&treat) to what the horse is able to offer on the day. If he seems unsure, click&treat more of the slices. If he is showing keenness and understanding about what comes next, use your voice to praise and move the click&treat further along the chain.\nWe can’t expect our horse to be the same every day, just as we are not the same every day. Good training adjusts what we do to what the horse is telling us. Some days it will feel very smooth. Other days parts will feel sticky. This is normal ebb and flow.\nThe day will come when you do it all with one click and treat at the end, but it may not happen again the day after that. Horses read our tension or relaxation in a nanosecond. Often what is happening with the horse relates to ourselves, our emotional state, and how the horse perceives us that day.\nOther times, the horse may be tired or anxious due to rough weather or other changes in his external and/or internal environment.\n- If you usually start walking on the horse’s left side, start instead walking on his right side. Be aware of keeping your signals equally clear on the side you use less often.\n- Practice alongside as many different fences as you can.\n- Once the horse shows that he knows the pattern, play with it at liberty along fences using the same signals you have used all along.\n- Once the routine is smooth along the fence, play with it out in the open, first with the lead rope and then at liberty. Alternate on which side of the horse you begin the routine.\n- Smooth Walk and Halt transitions: https://wp.me/p4VYHH-5TT\n- ‘Zero Intent’ and ‘Intent’: https://wp.me/p4VYHH-5RO\n- Changing Sides in Motion: https://youtu.be/3oqPs4LM5AM\n- Park and Wait (Stay): https://youtu.be/UvjKr9_U0ys\n- Wait Duration: https://youtu.be/jVn3WBuqpno\n- Recall Clip 1: https://youtu.be/XuBo07q8g24 Recall Clip 2: https://youtu.be/5BQCB2Fe5RE","This article was co-authored by Geraldine Grace Johns.

Learn how to master the pirouette, and soon you’ll be dancing like the stars with your twirls.\nLearning the Dance Positions Necessary to Do a Pirouette\n1Stand in the first position. Start by standing with your heels together and your feet turned out as far as comfortably possible. Be sure to have good balance before moving to another position. X Research source\n2Move your feet to the fourth position. Do this by sliding one foot about 12 inches (30 cm) forward and aligning your heels. X Research source\n3Practice a plié. You will do this by bending your knees while in the fourth position. Try to move gradually without jerks. Lower and rise at the same speed. This will help you with flexibility and balance.\n4Learn the relevé position. Rise up on your toes or balls of your feet, from the fourth position, to be in the relevé position.\n- If you are a beginner rise to the balls of your feet wearing ballet flats.\n- If you are intermediate or advanced and already dancing en pointe, try rising to your toes wearing toe shoes. This is not a requirement, though.\n5Get into the passé position. Slide the toe of one leg up the calf of the supporting leg to your knee to be in the passé position. The leg you move is called the working leg. Practice rising up on your toes in this position while using the ballet bar for balance.\n6Position your arms. Hold your arms in front of you, rounded, at lower abdomen level. This is the first position and is essential for balance.Advertisement\nPracticing Your Pirouette\n1Choose a focal point. Stand and choose a point on the wall or mirror, straight ahead at eye level, to use as a focal point. You can use a “post it” note if there is no point. You will look at this point during the entire dance move.\n- It's very important to keep your head secure as you pirouette—if your head is slightly tilted or you're not looking where you want to end up, it will affect your turn.\nGeraldine Grace Johns\nProfessional Ballerina & Ballet Instructor Expert Interview. 11 November 2020.\n- It's very important to keep your head secure as you pirouette—if your head is slightly tilted or you're not looking where you want to end up, it will affect your turn. X Expert Source Geraldine Grace Johns\n2Begin the pirouette moves. Stand in fourth position with your feet about twelve inches apart. Bend both legs evenly in a plié.\n3Add a relevé. Rise up on your toes or balls of feet in the relevé position. Slide one foot up the other supporting leg to the passé position. This leg can be turned out facing the side (ballet) or parallel (jazz).  X Research source\n4Position your arms for balance. Hold your arms in front of you in the first position. Remember, this is essential for balance.\n5Begin moving. Look at your focal point on the wall. Turn while in position, keeping your head facing the focal point for as long as you can and then whip your head around to continue focus while the rest of your body follows.\n- Your body’s steady movement and your head speeding up as necessary to focus is called spotting and helps prevent dizziness while your move remains controlled.\n- Push just enough to get around. Over pushing will throw the twirl off.  X Research source\n6Land your pirouette. Land back in the fourth position to complete the pirouette. Try to land smoothly. While this may sound easy, you will need to practice landing in the right direction.Advertisement\nDoing a More Advanced Pirouette\n1Strengthen your core. You will need a very strong core to do multiple pirouettes in one motion.\n- Do planks by holding your body stiff, in a pushup-like position, supported on your forearms. Hold for as long as possible. Aim to increase your time.\n- Do crunches. Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent. Put your hands behind your head or across your chest. Flatten your lower back to the floor, while contracting stomach muscles and lifting shoulders off the floor about 2 inches (5 cm). Exhale when you come up. Lower your shoulders and repeat 20 times. Aim to increase the number of crunches over time. X Research source\n2Strengthen your ankles. Dancing is very repetitive. Do exercises without impact.\n- Sit in a chair, lift your leg and do the alphabet with one foot and then the other.\n- Use a fitness band to do flex exercises. Put the band around one foot. Extend the foot while holding the band and slowly flex your foot in different directions.\n- Flex your calves in both the sitting and standing position. Strengthening muscles around the ankles will provide additional strength.  X Research source\n3Practice patiently. Multiple pirouettes is a very difficult move to master. Be patient with yourself. Remember, you love dancing and practice is the key to perfecting your art.Advertisement\nQuestionHow can I make my pirouette stronger?Geraldine Grace JohnsGeraldine Grace Johns is a Professional Ballerina and the Owner of Grace Ballet in New York and Los Angeles.

She was also a guest coach and Master Class teacher for the USA Royal Academy of Dance Challenge in Long Beach, California in 2019 and 2020.\nProfessional Ballerina & Ballet InstructorProfessional Ballerina & Ballet InstructorExpert AnswerOne of the most important things to know before you start is to have a secure spotting head. That's when you focus on a single spot, which will help with your balance and your turn. Your head is the heaviest part of your body, so if it's slightly tilted or you're not looking in the direction you want to end up, you'll have complications.\nQuestionWhen I do my pirouette, my passe leg is constantly slipping from my supporting leg. Also, I can't finish into my retire position without stumbling first. Any suggestions?Community AnswerWork on the strength of your passe leg, your toe should only rest on your knee and not press it. Do leg lifts and other thigh strengthening exercises to be able to do a proper passe. To end in a retire position, drop your heel sooner when finishing your turn, this should help you slow down faster and not stumble.\nQuestionSometimes when I am finishing the turn, I either don't have enough momentum or lose my balance and stumble. How can I fix this? Also, should I focus on going up on releve first, or turning first after the plie?Community AnswerThe releve and the positioning of everything (your legs and arms) is very important to get right first, because that's how you will form the strength to perform pirouettes. Focusing on this will help stop you from losing your balance. A strong releve and supporting leg will keep you from falling out of your turn.\nPractice makes perfect!\nPull long hair back so as not to interfere with spotting.\nKeep your supporting leg straight.\n- Practice spotting to avoid dizziness.\n- Do not practice on carpet as it can grab your shoes causing falls and injury.\n- Always practice dance moves in an area large enough to prevent hitting something if you fall.\nThings You'll Need\n- Flat ballet shoes or pointe shoes to fit your skill level.\n- An area large enough to practice.\n- A focal point at eye level.\n- ↑ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm-XZCi9skQ\n- ↑ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm-XZCi9skQ\n- ↑ Geraldine Grace Johns.

{"question":"List the historical facilities still open for visitors in Glen Mills and Fore River Shipyard locations","answer":"In Glen Mills, visitors can experience the West Chester Railroad, a living-history railway that operates between West Chester and Glen Mills, as well as Longwood Gardens which offers classes, galleries, and botanical exhibitions. At the former Fore River Shipyard location, visitors can explore The United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum and the USS Salem.","context":["Storage Types in Glen Mills\n- Boat Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- Businesss Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- Vehicle Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- Climate Controlled Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\n- RV Storage Units in Glen Mills, PA\nOther Storage Unit Options in Glen Mills, PA\nStorage Unit Sizes in Glen Mills\nAbout Glen Mills\nGlen Mills is a mid-size community about 27 miles west of Philadelphia. It's known for its strong role in the early paper industry, and the historical sites in the area attract many visitors to this small town. In Glen Mills, you'll enjoy a close proximity to the big city as well as a quiet suburban lifestyle at home.\nThe History of Glen Mills\nGlen Mills started as an industrial village where entrepreneur John Taylor built Sarum Forge in 1749. Seven years later, he erected the state's first iron-slitting mill and pioneered the ironmasters tradition in this area. Glen Mills' rich stores of iron ore supported the local economy throughout the 18th and 19th centuries and beyond. The American Revolution increased demand for certain iron products, including munitions, but by cutting off trade routes and destroying forges, the British made it difficult for ironmasters to maintain their businesses. Today, a historical marker in Glen Mills commemorates the iron industry and its impact on local citizens from the city's earliest years.\nThe town was named for two paper mills that existed in the mid-1800s, owned by the local Wilcox family. These mills played an important role in manufacturing paper for the U.S. government, specifically a unique, patented paper to be used for government notes and bonds.\nLiving in Glen Mills\nGlen Mills has many unique local attractions, ranging from quirky entertainment to historical points of interest. One of the area's more unusual attractions is the Bates Motel and Haunted Hayride, which has scared visitors for a quarter of a century. During the Halloween season, it's a popular destination for people from many of Glen Mills' neighboring communities.\nLongwood Gardens serves as another locally-treasured spot in Glen Mills. This attraction features classes, lectures, and research opportunities as well as acres of plants and flowers. The greenhouses offer many plant species to explore, and Longwood Gardens is devoted to both sustainable gardening and the furthering of the arts in Glen Mills. You can view art installations and galleries on the grounds as well as listen to concerts hosted by local musicians.\nOn weekends, you can take the West Chester Railroad, a living-history railway that travels between West Chester and Glen Mills. It provides the experience of traveling back in time to the original West Chester and Philadelphia Rail Road, which arrived in the town in 1858.\nGlen Mills Schools\nThere are a few options for primary and secondary education in Glen Mills, including the private Glen Mills School and public elementary, middle and high school campuses under the jurisdiction of Garnet Valley School District.\nResources for Moving to Glen Mills\nHere's some useful information for planning your move to Glen Mills:\n- Utilities: PECO is Glen Mills' primary energy provider, while the Concord Township manages local water and sewer services.\n- Garbage and Recycling: Although Glen Mills is part of the Concord Township, there aren't any town-provided waste disposal services. Instead, you'll choose a private company for trash and recycling collection.\n- Transportation: The greater Concord Township is part of the SEPTA public transit network.\nGlen Mills Housing\nMost homes in Glen Mills are single-family detached properties with three or four bedrooms, and there's a good mix of newer construction and older houses. The median home price in Glen Mills is higher than both the state and national averages, but there are enough options to make it easier to find something to fit your budget.","01. Shipyard History\nFore River Shipyard was located in Quincy, Massachusetts, between 1883 and 1980. Fore River Shipyard was started by Thomas Watson, who began work building marine engines before opening the shipyard.\nFore River Shipyard built a wide range of ships, including the first submarine that was officially commissioned by the U.S. Navy. In the early 1900s, the yard also contracted with the Imperial Japanese Navy. Bethlehem Steel bought the shipyard in 1913. During World War I (WWI), the shipyard built submarines, merchant ships and destroyers. During World War II (WWII), with 32,000 employees, the shipyard produced destroyer escorts, landing ships and 71 destroyers.\nGeneral Dynamics bought Fore River Shipyard in 1964 and built naval support vessels, civilian merchant ships and nuclear submarines. That work was eventually moved over to its sister shipyard, Electric Boat in Connecticut. In 1980, with an oversaturation of shipyards in the U.S., Fore River Shipyard closed.\nFore River Shipyard is now home to The United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum and the USS Salem.\nFore River Shipyard History at a Glance\n- Other Names: General Dynamics, Bethlehem Steel Company, Bethlehem Fore River\n- Location: Quincy, Massachusetts\n- Owner(s): Quincy Shipbuilding Division of General Dynamics Corporation, Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Ltd. and Thomas Watson’s Fore River Ship & Engine Company\n- Years of Operation: 1883 – 1980\n- Wartime Operations: Russo-Japanese War, World War I (WWI), World War II (WWII) and the Cold War\n- Number of Employees: 32,000 in 1943\n- Size of Shipyard: 180 acres\n- Noteworthy Ships: USS Hancock, USS Bunker Hill, USS Wasp, USS Gato, USS Lawrence Y. Spear, USS Dixon, USS Kansas City, USS Savannah, USS Portland, USS Pensacola, USS Fort Fisher, USS Kalamazoo, USS Salem, USS Bainbridge\n- Noteworthy Personnel: Thomas A. Watson, Frank O. Wellington, Admiral Francis T. Bowle, James J. Kilroy, Florence DiTullio\n- Types of Ships Built/Serviced: Protected cruisers, torpedo boat destroyers, lightships, battleships, schooners, scout cruisers, freighters, submarines, freight steamers, passenger steamers, fishing trawlers, colliers, tugs, steam yachts, barges, lighters, tankers, car floats, destroyers, battleship-cruisers, scout cruisers, aircraft carriers, ferries, cruisers, cutters, guided missile cruisers, nuclear-frigates, ammunition ships, fleet replenishment oilers, dock landing ships, helicopter landing-ships\nMany workers at Fore River Shipyard were potentially exposed to asbestos. Workers’ loved ones may have also experienced secondhand exposure. As a result, many people developed asbestos-related diseases, such as asbestosis, asbestos lung cancer, and pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. People who developed an asbestos-related disease may be eligible for compensation.\nNotable Ships Built and Repaired\nFore River Shipyard produced hundreds of ships over its lifetime. Ships were built for the military and commercial clients. Two notable ships that were built for the U.S. Navy were the submarine tender, USS Lawrence Y. Spear, and the aircraft carrier, USS Hancock.\nUSS Lawrence Y. Spear\nThe submarine tender USS Lawrence Y. Spear was laid down at Fore River Shipyard in 1996. Throughout her history, USS Lawrence Y. Spear received many awards and accolades, but she is most famous for being one of the first ships to have women assigned as crew members. This historic event first took place in October 1978. In 1980, she was also the first ship to initiate women as Shellbacks as they crossed the equator.\nQuick Ship Facts\n- Ship’s Name: USS Lawrence Y. Spear, aka USS L.Y. Spear\n- Year Built: 1966\n- Years in Service: 1970 – 1996\nUSS Lawrence Y. Spear provided support for the Iran hostage crisis in 1980 and Operation Desert Storm in 1991. One of her last missions before being decommissioned in 1996 was support for the recovery and salvage of TWA Flight 800.\nUSS Lawrence Y. Spear was built and active during a time when it was common for asbestos to be used in shipbuilding and repair. Anyone working or serving on the ship may be at risk of developing asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma.\nUSS Hancock was an aircraft carrier laid down at Fore River Shipyard in 1943. She fought against Japan in WWII in 1944 and 1945. She was involved in numerous attacks causing massive destruction to enemy territory. During these attacks, she was hit by several suicide planes causing multiple fires on board, as well as many causalities.\nQuick Ship Facts\n- Ship’s Name: USS Hancock, aka “Fighting Hannah”\n- Year Built: 1943\n- Years in Service: 1944 – 1947, 1954 – 1956, 1956 – 1976\nIn 1946, she was decommissioned and entered the reserve fleet at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.\nAfter conversion and modernization, USS Hancock was recommissioned in 1954, decommissioned in 1956 for additional conversions and recommissioned that same year. She participated in the Vietnam War throughout several deployments beginning in 1965 through 1975. She was decommissioned in 1976.\nFor her entire lifespan, many materials used to build, repair and modernize the USS Hancock contained asbestos. This asbestos put her workers and crew members at risk of developing mesothelioma.\n02. Shipyard Asbestos Use\nAsbestos Use at Fore River Shipyard\nAsbestos is a durable mineral that is highly resistant to heat. Due to these properties, shipbuilders often used asbestos during the construction process. Products containing asbestos helped control the release of heat and were fire-resistant. Such products were desirable on ships.\nFore River Shipyard actively operated from 1883 to 1980. Asbestos was commonly used during many of these decades. Asbestos was used throughout Fore River Shipyard. The dangerous mineral was often present in boilers, incinerators, insulating materials and other elements of ships. This put those in various shipyard occupations at risk of developing asbestos-related diseases.\nAsbestos product highlight: Adhesives, sealers and bondings\nAdhesives were used to install and repair a variety of products, such as pipes, boilers and furnaces. These products had to hold up in the harsh conditions of their environment. Manufacturers added asbestos to these products to strengthen them and extend their lifetime. People who worked with or near these adhesives were likely exposed to asbestos.\nAsbestos Exposure at Fore River Shipyard\nFore River Shipyard bustled with the activity of private citizens and military personnel. With the amount of asbestos in shipyards and ships, U.S. Navy veterans faced frequent exposure. Civilian workers and visitors also faced asbestos exposure risk. Before the 1980s, any shipyard visitor faced potential asbestos exposure and the risk of developing malignant mesothelioma cancer.\nMaintenance workers on warships, steamers, aircraft carriers, submarine tenders and other ships faced the same risks. Poor ventilation on ships combined with pervasive asbestos use made exposure common. For example, plumbers and pipefitters were exposed through the normal duties of their jobs.\nExposed to asbestos at work: Plumbers and pipefitters\nWorkers who installed and repaired pipes and plumbing were at risk of asbestos exposure. The dangerous mineral was often used to insulate plumbing fixtures throughout ships. Any time the material was disturbed, workers faced a risk of inhaling asbestos fibers.\nAsbestos use all but stopped before the 1980s. However, people can still be exposed at shipyards when working on ships maintained or built pre-1980. Various shipyard duties, including sanding or sawing pipes for installation, exposed workers to asbestos.\n03. Asbestos Lawsuits\nAsbestos Lawsuits and Settlements\nShipyard workers, veterans and visitors of Fore River Shipyard are at risk of developing mesothelioma, asbestos cancer or another asbestos illness. Those diagnosed have several claim options to receive financial compensation.\nAsbestos-disease victims can seek compensation from the companies responsible for their exposure. An individual’s asbestos claim options will vary depending on each company’s current status. Victims can work with a mesothelioma lawyer to discuss their options and obtain compensation through a lawsuit, settlement, trust fund and/or VA claim (or a combination of these types of claims).\nHolding Asbestos Companies Responsible\nVarious companies that used to manufacture asbestos products have not filed for bankruptcy. Individuals can file lawsuits against such companies. Asbestos lawsuits can provide victims compensation through verdicts or settlements.\nFor example, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which purchased the television network CBS Inc. in 1995, became the leading supplier of reactors for U.S. submarines in the 1940s. The company also made radar and other electrical systems used in submarines. Asbestos was likely used in the creation of these products, putting Navy service members at risk of asbestos-related diseases.\nIMO Industries (formerly IMO DeLaval) has a long history of producing turbines, compressors, pumps and motion control equipment. Many of their products contained asbestos and were prevalent at Fore River Shipyard. Asbestos exposure from these products put people at risk of developing mesothelioma.\nSome of these victims have filed successful lawsuits against the companies.\nExample Lawsuit Recovery for Fore River Shipyard Worker\n53-Year-Old Former Steamfitter Diagnosed With Mesothelioma\nRecovery: $1.5 million\nYears of Asbestos Exposure at Fore River Shipyard: 1971 – 1979\nA 53-year-old former steamfitter spent eight years at Fore River Shipyard. He worked throughout the base but mainly in the power plants. The power plants produced high-pressure steam. During summer, boilers would undergo maintenance and overhaul, if needed. This maintenance included stripping and reapplication of the boilers’ asbestos insulation for repair and replacing asbestos gasket material. This work created large quantities of asbestos dust that the steamfitter breathed in.\nLearn More About Your Legal Rights\n- Limited time to file\n- Settle before trial\n- Free case evaluation\n04. Filing Asbestos Claims\nAsbestos Company Trusts\nAfter exposing unknowing people to asbestos, many companies have filed for bankruptcy. In fact, more than 100 asbestos companies have gone bankrupt since the 2000s. As a result of their filings, many of these companies were forced to create trusts to compensate victims of mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases.\nMany Navy and civilian personnel were exposed to asbestos through their work in shipyards. These individuals used a variety of asbestos products. If a shipyard worker developed an asbestos-related disease, that person can file a claim with that product manufacturer’s trust.\nAsbestos Company Trust Funds and Eligible Years of Employment\nThe following companies provided asbestos products to Fore River Shipyard. After facing many asbestos lawsuits and exposing innocent people to asbestos, these companies filed for bankruptcy and created trusts to pay victims. If an individual worked at Fore River Shipyard and developed a disease such as mesothelioma, they may be able to file a claim against these companies’ trusts.\n|Asbestos Company Name||Eligibility Start Date||Eligibility End Date|\n|Babcock and Wilcox||1/1/1942||12/31/1982|\n|United States Gypsum||1/1/1942||12/31/1982|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6c8ba484-ccfc-46f5-ae68-4fdffe54d850>","<urn:uuid:1a1f21fc-f164-402e-8818-21c3b980762b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the security vulnerabilities of VPNs, and how do they function in enabling remote work access?","answer":"VPNs are vulnerable to network scanning, brute force attacks, and zero-day vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals can use stolen credentials to connect to VPNs, change configuration settings, and access additional infrastructure. VPNs that use SSL protocols are particularly vulnerable, allowing criminals to retrieve arbitrary files including authentication credentials or embed malware. Regarding functionality, VPNs create an encrypted 'tunnel' between the internet (described as a big field) and the work network (a little field). This tunnel allows remote users to access servers and behave exactly as if they're in the office, enabling them to print, access file shares, and update their roaming profiles.

Cybercriminals can use stolen credentials to connect to the VPN and change configuration settings or connect or access additional infrastructure. Vulnerabilities also exist in VPNs that rely on secure socket layer (SSL) protocols through which cybercriminals can retrieve arbitrary files, including those containing authentication credentials, or exploit administrator privileges to embed malware that can be activated at a later time.\nThe NSA advisory reminds organizations to:\n- Reduce the VPN gateway attack surface\n- Verify that cryptographic algorithms are Committee on National Security Systems Policy (CNSSP) 15-compliant\n- Avoid using default VPN settings\n- Remove unused or non-compliant cryptography suites\n- Apply vendor-provided updates (i.e. patches) for VPN gateways and clients\nA recent survey of 519 IT professionals finds that during the pandemic about a third of respondents (30%) said they experienced VPN issues. In the wake of the pandemic, many organizations are revaluating their entire approach remote access. Rather than relying on VPNs, many organizations are evaluating software-defined wide area networks (SD-WANs) that are accessed via software-defined perimeter (SDP) software remotely installed on endpoints. The SD-WAN, accessed either via a service or through a gateway deployed by an internal IT team, ideally should include a built-in firewall.\nThe goal is to create a true zero-trust network environment. Rather than relying on traditional passwords, SDP software makes it possible to assign identities to specific users in a way that reduces the likelihood credentials will be stolen.\nInterest in zero-trust architectures was on the rise prior to the pandemic. Like many emerging technology trends, the pandemic may simply accelerate the rate at which organizations make that transition.\nCyberattacks aimed at end users working from home are on the rise. It’s only a matter of time before organizations reevaluate their approach to endpoint security. The rate at which that transition will occur will depend heavily on both budget dollars and the expertise available to implement a zero-trust architecture.\nIn the meantime, cybersecurity teams need to be wary of complacency. Many have done a terrific job responding to the initial emergency. However, now that it appears that working from home more often is the new normal, it’s also apparent that cybersecurity as organizations once knew it will never be the same again.\nMike Vizard has covered IT for more than 25 years and has edited or contributed to a number of tech publications including InfoWorld, eWeek, CRN, Baseline, ComputerWorld, TMCNet, and Digital Review.

Well, you might not have wondered that, but there’s a lot going on behind the scenes that make that all possible. This means that even if you’re enjoying a coffee at Starbucks, you can still log in and work on your files. And that’s a pretty good thing to be able to do!\nSo How Does It Work?\nWhen you first power on your laptop, unless you’re actually plugged into your company’s network with a real network cable, you’ve logged into your laptop using your ‘roaming profile’.\nBut what’s a roaming profile? Your roaming profile is all of your account’s information, such as the files on your desktop, your permissions and even your account name and password. This information is stored not only on the network, but also locally on your laptop as well. This means that your computer will recognize you even if your computer can’t reach the company’s network, and stores your files and remembers your passwords and bookmarks and such.\nBut why is that important? Normally, when you log into your computer, your computer will ask the network who you are. However, the only type of network that works in that kind of situation is a network connection using a physical cable. In fact, you can’t use wifi at all until you log in.\nIn this case, your computer gives you a chance to log in by checking against the last password you used. When you do this, everything will be as you left it the last time, and you’ll be able to use your files just as if you were in the office. However, there are two things to remember.\nTwo Important To Remember About Your Profile\nFirst, if you somehow make a change to one of those files stored in your profile – such a spreadsheet as on your desktop or a photo in your My Documents folder – from another computer, those changes won’t synchronize to your laptop until the next time you log into the network itself. So if you leave your laptop at home and make a change on a file in your profile there, and then go into work and use a desktop computer, you won’t see those changes on your desktop until you bring your laptop into work again.\nSecond, if you’re not connected to the company network, you can still use the files on your laptop – but you won’t be able to access network shares. So if you happen to have a shared drive or a printer that you regularly use, you won’t be able to use them if you’re not on the network.\nSo what do you do if you’re at home and you need to access these kinds of resources? Well, as usual there’s a solution.\nVirtual Private Networks (VPN)\nA virtual private network, or VPN, is a way to trick your computer to thinking it’s at the office.\nTo explain how the technology works, imagine that the internet is a big field with a big fence, and your work network is a little field separated by another fence. Normally, these two fields are separated. However, connecting to your virtual private network is like digging a ‘tunnel’ between the big field and the little field (in fact, it’s actually called a tunnel).\nOnce you connect your virtual private network, your computer can reach your work network. In fact, it behaves exactly as if it’s in the office. That means you’ll be able to print, access your file shares, and otherwise behave just like you’re at work. Furthermore, your profile will update, which means your files will receive the latest updates to them if there has been a change!\nIn order to connect to your virtual private network, you’ll need to connect to the internet first. Once you connect to the internet, you can then click on the VPN connection to connect it as well – both connections are needed in order to work.\nOnce your VPN is connected, you’re off to the races! Just be sure your boss doesn’t actually think you’re at your desk today."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:329bde5d-252e-4bb2-b405-4a3ea4277fe9>","<urn:uuid:04d55878-2618-48be-884a-8f08cfb18223>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What economic challenges do rural communities face compared to urban areas, and which nonprofit programs are receiving funding to boost local economic development?","answer":"Rural communities face several economic challenges compared to urban areas. They have lower labor force participation rates (59% vs 63% in urban areas), and most rural communities haven't recovered the jobs lost during the recession. However, some rural areas show strength in entrepreneurship and export businesses. Many nonprofits are receiving infrastructure funding to address these economic challenges. For instance, Cultural Diversity Resources received funding to increase the effectiveness of BIPOC organizations serving low-income communities through organizational partnerships and workforce development. The Community Integration Center received support to boost operational capacity and improve programming. Additionally, organizations like Field of Dreams Empowerment Center got funding to restructure practices and services to increase their ability to access and sustain new funding for expanding programs in resource-scarce environments.","context":["Propel Nonprofits, with a state appropriation coming through the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development that was secured in partnership with the Coalition of Asian American Leaders, has awarded $1.71 million to 38 culturally led nonprofit organizations for infrastructure funding.\n2021-2023 Awarded Organizations\n- Afoutayi Dance, Music and Arts Company: Create and sustain formal infrastructure in financial systems, publicity, and grant writing, as well as increase staff capacity in technology/multimedia design.\n- Ananya Dance Theatre: Expand administrative capacity and develop a leadership transition plan.\n- Bridgemakers: Refresh website, build a financial infrastructure and payroll system, secure project management software and laptops, and provide related professional/management coaching, training, and support for team members.\n- Brownbody: Strengthen organizational workforce to enable org to have the capacity and systems to hire a Managing Director.\n- Center for Leadership and Neighborhood Engagement: Develop sustainable commitment to four targeted neighborhoods in North Minneapolis.

Like other nonprofits, their services provide a social safety net and drive employment, community, and economic development. Investing in these organizations makes our communities better.”\nThese infrastructure grants will be used for everything from implementing new financial and data management systems to building staff and board capacity. There was strong demand from this kind of infrastructure support from nonprofits across Minnesota.\n“After two rounds of NIGP (Nonprofit Infrastructure Grant Program) funding we can see the state’s investment is working to build a pipeline of nonprofits serving cultural communities who can apply for state grants and contracts,” said Kate Barr, President and CEO of Propel Nonprofits. “For example, almost all the previous grantees of this program said they are likely to apply for a state or other publicly funded grant in the next 3-12 months. This result is a big step forward for both the organizations and for state agencies hoping to work with nonprofits that are grounded in their communities.”\nIn addition to grant funding, awarded organizations will also receive ongoing technical assistance from Propel Nonprofits regarding financial administration.","This is the fourth post in a series about reducing the divide between urban and rural communities.\nTo bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, we first need to understand what sets these communities apart and where they have common ground. Below are a few key stats about urban and rural populations, economies and housing, and the different types of critical challenges these communities face.\nDespite the vast amount of discussion about the urban-rural divide, there is actually little agreement about what these terms mean. The most common definitions are from the Census Bureau — “mostly urban,” “mostly rural” or “completely rural” — and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) — “metropolitan” or “non-metropolitan.”\nThe problem with these definitions is that more than half of the country’s rural population, as defined by the Census, lives in less densely populated parts of OMB metropolitan areas.\nNo matter how you slice it though, the clear majority of Americans live in urban areas. This share continues to grow as people move from rural to urban regions. Those who live in rural communities tend to be older (with an average age of 51 years, versus 46 in urban communities) and less educated (20 percent with a bachelor’s degree versus 29 percent in urban communities).\nRural and urban unemployment rates have improved in recent years, but labor force participation — the share of the population working or seeking employment — remains below pre-recession levels. Specifically, the gap between urban (63 percent) and rural (59 percent) labor force participation is significant and largely attributed to an aging rural workforce. Additionally, most rural communities still have not recovered the jobs they lost during the recession.\nHowever, not all rural communities are the same, and some are outpacing the growth of urban areas on key economic indicators. For example, many rural areas have higher rates of entrepreneurship, and the National League of Cities’ (NLC) own research found that businesses that export their goods and services are thriving in rural communities. Rural areas in many states are also making outsized contributions to their states’ GDP.\nDespite their differences, affordable housing is a prevalent concern amongst both urban and rural communities. Across the U.S., only 46 units are available for every 100 extremely low-income renter households. The problem is more severe in cities, which typically have only 42 units per 100 low income renters. Rural area housing challenges are compounded by the fact that residents typically have lower median incomes and available affordable housing is often poor quality.\nRural residents have higher homeownership rates (81 percent) than urban residents (60 percent). Younger adults are both more likely to rent and more likely to live in urban areas. Rural areas have an older demographic, whom are both more likely to own their homes and age in place. Lack of mobility within rural housing markets contributes to an overall housing shortage in these communities, limiting business expansion and attraction opportunities.\nOver the years, several other differences have become prominent between urban areas and their rural counterparts:\nIn a world dependent on online communications, broadband access remains a challenge in rural areas. In all states, broadband access is higher in urban areas than in rural ones. While 63 percent of rural Americans say they have a broadband internet connection at home, increased from 35 percent in 2007, there are still many challenges to improving accessibility.\nThe cost of providing services is the most significant hurdle. Even where broadband is available, it is often prohibitively expensive, leading to gaps not only in access, but also in adoption. Lack of internet has widespread consequences, particularly for rural economic and educational opportunities.\nHealth and Opioids\nThere were more than 33,000 opioid-induced deaths in 2015, a fourfold increase from 2000. Although overall opioid mortality rates are higher in urban counties, mortality rates in rural areas have increased more quickly across all regions over the last two decades. Between 1999 and 2016, opioid death rates in rural areas have quadrupled among the 18 to 25 age group, and tripled for females. To treat and prevent opioid addiction, various healthcare services are required. Unfortunately, resources are more limited in rural areas.\nThe lack of improved access to healthcare services also has significant impacts on life expectancy. On average, from 2005-2009, the life expectancy in rural areas was 76.7, compared with 79.1 for urban dwellers, a gap that has widened significantly over the past 50 years. People living in rural areas are also more likely to die from the five leading causes of death, including heart disease, cancer and stroke, than their urban counterparts. In 2014, approximately 71,000 deaths among rural residents were potentially preventable.\nDespite the wide gulf between urban and rural communities, there are a number of challenges they share, from affordable housing to opioid addiction. These common challenges provide opportunities for shared solutions.\nAbout the Author: Rose Kim is a research associate in NLC’s Center for City Solutions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:69f80a8f-e787-4acc-be56-9ce4006ad7e9>","<urn:uuid:8185aa9c-c26b-44ec-99aa-ee0ffaa16ac2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the essential variables needed for monitoring biological invasions, and what is their estimated economic impact across different countries?","answer":"The essential variables for monitoring biological invasions are: (1) alien species occurrence, (2) alien status of a species, and (3) impact that a species has on biodiversity and ecosystems. Regarding economic impact, studies have documented that damages associated with non-indigenous species invasions total more than US $336 billion per year across the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, India, and Brazil. In the United States specifically, invasive exotic species cause environmental losses and damages of nearly $120 billion annually.","context":["There is a key set of measurements, or essential variables, that are needed to monitor biological invasions. Some data must be provided by countries themselves, whereas a wealth of additional supporting information is available from elsewhere to support national and global monitoring efforts.\nInvasive alien species are well known as being a great risk to the environment and economies. However, there is currently no global, systematic evaluation and monitoring process in place for invasive alien species. Also, the variables and measures for monitoring invasions in a standardised way – needed to underpin a robust observation system – have until now not been fully developed or adopted. Here we present the Essential Biodiversity Variables for global monitoring of biological invasions.\nAn Essential Biodiversity Variable Approach to Monitoring Biological Invasions: Guide for Countries\nThe variables for invasion monitoring fit within the broader framework of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs; Pereira et al., 2013). The EBV framework underpins the development of a global system of harmonized observations on biodiversity change. Similarly, essential variables for invasion monitoring underpin the development of a global system of harmonised observations to assess and track the status of biological invasion (McGeoch et al., 2006; McGeoch et al., 2010).\nThe key set of measurements, or essential variables that are needed to monitor biological invasions are (1) alien species occurrence, the (2) alien status of a species and the (3) impact that a species has on biodiversity and ecosystems (McGeoch et al., in review; GEO BON, 2015).Relationship between Alien species occurrence and EBVs\n“Species occurrence” – including alien species occurrence – belongs to the class of Essential Biodiversity Variables called ‘Species populations’ (Pereira et al. 2013) and forms part of the ‘Species distributions’ EBV within this class. Observation data on alien species occurrence therefore contribute directly to the Species distributions EBV.\nThe status of a species as either alien or native at any particular locality can be considered to be an attribute of the species occurrence variable, or information that is ancillary to species occurrence. It is not itself an Essential Biodiversity Variable (EBV; Pereira et al. 2013). Nonetheless, in the context of biological invasions, this information takes on special significance. It is the essential basis upon which appropriate policy and management decisions are taken. There is also the need to prioritize collection and collation of these data, which are currently inadequate (McGeoch et al. 2012), to support effective invasion management.\nThe ‘alien species impact’ variable is a higher level, composite variable that includes information from multiple Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs), such as species traits and ecosystem structure and function. It is not itself an Essential Biodiversity Variable (EBV) (Pereira et al. 2013). Alien species impact, quantified using the standardised method for classifying alien species according to the size of their impacts can be used as an indicator of the change of ecosystems and economies by biological invasion (Hawkins et al., 2015; Blackburn et al., 2014). This variable is therefore not ‘observation’ based but rather the outcome of a semi-quantitative, analytical and stakeholder involved process.\nSome of these data must be provided by countries themselves, whereas a wealth of additional supporting information is available from elsewhere to support national and global monitoring efforts (GEO BON, 2015). Together these essential variables provide the minimum information set needed to assess and track the status of biological invasion (McGeoch et al., in review; GEO BON, 2015). This will enable countries with a range of baseline data adequacies and capacities to report on the status of biological invasions and to work towards achieving Aichi Target 9 of The Convention on Biological Diversity’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, 2011-2020.\nBlackburn, T.

{"question":"How do memory palace techniques compare between virtual reality and traditional self-testing approaches?","answer":"In virtual reality, the memory palace technique is implemented through immersive environments where users can physically navigate spaces to memorize information, such as placing famous faces in specific locations within a palace or medieval town. This approach leverages the brain's spatial organization abilities and shows improved recall accuracy. In contrast, traditional self-testing approaches focus on active recall through methods like flashcards, written responses, and oral recitation, without the spatial component. Both methods rely on active engagement rather than passive review, but VR provides an added dimension of spatial presence that helps users focus better, while self-testing's effectiveness comes from the effort required to retrieve information from memory.","context":["FREEDOM AND SAFETY\nA new study shows that people recall more information when they learn by using next-generation tools like virtual reality than they do using traditional options like standard computers.\nResearchers from the University of Maryland conducted the first-ever in-depth analysis comparing how people learn through virtual, immersive environments against more traditional platforms and found that people remember information better if it is presented to them in a virtual environment.\n“This data is exciting in that it suggests that immersive environments could offer new pathways for improved outcomes in education and high-proficiency training,” Amitabh Varshney, professor of computer science and dean of the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences at UMD, said in a statement.\nIn the study, the researchers used a concept called memory palace or spatial mnemonic encoding - where participants recall an object or item by placing it in an imaginary physical location like a building or a town. This takes advantage of the human brain’s ability to spatially organize thoughts and memories.\n“Humans have always used visual-based methods to help them remember information, whether it's cave drawings, clay tablets, printed text and images, or video,” Eric Krokos, a doctoral student in computer science and lead author on the paper, said in a statement. “We wanted to see if virtual reality might be the next logical step in this progression.”\nThe researchers used 40 volunteers, the majority of which were University of Maryland students that were unfamiliar with virtual reality. The participants were split between a group that viewed information first through a VR head-mounted display and then on a desktop computer and a group that viewed the information in the opposite order.\nBoth groups were asked to familiarize themselves with printouts of well-known faces like Abraham Lincoln, the Dalai Lama, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Marilyn Monroe. The groups were then shown the faces using the memory palace format with two imaginary locations - an interior room of an ornate palace and an external view of a medieval town.\nBoth groups navigated each memory palace for five minutes, where the desktop participants used a mouse to change their viewpoint and the VR group turned their heads from side to side and looked up and down.\nThe users were then asked to memorize the location of each of the faces shown, where half of the faces were positioned in different locations within the interior setting. For example, Oprah Winfrey appeared at the top of a grand staircase, with Stephen Hawking a few steps down, followed by Shrek. On the ground floor, Napoleon Bonaparte's face sat above a majestic wooden table, while Tthe Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was positioned in the center of the room.\nIn the medieval town, users viewed images that included Hillary Clinton’s face on the left side of a building, with Mickey Mouse and Batman placed at varying heights on nearby structures.\nThe scene then went blank for two minutes followed by each memory palace reappearing with numbered boxes where the faces previously had been. The participants were then asked to recall which face had been in which location.\n“By visually navigating the scene, users could determine that 'Hillary Clinton is in the top left window and it looks like she is about 20 yards from where I am sitting’,” said Krokos, who conducted the user-study in the Augmentarium, a visualization testbed lab on the UMD campus that launched in 2015 with funding from the National Science Foundation.\nThe researchers observed an 8.8 percent improvement in recall accuracy using VR.\nIn post-study questionnaires, all 40 participants said that they were completely comfortable and adept in navigating a desktop computer to access information. All but two users said they preferred the immersive VR environment as a potential learning platform, while only two people said they felt uncomfortable using VR.\nMany of the participants said the immersive \"presence\" while using VR allowed them to focus better, while 40 percent of the participants scored at least 10 percent higher in recall ability using VR over the desktop display.\n“By showing that virtual reality can help improve recall, it opens the door to further studies that look at the impact of VR-based training modules at all levels - from elementary school children learning astronomy to trauma residents acquiring the latest knowledge in lifesaving procedures,” Varshney said. “We believe the future of education and innovation will benefit greatly from the use of these new visual technologies.”","Imagine the following scenario: You are presented with a Swahili-English word pair list to study for a fixed amount of time. An hour later, you have a choice: You can either re-study the list, or use a blank sheet of paper to attempt to recall all the word pairs you can. You will be tested on this material in one week. What should you choose?\nMany such studies have been done, and they demonstrate repeatedly that self-testing (also called retrieval practice) is significantly more effective in long-term retention than re-studying the material for the same amount of time. This is known as the testing effect. Using the testing effect to improve retention is known as test-enhanced learning.\n“Learning is usually thought to occur during episodes of studying, whereas retrieval of information on testing simply serves to assess what was learned. [… However,] retrieval practice is actually a powerful mnemonic enhancer, often producing large gains in long-term retention relative to repeated studying.” (1)\nTest enhanced learning doesn’t just help a little bit. In a representative study, test subjects who repeatedly self-tested during their study session doubled their retention over those who only self-tested once. However, in both groups, repeated study sessions with the same material had virtually no effect on retention!\nWhat is retrieval practice / self-testing?\nYou are probably already familiar with many techniques of retrieval practice. Retrieval practice is the act of calling information to mind rather than rereading it or hearing it. (1) The effort necessary to recall the information is what makes testing beneficial to retention. Techniques can include:\n- Short response questions (written)\n- Recitation (oral rote memory drills)\n- Oral or written narration (Charlotte Mason style narration)\n- Flashcards used correctly (recalling the answer before turning the card)\nA word of warning: do not use multiple choice or true/false tests as part of test enhanced learning. I will explain why in my next blog post.\nWhat about feedback?\nAmazingly, retrieval practice maintains its effectiveness even without feedback (correction of wrong answers) as compared to repeated studying. A student could simply complete a short answer quiz after reading material, and then throw it away, and still have used his time more efficiently than had he chosen to re-read the material a second time instead.\nHowever, feedback does enhance long term retention over no feedback test enhanced learning. Conventional wisdom (and Charlotte Mason) tells us to correct mistakes in our student’s work immediately. However, repeated studies show that delayed feedback (correction of errors) is actually a more effective technique! The good news for homeschooling parents: We do not need to hover over our students as they use retrieval practice. Going over all corrections following a test, or even the next day is a more effective retention tool, and may be due to the spacing effect, which I will discuss later in this series.\nRepeated retrieval practice is better than non-repeated, but there is a trick to it. Asking for a word definition every minute for ten minutes (ten retrievals) will have the same impact as asking for it only once, after one minute. This is because the subsequent retrievals are not challenging enough. I will go into the details of when to use retrieval practice in my next Retention Toolkit Series post.\nThe Rote Memory Fallacy\nThere is a strong bias in modern education against “rote memorization.” There is a fear that students taught to parrot information have no ability to use that information in any meaningful sense. The most sought-after skill in students is transfer:\n“the ability to generalize learning from one context to another or to use learned information in a new way (e.g. to solve a problem)” (1)\nSo the key question is, does test enhanced learning improve transfer? The answer is, once again, a resounding yes. Test enhanced learning far outperforms repeated studying (rereading, reviewing notes, listening to a lecture again) in improving a student’s ability to transfer and apply knowledge.\nA Meeting of the Minds\nIt is my policy to listen closely when cognitive science confirms something which classical educators and ancient sages have reasoned to be true. The testing effect is not a new discovery.\nPsychologist and philosopher William James wrote in 1890,\n“A curious peculiarity of our memory is that things are impressed better by active than by passive repetition. I mean that in learning by heart (for example), when we almost know the piece, it pays better to wait and recollect by an effort from within, then to look at the book again. If we recover the words in the former way, we shall probably know them the next time; if in the latter way, we shall very likely need the book once more.” (2)\nAnd if that isn’t far enough back to satisfy you, Aristotle wrote in 350BC that,\n“Exercise in repeatedly recalling a thing strengthens the memory.” (3)\nApplication in the Homeschool\nMove testing from an evaluation tool to a method of study. Self-testing is a study skill that can replace review (rereading listening to a lecture again, reviewing notes). Teach students to self test independently, and use a parent-directed testing such as oral narration or short free response quizzes to improve students’ retention of material. Give feedback after testing but don’t worry about doing it immediately. It’s okay to put material into your inbox and address is later in the day or the following day. Students can also provide their own feedback during self-study by recalling as much as possible without aid, then reviewing material, putting it aside, and practicing retrieval again. Emphasize to your student the importance of allowing retrieval to be a struggle- do not give up too early and peek at notes!\nDo not use multiple choice or true/false tests.\nTiming is everything.

This reality raises increasingly pressing management issues for multinationals engaged in today’s complex and rapidly changing environment.\nA key challenge within this context emerges from doing business across regions and national boundaries. To prepare for continued success and growth internationally, companies need to equip their managers with an awareness and knowledge about differences between national cultures. Despite an increasingly cross-border business world, the emergence of “culture-free” business practices has yet to materialize; in fact, the complexities associated with differing beliefs and practices remain distinct challenges in spite of the growing interdependence among countries.\nOne feature of today’s global business environment is clear: Cultural differences persist and influence business outcomes. Therefore, as organizations extend their geographical reach, several key questions can help initiate the journey of exploring and developing intercultural cooperation in a business context.\nThe scope and impact of culture on international management practice are broad and bring to the forefront a number of critical issues that face many global organizations. From a cultural-differences perspective, today’s effective global manager must be able to deal with\nThese and many similar issues elevate the importance of building cultural competence. As a culturally competent organization, companies can be responsive, agile, and adaptable in recognizing and responding to these issues while controlling more proactively their ability to compete globally on several crucial levels:\nCultural Boundaries Are Not National Boundaries. The concept of cultural boundaries is often used interchangeably with those of geographical and political boundaries (i.e., the nation). This notion has served well those businesses that divided the world into neat geographic regions and serviced them with a multinational organizational structure—a perspective no longer attuned to the realities of the global workplace.\nCulture Is a Shared Pattern of Ideas, Emotions, and Behaviors. Culture operates on both a conscious and subconscious level; at both a group and individual level. It is useful to think of culture as an iceberg (Fig. 1). The tip of the iceberg symbolizes the level of behavior and other observables/tangibles (i.e., the world of manifestations). Beneath the level of our daily awareness, this behavior is linked to a world of values that is shared by a group. This internal world, which consists of ideas and their emotional value, is symbolically expressed as the bottom of the iceberg.\nIn simplistic terms, the shared linkage between a behavioral expression (a handshake or a bow) and an idea or notion constitutes a norm. If we observe, for example, that a particular group of people tends to shake hands upon meeting, we may call this behavior the social norm for this group. The shared linkage between an idea/notion and an emotion can be considered a value.\nThe connection between norms and values is recognized by defining culture as the complex pattern of ideas, emotions, and observable/symbolic manifestations (including behaviors, practices, institutions, and artifacts) that tends to be expected, reinforced, and rewarded by and within a particular group.\nCultural competence is, therefore, an increasingly important characteristic defining a successful global manager. Whether one is relocating to a different country, on a temporary assignment, part of a regional or global team, or leading a regional or global project, the ability to transcend cultural differences in the pursuit of business objectives is a critical skill set.\nHow Do Cultural Differences Affect Work and Management Practices? It is difficult to provide a succinct overview of all the aspects of culture that affect work and management practices. Generally, individual value orientations and social norms do influence the behaviors of leaders, managers, and employees. TMC has developed the Cultural Orientations Model, composed of 10 dimensions that exert an influence on work behavior and management practice: environment, time, action, communication, space, power, individualism, competitiveness, structure, and thinking (Fig. 2). The model is embedded in a five-step skill-building process that begins critically with open-mindedness to differences, a willingness to change, and a desire to enhance one’s skills and abilities (Fig. 3).\nThrough this learning process, global managers can acquire and deploy a cultural skills set, as an essential part of their managerial toolkit, composed of four key skills.\nThe degree to which culture can impact managerial effectiveness is best illustrated by highlighting the challenges of working with colleagues and partners from specific countries, such as India and China, two of the world’s fastest-burgeoning economies. As each country is undergoing momentous change, it is important to remember that their cultures seek continuity, underscoring the need to be patient in developing and nurturing links and relationships in India and China.\nAs these countries turn their attention to strengthening their ability to compete in the global economy, they face a new challenge—developing international expertise and gaining exposure to the developed world. In particular, they must acquire the skills and tools to lead and manage people in order to interact effectively with their counterparts from around the world. Similar challenges face all that aspire, in turn, to do business with India and China (i.e., getting firsthand knowledge about the cultures and business contexts of these countries).\nThe contrasts of culture are no better shown than in the interactions that American or Northern European managers have with their counterparts in these two countries. Critical insights can be gained by reviewing the core cultural values of these countries and the impact these values have on interpersonal interactions and management practice.\nTo avoid stereotypes, a starting point may be to access the Cultural Navigator, a TMC Web-based learning resource, to review general country information as well as evaluate the cultural norms of India and China. To build on this background and create an appreciation of the complexity for cultural differences that influence the conduct of business across national boundaries, consider four perspectives that expose how our mindset needs to change while revealing the intricacies facing us (Fig. 4).\nGap Analysis. By comparing country-to-country background data, we can discover where there may be gaps or “social distance” among national cultural norms. Cultural gaps are important in that they may represent barriers preventing the trust and confidence essential to relationship building.\nBy applying the skills of cultural due diligence and style switching from the managerial toolkit described above, we can begin to effectively close the gaps between differences in cultural orientations. Opening one’s mindset to new possibilities (i.e., viewing the world differently or adjusting management practice on the basis of differences in cultural values) is a critical choice in building cultural competence.\nUsing the gap-analysis tool can reveal potential differences along the dimensions of the Cultural Orientations Model and stimulate critical awareness. For example, the contrast between fixed and fluid orientations to time, if not acknowledged, can lead to frustration, impatience, and organizational ineffectiveness. In the case of India and China, consider what the cultural differences are, what potential conflicts might arise, and how we can use cultural knowledge to resolve these gaps or differences.\nPotential Conflict (from a U.S. perspective)\nOne’s preference may lead to frustration and lower productivity. You may\nResolution (from a U.S. perspective)\nIt is critical to bridge this gap and adapt one’s style.\nAn equally critical step is to consider the fundamental differences in cultural values and mindsets from an Indian and Chinese perspective as well as how these differences can impact business interactions. It is evident that Chinese and Indian business networks are noticeably sustained by cultural values and tradition. When these values disappear, the networks collapse and successful business relationships can be seriously, if not irreparably, compromised.\nAs within any culture, values vary across national boundaries, and their interpretation on the local scene can be complex and nuanced. To illustrate the significance of values, two key cultural values have been identified as representations of the Chinese and Indian cultures.\n• Relations, connections [Guangxi (Mandarin) in China; Rishtaa (Hindi) in India]. A person is defined not so much as an individual, but rather as members of families and social networks. Family members have primary relationship status, friends and close colleagues have secondary status, and business associates and acquaintances rank third. In Indian society, for example, the value of self-identity and community membership, shared with a partner or colleague, remains a central life experience.\nImplications for western managers: Social networks are the basis on which trust is established, reciprocated, and developed. Trust is an essential characteristic of social networks and therefore must be established before any serious business relationship can be cemented. Business relationships based on personal trust will endure greater stress and demonstrate greater adaptability. Developing relationships built on connections among counterparts may take more time to mature than in the West and require considerable patience and flexibility.\nMindset Change: Focus on developing relationships and building trust before and during business transactions and interactions. Tasks are accomplished once trust is established.\n• Face, honor [mianzi/lian (Mandarin) in China; Izat (Hindi) in India]. A sense of dignity and honor that is maintained in their social networks. Instead of “saving face” or rescuing others from embarrassment, one tends to think in terms of giving and getting face. There are a myriad of ways to give “face,” such as accepting business cards properly, addressing people by their surnames and titles, and hosting meals for others. Losing face occurs through the actions of others, i.e., when one is criticized, reprimanded, or made fun of.\nImplications for western managers: “Face” is a concept of central importance because of its universal influence in interpersonal relations for Chinese and Indians. “Loss of face” makes it impossible for the individual to function properly within the business or social community of which they are a part; colleagues or partners will no longer have confidence in the persons or companies concerned.\nMindset Change: “Saving face” and protecting one’s “honor” are guidelines affecting all successful professional and personal interactions in China and India. The key is to “save” the other person’s “face” and “honor” at least as much as one’s own, if not more.\nWhile these values may have their counterpart in Western societies, the significance of the differences is important, and there need to be fully understood when working closely with Indians and Chinese. Value differences influence the way we behave, think, manage, and work with others from different cultural backgrounds.\nUnderstanding value differences leads to a better appreciation for the nuance and influence of culture on business interaction. Taking our exploration a step further, consider the impact that culture exerts on managerial practice. This can be illustrated by comparing a representative list of six managerial competencies selected from more than 20 commonly recognized managerial competencies (Table 1).\nThrough comparisons of this kind, the implication of values gaps/differences or social distance becomes clearer in terms of the potential impact on business interactions. In turn, an in-depth awareness and knowledge of each national culture and its cultural values can enhance the individual’s and organization’s ability to build stronger interpersonal relationships when dealing across national boundaries.\nAnalyzing Culture Clashes. Drawing upon country-specific knowledge, a variety of comparative-analyses data sets, and one’s cultural skill set, a manager is now better equipped to approach a specific country cultural circumstance with heightened understanding and confidence. In the scenarios that follow, one can apply one’s cultural toolkit to resolve day-to-day intercultural work situations for increased efficiency and productivity. How do you think you would address these cases?\nYou receive a call from one of the Indian Alphacorp managers who was involved in contract negotiations several months ago. She indicated her dissatisfaction, but she did not elaborate on any specific concerns. Although you have moved to a different position and new responsibilities, you checked with the technical experts and the implementation team. You find out that everything was delivered and installed according to Alphacorp’s specifications. Recent testing indicated superior systems performance. How can you resolve this issue? (Fig. 5).\nSolution: The best approach to resolving this situation would be to schedule a visit with your successor at Alphacorp, to explore the source of the client’s dissatisfaction.\nAnalysis: This scenario demonstrates a gap between being and doing orientations in the context of a project. Alphacorp is a being-oriented, or relationship-centered, organization. As such, it is important for its managers to establish strong, trusting relationships between employees as the foundation for business transactions. It is very likely that the source of dissatisfaction is that you have moved into a different position, and a trusting relationship has not yet been established with your successor. Sending a technical expert cannot adequately substitute for this loss. Rather, transferring the relationship to your successor through a joint visit to Alphacorp will give this being-oriented customer needed assurance.\nOn the basis of your success at the U.S. headquarters as a sales manager, you are sent to China to oversee the creation of a new department. You are fluent in both Mandarin and Cantonese, so verbal and written communication is not a problem. During your first meeting with the new department, you discuss in detail and in Mandarin your motivation and interest in making this department one of your organization’s top business units. You tell them about an incentive program you have created that will allow each member to excel and be rewarded for individual contributions. You make decisions and implement changes you feel will help you achieve this goal. After a few days, it becomes apparent that your Chinese subordinates are not enthusiastic about your plans. Why are they upset? (Fig 6).\nSolution: The Chinese would prefer to be treated as a group and not receive individual recognition for contributions.\nAnalysis: It is inaccurately assumed that the competitiveness used as motivation and incentives for sales forces in the U.S. will have the same impact with members of a Chinese sales force. Such an approach will be unpopular with the Chinese for at least two reasons: The culture is much more cooperative in nature than in the U.S., using established networks to accomplish goals, and the Chinese would prefer group recognition to having individuals excel.\nAs these two scenarios show, cultural awareness and understanding differences in cultural norms and values are crucial elements of a global manager’s skill set. Cultural competence enables both the organization on a strategic level and a manager or team on a tactical level to resolve issues and compete in today’s complex cross-border marketplace. Without cultural competence, what are the implications of remaining unaware of the impact social distance or gaps might have in these situations? What repercussions may result if the gaps between managers andteams persist?\nBuilding cultural competence is a multifaceted process accelerated by the day-to-day reality of working across national boundaries. Indian and Chinese management culture is in a time of transition—on a local level, cultural values and norms continue to exert a strong influence, while on an international level, the influences of globalization, technology, and Western management practices have increased over the past decades. While China and India push to acquire knowledge of, exposure to, and experience in Western management practices, their counterparts around the world seek market penetration and business growth in these countries.\nThe degree to which Indian and Chinese management systems change, and the speed of that change, are at the crux of the debate about transition. Regardless of the pace of change, it is important to appreciate that traditional cultural values, such as the concept of hierarchy, the nature of social and community networks, the implication of continuity and stability, and a prevalence for flexibility and ambiguity, continue to impact managerial practice and remain influential features of the cross-cultural management landscape.\nFor managers and organizations doing business in India and China, a clear appreciation of individual and national cultural values and norms is essential—be it for the Western expatriate manager in India/China or his/her country counterpart engaged in outsourcing or offshoring activities with the West or as a leader of a multicultural virtual team. While work circumstances do not always reflect cultural differences, evidence shows that issues of this nature are an inevitable thread in the fabric of management practice and personal interaction.\nWhile intimidating and frustrating at times, the good news is that cultural challenges are manageable by acknowledging cultural gaps openly and resolving them cooperatively by using available cultural knowledge, country information, and personal dialogue to develop core cultural competence skills to sharpen one’s mindset for the global marketplace.\nTim Walker, Chief Operating Officer of Training Management Corp. (TMC), brings more than 25 years of international experience in working and living across cultures. He is the author of Doing Business Internationally: The Guide to Cross-Cultural Success and Sales and Marketing across Cultures. Information about TMC is available at www.tmcorp.com.\nIn this issue of TWA, which highlights India and China, we are pleased to include an article on the influence of culture on competing in the global market. The article provides tips on how to build a culturally competent organization. It describes how culture affects the way in which companies do business in today’s global market and also presents insight into the similarities and differences in the values, culture, and management practices of India and China compared to other regions.

{"question":"What are the main differences between transactional journey maps and system flowcharts in visualizing business processes?","answer":"Transactional journey maps and system flowcharts differ significantly in their visualization of business processes. System flowcharts show the flow of data through major system components like data entry programs, storage media, processors, and communication networks, using symbols and short text labels to represent specific operations and pathways. They focus on technical processes and system architecture. Transactional journey maps, on the other hand, focus on improving specific customer events or touchpoints that influence satisfaction and loyalty. While they provide detailed analysis of particular customer interactions, their limited focus may prevent understanding of what happens before and after the mapped touchpoint. Unlike flowcharts, transactional maps require customer data to be credible and should consider the customer's perspective rather than just internal processes.","context":["Whether transactional or holistic, journey maps need customer data to be relevant and credible.\nIn last month’s article, I discussed how to get the most from customer journey maps and how to make them work for your organization. Many of you asked for more details about how to build one, so I will share some of the lessons we learned in building ours.\nAs we said last month, there is no right or wrong way to develop a customer journey map. Still, it’s not a free-form exercise. There are proven guidelines to ensure success. Here are five tips.\n1. Decide what kind of map you need.\nCX teams often ask what kind of journey map they should develop—a detailed transactional one that focuses on improving a specific event, or a map that takes more of a holistic view of the end-to-end customer journey. Both identify “moments of truth” that strongly influence customer satisfaction and loyalty.\nSome CX leaders view holistic maps as a luxury they don’t have time for; they’re under pressure to solve immediate problems. Transactional maps might seem like the best place to start, but their limited focus keeps you from addressing what happens to the customer before and after the touchpoint being mapped. It’s a good argument for making the initial investment in a holistic map and its supporting customer data first, and then drilling down to solve transactional issues in the next phase.\nI confess my bias toward the latter approach. Why? Customers don’t care about our processes, our departments or how well we do or don’t work together. Customers view us as a company regardless of where they interface with us. Holistic maps help us take the customer’s view—and that’s not always easy for a company to do if they are looking at a single part of the journey.\n2. Start and end with the customer’s perspective.\nWhether you choose a transactional or holistic map, it’s important to begin with the customer perspective. It can be risky business to start CX projects based on internal views only, without validating them against customer data.\nFor example, in the process of building our journey map based on customer interviews and survey data, we found there was a chasm at each handoff in the customer lifecycle—from sales to service to implementation to support. Though we had procedures and forms in place for each handoff point, they weren’t sufficient, and in many cases our customers were having to repeat themselves at each new point in the lifecycle. They fell into the chasm, so to speak. We learned that we needed to implement a formal, inter-departmental meeting at each handoff point. We also learned that, in many cases, what we thought we knew about our customers didn’t at all match their perception of us. Such is the value of a holistic journey map.\n3. Don’t reinvent the data wheel.\nYou don’t have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to customer data for journey mapping. You can leverage data from an existing relationship program and update it with interviews, or use the interviews to target specific transactional details.\nWe brought in a CX consultant to help us develop our ever-evolving journey map, and when we did we had already collected data from more than 10,000 customer surveys, as well as results of focus groups and one-on-one interviews. After reviewing the data, the consultant interviewed 20 customers and 20 employees, and found that the interviews largely reflected our data findings. The consultant’s work was of value because he probed on issues that he found in the data and gave us a good view of where we were and weren’t meeting customer expectations. It was well worth the investment to get that outside view.\nOne caution: Don’t let internal colleagues discount the information you gather in interviews or surveys, or decline to take responsibility for certain survey findings. It’s simply human nature to want to do this, so be prepared. The customer journey map exercise and accompanying customer data can help you get very specific about interactions that need to be improved, and who is responsible for them.\n4. Get executive buy-in.\nStart customer journey mapping with an open dialogue with the executive team and all stakeholders. The first step is to be sure they understand the purpose of a journey map and what value it can deliver to the organization. Executives can be fuzzy on the definition, or think you’re proposing a process map. Be clear that a journey map shows the view of your company from the outside in.\nNext, find out what kind of information from the CX function would be useful for them. Continue the dialogue by setting up a steering committee with senior stakeholders who interact with and/or impact customers. They will provide valuable guidance. In turn, you can develop a meaningful plan on what to do with the CX information and insights once you get them, including how best to share them, validate them and have the organization act on them.\n5. Keep it under control.\nA customer journey map can easily get crowded. There is a tendency to try to put everything on it. If you load it with too much information, it becomes a monster, something that needs a voiceover to be understood. It no longer tells its own story. Holistic maps should focus on interactions, moments of truth, key themes and emotional impacts. They should reference real data and focus on the touchpoints that are most important to your customers. That’s where you’ll make the biggest impact.\nOur map is 25 feet long and three feet wide. Constructed in Microsoft Office Visio, we added graphics to help our client visualize key parts of the story. Our map also has removable sections so we can change information depending on our audience, whether internal or external. This is a good way to ensure your map stays focused on your audience. When I show our map to customers, for example, I include content illustrating improvements we have made based on their feedback. When I show it to internal departments, I make sure the map shows customer emotional reactions at key interface points.\nA tool for action and positive change\nBuilding the dream journey map, and getting it right, can be a difficult task. In our experience, the soundest approach is to make the initial investment in a holistic map and its supporting customer data, and then drill down to solve transactional issues in the next phase. Real world demands might intervene, but the truth is the more you know about your customers, their experiences with your company and what’s most important to them, the greater the return you’ll get from your mapping investment.\nAbove all, keep in mind that the map is a tool. Its purpose is to present information not for its own sake, but as the starting point for CX analysis, action and positive change.","By using symbols and short text labels to show data inputs outputs storage points and pathways they can condense information.

A DFD details the flow of data through a system. Data flow chart When you need to take a deep dive into your data a data flow diagram can help.\nThe data flow diagram DFD template at this level 2 shows the flow of information and can be used to visualize an entire system. It shows how information enters and leaves the system what changes the information and where information. A data-flow diagram has no control flow there are no decision rules and no loops.\nA neat and clear DFD can depict a good amount of the system requirements graphically. In a flow chart a reader can determine what operations will be performed in what order and under what circumstances.

How to Create a System Flowchart. And because tech teams and non-technical.\nWhat Is A Level 2 Flow. DFD does not have control flow and no loops or decision rules are present. It can be manual automated or a combination of both.\nIn a sense data flow diagram provides a very high level view of the system while a flow chart is a lower level view basically showing the algorithm. A hierarchy flow chart is one of the most popular flow charts because it. Each data store should have at least one data flow in and data flow out.\nData flowcharts can range from simple even hand-drawn process overviews to in-depth. It has only a single type of arrow is used 3. One of the most useful tool for this is creating a flowchart which is a diagram.\nThe DFD also provides information about the outputs and inputs of each entity and the process itself. This level describes the systems main functions and breaks down the 0 level DFD process into sub procedures. Often it is a preliminary step used to create an overview of the system that can later be elaborated.\nThe main objective is to represent the processes and data flow between them. It focuses on the major data flows. One may also ask what are the types of data flow diagram.\nData flow diagram shows the flow of data between the different entities and datastores in a system while a flow chart shows the steps involved to carried out a task. DFDs can also be used for the. A data flow diagram DFD maps out the flow of information for any process or system.\nIt uses defined symbols like rectangles circles and arrows plus short text labels to show data inputs outputs storage points and the routes between each destination. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm a step-by-step approach to solving a task. It is a generic tool that can be adapted for a wide variety of purposes and can be used to describe various processes such as a manufacturing process an administrative or service process or a project plan.\nAs its name indicates its focus is on the flow of information where data comes from where it goes and how it gets stored. Before you start mapping out data flow diagrams you need to follow four best practices to create a valid DFD. A data flow chart is a diagram that displays the flow of data through the data management process.\nA data flow diagram DFD illustrates how data is processed by a system in terms of inputs and outputs. The main objective is to represents the flow of control in program. The flow of data of a system or a process is represented by DFD.\nEven though this chart has no images the flow of data is not difficult to grasp. It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs of each entity and the process itself. A systems stored data must go through a process.\nA flow chart details the processes to follow. DFD is the abbreviation for Data Flow Diagram. A flowchart is a picture of the separate steps of a process in sequential order.\nEach process should have at least one input and one output. A data-flow diagram is a way of representing a flow of data through a process or a system usually an information system.

{"question":"How do the data sharing approaches in Alzheimer's research differ between general population studies and Down syndrome studies?","answer":"Both types of studies emphasize open data sharing but have specific protocols. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for the general population requires investigators to sign agreements not to re-identify subjects, redistribute data, or contact principal investigators. For Down syndrome research, data sharing is aligned with three major AD biomarker studies (ADNI, DIAN, and API) and follows a similar open-access format, but includes additional specific biomarkers like tau-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid measurements, evaluated every 15-30 months.","context":["Publishing your data: the ethics question\n23 July 2013 1 Comment\nIn practice, this means looking at all of those legal and policy issues which have an impact on data sharing and use, such as copyright, licensing, ethics, Gov 2.0, etc and keeping an eye on developments overseas.\nANDS is building the Australian Research Data Commons: a cohesive collection of research resources from all research institutions, to make better use of Australia’s research data outputs.\nLast April, I published a short item in this blog about the importance of data citation if you are to get recognition for publishing your data and making it available to others.\nThere is increasing evidence that making your data available to others (or, to use a more familiar term, publishing your data) can enhance your research reputation. But consider the case of researchers whose work involves human subjects who might feel that their data cannot be published. This presents something of a challenge: how to handle sensitive data so that others can use it, while following ethical guidelines and making sure that the data cannot be wrongly used.\nData can be sensitive for a variety of reasons. Privacy considerations mean that personal, identified data cannot usually be made available to others. Security considerations might mean that you would be putting people at risk if you made some data available. You might also consider the possibility that your data describes the last remaining population of some rare species and, while most of the data might be fine to share, you don’t want anyone to put the species at risk by providing location information (think of the Wollemi Pine).\nAll is not lost.\nThe fact that your data might be sensitive does not mean that you cannot consider sharing it. However, there are ethical considerations to keep in mind, and it helps if you do your planning at the beginning of a project.\nFirst, there is the issue of consent when dealing with personal information. This means that you need to inform participants in your study how the research data will be stored, preserved, and used in the long term. You will need this for any study of this kind. You’ll need to inform your participants how confidentiality will be maintained. You’ll need informed consent, either written or verbal, for data sharing.\nSecond, you may need to consider the issue of anonymising any data that you plan to share so that individuals, organisations, or businesses cannot be identified. There are a number of techniques that can be used to anonymise data: removing direct identifiers such as names or addresses, aggregating variables such as replacing date of birth with age groups, and reducing the upper or lower ranges of a variable to hide outliers (such as subjects with very high salaries or advanced ages). There is really good information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on the finer details of how to anonymise your data.\nAnonymisation is not always required. You may, for example, have conducted oral history interviews where it is customary to publish and share the names of people interviewed, if they have given their consent.\nIn addition, not all data can be anonymised. Audiovisual data is very difficult to anonymise, so it may not be worth it. Consider using transcripts of interviews, or accept that there is some data which simply cannot be shared.\nThird, you’ll need to consider how future users might access the data, and any conditions that you might want to apply to its use. You might, for example, want to limit access to people working in the same discipline, or wish to have an assurance that there will be no data-mining that might allow the data to be re-identified.\nThis is probably the trickiest aspect of sharing the data, as you need to have confidence that the data repository you choose has the capacity to keep your data secure and mediate requests for its use.\nIn Australia, there are several examples of facilities that might meet your needs. The Australian Data Archive (ADA) is well set up for this purpose as is its offshoot, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Archive (ATSIDA). Both can handle qualitative and quantitative data. There are other excellent facilities in other countries.\nAny access conditions you want to impose can be expressed by the licence attached to the data. If the data repository you choose does not have a standard licence, there is a template available through AusGOAL, the Australian Governments Open Access and Licensing Framework.\nAny plans you have to make your data available will have to be approved by your local Human Research Ethics Committee. Some members of the Committee may not be comfortable about your proposals. If they aren’t, you could tell them about one major data sharing initiative that has been a huge success in terms of making data available to improve our capacity to understand Alzheimer’s Disease.\nThe Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was established in California in 2004. It is a longitudinal study intended to improve our understanding of the progression from mild aging through to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Central to the study has been the notion that all data should be shared, enabling researchers from different countries and disciplines to take part. By March 2013, there were 3,712 approved investigators accessing the data.\nAnyone seeking to make use of the de-identified data must sign an agreement, which stipulates that they will not attempt to re-identify or contact subjects involved in the study, disclose or redistribute the data, or attempt to contact ADNI principal investigators (PIs) or staff.\nAustralian ADNI is based on neuroimaging data from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) which has 12 partners around Australia, all sharing data.\nSo, who says it can’t be done?\nThere is a more detailed guide to the whole topic of ethics, consent and data sharing available via the ANDS website.\nThe Margaret Henty series on data management","Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have been largely neglected in therapeutic and biomarker studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adults with DS are uniformly affected by AD pathology by their 30's and have a 70-80% chance of clinical dementia by their 60's. In 95% of cases, DS is associated with three copies of chromosome 21, each containing of copy of the Amyloid-beta (A?) Precursor Protein gene (leading to a 1.5-fold increase in A? protein). Yet, nowhere is it clearer than in DS that A? deposition is not sufficiet to produce dementia, as individuals harbor this pathology for over a decade before cognitive decline is apparent. DS can be seen as a setting of amplified sensitivity to risk and protective factors that moderate the relationship between A?, neurodegeneration and clinical dementia. Understanding the factors that moderate this relationship in DS and biomarkers for those factors is critically important in the design of therapeutic trials for AD in DS and in general. Thus, this longitudinal study of Neurodegeneration in Aging DS (NiAD) and its relationship to cognition has the potential to: 1) identify critical factors that link A? deposition to neurodegeneration and, ultimately, dementia; 2) define biomarkers for these factors; and, most importantly, 3) set a foundation for an efficient transition from this biomarker study to a therapeutic trial to combat A in DS augmented by biomarker outcomes. For the past 5 years, the three independent research groups included in this application have been studying the course of A? deposition and other imaging biomarkers and their impact on cognitive/functional measures in adults with DS [(a) the combined Pittsburgh/Madison study; (b) the Banner Alzheimer's Institute study; and (c) the Cambridge study]. In their ongoing work, 140 adults with DS (including 23 with DS/AD-dementia) have undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) scans and neuropsychological/ functional assessments. These three research groups now propose to combine resources and harmonize all protocols in response to the request from NIA/NICHD to develop a large AD biomarker study in DS. This study will be further strengthened by aligning NiAD with the three largest ongoing longitudinal studies of AD biomarkers in the general population: the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative (API). All data will be made available in an open-access format using a model similar to ADNI. The established DS cohort is a significant advantage that will shorten the recruitment phase, maximize longitudinal data that can be acquired and allow for addition of new biomarkers to be compared to longitudinal clinical and imaging measures. The proposed 5-year longitudinal study will examine progression of AD related biomarkers (A?-, tau- and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural and functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid A? and tau, plasma A? and proteomics, genetics, neuropathology) and cognitive/functional measures in 180 adults with DS (>25 yrs. of age) and 40 biomarker-controls. Subjects will be re-evaluated every 15 months to assess changes in cognition/adaptive functioning and every 30 months to detect biomarker changes.\nAdults with Down syndrome (DS) are at an extremely high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), with most individuals over age 40 evidencing neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques (which are thought to be associated with the eventual appearance of AD symptoms). The goal of the current application is to recruit and follow 180 adults with DS and 40 biomarker controls to enable the identification of the longitudinal progression of AD in adults with DS using clinical, cognitive, imaging and genetic and biochemical biomarkers. This data is not only necessary to deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of AD in DS, but may also offer information that will prove useful in the design of treatment trials to slow or prevent AD in DS.\n|Hu, Ziheng; Wang, Lirong; Ma, Shifan et al.
