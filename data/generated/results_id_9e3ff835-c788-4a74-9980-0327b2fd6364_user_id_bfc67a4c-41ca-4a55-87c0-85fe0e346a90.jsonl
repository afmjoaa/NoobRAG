{"question":"Do global payroll solutions and CMMS systems face similar challenges in proving their value to upper management?","answer":"Yes, both systems face similar challenges in demonstrating their value to senior management. For global payroll, the challenge lies in convincing C-suite executives who only see invoice costs but don't recognize hidden operational costs and efficiency gains. Similarly with CMMS, the connection between maintenance cost reduction and profitability is not always obvious to senior management, requiring demonstration of how reducing downtime leads to increased productivity and profits. Both systems require comprehensive value assessments to reveal their full financial impact beyond surface-level costs.","context":["When building the business case for global payroll, much rests on the potential return on investment (ROI).\nWhile cost should not be the only consideration in the move to a global payroll solution, as not all benefits show up clearly on a balance sheet, it is ROI that so often drives the conversation at boardroom level.\nOnly by understanding the true costs of a decentralized payroll approach can you assess the real financial value of any future improvements. For those considering a global payroll transformation, this blog will demonstrate how to calculate an accurate comparison between your current and potential payroll costs.\nWe’ll look at the importance of undertaking a value assessment with your prospective payroll vendor, identify where savings can typically be made, and assess just how quickly a global payroll solution might start generating a return.\nThe first step is noting the ideal list of key data inputs required for a value assessment. If not all data is available, assumptions can be made to ensure the evaluation is still valid — however, this will impact the overall analysis. The key data required includes:\nBuilding the internal business case\nIn most organizations, HR and payroll teams can recognize the value in global payroll straight away. As the people on the front lines, carrying out the work day-to-day, they see the opportunities for process optimization up close and personal.\nThe challenge lies in selling that vision to the C-suite — the CFOs and other chief decision-makers who don’t live and breathe payroll every day.\nThese key stakeholders typically deal in facts and figures. They may see an invoice from a payroll provider in a specific country and base conclusions on the bottom line, too far removed from the payroll process to recognize the hidden costs that add considerably to the payslip price. The cost, for example, of their own staff moving data to and from that provider.\nConducting a value assessment of global payroll can help uncover these hidden costs, looking beyond supplier invoices to reveal the uncosted activity that goes on within the organization to make payroll work.\nThe assessment is a challenge in itself — namely, gathering the right information from across the enterprise to make your business case accurate. It will take time and effort, but your prospective global payroll vendor should be able to help with some of the heavy lifting.\nAvoiding the common pitfalls when building your business case\nIn trying to calculate ROI to build the business case for global payroll, organizations will typically compare current and potential costs by using their current ‘per payslip’ price as the benchmark.\nIf you’re currently paying $10 a payslip, and your potential global payroll solution works out to $12 per payslip, resistance is to be expected. But the price on the invoice shows only what you pay — not what you save.\nInvoice values fail to show the efficiencies gained from standardization or the elimination of manual processes, all of which would save considerable money across the business.\nThe per-payslip figure also fails to take into account the level of service you’re receiving. With existing local providers, there may be additional fees for statutory filings or for treasury services. These figures need to be factored in for a fair comparison of the service and costs you have today versus what you could expect from an optimized global payroll solution.\nThe true cost and potential savings\nFor the global payroll vendor to help you uncover the true cost of your current approach, they’ll need to know things like the country breakdown, the payroll frequency, the headcount, and the number of legal entities. All are normally easy to identify.\nWhat’s typically harder for the vendor to get, and you’ll need to provide as accurately as possible, is the number of FTEs processing that payroll. This must also account for any time taken by other non-payroll FTEs who support the process in some way, be they HR staff transferring information or IT team members providing system support.\nUltimately, the global payroll vendor is seeking to reduce the time each FTE spends on payroll. If team members in Finance are performing payroll tasks on the side, how much time can be given back to their regular duties once the vendor picks up payroll?\nAs well as saving time, the vendor is also looking to reduce payroll administration costs and to avoid duplicate work through integration.\nDrawing in data through advanced integrations (as opposed to spreadsheet exchanges and other manual methods of supplying data) not only ensures a cleaner data set, but limits the opportunity for payroll errors.\nIntegration offers further opportunities for efficiency, so vendors may wish to explore the potential for systems integrations between HR and payroll, or time and attendance systems. Consolidated, centralized reporting and analytics tools, meanwhile, afford further tangible benefits — not least the ability to finally get an all-encompassing view of your global payroll costs.\nWhen it comes to ROI, what does ‘good’ look like?\nWhen you conduct a value assessment with your potential payroll provider, you would expect to see savings. Without one, the business case would be dead in the water. But just how significant a savings should be expected — and how quickly will the new solution have paid for itself?\nSavings can be identified both in terms of time and cost. In terms of the reduction in time spent by FTEs on your payroll, research shows payroll teams can save up to 40% of the time spent on automatable activities.\nWhen added to other efficiency gains, this could lead to an overall reduction in payroll administration costs of as much as 65%, based on assessments conducted by CloudPay. Even taking into account the upfront costs of implementation, this means the solution has normally repaid the business by the end of year one.\nThese savings are typically realized in the following key areas:\n- Reduced FTE time spent on payroll processing activities by 45%\n- Reduced payroll administration costs, such as by removing duplication\n- Reduced payroll leakage below 2.5% (a higher leakage rate is usually the result of no policies, a lack of standardization, and/or low technology adoption)\nMoving forward across a typical three- to five-year contract, 65% savings on annual payroll costs represents significant ROI for the business.\nWhy conduct a value assessment?\nWhile many organizations will seek input from a global payroll vendor following a notable failure of current payroll processes, it can be sensible to undertake a value assessment even when payroll is running largely error-free.\nThere may simply be a sense within your organization that your current approach to payroll — whereby everything's done locally — leaves significant room for improvement in terms of efficiency.\nUnderstanding the true costs of your current operation will reveal the value those process improvements could have.","CMMS cuts maintenance costs, increases profits\nThe connection between lowering maintenance costs and enhancing profitability may not always be obvious to senior management.\nIn the world of plant operations, CMMS normally stands for “Computerized Maintenance Management Software.” Those letters, however, could also be the acronym for “Cutting More Maintenance Spending” because CMMS does, in fact, reduce maintenance costs.\nBy playing a role in reducing expenditures by increasing the capacity of critical equipment through automated maintenance, CMMS can contribute as a profit center. The connection between lowering maintenance costs and enhancing profitability may not always be obvious to senior management, but the equation that demonstrates this connection could not be simpler:\n- Reducing downtime = Increasing uptime\n- Increasing uptime = Greater productivity\n- Greater productivity = Increased profits\nBut how exactly does CMMS achieve the cost savings that lead to higher profitability? The answers to that question can vary from company to company, but fundamentally, there are five basic ways to shore up maintenance costs and gain the benefits CMMS has to offer.\nPreventing equipment failures\nWhen machinery or plant systems go down, it means lost production time for manufacturers, resulting in additional labor/overtime, potentially late deliveries, and increased costs in replacement parts. By using CMMS to identify, in advance, the equipment that needs parts replaced more frequently, and setting up a preventive maintenance schedule, repairs can be made before the machine malfunctions.\nTo prevent equipment failures, start with a strong preventive maintenance plan as the best “offense” strategy to minimize unplanned failures and cut costs. When inevitable breakdowns occur, CMMS will capture accurate, timely information from work orders, which show the real-life needs during equipment failures. CMMS can aggregate that work order data in summary report form, drive PM schedules, and ensure assets get checked before failures occur.\nOperations personnel can look up an asset and check the history of repairs. Maintenance data may show that a spare part wears out every five months, for example, and routine maintenance can be scheduled every four months, in advance of a potential malfunction to eliminate equipment downtime.\nPMs can be scheduled on a calendar basis, “meter readings,” or a combination of both. Meter readings can provide a higher degree of certainty in scheduling the PM. If users can retrieve this data in an automated fashion, they will get more “data points” on the asset while eliminating human error during data entry, thus giving better, more accurate and timely analysis.\nThe reality is this: Preventive maintenance is always cheaper than corrective measures, so it makes sense to circumvent equipment failure whenever possible. Or, as Benjamin Franklin put it: “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”\nStreamlining repair communications\nSeamless communications between staff members who report problems and the maintenance team who responds to those reports contribute to maintenance efficiency. With CMMS, automating the repair process can replace the handwritten notes that are easily misplaced/difficult to read, the avalanche of redundant e-mails that have to be retyped into CMMS, or the constant interruptions managers get from radio calls or hallway encounters with staffers checking on the status of repairs. Also, managing redundant requests, getting appropriate approval from supervisors, and other tasks around the request process can be automated.\nFor example, a maintenance repair dispatcher on the West Coast receives a “trouble ticket” about a broken machine at the company’s facility across the country. With CMMS, that ticket is automatically routed to the most appropriate technician. The automated system also generates a work order that the technician completes once the repair request is fulfilled and the machine is back up and running.\nThroughout this process, CMMS updates the East Coast facility until the machine resumes functioning. In this way, CMMS saves time and energy for staffers because it keeps everyone in the communication loop and they can stay abreast of repair progress. Further, the automated system also clarifies which technician is responding to which request, and removes any mystery about when the problem has been resolved.\nOnce again, by using CMMS, not only does staff communication improve but the repair process for technicians is much more efficient, which translates to faster machine repairs and improved uptime.\nStretch the life of your assets\nCMMS gives managers an edge when they need to make strategic decisions about capital expenditures and equipment replacement. Typically, the age of an asset is the determining factor when considering whether it needs to be replaced or not. That criterion, however, may not be the best measure or the most cost-effective one.\nFor example, the director of operations asks managers to list the assets they will need to overhaul or replace so he can add to his budget for the forthcoming fiscal year. Because CMMS technology analyzes and grades equipment based on existing operational information captured daily from PMs and WOs (including labor, parts, and other factors), a 10-year-old air conditioning unit could show superior uptime versus a newer model. Replacement could be postponed until the following year’s budget. That conclusion might be drawn because the newer AC has required far more repairs than the older one, plus the older AC may show a steady or even decreasing frequency of failure with a steady decrease in maintenance costs.\nThis analysis helps shift asset capital spending to where it is needed more, making it a significant contributor to the ROI of a CMMS system. While no single CMMS-generated report can fully automate purchasing decisions, this technology makes it easier to assess key performance indicators and develop a more robust, multidimensional view of equipment costs. It can also help with a more accurate deployment of staff, PMs, etc. CMMS makes it possible to sift through asset maintenance history and grade machines to better inform budget and operational decisions, helping to intelligently stretch the life of your assets.\nIf there is one maintenance headache—and expense—that every manager wants to avoid, it is the cost of fines levied by regulatory agencies. CMMS significantly diminishes this problem in several ways. Also, a by-product of CMMS is that much of the information needed for this compliance is already in the CMMS system, eliminating the need to keep redundant records.\nManagers use CMMS to automate the process of defining, scheduling, and implementing preventive maintenance and work order tasks and schedules to comply with safety and environmental regulations as well as equipment insurance policies.\nFor example, OSHA auditors want to see a trackable history of what was done on a piece of equipment, when it was done, who did it, how often it has been inspected, whether it had clear instructions and safety procedures documented, etc. The automated PM system of a CMMS system can accurately and easily search historical work orders and related data of an asset and generate a report that will satisfy regulatory agencies.\nIn addition, CMMS-generated logs of preventive maintenance work provide an accurate history of repairs in response to a civil lawsuit. For example, a football stadium was being sued for damages related to a patron’s fall in a restroom. The management team at the stadium was able to rebuff the suit because they could show the history of all the work (PM and corrective maintenance) that had been done around the restrooms and related systems using CMMS reports that transformed work order histories into a summary chart of repairs.\nIn another case, a large textile and linen rental company implemented its CMMS so effectively that it not only met OSHA compliance but became eligible for the agency’s Voluntary Protection Program, which recognizes and partners with businesses that show excellence in occupational safety and health.\nOne of the truisms about regulatory compliance is that “if it is not documented, it did not happen.” CMMS provides that documentation and proof of compliance—which is no small feat considering the fact that in the last decade, OSHA has levied more than $300 million in penalties against U.S. corporations.\nJust-in-time parts inventory\nCMMS allows manufacturing plants to keep lower stocks of spare parts by giving an accurate count and setting “just-in-time” reorder points to match up with maintenance demands. This is especially helpful with expensive parts (and those with long-lead times) that need to be stocked at every facility within a company.\nAs a result, real cost savings can be achieved when different locations “share” these costly parts. With CMMS, managers can quickly search throughout the company to find the parts they need and have them delivered overnight—a system that satisfies most situations.\nIn one case, a company was keeping three to four circuit boards on hand as replacement stock in each of its facilities. The firmware on the circuit boards, however, expired after 12 months, rendering the boards useless. Consequently, the company was throwing away $10,000 circuit boards. Once the CMMS program was put in place, the circuit boards were stocked at only a few plants and then overnighted to the plant that needed them, facilitating the company’s just-in-time parts delivery system.\nRather than keeping multiple circuit boards on hand, the company used CMMS to keep track of spare parts inventories. Now, the CMMS system automatically notifies the engineering department when a circuit board is shipped out.\nThese five facets of cost savings demonstrate how CMMS quickly shows a return on investment and enhances maintenance operations in ways that go far beyond simply tracking daily work orders. Whether using CMMS to prevent equipment failures, extend the life of assets, and keep parts inventory costs low, or to improve staff communication and regulatory compliance records, this technology can prove invaluable to a company’s bottom line.\nCMMS does far more than make sure broken machines get fixed. It increases capacity for an organization, as if the company was adding new equipment. Essentially by reducing downtime, it can shift the view of upper management that maintenance is a profit center—not a cost center.\nROI Method 1: Classic Maintenance Expense Model\nIf you have a good idea of what your maintenance expenses are (including any combination of equipment, inventory, downtime, overtime, or overall), the formula is relatively easy.\nThe example above spans 3 years. Annual maintenance budgets are $400,000 or $1,200,000 over the 3 years. The cost of the software over that 3-year period in this example is $9,150. The annual percentage improvement estimates are 2%, 4%, and 7% based on the assumption that improvements increase through greater CMMS product usage. With these conservative improvement percentages, the company will show a stronger bottom line of $42,850 over 3 years. That comes to an ROI of 368% and a payback in just 2.56 months.\nCMMS can make this happen by reducing labor/overtime, improving inventory control, decreasing equipment replacement/repairs, etc. These are all possible through a good CMMS implementation.\n|Search the online Automation Integrator Guide|\nCase Study Database\nGet more exposure for your case study by uploading it to the Control Engineering case study database, where end-users can identify relevant solutions and explore what the experts are doing to effectively implement a variety of technology and productivity related projects.\nThese case studies provide examples of how knowledgeable solution providers have used technology, processes and people to create effective and successful implementations in real-world situations.

{"question":"How do RHIC and CERN's facilities compare in demonstrating fundamental physics theories?","answer":"RHIC demonstrated unexpected findings about the Standard Model by showing quarks and gluons form a nearly perfect liquid instead of the predicted gas, requiring revision of theoretical models. Meanwhile, CERN's Large Hadron Collider validated the Standard Model by discovering a particle consistent with the predicted Higgs boson, which explains how particles acquire mass. Both facilities have been crucial in testing and refining our understanding of fundamental physics.","context":["April 18, 2005\nTAMPA, FL — The four detector groups conducting research at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) — a giant atom \"smasher\" located at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory — say they've created a new state of hot, dense matter out of the quarks and gluons that are the basic particles of atomic nuclei, but it is a state quite different and even more remarkable than had been predicted. In peer-reviewed papers summarizing the first three years of RHIC findings, the scientists say that instead of behaving like a gas of free quarks and gluons, as was expected, the matter created in RHIC's heavy ion collisions appears to be more like a liquid.\nSecretary of Energy Samuel Bodman\n\"Once again, the physics research sponsored by the Department of Energy is producing historic results,\" said Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, a trained chemical engineer. \"The DOE is the principal federal funder of basic research in the physical sciences, including nuclear and high-energy physics. With today's announcement we see that investment paying off.\"\n\"The truly stunning finding at RHIC that the new state of matter created in the collisions of gold ions is more like a liquid than a gas gives us a profound insight into the earliest moments of the universe,\" said Dr. Raymond L. Orbach, Director of the DOE Office of Science.\nAlso of great interest to many following progress at RHIC is the emerging connection between the collider's results and calculations using the methods of string theory, an approach that attempts to explain fundamental properties of the universe using 10 dimensions instead of the usual three spatial dimensions plus time.\nDr. Raymond L. Orbach\n\"The possibility of a connection between string theory and RHIC collisions is unexpected and exhilarating,\" Dr. Orbach said. \"String theory seeks to unify the two great intellectual achievements of twentieth-century physics, general relativity and quantum mechanics, and it may well have a profound impact on the physics of the twenty-first century.\"\nThe papers, which the four RHIC collaborations (BRAHMS, PHENIX, PHOBOS, and STAR) have been working on for nearly a year, will be published simultaneously by the journal Nuclear Physics A, and will also be compiled in a special Brookhaven report, the Lab announced at the April 2005 meeting of the American Physical Society in Tampa, Florida.\nThese summaries indicate that some of the observations at RHIC fit with the theoretical predictions for a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the type of matter postulated to have existed just microseconds after the Big Bang. Indeed, many theorists have concluded that RHIC has already demonstrated the creation of quark-gluon plasma. However, all four collaborations note that there are discrepancies between the experimental data and early theoretical predictions based on simple models of quark-gluon plasma formation.\n\"We know that we've reached the temperature [up to 150,000 times hotter than the center of the sun] and energy density [energy per unit volume] predicted to be necessary for forming such a plasma,\" said Sam Aronson, Brookhaven's Associate Laboratory Director for High Energy and Nuclear Physics. But analysis of RHIC data from the start of operations in June 2000 through the 2003 physics run reveals that the matter formed in RHIC's head-on collisions of gold ions is more like a liquid than a gas.\nThat evidence comes from measurements of unexpected patterns in the trajectories taken by the thousands of particles produced in individual collisions. These measurements indicate that the primordial particles produced in the collisions tend to move collectively in response to variations of pressure across the volume formed by the colliding nuclei. Scientists refer to this phenomenon as \"flow,\" since it is analogous to the properties of fluid motion.\nHowever, unlike ordinary liquids, in which individual molecules move about randomly, the hot matter formed at RHIC seems to move in a pattern that exhibits a high degree of coordination among the particles — somewhat like a school of fish that responds as one entity while moving through a changing environment.\n\"This is fluid motion that is nearly 'perfect,'\" Aronson said, meaning it can be explained by equations of hydrodynamics. These equations were developed to describe theoretically \"perfect\" fluids — those with extremely low viscosity and the ability to reach thermal equilibrium very rapidly due to the high degree of interaction among the particles. While RHIC scientists don't have a direct measure of viscosity, they can infer from the flow pattern that, qualitatively, the viscosity is very low, approaching the quantum mechanical limit.\nTogether, these facts present a compelling case: \"In fact, the degree of collective interaction, rapid thermalization, and extremely low viscosity of the matter being formed at RHIC make this the most nearly perfect liquid ever observed,\" Aronson said.\nThese images contrast the degree of interaction and collective motion, or \"flow,\" among quarks in the predicted gaseous quark-gluon plasma state (Figure A, see mpeg animation) vs. the liquid state that has been observed in gold-gold collisions at RHIC (Figure B, see mpeg animation). The green \"force lines\" and collective motion (visible on the animated version only) show the much higher degree of interaction and flow among the quarks in what is now being described as a nearly \"perfect\" liquid. (Click images for larger version.) An updated video comparing the expected gas with the observed \"perfect\" liquid is available.\nIn results reported earlier, other measurements at RHIC have shown \"jets\" of high-energy quarks and gluons being dramatically slowed down as they traverse the hot fireball produced in the collisions. This \"jet quenching\" demonstrates that the energy density in this new form of matter is extraordinarily high — much higher than can be explained by a medium consisting of ordinary nuclear matter.\n\"The current findings don't rule out the possibility that this new state of matter is in fact a form of the quark-gluon plasma, just different from what had been theorized,\" Aronson said. Many scientists believe this to be the case, and detailed measurements are now under way at RHIC to resolve this question.\nSee an updated version of the \"perfect\" liquid animation.\nTheoretical physicists, whose standard calculations cannot incorporate the strong coupling observed between the quarks and gluons at RHIC, are also revisiting some of their early models and predictions. To try to address these issues, they are running massive numerical simulations on some of the world's most powerful computers. Others are attempting to incorporate quantitative measures of viscosity into the equations of motion for fluid moving at nearly the speed of light. One subset of calculations uses the methods of string theory to predict the viscosity of the liquid being created at RHIC and to explain some of the other surprising findings. Such studies will provide a more quantitative understanding of how \"nearly perfect\" the liquid is.\nThe unexpected findings also introduce a wide range of opportunity for new scientific discovery regarding the properties of matter at extremes of temperature and density previously inaccessible in a laboratory.\n\"The finding of a nearly perfect liquid in a laboratory experiment recreating the conditions believed to have existed a few microseconds after the birth of the universe is truly astonishing,\" said Praveen Chaudhari, Director of Brookhaven Lab. \"The four RHIC collaborations are now collecting and analyzing very large new data sets from the fourth and fifth years of operation, and I expect more exciting and intriguing revelations in the near future.\"\nRHIC is funded primarily by the Office of Nuclear Physics within the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science.

(AFP)\n\"I never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge,\" he said in a statement issued by the University of Edinburgh, where he was a professor.\nFinding the Higgs would validate the Standard Model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces.\nIt is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not.\nMooted by Higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the Big Bang some 13.7 billion years ago.\nWhen some particles encounter the Higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. Others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle.\nCERN uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting Higgs.\nThe task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass.\nOver the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the Higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist.\nTwo CERN laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 Gigaelectronvolts (GeV), according to data they presented on Wednesday.\nBoth said that the results were \"five sigma,\" meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk.\n\"The results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 GeV we're seeing is dramatic,\" said Joe Incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments.\n\"This is indeed a new particle. We know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. The implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.\"\nScientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean.\n\"(The Higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation,\" said Anthony Thomas at the University of Adelaide in Australia.\nCERN physicist Yves Sirois agreed.\n\"This could the Higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the Universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang,\" he told AFP.\n\"It may be the Higgs boson, but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the Standard Model.\"\nWhat Is The Higgs Boson?\nThe Higgs is the last missing piece of the Standard Model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. The other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found and finding the Higgs would validate the model. Ruling it out or finding something more exotic would force a rethink on how the universe is put together.\nScientists believe that in the first billionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe was a gigantic soup of particles racing around at the speed of light without any mass to speak of. It was through their interaction with the Higgs field that they gained mass and eventually formed the universe.\nThe Higgs field is a theoretical and invisible energy field that pervades the whole cosmos. Some particles, like the photons that make up light, are not affected by it and therefore have no mass. Others are not so lucky and find it drags on them as porridge drags on a spoon.\nPicture George Clooney (the particle) walking down a street with a gaggle of photographers (the Higgs field) clustered around him. An average guy on the same street (a photon) gets no attention from the paparazzi and gets on with his day. The Higgs particle is the signature of the field - an eyelash of one of the photographers.\nThe particle is theoretical, first posited in 1964 by six physicists, including Briton Peter Higgs.\nThe search for it only began in earnest in the 1980s, first in Fermilab's now mothballed Tevatron particle collider near Chicago and later in a similar machine at CERN, but most intensively since 2010 with the start-up of the European centre's Large Hadron Collider.\nFormer CERN director general Christopher Llewelyn-Smith waves after the presentation of results during a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the Higgs boson at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Meyrin near Geneva. (AP Photo)\nWhat Is The Standard Model?\nThe Standard Model is to physics what the theory of evolution is to biology. It is the best explanation physicists have of how the building blocks of the universe are put together. It describes 12 fundamental particles, governed by four basic forces.\nBut the universe is a big place and the Standard Model only explains a small part of it. Scientists have spotted a gap between what we can see and what must be out there. That gap must be filled by something we don't fully understand, which they have dubbed 'dark matter'. Galaxies are also hurtling away from each other faster than the forces we know about suggest they should. This gap is filled by 'dark energy'. This poorly understood pair are believed to make up a whopping 96% of the mass and energy of the cosmos.\nConfirming the Standard Model, or perhaps modifying it, would be a step towards the holy grail of physics - a 'theory of everything' that encompasses dark matter, dark energy and the force of gravity, which the Standard Model also does not explain. It could also shed light on even more esoteric ideas, such as the possibility of parallel universes.\nCERN spokesman James Gillies has said that just as Albert Einstein's theories enveloped and built on the work of Isaac Newton, the work being done by the thousands of physicists at CERN has the potential to do the same to Einstein's work.\nIn this file picture, the magnet core of the world's largest superconducting solenoid magnet (CMS, Compact Muon Solenoid), one of the experiments preparing to take data at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator is seen, near Genva, Switzerland.(AP Photo)\nWhat Is The Large Hadron Collider?\nThe Large Hadron Collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator, a 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe that sits in a tunnel 100 metres underground on the Swiss/French border. It cost 3 billion euros to build.\nTwo beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around it before smashing into each other to create many millions of particle collisions every second in a recreation of the conditions a fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when the Higgs field is believed to have 'switched on'.\nThe vast amount of data produced is examined by banks of computers. Of all the trillions of collisions, very few are just right for revealing the Higgs particle. That makes the hunt for the Higgs slow, and progress incremental.\nWhat Is The Threshold For Proof?\nTo claim a discovery, scientists have set themselves a target for certainty that they call \"5 sigma\". This means that there is a probability of less than one in a million that their conclusions from the data harvested from the particle accelerator are the result of a statistical fluke.\nThe two teams hunting for the Higgs at CERN, called Atlas and CMS, now have twice the amount of data that allowed them to claim 'tantalising glimpses' of the Higgs at the end of last year and this could push their results beyond that threshold.\nWhy Is It Important?\nThe origin of mass -- meaning the resistance of an object to being moved -- has been fiercely debated for decades.\nFinding the Higgs boson would vindicate the so-called Standard Model of physics, a theory that developed in the early 1970s, which says the Universe is made from 12 particles which provide the building blocks for all matter.\nThese fundamental particles are divided into a bestiary comprising six leptons and six quarks, which have exotic names such as \"strange,\" \"up\", \"tau\" and \"charm.\"\nWhy Is It Called The Higgs Boson?\nThe name comes from a British physicist, Peter Higgs, today aged 83, who conceived of a field of mass-conferring particles in 1964 and became the first to publish his idea.\nImportant theoretical work was also done separately by Belgian physicists Robert Brout, who died in 2011, and Francois Englert, 79.\nBosons are non-matter particles which are force carriers, or messengers that act between matter particles.\nThe interaction gives rise to three fundamental forces -- the strong force, the weak force and the electromagnatic force. There is a fourth force, gravity, which is suspected to be caused by a still-to-be found boson named the graviton.\nIn this file photo, a view of the LHC (large hadron collider) in its tunnel at CERN (European particle physics laboratory) is photographed, near Geneva, Switzerland. (AP Photo)\nHow Has The Higgs Been Hunted?\nThe quest for the Higgs has been carried out at colliders: giant machines that smash particles together and sift through the sub-atomic debris that tumbles out.\nThe big daddy of these is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), operated by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) in a ring-shaped tunnel deep underground near Geneva.\nSmashups generated at the LHC briefly generate temperatures 100,000 times hotter than the Sun, replicating the conditions that occurred just after the Universe's creation in the \"Big Bang\" nearly 14 billion years ago.\nBut these concentrations of energy, while violent, occur only at a tiny scale.\nOn Wednesday, CERN scientists said they had found a new particle that was \"consistent\" with the Higgs, but further work was needed to determine what it was.\nWhy \"The God Particle\"?\nThe Higgs has become known as the \"God particle,\" the quip being that, like God, it is extremely powerful, exists everywhere but is hard to find.\nIn fact, the origin of the name is rather less poetic.\nIt comes from the title of a book by Nobel physicist Leon Lederman whose draft title was \"The Goddamn Particle,\" to describe the frustrations of trying to nail the Higgs.\nThe title was cut back to \"The God Particle\" by his publisher, apparently fearful that \"Goddamn\" could be offensive.\n(With inputs from AFP and Reuters)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bca1ac30-3ea9-4923-a10f-fc42cfc09dd2>","<urn:uuid:1fc3268e-a819-4df2-a57c-f7d657563591>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the key difference between how food irradiation and microwave ovens use radiation to treat food?","answer":"Food irradiation and microwave ovens use fundamentally different types of radiation. Food irradiation uses ionizing radiation (like X-rays, gamma rays, or high-energy electrons) in a cold process that doesn't significantly raise food temperature. In contrast, microwave ovens use non-ionizing radiation that generates heat by increasing the molecular motion of water molecules in moist foods, thus cooking them.","context":["Food irradiation is the treatment of foods by exposing them to ionizing radiation. For example, irradiation can kill harmful bacteria and other organisms in meat, poultry, and seafood, disinfest spices, extend shelf-life of fresh fruits and vegetables, and control sprouting of tubers and bulbs such as potatoes and onions. It is a safe process that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and over 50 other national food control authorities for many types of foods. Irradiation may be referred to as a “cold pasteurization” process, as it does not significantly raise the temperature of the treated foods. As with other microbial inactivation processes, such as heat pasteurization, irradiation cannot reverse the spoilage of food. Thus, safe food handling and good manufacturing practices are required for irradiated food just as for other foods.\nOne reason is that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that some 5,000 deaths and 76 million illnesses a year in the U.S. occur due to foodborne illnesses-that toll could be substantially reduced by irradiation. Foods may be contaminated naturally during any stage of production or consumption (from farm to fork). The contamination may be in the form of microbes-including those that cause food spoilage or diseases in humans-as well as insect infestations that cause food spoilage and destruction. Some foods are seasonal and highly perishable, while others are not allowed to enter the United States because they may harbor pests and diseases that cause damage to local agriculture or illness in humans.\nIrradiation, being a cold process, can be used to inactivate spoilage and disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria in solid foods such as meat, poultry, seafood, and spices. It can also kill insect eggs and larvae in fresh fruits and vegetables without changing the foods’ quality or sensory attributes. Its ability to inactivate pathogenic bacteria in frozen food is unique. Since irradiation is a cold pasteurization process, foods remain in the same state after irradiation as before, i.e. frozen foods stay frozen, raw foods remain raw, and volatile aromatic substances are retained.\nThe increasing awareness of foodborne disease outbreaks, as well as major food recalls to meet strict sanitary standards in the United States, has resulted in an increasing recognition and a wider use of irradiation as a sanitary treatment to destroy pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef. Its role as an insect control method to meet strict quarantine requirements in the U.S., especially for tropical fruits from Hawaii, is also growing. Irradiation has routinely been used to meet microbiological standards for spices and dried vegetable seasonings in the U.S. and many other countries in the past two decades.\nThe radiation energy used to treat foods is called “ionizing radiation” because it produces ions–electrically charged particles. Ionizing radiation-including X-rays, gamma rays and beams of high-energy electrons produced by electron accelerators-has a higher energy than non-ionizing radiation such as visible light, television and radio-waves and microwaves.\nTwo types of radiation sources are commonly used for food treatment. The first is a tightly sealed metal container of radioactive elements-cobalt 60 or cesium 137-that produce gamma rays. The rays are directed onto the food being irradiated, but the food itself never comes into contact with the cobalt or cesium source.\nThe second type of radiation source is a machine that produces either X-rays or high-energy electrons. Because of the physical characteristics of these sources, no radioactivity can be induced in food thus treated, no matter how much energy (dose) is absorbed by the food or how long the food is irradiated.\nIrradiation has a number of uses in food processing, most of which improve the safety and quality or prolong the useful life of foods. Different doses of radiation are used for different purposes. Food-borne illnesses take a heavy toll on the economy and productivity of populations in most countries. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that food-borne diseases cause approximately 76 million illnesses; 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths each year or approx. 100 deaths per week. Such microorganisms as E.-coli O157:H7, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, Vibrio and Toxoplasma are responsible for 1,500 deaths annually. The most important public health benefit of food irradiation is its ability to destroy pathogenic (disease causing) organisms in food. Consumers are familiar with heat pasteurization of liquid foods like milk and juices, which effectively eliminates spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, inactivates spoilage enzymes, and extends shelf-life without significantly altering taste and nutritional value. Irradiation can perform the same protective functions for solid foods by decreasing significantly the number of microorganisms in foods without causing significant changes in their flavor and aroma. It is the only process that can do so effectively in raw and frozen foods. It is important to note that irradiation cannot make up for mishandling or unsanitary food processing practices. Irradiated foods must be properly packaged to prevent re-contamination, kept at proper temperatures, and handled with care during food preparation to avoid cross contamination from other (unirradiated) foods or unsanitary utensils. Improved food handling alone could reduce but not prevent contamination by pathogenic bacteria. Irradiation gives us an additional, complementary tool to ensure food safety.\nDifferent types and species of microorganisms have different sensitivities to irradiation. Spoilage and disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria of different species, the major causes of food spoilage and many common food-borne diseases, are generally sensitive to irradiation and can be inactivated by low and medium doses of radiation between 1 and 7 kGy. Bacterial spores are more resistant and require higher doses (above 10 kGy) for inactivation. As with any sub-sterilization process, special care must be taken when irradiating food using low and medium doses to kill off spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, to avoid growth and toxin production by spores of Clostridium botulinum bacteria (which causes botulism poisoning) that may be in some foods, and which can survive the treatment. Yeasts and molds, which can spoil some food, are slightly more resistant to irradiation than are bacteria and require a dose of at least 3 kGy to inactivate them. Since viruses are highly resistant to radiation and require a dose of between 20 to 50 kGy to inactivate them, irradiation would not be a suitable means of dealing with viral contamination of foods.\nThere is a misconception that food irradiation produces harmful mutant strains of pathogenic microorganisms that might flourish in the absence of the bacteria killed by irradiation. Results of research carried out to examine this potential risk have been reassuring. Irradiation of food at doses required to inactivate spoilage and disease-causing bacteria results in major damage to their chromosomes(and DNA)-damage that is beyond repair. Thus, any surviving pathogenic bacteria in irradiated food are significantly injured and they are unable to reproduce. The food, on the other hand, that might be contaminated is not alive and thus is not damaged by irradiation.\nNo. Irradiation involves the treatment of food with ionizing radiation to achieve desired effects, e.g., killing pathogens, extending shelf-life, controlling sprouting, replacing chemical fumigation, etc., without significantly increasing the temperature of food. Thus it is a non-thermal process. In contrast, microwave ovens expose foods to a non-ionizing radiation that generates heat by increasing the molecular motion of the water molecules in moist foods, thus cooking them.\nNo. Irradiation does not make food radioactive. The types of radiation sources approved for the treatment of foods have specific energy levels well below that which would cause any element in food to become radioactive. Food undergoing irradiation does not become any more radioactive than luggage passing through an airport X-ray scanner or teeth that have been X-rayed. It should be noted that everything in our environment, including food, contains natural trace amounts of radioactivity (background level). Irradiation of food at any dose will not result in an increased radioactivity beyond that of the background environment.\nNo. The process simply involves exposing food to a source of radiation. It does not create any new radioactive material. When the strength (activity) of radioactive sources such as cobalt or cesium falls below economical usage levels, the sources are returned in a licensed shipping container to the suppliers, who have the option of either reactivating them or storing them in a regulated place. Basically, the same procedures are followed when an irradiation plant closes down. The radiation sources can be acquired by another user or returned to the supplier, the machinery dismantled, and the building used for other purposes. When a machine source such as electron beam or X-ray generators, which use electricity as their power sources, is used for irradiating food, neither radioactivity nor radioactive materials is involved.\nYes. The safety of food irradiation has been thoroughly studied and comprehensively evaluated for over 50 years, both in the United States and elsewhere. No food technology has ever been as extensively studied and evaluated with respect to safety as has food irradiation. The studies involved many animal feeding tests including multigeneration tests in animals, e.g., rats, mice, dogs and monkeys, to determine if any changes in growth, blood chemistry, histopathology or reproduction occurred that might be attributable to consumption of different types of irradiated foods as part of their daily diets. Data from these studies were systematically evaluated by panels of experts that included toxicologists, nutritionists, microbiologists, radiation chemists and radiobiologists, convened repeatedly by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and World Health Organization (WHO) in 1964, 1969, 1976, 1980 and 1997, as data became available. In 1980, the Joint FAO/IAEA/WHO Expert Committee on the Wholesomeness of Irradiated Food (JECFI) concluded that ?Irradiation of any food commodity up to an overall average dose of 10 kGy introduces no toxicological hazard; hence, toxicological testing of food so treated is no longer required.? The JECFI also stated that irradiation of food up to a dose of 10 kGy introduces no special microbiological or nutritional problems.\nInvestigations since 1981 have continued to support the JECFI?s conclusions about the safety of food irradiation. These investigations included a small human feeding trial in China in which 21 male and 22 female volunteers consumed 62 to 71% of their total caloric intake as irradiated foods for 15 weeks. Since 1980, there has been no credible scientific evidence, either from human feeding studies or from consumption of several types of irradiated foods available in commercial quantities in several countries that indicate such foods pose a toxic hazard. In 1997, FAO, IAEA and WHO convened a Joint Study Group to evaluate data on wholesomeness studies of food irradiated with doses above 10 kGy. Based on scientific evidence supporting the safety of food irradiated with any dose, above or below 10 kGy, the Joint Study Group concluded that food irradiated with any dose to achieve technical objectives is safe and nutritionally adequate. No upper dose limit therefore needs to be imposed as long as food is irradiated based on prevailing good manufacturing practices. The safety of irradiated foods is also supported by data on extensive experience with laboratory animal diets that had been sterilized by irradiation. Over the past few decades, millions of laboratory animals including rats, mice and other species have been bred and reared exclusively on radiation-sterilized diets. Several generations of these animals were fed diets irradiated with doses ranging from 25 to 50 kGy. The studies took place in laboratories in several countries-Austria, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. No transmittable genetic defects-teratogenic or oncogenic-have been observed that could be attributed to the consumption of irradiated diets.\nNo. Irradiation facilities are safe for local communities. A food irradiation plant wouldnot endanger a community. It would be no different from the approximately 40 medical-products irradiation sterilization plants and the more than 1,000 hospital radiation-therapy units using cobalt-60 as radiation sources, as well as the hundreds of industrial electron irradiation facilities used for different purposes, now operating in the United States. None of these facilities has been found to pose a danger to the surrounding community. To be sure, a food irradiation facility must be designed, constructed and operated properly, as well as duly licensed by national or state authorities. This does not represent a new challenge, since the necessary safety precautions are well understood. They have long been applied in the design, construction and maintenance of similar types of irradiation facilities used for other purposes over the past 50 years.\nNo. It is impossible for a “meltdown” to occur in a food irradiation plant or for a radiation source to explode. The radioisotopic sources approved for food irradiation, i.e., cobalt-60 and cesium-137, cannot produce the neutrons that can make materials radioactive, so no ?nuclear chain reaction? can occur at such an irradiation facility. Food irradiation plants contain shielded chambers within which the foods are exposed to a source of ionizing radiation. The radiation sources used in food irradiation cannot overheat, explode, leak or release radioactivity into the environment.\nWould workers in a food irradiation plant be exposed to hazardous radiation? No. Irradiation facilities, including those used for food irradiation, are designed with several levels of safety redundancy to detect equipment malfunction and to protect personnel from accidental radiation exposure. All irradiation facilities must be licensed by national or state authorities to ensure their safety for the workers as well as for the environment. Regulations in all countries require such facilities to be inspected periodically to ensure compliance with the terms of the operating licenses. As a result of long experience in designing and operating similar types of irradiation facilities, the necessary precautions for worker safety in a food irradiation plant are well understood. In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for regulating worker protection from all sources of ionizing radiation. Food irradiation plants that use cobalt or cesium as their radiation source must be licensed by the NRC or an appropriate state agency. The NRC is responsible for the safety of workers in facilities it has licensed. Plants in the United States that use machine-generated radiation are under the jurisdiction of state agencies, which have established appropriate performance standards to ensure worker safety.\nNo. Spent fuel from nuclear reactors (radioactive waste) is not used in any food or industrial irradiation facilities. Of the four possible radiation sources for use in food irradiation, only one?cesium?is a byproduct of nuclear fission. It is of limited commercial availability and is not used in any industrial irradiation facility. Cobalt-60, the most commonly used radioactive source for industrial radiation processing-including food irradiation-has to be manufactured specifically for this purpose; hence it is not a “nuclear waste” product. Cobalt-60 is produced by activating cobalt-59, a non-radioactive metal, in a nuclear reactor to absorb neutrons and change its characteristics to cobalt-60, which is radioactive and generates gamma rays. Canada is the largest producer of cobalt-60, representing about 75% of world production. The remaining producers are in France, Argentina, Russia, China and India. Cobalt-60 suppliers can in principle reactivate used cobalt-60 sources, if required, thus effectively recycling them. Food irradiation does not use radioactive wastes. Electrically generated electron beam and X-ray machines have been designed and used for irradiating food in the United States, especially for ensuring microbiological safety of ground beef and meeting the quarantine requirements for tropical fruits. When such machines, which use electricity as power sources, are used for irradiating food, there is neither radioactivity nor radioactive materials involved.\nThe effectiveness of a specific application of irradiation on food must be verified by the FDA and USDA. When these agencies approve specific applications of food irradiation, they require that food be irradiated in facilities licensed for this purpose. These facilities also must use correct radiation doses as required by law, according to good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and as part of an overall HACCP plan. These guidelines emphasize that, as with all food technologies, effective quality control systems need to be established and closely monitored at critical control points at the irradiation facility. In all cases, only food of high quality should be accepted for irradiation. As with other technologies, irradiation cannot be used as a substitute for poor hygienic practices or to reverse spoilage.\nRayfresh Foods has developed an economical way to irradiate food products within the scheme of a continuous process. This in-line system helps in the quest for food safety. Our by-products are safe, healthy foods, and extended shelf life with no discernable change in taste and texture. By passing light through a product using x-rays, we can only add to a processors already clean and safe practices. Although no one thing can eliminate all the risks associated with food processing, Rayfresh Foods Rainbow Process will move us closer to safe tables.","The term radiation refers to the energy that travels through space or matter in the form of energetic waves or particles. When radiation occurs, the waves move out in all directions from the producer of the energy. Dive into radiation examples and the types of radiation.\nExamples of Radiation in Daily Life\nExamples of Everyday Radiation\nWhile you might only think of radiation when you are getting an x-ray at the hospital, radiation is all around you. Radiation can be ionizing, which means it has the capacity to modify the ions of an atom, or non-ionizing, which means it does not possess that ability. See examples of both types of radiation to better understand this topic.\nNon-ionizing radiation has enough energy to heat substances but not enough to ionize molecules.

Explore the types of ionizing radiation, its effects and how to measure it.\nTypes of Ionizing Radiation\nThere are four types of ionizing radiation classified by scientists based on how hard it is to stop the waves or particles.\n- Alpha radiation is the easiest to stop, as it can be stopped by paper.\n- Beta radiation is a bit more difficult to stop and requires metal to stop it, though the metal can be thin.\n- Gamma radiation is most powerful and dangerous and can only be stopped by many feet of earth, water of great depth or metal of intense thickness.\n- X-rays are similar to gamma radiation and commonly used in medicine. X-rays have less penetrating power.\nRadiation's Effect on Humans\nEffects of ionizing radiation on humans include cancer, sickness of varying types, death, and mutation. These are a result of the change in DNA that ionizing radiation can cause. Those exposed to lower radiation levels (such as non-ionizing) are unlikely to develop any adverse effects.\nIonizing radiation is created by a reaction of a nuclear form that is either natural or artificial. It is often hard to measure since it is invisible and can usually only be measured at very high concentrations. A Geiger counter is an example of a tool for measuring ionizing radiation.\nRadiation Examples in Our World\nRadiation is an everyday phenomenon that is all around you.

{"question":"Could you elaborate on how the historical evolution of environmental management frameworks has shifted from waste-focused to resource-focused approaches, particularly comparing the 1979 waste hierarchy concept with modern ISO 14001:2015 standards?","answer":"The evolution from waste-focused to resource-focused approaches represents a significant shift in environmental management frameworks. The waste hierarchy, introduced in 1979, emerged as a relatively simple tool focused primarily on waste management options and moving away from landfilling. However, as environmental management has evolved toward resource management and circular economy principles, this narrow focus has shown limitations, particularly in addressing resource efficiency and total material flow through the economy. In contrast, ISO 14001:2015 represents the modern approach, offering a comprehensive framework that extends beyond waste management to encompass the entire resource lifecycle. It includes broader considerations such as environmental performance enhancement, sustainability policies, product lifecycle management, and strategic business integration, with specific objectives for sustainable development and environmental protection. This evolution reflects a transformation from managing end-of-life waste to a more holistic approach of resource management and environmental stewardship.","context":["Rethinking the waste hierarchy\n24th October 2017\nThe term “rethink” is a particular favourite within our sector. Examples of reports and projects abound: rethinking waste, rethinking waste management, rethinking waste crime, rethinking organic waste, rethinking recyclability. What about rethinking the waste hierarchy? Many suggestions have been put forward, expanding the so-called 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) to 5Rs, 6Rs (Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Replace) and even 10Rs in an attempt to widen the reach of the hierarchy beyond the waste phase. Is it perhaps time to revisit this 1970s-vintage principle and ask whether it needs to be updated and/or supplemented with other priority frameworks?\nThe waste hierarchy originated as Lansink’s Ladder when Ad Lansink presented an order of preference for waste management options to the Dutch parliament in 1979. Since then the waste hierarchy has served as the cornerstone of waste management policy, principally as a guide to move waste management away from landfilling into more environmentally desirable options.\nHowever, with the evolution from waste management to resource management and the advent of the circular economy as its leading guiding principle, how does the waste hierarchy stand up in this new context? For example, it has been suggested that ‘prevention’, the first step in the hierarchy, is misplaced here. As experience in the UK has indicated, a product is de facto defined as a waste once it has been discarded, which is at odds with the concept of preventing a product from becoming waste in the first place. Furthermore, Van Ewijk and Stegemann have pointed out in Limitations of the waste hierarchy for achieving absolute reductions in material throughput (2016) that in addressing just the discard element of a product, the waste hierarchy does nothing to encourage practices further up the resource chain, for example to improve resource efficiency and resource productivity, and to minimise total material flow through the economy.\nAnother crucial aspect of the circular economy, that of encouraging sustainable consumption behaviours, is also untouched by the waste hierarchy, though the European Commission’s good practice guide Public Procurement for a Circular Economy – good practice and guidance (2017) adapts it as the basis for green procurement – reduce, reuse, recycle, recover. Interestingly, the implicit assumption here is that a product is ‘prevented’ from becoming waste, again suggesting that prevention is a strategy that should be separate from the ‘waste’ hierarchy.\nThe bottom line seems to be that the plus points of the waste hierarchy are its simplicity, clarity and enduring emotional and intuitive appeal, which suggests that tinkering with it, for example by expanding some steps or introducing new steps to force-fit other concepts would make it unwieldy and water down its powerful message. Better perhaps to accept that it holds good for a particular segment/side stream of the circular economy, and to introduce other priority frameworks to support it. Horses for courses.\nOne option would be to separate the resource chain into three or four discrete elements, and apply appropriate concepts to each. For example, production and manufacture would be characterised by a preference for secondary over virgin raw materials and renewable over brown energy, backed up by resource efficiency and resource productivity targets. The aim here would be to encourage “absolute material reductions through the concept of absolute decoupling” in the words of Van Ewijk and Stegemann.\nThe product phase would be supported by a hierarchy emphasising the primacy of designing for durability, modularity, repair and reuse, then for recyclability, and finally to promote safe disposal by avoiding the use of hazardous materials – linking with the previous stage to ensure that secondary raw materials and renewable energy are used in preference to virgin/fossil commodities.\nThe consumption phase would be characterised by a so-called “consumption hierarchy”, which could look something like this:\nThe discard phase would still be represented by the standard five-step waste hierarchy, except that prevention activities may be better addressed in a hierarchy further up the resource chain.\nThe waste hierarchy has had a huge influence in changing waste management practices for the better. The present approach attempts to replicate this success in other key elements of the resource chain, but each according to its own characteristics. In particular, disentangling prevention from the discard phase may give it the focus and attention it sorely lacks at the present time, sitting as it does within the waste hierarchy.Tweet\n- circular economy\n- no more waste\n- resource management\n- Waste Crime\n- waste hierarchy\n- waste management\n- waste management policy\n- zero waste to landfill","ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System Certification\nThe current version of ISO 14001 was reviewed and published in 2015. Currently, more than 420,000 organizations around the world are ISO 14001-certified. This number is growing rapidly.\nISO 14001 is an international standard offered by the International Organisation for Standards (ISO). Through the ISO 14001 management system, companies can monitor the impact their products and services have on the environment.\nIt’s primarily for organizations that use natural resources. As a result of their processes that convert natural resources into useful products, the organizations tend to release a lot of wastes that negatively affect the environment. These negative effects need to be recognized and reduced, throughout their lifecycle. Recently, ISO 14001 was updated in 2015, which is why the latest certification in the ISO 14001 family that is available is called ISO 14001:2015.\nISO 14001:2015 - An Introduction\nISO 14001:2015 defines the conditions imposed by a standard Environmental Management System. It includes the guidelines for a company looking to enhance their environmental performance and sustainability policies. Its use is directed towards associations who are looking to manage their liabilities with a planned approach towards sustainability. ISO offers a 35-page implementation guide, curated and overseen by Technical Committee ISO/TC 207/SC 1.\nApplicability of ISO 14001:2015\nAccording to ISO, the Environmental Management System Certification can be applied to any organization. This helps organizations of different sizes, belonging to different industries, get the same advantages of ISO 14001:2015’s application. ISO 14001:2015 eliminates the ‘one size fits all’ approach.\nOne must remember that ISO 14001:2015 is not a scale with which environmental management parameters must be matched to. It’s more like an internationally-authorized guidebook that states how certain operations must be conducted with respect to environmental conservation. The basic fundamentals of ISO 14001:2015 are based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) iterative management method.\nObjectives of ISO 14001:2015\nThe objective of ISO 14001:2015 is to deliver a framework for the applying organization aimed towards the protection of the environment.

For prevention, both species can benefit from regular teeth brushing using specially formulated toothpaste in flavors like chicken or cheese, along with soft toothbrushes or finger brushes. Professional dental cleanings under general anesthesia are also available for both species, involving ultrasonic scaling, polishing, and fluoride treatment. However, while daily brushing is ideal, there are additional prevention options for dogs that aren't mentioned for cats, such as dental chews, various mouthwashes and gels, and high-quality pet food designed to prevent plaque and tartar formation.","context":["Maryborough Veterinary Practice\noffers a comprehensive list of services and facilities.\n- Annual Health Check and Vaccinations\n- Radiology (X-rays)\n- Intestinal Worms\n- Puppy School\nConsultations at the Practice:\nWhen your pet is unwell or requires a routine vaccination or health check, contact the practice and we’ll book you in to see the vet. Most days we have 3 or 4 vets on duty and can usually see you without delay. We explore your animal’s history and give them a thorough physical examination to determine if further medication, treatment or surgery will be required. If needed we can also do further testing (such as a blood test or microscope work) on the spot, rather than having to plan an extra visit.\nFarm services & home visits for large animals:\nOur vets head out daily to visit farms and homes to attend horses, cattle, sheep, alpacas, goats and pigs. This may be for routine herd health or an unwell individual animal.\nANNUAL HEALTH CHECK AND VACCINATION\nJust as people should with their doctors, each pet should have a\ncheck-up from a vet once a year. We check all the vital signs and\noften pick up on problems early such as a lump or a niggling pain that\nanimals can’t tell us about. We vaccinate pets routinely against some\ncommon and potentially fatal diseases. The usual vaccines are known as C3 or C5 in dogs and F3 in cats.\nWe have full X-ray facilities at the practice, including mobile equipment for large animals, giving the vets an enhanced ability to detect problems and abnormalities. X-rays allow us to take a closer look inside your pet, and can be used to investigate anything from bones to lungs.\nSometimes, depending on what is wrong with your pet, an ultrasound\nwill give us a much better idea of what is occurring inside. We have state of the art ultra-sound equipment at the practice, including mobile ultra-sound for large animals, which allows the vets to have a non-invasive look inside.\nWe offer a variety of in-house tests. We can perform urinalysis to\nexamine your pets’ urine for any abnormalities. We offer blood tests\nfor diseases such as Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) for cats,\nParvovirus for dogs and heartworm. We can also see if your pet is\nanaemic, or has glucose imbalances (i.e. Diabetes). We are able to\nlook under the microscope to examine slides from ears, skin, lumps,\netc. For more complex testing we get results from ASAP laboratories back\nwithin 24 hours.\nWe perform a wide range of surgery at the clinic.

The American Veterinary Dental Society reports that 80% of dogs and 70% of cats show signs of oral disease by age 3, so it's never too early to take steps to prevent such disease. Periodontal disease is caused by the progressive inflammation of the structures of the tooth, through the accumulation of plaque and leading to the formation calculus (tartar). The build up of tartar can harbor bacteria that invades below the gumline, causing gingivitis (inflammation of the gums), and can eventually affect the integrity of the tooth. When a tooth becomes loose due to the destruction of soft tissue and erosion of the bony socket, not only is it likely to be painful, it can also allow the accumulated bacteria to enter the bloodstream, affecting all other body systems, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys. For this reason, it is extremely important for your pets to get regular oral exams and not delay any dental work that your veterinarian recommends. Some pets are more prone to dental disease than others, especially small dogs and those breeds with brachiocephalic heads (i.e. pugs, bulldogs, etc.).\nBrushing at Home\nThe very best way to take steps to avoid oral disease is to brush your pet's teeth at least three times a week. There are toothbrushes made especially for pets, although an extra soft child's toothbrush will work fine, and specially formulated toothpaste that is non-foaming and safe for pets to swallow. It may take some time for your pets to get used to teeth brushing, and it can be helpful to begin by rubbing their teeth with your finger or some gauze several times a week until they get used to the routine (be sure to reward them when they sit well for it), and eventually work your way up to brushing all their teeth with the toothbrush and paste.\nNeedless to say, we don't all have the time or patience necessary to brush our pets' teeth everyday, and some pets still accumulate tartar, even with consistent brushing. It is for these reasons that many pets require professional dental cleanings under general anesthesia. Pre-anesthetic blood work is recommended before any procedure requiring general anesthesia. Routine dental cleanings at Whitefish Animal Hospital include the use of ultrasonic scalers and hand tools to remove built up tartar, the polishing of each tooth to fill in grooves where plaque forms easily, and a fluoride gel treatment to protect the teeth. Our veterinarians also complete an extensive oral examination, locating any broken or diseased teeth that need to be extracted. It is important to remove such teeth right away to prevent further infection and/or pain. Finally, we have just installed a new digital dental x-ray machine, which will be used routinely during dental cleanings to more extensively screen for periodontal disease.\nPlease call 406-862-3178 anytime to make an appointment for a free dental evaluation and/or to have a technician work up an estimate for your pet's next dental cleaning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8cf01488-36e5-4fb4-9593-b16e477a12a8>","<urn:uuid:1fb5cf10-1a24-47fd-ba26-459684636ba2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are some specific tips for maintaining consistent transportation routines when a mother has breast cancer?","answer":"When arranging transportation during breast cancer treatment, try to maintain continuity in who helps transport the children. For example, instead of having a different person drive the children to school each day, it's better to have one person handle school transportation for an entire week.","context":["Information central for parenting with breast cancer.\nTaking Care of Your Family\nPreserving Continuity and Routine\nChildren thrive on routine. It makes them feel safe and secure. Lots of change, on the other hand, can make kids anxious and agitated. When you have breast cancer, maintaining a routine can be difficult at a time when your kids need it most. You can help keep your kids feeling safe and secure by minimizing change, reassuring them, sharing control, and limiting surprises.\nMinimize change. Disruption in family routines is inevitable when a mother has breast cancer. Treating this disease is much like taking on a second job, so moms need help carrying on with the family’s daily activities. Here are some tips for minimizing the changes to our children’s routines:\nTransportation - Try to keep some continuity in the people who help transport your children. For example, instead of having a different person drive your children to school every day, try to have one person drive the kids to school for a week.\nMeals - You can help keep mealtime familiar even when friends and family members offer to cook for you. Many moms are reluctant to give people direction about cooking for their family because they fear offending the cook or appearing ungrateful. Yet most volunteer cooks will be happy to have some direction. They want your family to enjoy the meal they prepare for you. Here are a few suggestions:\n- Be frank with volunteer cooks. Tell them what your children will (and won’t) eat. You can say, “I am so grateful that you’ve offered to cook for us. You should know up front that my kids are very picky eaters. I don’t want you to go to a lot of trouble to prepare something they won’t eat. Would you like some suggestions about what to make?”\n- Suggest food combinations that your children are used to eating. You can say, “Tacos would be terrific. My kids love them! They would be especially happy if you would include some corn. I always serve corn when we have tacos, and I know that familiar touch would make them especially happy.”\n- Offer the brand names of specific products. You might say, “If you’re making a special trip to the store, my kids really like Prego Traditional spaghetti sauce. That would be a great choice.”\n- Post information online. If you use the internet to communicate with your helpers, you can give them information about meal suggestions, brand names, food allergies and intolerances, and even some favorite recipes. See Online Communication in the Resources section of this website.\nOf course, don’t get carried away with making demands on people who are kind enough to cook for you. Only you can prepare familiar meals exactly the way your children like them. Your kids will get used to trying new or differently prepared foods. If you’re up to it, consider thanking the cook by phone, e-mail, or with a brief note in the mail.\nBedtime - Routines make bedtime easier for the whole family, and they help your child feel safe and secure. If your illness prevents you from carrying on with your normal routine, try changing either the routine or the person who does it (such as your partner, a grandparent, or a babysitter).\nIn other words, it’s easier for your children if Grandma does her best to follow your child’s regular bedtime routine. Alternatively, come up with a temporary routine that you’re capable of doing yourself, such as reading to your child in a chair instead of reading to him in bed.\nReassure them. Reassure your children that their needs will be met, that you still love them, and that most of the changes related to your illness will be temporary. While this may be obvious to adults, children need reassurance about these basic facts. They have rich imaginations that can attach mistaken meaning to changes in routine. Your children may need to hear reassurances like these:\n“I love you as much as ever, even if the way I show you my love changes for awhile.”\n“I will make sure that you have everything you need, I just may not be able to do it for you myself.”\n“Some things might change for awhile, like who drives you places or what you have for dinner, but this won’t last forever.”\n“I can’t put you to bed tonight, but it’s not because I don’t want to or don’t love you. My heart wants to, but my body just isn’t up to it right now.”\nBesides talking to your kids, you can reassure them with your actions. Put an unexpected note in their lunch boxes or send them periodic e-mail messages. You can even send younger kids a note in the mail. They will be thrilled to tear open a letter addressed to them, even if it comes from someone in their own house.\nShare control. Being in control helps people feel secure. You can share this feeling with your children by giving them some control over the changes in your household. You can share control by offering choices and by inviting open-ended discussions.\n- Offer choices. You can include younger children in decision-making by giving them limited choices. Only offer choices that are realistic and that you can accept.\nYou might say something like this: “I can’t take you to practice tomorrow because I have an appointment with my doctor. Would you rather have Mike’s mom or Ben’s mom drive you?”\nYour child might not want to make a decision, or he might insist that you drive. You can say, “I really want to drive you, too, but it’s just not going to be possible tomorrow. Would you like to decide or should I decide for you?”\n- Invite open-ended discussions. Older children can be included in open-ended conversations about some changes that will affect the family. Be sure to discuss the issue with your partner first, so you agree in advance on what outcomes will be acceptable to you both.\nThis is an example: “My doctor doesn’t want me to go on our hiking trip later this month. Dad and I talked about it, and we had a few ideas. We could postpone the trip until next year or you could go without me. We could also go somewhere closer to home instead. What do you think we should do?”\nLimit surprises. While it’s not always possible, informing kids about changes in advance makes the changes easier to accept. (Be cautious with telling younger kids about potentially scary changes, like upcoming surgery. By giving them too much notice, they have a lot of time to worry.)\nGiving your kids a calendar will help reduce their anxiety. A calendar keeps them informed and shows them that changes are temporary. Some kids will enjoy making a calendar with you, and some kids will want to cross off each day that passes. They’ll also have activities to look forward to, like sleepovers, playdates, and birthday parties.\nHere are some suggestions for making calendars for your family:\n- Tell your kids that events on the calendar will likely change, but that you’ll do your best to make sure they know about the changes in advance.\n- You can buy a paper calendar or a wipe-off calendar for the wall, desk, or bulletin board. You also can make one yourself. If you’d like to make a calendar, you can download one for free at www.calendarsthatwork.com or click on Calendar in the Tools section of this website.\n- These are some items to consider including in your calendar:\n- After-school activities\n- Birthday parties\n- School programs\n- Hot lunch days\n- Religious school\n- Field trips\n- If you choose to make a calendar, consider using clip art for young children. Calendars are helpful even for children who cannot read. Just seeing repeating patterns of pictures, like a soccer ball indicating soccer practice every week, is reassuring. You can find free clipart at the Microsoft website. You can also find clipart for some common children’s activities in the Tools section of this website.\n- If you make one calendar for the entire family, consider using different colors or symbols to indicate which family members participate in each activity.\n- Consider sharing the calendar with babysitters, family members, teachers, carpool drivers, and anyone else who is involved with the daily care of your children.\n- Minimize confusion by indicating when your calendar was last updated by writing “Updated on [date]” in one corner."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:70bbd29a-31b9-4877-9d6e-b54267185dc3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between the terms 'variety' and 'varietal' in wine terminology, and what are the key harvesting parameters for grape varieties?","answer":"Variety and varietal have distinct meanings in wine terminology. Variety is a noun referring to a specific type of grape (like Pinot Noir), while varietal is both a noun for wine made from a single grape variety and an adjective describing if a wine is varietally correct. In the US, a wine must contain at least 75% of the named grape variety (95% in Oregon) to be called a varietal. When harvesting any grape variety, key parameters must be monitored: Brix (optimal 22-25° for red grapes), titratable acidity (0.6-0.8%), and pH (3.2-3.6). These parameters help determine the optimal harvest time, with researchers suggesting a Brix:TA ratio of 30:1 to 35:1 for the most balanced wines.","context":["Do your grapes look ripe; they are full of color and have reached the size you expect from the varietal. But before harvesting, a number of factors must be considered to determine if they are truly ready for harvesting: Brix, titratable acidity (TA), pH, phenolic ripeness and flavor development.\nThe latter two factors are determined by taste, and may vary from one person’s palate to another’s, so let’s focus on the first three and the tests that can be performed to determine each. Start by picking grapes at random from the middle of clusters from different vines of the same variety to be your test subjects. Avoid vines or grapes that appear damaged or are at the end of a row.\nThe perfect red grape will have a reading around 22-25 °Brix, 0.6-0.8% acid and a pH of 3.2-3.6. However, few things in this world are perfect and grapes often are not one of them.\nLet’s start with Brix, which is the percent of sugar in the grape juice. Brix will determine the potential alcohol content grapes possess if fermented to dryness. Because a sugar solution like grape juice has a higher specific gravity than water, Brix can be measured with a hydrometer. The specific gravity of water is 1.000. The higher the Brix content in grape juice the higher the resulting specific gravity will be.\nIn his book, From Vines to Wines, Jeff Cox states that averaging the specific gravities of two separate 100-berry samples, each crushed, sieved and measured with a hydrometer, will result in an accuracy of plus or minus 1 °Brix, while five 100-berry samples will give an accuracy within ½ °Brix.\nBrix can also be measured with a refractometer, which measures the sugar content by how much light is refracted through the juice. The advantage of a refractometer is that it can be taken into the vineyard to determine Brix immediately by squeezing a drop of grape juice onto it; of course many grapes from across the vineyard must be tested to get a feel for the entire crop.\nTitratable acidity (TA) is the total amount of acid in the grape juice expressed as the tartaric acid content. Acids give crispness, tart and thirst-quenching qualities to wine and help with balance. Most of the acid in grapes is tartaric (and possibly high malic acid in some varietals grown in cool-climates). Tartaric acid has a strong, sour taste and has the biggest impact on taste. The optimum range of acids for reds is 0.60-0.80% and for whites is 0.65-0.85%.\nIf TA is too low your wine will have a flat, flabby taste, and also be more susceptible to bacteria, while grapes with too high a TA will have a sour taste. Most winemaking supply stores sell TA test kits, or, if you live within the vicinity of a wine laboratory, they will also give you these readings for a price.\nThe final factor to look for is pH, which is somewhat related to TA, however there is not always a correlation. While TA measures the acid concentration, pH measures the relative strength of those acids. The optimum pH for reds is 3.2-3.6 and 3.0-3.3 for whites. A low pH wine will taste tart, while high pH — often caused by overripe grapes or soil with too much potassium in it — will taste flat and lack freshness. High pH can also lead to bacterial growth and spoilage in your wine — not good! A pH meter is needed to get an accurate reading. Retailers sell pH test kits, however they are not intended to accurately give readings within a 0.1 margin, which is necessary for winemakers.\nIn addition to looking at ideal readings for each factor, UC-Davis researchers have determined a ratio of Brix:TA from 30:1 to 35:1 lead to the most balanced wines. But keep an eye on all three numbers, because sometimes waiting in one area causes diminishing returns in another area.","Wine Terms that are Misused and/or Misunderstood\nLake Superior State University recently announced the 38th Annual List of Words to be Banished from the\nQueen’s English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness. Words that made the list included\n“passionate,” “bucket list,” and “trending.” This caught my attention and led me to think of a few wine related\nwords that are often misused and or misunderstood.\nMinerality This term is so poorly defined that it is essentially worthless but wine critics including myself\n(reluctantly) continue to use it in their wine reviews. We know that the roots of the grapevine cannot absorb\nminerals or mineral flavors from the soil. What is perceived as minerality is thought by some to be due to\nreduced sulfur compounds that can simulate the smell of wet minerals and the taste of flint. Clark Smith\n(Wines & Vines November 2010) has defined minerality as follows: “An ‘energetic buzz’ in a wine’s finish similar\nto acidity, with which it is often confused, but further back in the mouth.”\nBouquet This term is often mistakenly used to describe the aromas of a young wine. It should only be used to\nrefer to the complex aromas of a mature wine.\nVariety or Varietal? The two words are often misused and interchanged with impunity. Each word, however,\nhas a clear meaning. Variety is a noun and refers to a specific type of grape such as Pinot Noir, or many kinds\nof wine such as fortified, still, or sparkling. Varietal is both a noun when referring to a wine made from a single\ngrape variety, and an adjective when used to say a wine is varietally correct. In the United States, 75% (95% in\nOregon) of the wine must come from the named grape variety before it can be called a varietal.\nAcidity There are two main methods of expressing acidity: titratable acidity (TA) which refers to the test that\nyields the total of all acids present, and hydrogen ion concentration (pH) which is a measure of the strength of\nacidity. The higher the H+ concentration, the more acidic the solution, and since the pH is the negative log of\nthe H+ concentration, the lower the pH, the more acidic the solution. Wine tends to fall within a range of pH of\n3 and 4. The pH is a critical measurement during winemaking and ideally should be below 3.60 for sulfur\ndioxide to be effective during the winemaking process. A higher pH will reduce the effectiveness of sulfur\ndioxide and increase the chance of Brettanomyces and spoilage organisms growth. The perception of acidity\nin a wine is related to the titratable acidity and not pH. Titratable acidity (TA) produces the acid sensation in the\nmouth and is most critical for mouth feel. pH and TA values do not run parallel. A wine can have a high pH and\nlow TA or vice versa.\nPunchdown or punch down? Both in correct use.\nScrewcap or screw cap? Both in correct use.\nDestemmed or de-stemmed? Destemmed is correct usage. Also destemming.\nWinegrower or wine grower? Both in correct use.\nFermenter or fermentor? Fermenter is correct usage.\nReserve This is a term that is overused and nebulous because it has so many meanings. It implies a wine of\nhigher quality, but it can refer to a wine that is a barrel selection, one that has been aged longer, or a wine\nsourced from the best blocks in a vineyard. Wineries sometimes substitute the word cuvée, a fancy French\nway of saying a blend. It is often simply a marketing strategy for selling wine (or charging more) in which case\nit may take on other configurations such as vintner’s reserve, limited reserve, grand reserve, or special reserve\n(Kendall-Jackson produces thousands of cases of “Vintner’s Reserve Chardonnay).\nEstate Bottled This indicates that 100% of the wine came from grapes grown on land owned or controlled by\nthe winery, which must be located in an AVA. The winery must crush and ferment the grapes, and finish, age\nand bottle the wine in a continuous process on their premises.

The organic diet study demonstrated significant reductions in these same types of chemicals, showing 60.5% average reduction in pesticide levels after just 6 days, including a 95% drop in malathion and 61% drop in chlorpyrifos. The EDSP screens for endocrine effects while the diet study confirmed actual reductions in exposure to these chemicals through organic food consumption.","context":["Chemical Selection Approach for Initial Tier 1 Screening\nApproach for Selecting the Initial List of Chemicals for Screening - Federal Register Notice [PDF file, 17pp., 125KB, About PDF]\nOn this page:\n- Overview of the EDSP\n- Chemical Selection – Approach for Initial Screening\n- Subsequent Approaches for Chemical Selection\n- Initial List of Chemicals\nThe EDSP was established in response to a Congressional mandate in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to screen pesticides for their potential to affect the estrogen system. The core elements of the EDSP are:\n- Assay development and validation;\n- Selection of chemicals to be tested (i.e., the 2005 Federal Register Notice (PDF) (17 pp, 125K, About PDF); and\n- Development of program policies and procedures to implement screening.\nThe approach used by EPA for selecting 50 to 100 chemicals for initial screening under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act is summarized below. Nothing in the approach for selecting the initial list would provide a basis to infer that any of the chemicals selected for the list interferes with or is suspected to interfere with the endocrine systems of humans or other species.\nThe approach included consideration of the most current databases and priority-setting tools available. For this approach EPA:\n- Focused chemical selection for this initial list on the subset of chemicals for which testing is required (i.e., pesticide chemicals);\n- Used exposure data as the primary basis for chemical selection;\n- Deferred consideration of nominations from the public;\n- Excluded mixtures; and\n- Excluded chemicals that are no longer produced or used in the United States.\nThe approach described in the September 2005 Federal Register notice further indicated that the following would be excluded from the list of chemicals for initial screening.\n- Substances anticipated to have low potential to cause endocrine disruption (e.g., most polymers with number average molecular weight greater than 1,000 daltons, strong mineral acids, and strong mineral bases);\n- \"Positive control\" chemicals used by EPA for the validation of the screening assays proposed for the Tier 1 battery.\nEPA anticipates that it may modify its chemical selection approach for subsequent screening lists based on experience gained from the results of testing of chemicals on the initial list, the need for a broader approach in the future to incorporate different categories of chemicals (e.g., non-pesticide substances) and additional pathways of exposure, and the availability of new priority-setting tools (e.g., High Throughput Pre-Screening (HTPS) or Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) models). In addition, the Agency intends to conduct a review of the data received from the screening to evaluate whether the program could be improved or optimized.\nEPA published the draft list of initial pesticide active ingredients and pesticide inerts to be considered for screening under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for public notice and comment in a 2007 Federal Register Notice (PDF) (18 pp, 131K, About PDF). The draft list was produced using the approach described in the September 2005 Federal Register Notice (PDF) (17 pp, 125K, About PDF), and included chemicals that the Agency decided should be tested first, based upon exposure potential.\nOn April 15, 2009, EPA published the Final List of Initial Pesticide Active Ingredients and Pesticide Inert Ingredients to be Screened under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (PDF) (7 pp, 62KB, About PDF). The final list includes 67 chemicals to be screened under Tier 1 of the program. More information about the final list.\nThis list should not be construed as a list of known or likely endocrine disruptors.

On average, the pesticide and pesticide metabolite levels detected dropped by 60.5% after just six days of eating an all-organic diet.\nThe study, Organic Diet Intervention Significantly Reduces Urinary Pesticide Levels in U.S. Children and Adults, found significant reductions in pesticides that have been associated with increased risk of autism, cancers, autoimmune disorders, infertility, hormone disruption, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The most significant declines involved organophosphates, a class of highly neurotoxic pesticides linked to brain damage in children: the study found a 95% drop in levels of malathion and a nearly two thirds reduction in chlorpyrifos. Organophosphates are so toxic to children’s developing brains that scientists have recommended a full ban.\n“This study shows that organic works,” said study co-author Kendra Klein, PhD, senior staff scientist at Friends of the Earth. “We all have the right to food that is free of toxic pesticides. Farmers and farmworkers growing our nation’s food and the rural communities they live in have a right not to be exposed to chemicals linked to cancer, autism and infertility. And the way we grow food should protect, not harm, our environment. We urgently need our elected leaders to support our farmers in making healthy organic food available for all.”\nThe study tested the urine of four diverse American families in Oakland, Minneapolis, Atlanta, and Baltimore after eating their typical diet of conventional food for six days and then after a controlled diet of all organic food for six days.\nA short video produced by Friends of the Earth, featuring the families involved in the study, illustrates the changes each family made and aims to shift the narrative from organic being a lifestyle choice to being a human right.\nKey findings of the study include:\n- 61% drop in chlorpyrifos, a neurotoxic pesticide known to damage children’s developing brains. Exposure is associated with increased risk of autism, learning disabilities, ADHD, and IQ loss.\n- 95% drop in malathion, another neurotoxic organophosphate pesticide and a probable human carcinogen according to the World Health Organization.\n- 83% drop in clothianidin, a neonicotinoid pesticide. Neonicotinoids are associated with endocrine disruption and changes in behavior and attention, including an association with autism spectrum disorder. Neonicotinoids are also a main driver of massive pollinator and insect losses, leading scientist to warn of a “second silent spring.”\n- 43-57% drop in pyrethroids, a class of pesticides associated with endocrine disruption and adverse neurodevelopmental, immunological and reproductive effects.\n- 37% drop in 2,4-D, one of two ingredients in Agent Orange. 2,4-D is among the top five most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and is associated with endocrine disruption, thyroid disorders, increased risk of Parkinson’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, developmental and reproductive toxicity and other health issues.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under President Trump has ignored the clear science behind the danger of organophosphate pesticides and reversed the EPA’s proposed ban on chlorpyrifos in 2017. Friends of the Earth is calling on Congress to take immediate action to pass a bill recently introduced by Rep. Velazquez (H.R. 230) to ban chlorpyrifos.\n“This important study shows how quickly we can rid our bodies of toxic pesticides by choosing organic,” said Sharyle Patton, Director of the Commonweal Biomonitoring Resources Center and co-author of the study. “Congratulations to the families who participated in the study and their willingness to tell their stories in support of creating a food system where organic is available to all.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0d43646a-2e02-47aa-9975-f7c981829c75>","<urn:uuid:51185ab9-d9a8-4e6f-9291-ecd3d6b4fbc1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Scandinavian and Japanese interior design styles differ in their approach to storage and organization?","answer":"Scandinavian interior design emphasizes decluttering through practical storage solutions like multipurpose furniture (such as wooden chests that serve as both coffee tables and storage) and natural material baskets for organization. Japanese design takes a more architectural approach to storage and organization, incorporating built-in elements like alcoves for displaying carefully curated items and utilizing movable walls and screens to modify spaces as needed. Both styles prioritize minimalism but implement it through different structural and functional approaches.","context":["Scandinavian interior design: Welcome to a world where simplicity meets sophistication, where functionality embraces beauty – the world of Scandinavian interior design. Hailing from the enchanting Nordic countries, this design philosophy has captured hearts worldwide with its understated yet impactful aesthetic. You might be thinking, “Isn’t Scandinavian interior design expensive?” Fear not, for this blog will unravel the secrets of infusing your home with Scandinavian charm without straining your wallet. Join us as we delve into the essence of Scandinavian interior design and unveil pocket-friendly ideas to revamp your living space.\nDecoding Scandinavian interior design\nScandinavian interior design, born in the mid-20th century across Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland, is a reaction to the fast-paced industrial world. It’s a harmonious blend of form, function, and nature’s touch. Here are the core principles that define Scandinavian interior design:\n- Less is More: Scandinavian interior design celebrates minimalism. It rejoices in clean, uncluttered spaces, creating an aura of tranquility and balance.\n- Embrace Nature: Natural materials like wood, wool, leather, and stone lie at the heart of this design ethos. They infuse a sense of warmth and authenticity, connecting your space to the great outdoors.\n- Light and Airy: With prolonged dark winters, Scandinavians have mastered the art of maximizing natural light. Light colors – especially whites and soft grays – dominate the palette, giving rooms an open and fresh ambiance.\n- Purposeful Furnishings: Functionality takes precedence in Scandinavian interior design. Furniture isn’t just art; it’s art with a purpose. Every piece is thoughtfully designed to be practical and beautiful.\nBudget-Friendly Scandinavian interior design Hacks\nScandinavian Interior design #1 – Thrifted Treasures\nDelve into the world of thrift stores, garage sales, or online marketplaces where hidden gems await your discovery. Search for a vintage wooden chair with sleek lines and a timeless silhouette. Even if the chair has lost some of its original luster, a fresh coat of paint can work wonders. Opt for a soft pastel shade or classic white that aligns with the Scandinavian palette. Before painting, lightly sand the surface to ensure a smooth finish. By giving new life to an old piece, you’re not only adding an affordable accent to your space but also contributing to the sustainability of your decor.\nScandinavian Interior design #2 – DIY Minimalism\nChannel your inner artisan with these DIY projects that capture the essence of Scandinavian minimalism. Transform wooden crates into a minimalist side table by stacking them to create tiers. Secure them in place, and you’ll have a functional and stylish addition to your living room or bedroom. To infuse your walls with natural charm, gather branches, twine, and dried leaves. Arrange them in a geometric pattern or let your creativity flow freely. Secure the elements with twine or simple frames for an art piece that pays homage to the raw beauty of nature.\nScandinavian Interior design #3 – Indoor Greenery\nEmulate the Nordic connection to nature by introducing houseplants that thrive indoors. Opt for ferns, succulents, or snake plants – they’re not only budget-friendly but also easy to maintain. Place them in pots made from affordable materials like terracotta or repurposed containers from thrift shops. These plants infuse your home with a refreshing vitality, and their presence aligns seamlessly with the Scandinavian love for the natural world.\nScandinavian Interior design #4 – String Lights Serenity\nString lights are a budget-friendly way to infuse your space with a serene and inviting atmosphere. These lights aren’t exclusive to the holiday season; they can be used year-round to create a calming ambience reminiscent of Scandinavian evenings. Drape them along a wall in a wave-like pattern, suspend them from the ceiling in a cascading arrangement, or intertwine them with potted plants to add a touch of enchantment to your surroundings.\nScandinavian Interior design #5 – Functional Wall Decor\nMake a stylish statement at your entryway with functional wall decor that captures the essence of Scandinavian interior design. Hang wooden pegs or hooks in a minimalist design and a light wood finish. These hooks serve as a coat rack that’s not only visually appealing but also practical. Say goodbye to cluttered entryways, and embrace the convenience of a designated space for coats, bags, and hats that echoes the Scandinavian emphasis on simplicity and functionality.\nScandinavian Interior design #6 – Textured Textiles\nElevate the comfort and aesthetics of your space with budget-friendly textured textiles that exude Scandinavian coziness. Seek out thrifted or affordable finds such as woven blankets, chunky knit pillows, or faux sheepskin throws. Drape a woven blanket over the back of your sofa to add a touch of texture and visual interest. Enhance your bedding ensemble with a collection of chunky knit pillows, and place a faux sheepskin throw on your favorite armchair for an inviting touch that’s both affordable and indulgent.\nScandinavian Interior design #7 – Multipurpose Furniture\nMaximize your budget by investing in furniture that serves multiple functions, embodying the very essence of Scandinavian practicality. Consider a wooden chest that can function as both a coffee table and discreet storage solution. This versatile piece not only complements the clean lines of Scandinavian interior design but also adds a touch of rustic charm. Its dual functionality helps you declutter while maintaining a sophisticated aesthetic.\nScandinavian Interior design #8 – Gallery of Memories\nCreate a personalized gallery wall that speaks to your memories and experiences while aligning with the Scandinavian interior design ethos. Opt for simple, minimal frames that let the content take center stage. Display a mix of your favorite photos, art prints, and pressed botanicals collected during your outdoor adventures. This gallery not only infuses your space with a touch of your personality but also celebrates the connection to nature that’s deeply rooted in Scandinavian living.\nScandinavian Interior design #9 – Repurpose with Purpose\nLet your creativity shine by repurposing wooden crates into stylish and functional shelving units that uphold the Scandinavian aesthetic. Stain or paint the crates in light hues that evoke the natural tones of Nordic landscapes. Arrange the crates in an asymmetrical configuration on your wall to showcase books, plants, and decor items. This DIY approach not only adds a unique focal point to your space but also reflects the simplicity and resourcefulness inherent in Scandinavian interior design.\nScandinavian Interior design #10 – Decluttering Zen\nEmbrace the heart of Scandinavian interior design by fostering a decluttered environment that allows your space to breathe. Keep only what’s necessary and meaningful to create a serene atmosphere. To maintain order while incorporating natural elements, use baskets made from materials like woven seagrass or rattan. These baskets serve as both practical storage solutions and decorative accents that align seamlessly with the Scandinavian ethos of simplicity and harmony.\nScandinavian interior design welcomes you to embrace the beauty of simplicity, functionality, and nature’s elegance. By integrating these budget-friendly ideas, you’re not just transforming your living space; you’re creating a sanctuary that encapsulates the essence of Nordic living. Each element, from the repurposed vintage chair to the DIY wall art, from the indoor greenery to the textured textiles, contributes to a harmonious narrative of tranquility and refinement. As you immerse yourself in these design hacks, your home evolves into an embodiment of Scandinavian grace – an environment that nurtures your well-being and fosters a deep connection with nature and purposeful design.","By Koji Yagi\nJam-packed with stylish designs and shrewdpermanent advice, A eastern contact to your Home deals daring and interesting principles for transforming your place or decorating your condo. the writer, architect Koji Yagi, explains the elemental parts of jap inside layout and indicates you ways to exploit them.\nInstall tatami mats and shoji doors-cardinal components of jap inside design-and see how superbly they reply to the Western domestic. switch the dimensions and form of a room simply and tastefully with bamboo monitors and movable walls. construct an easy Japanese-style alcove, beautify it with whatever particular, after which flaunt it. try out a few eastern lights techniques-low, smooth, and lovely. switch the temper of a room, and alter your manner of issues.\nA jap contact in your Home comprises even more. useful, approachable, and genuine, it's written by way of a well-known eastern architect eager about the calls for of latest life, and the solutions that conventional eastern layout has to provide.\nOver a hundred and twenty colour plates taken by way of a number one jap photographer accompany the expert textual content. furthermore, over 2 hundred black and white sketches, flooring plans, and a piece on selfmade tasks make this a booklet that would pique your wish to be artistic after which assist you to satisfy it. a realistic advisor for owners, inside designers, and those who prefer to paintings with their heads and their palms, this booklet will introduce you to a brand new lifestyle.\nRead or Download A Japanese Touch for Your Home PDF\nSimilar japan books\nChoked with stylish designs and smart information, A eastern contact to your domestic bargains daring and interesting rules for reworking your house or adorning your condominium. the writer, architect Koji Yagi, explains the fundamental components of eastern inside layout and exhibits you the way to take advantage of them.\nInstall tatami mats and shoji doors-cardinal parts of jap inside design-and see how fantastically they reply to the Western domestic. swap the dimensions and form of a room simply and tastefully with bamboo displays and movable walls. construct an easy Japanese-style alcove, beautify it with whatever distinctive, after which flaunt it. try out a few eastern lights techniques-low, gentle, and gorgeous. switch the temper of a room, and alter your method of taking a look at issues.\nA eastern contact in your domestic comprises even more. useful, approachable, and genuine, it really is written by way of a famous eastern architect inquisitive about the calls for of up to date life, and the solutions that conventional eastern layout has to provide.\nOver a hundred and twenty colour plates taken through a number one jap photographer accompany the knowledgeable textual content. additionally, over 2 hundred black and white sketches, flooring plans, and a piece on home made tasks make this a booklet that may pique your wish to be inventive after which enable you satisfy it. a realistic advisor for owners, inside designers, and those that prefer to paintings with their heads and their arms, this publication will introduce you to a brand new lifestyle.\nNotice: i feel the dossier dimension is so huge as a result of all of the HQ images incorporated.

{"question":"How does the return of international concerts contribute to Thailand's broader economic development, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses?","answer":"The return of international concerts contributes to Thailand's economic development through multiple channels. Beyond direct concert revenue, it benefits surrounding attractions like restaurants and historical sites through increased visits. The strategy creates opportunities for local services including culinary experiences and travel insurance. The impact extends to complementary experiences such as urban attractions, activities, cruises, and entertainment. This phenomenon is expected to boost Thai small and medium-sized tourism businesses, benefiting Thailand's overall economy and tourism industry. The approach not only drives leisure travel spending across various demographics but also integrates cultural celebration through music performances into Thailand's tourism strategy.","context":["The return of popular international artists and live concerts to Bangkok offers multiple benefits to the Thai economy, according to Traveloka, one of Southeast Asia's largest travel, services and lifestyle apps.\nThere is a growing trend to travel internationally for music, sports and other major events. With the global music tourism market forecast to be worth US$11.3 billion by 2032, Thailand is well positioned to take advantage of this development.\nIn Asia Pacific alone, with its fast-growing youth population, the higher demand for live music performances is anticipated to lead the global music event market. That's one way a steady stream of international concerts can play a significant role in Thai tourism growth with their massive crowd-pulling abilities.\nTaylor Swift's Eras tour is a good example of how concerts encourage consumption in host cities, with its US leg expected to generate up to $5 billion in economic activity, according to the online research firm QuestionPro. The spending goes well beyond event ticket sales to include not just merchandise and food and beverage but also the costs of flights, accommodation and retail sales in host cities.\nWith the return of live concerts approaching pre-pandemic levels, which kicked off early this year with Blackpink's two-day Bangkok stop in January, followed by Harry Styles and Arctic Monkeys concerts in March, Thailand is well on its way to benefit from the \"experience economy\".\nAccording to Traveloka data, there has been a significant increase specifically for inbound flights, with the number of flight transactions increasing by almost five times for the first half 2023, compared to the same period last year. This surge in flights is also reflected in the accommodation trend, as hotel bookings in Bangkok have risen to almost 30%.\nIn the first half of 2023, Traveloka Thailand experienced a significant number of bookings, with the majority coming from both inbound and domestic travellers heading to Bangkok. Among inbound tourists, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, England, Singapore, Malaysia and Cambodia were the top contributors to the bookings.\nAt the same time, domestic tourists displayed their enthusiasm as Traveloka observed an increase in bookings from Chiang Mai, Hat Yai, Chiang Rai, Phuket, Chon Buri, Songkhla and Surat Thani to Bangkok.\nThailand enjoyed a vibrant tourism industry during the first half of 2023, and this looks to continue into 2024. This will positively affect the demand for accommodation and flights, and with added music tours making a comeback, it can also help propel the travel industry to the next level.\nMusic tourism is not just limited to live performances, as surrounding attractions like restaurants and historical sites can also benefit from increased visits, to name only a few examples.\nWith the upcoming Charlie Puth and Sam Smith concerts in October, and with fast-to-sell-out Coldplay concerts scheduled for February 2024, Thailand can expect that they will bring good tourism revenue. Travel and tourism businesses with the right strategy and approach will stand to benefit from this.\nAccording to Iko Putera, CEO of Transport at Traveloka, this is an opportunity for those in the industry to work on delivering experiences that are complementary to the most popular concerts and music festivals, such as urban attractions and activities, cruises, and entertainment.\n\"What we are seeing from Traveloka data, is that international concerts in Bangkok could be one of the key drivers for leisure travel spending across a wide demographic,\" he said.\n\"Celebrating culture through music performances and entertainment should also be an integral part of Thai tourism strategy. The lineup of world-class performers for multiple shows in Bangkok serves as a remarkable achievement for its tourism industry.\"\nSuch a strategy not only promises prosperity for local businesses but also presents significant opportunities for other local services such as culinary experiences, travel insurances, and more.\n\"We are hopeful this phenomenon will have a positive contribution in boosting Thai small and medium-sized tourism businesses, which benefits Thailand's overall economy and tourism industry,\" said Mr Iko."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:23610cea-e837-4d18-ac4e-a80df3c86855>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does the Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem play in both recreational fishing and marine conservation, particularly in areas like John Pennekamp State Park and the general fishing zones?","answer":"The Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem serves dual purposes in fishing and conservation. For recreational fishing, it's the only living coral reef in North America, providing productive grounds for catching snappers, groupers, and other reef fish species. However, conservation efforts, exemplified by John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, protect these ecosystems from damage. The park, established after years of reef destruction from tourism in the 1900s-1950s, now preserves 70 nautical square miles of marine sanctuary while still allowing careful eco-tourism. This balanced approach helps maintain the reef's biodiversity, which includes 80 different coral species and over 260 types of tropical fish, while supporting sustainable fishing activities in designated areas outside the protected zones.","context":["A Guide to Winter Fishing in the Florida Keys\nYou may not catch a 255-pound swordfish every trip, but any winter fishing excursion to the Florida Keys is full of adventurous angling potential.\nBy Terry Gibson\nA few winters back, long-time friend and legendary New York-based charter Capt. John McMurray called me to plan the fishing adventure of a lifetime. John’s wife, Danielle, was pregnant with their first children – twins – and she had given John the go-ahead to take a fishing trip of his choice, before feedings and diaper changes became daily affairs. John’s plan: Rent a motorcycle in Miami and ride it down through the Florida Keys while I follow, pulling my boat. We would hit the best winter fishing in the Florida Keys with the best captains. It proved an epic road trip with superb fishing for dozens of species, including an incredible day of sailfish action, backcountry rod-bending for snook and redfish, and never to be forgotten, a 255-pound swordfish. If you’re up for a Florida Keys winter fishing adventure, here’s your guide to following in our wakes.\nBest Bet: Sailfish in the Stream\nHemingway would be stoked to see how strong the Atlantic sailfish population that migrates along the Gulf Stream is today. You’ll probably target this acrobatic fish while winter fishing in the Florida Keys using the excitingly visual method of dangling live baits beneath kites, but you can also sight-cast live baits to feeding schools. There’s great sailfishing from Key Largo to Big Pine Key to Key West, but I’ve done my best fishing out of Bud N’ Mary’s Marina in Islamorada.\nFlorida Bay is a vast wilderness comprising thousands of miles of shallow seagrass meadows, mangrove islands and tributary creeks between the mainland and the Keys. Most of it is protected by Everglades National Park, but you can access Park waters from the northern Keys, including Key Largo, Tavernier and Islamorada.\nAnd there’s no shortage of exciting species you can catch. Winter redfish appear in schools that number in the hundreds. A warm day finds snook sunning themselves, perfect for the sight-fishing angler. Spanish mackerel are a guaranteed catch. They school up literally by the millions.\nOn the Reef\nAccessible from any marina location, the North American Coral Reef Tract runs northward along the entire length of the Florida Keys and beyond. This is the only living coral reef in North America. Winter fishing in the Florida Keys for snappers, grunts, groupers and other fish associated with coral is a blast, especially for kids. You can hire a charter or take a “party boat.” The trip is inexpensive and sure to produce a fresh fish dinner. An added bonus: Many Keys restaurants will cook your fresh catch.\nCatches differ depending upon where you launch in the Keys, but the flats behind Big Pine Key and parts south tend to fish better for bonefish and permit during winter months, though that’s a generalization. The fishing for these prized species gets even better in the spring, along with tarpon fishing, throughout the Keys.\nYou can also stalk permit, bonefish and tarpon in upper Florida Bay.

But did you know that the U.S. also has a hidden state park off the largest island in the Florida Keys — and it’s underwater? That’s right, folks, you can actually visit an UNDERWATER state park! How cool is that? There is plenty to see and do, so let’s get right to it and discover John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park!\nThe First Underwater Park in the United States\nOff the coast of Florida are over 200 small islands known as the Florida Keys. This unique archipelago is also the home of the only living coral reef in the continental U.S. It is the third largest coral reef in the entire world! Unfortunately, as people visited these beautiful islands from the 1900s to the 1950s, the reefs experienced great damage. Tourists and tourism companies frequently chiseled out corals from the coral reef, along with seashells, sponges, and even seahorses, to sell and take home as souvenirs. Sometimes they even used dynamite! The coral reefs in the Florida Keys took thousands of years to form, and yet over just a few decades, they were disappearing at an alarming rate.\nFortunately, John Pennekamp, an editor with the Miami Herald, fought to legally protect these beautiful underwater ecosystems. Finally, in 1963, President Dwight D. Eisenhower designated a section of Key Largo — the largest island in the Florida Keys — as the Key Largo Coral Reef Preserve. Later, the governor of Florida changed the name to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park to honor Pennekamp’s role in protecting the reef here. Today Key Largo claims the title of the “Diving Capital of the World” due to these beautiful coral reefs.\nWhere is Florida’s Hidden State Park on a Map?\nFlorida’s hidden state park is located off the coast of Key Largo, the largest island in the Florida Keys. The Keys are an archipelago of 200 islands that stretch from the southernmost tip of Florida south toward Cuba.\nJohn Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park at Key Largo\nKey Largo is the largest island in the Florida Keys, measuring 33 miles long. John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park encompasses part of the island on land and the ocean beyond it. The park boasts large mangrove swamps and lush tropical hammocks along 25 miles of stunning coastline and reaches 3 miles into the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe marine sanctuary spans up to 70 nautical square miles of ocean. Closer to the coast, the water is shallow and averages a depth of just 5 to 15 feet. However, scuba tours can reach further out and venture into depths around 30 to 45 feet.\nPlant Life at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park\nAlong the coast of Key Largo, you can explore many coastal berms. These storm-deposited ridges of sediment are made up of different things like shell fragments and pieces of coralline algae. They range from 1 to 10 feet tall and offer an up-close look at a variety of tropical plants and trees. You can find tall shrubs and short trees like the Spanish stopper, saffron plum, hog plum, and white indigo berry here. Short shrubs and herbs such as spider lilies, rouge berries, and limber caper also grow on these coastal berms. You might also come across mangrove trees, joewood, buttonwood, and sea ox-eye daisy near the seashore.\nHere is a quick list of just some of the plants that often grow on the coastal berms of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park:\n- Gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba)\n- Hog plum (Ximenia americana)\n- White indigo berry (Randia aculeata)\n- Spider lily (Hymenocallis latifolia)\n- Poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum)\n- Lantana (Lantana involucrata)\n- Spanish stopper (Eugenia foetida)\n- Saffron plum (Sideroxylon salicifolium)\n- Limber caper (Cynophalla flexuosa)\n- Sea purslane (Sesuvium portulastrum)\n- False mint (Dicliptera sexangularis)\n- Cordgrass (Spartina spp.)\n- Seashore dropseed (Paspalum spp.)\n- Buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus)\n- Red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle)\n- White mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa)\n- Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans)\n- Inkwood (Exothea paniculata)\n- Sea ox-eye daisy (Borrichia arborescens)\nMarine Life at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park\nJohn Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park is a protected paradise for all kinds of marine life. The reefs here are communities of hard and soft corals living in shallow stretches of water. The clear, warm water here gives these animals a place to thrive and grow.\nCorals are surprisingly small animals, with some that can be as small as the head of a pin! But don’t let their tiny size fool you — some colonies of corals can reach sizes larger than a house! However, corals take a very long time to grow — the coral reefs at John Pennekamp took thousands of years to grow into what we see today! Brain corals, for example, grow around just 0.25 to 0.5 inches yearly, while staghorn coral grows about 1.5 inches yearly. However, staghorn corals are much more delicate, and if you even just touch their outer layers, you can easily injure or even kill them!\nFortunately, in addition to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, most of the reefs of Key Largo are also protected as part of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. This protection has significantly increased the health and populations of marine life here while still allowing careful eco-tourism activities.\nSo, what types of marine life can you see at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park? Let’s take a closer look!\nThere are 80 different species of coral that live in the waters of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. Elkhorn coral, for example, grows long branch-like sections that provide homes for many other animals living in the reef. A single colony can be as tall as 6 feet and as wide as 12 feet! However, elkhorn and several other coral species here are endangered, so protecting the park’s biodiversity is important.\nBrain coral is another common species in the park, and like its name, it looks somewhat like a spongy brain. On the other hand, sea fans have a much more delicate appearance, with small branches that link together to form beautiful latticework planes.\nHere are just a few examples of some of the coral species that live in John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park:\n- Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata)\n- Staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis)\n- Blushing star coral (Stephanocoenia intersepta)\n- Brain coral (Diplora sp. and Pseudodiploria spp.)\n- Star coral (Siderastrea siderea, Montastraea sp., and Orbicella spp.)\n- Starlet coral (Siderastrea siderea)\n- Lobed star coral (Solenastrea hyades)\n- Knobby cactus coral (Mycetophyllia aliciae)\n- Starlet coral (Siderastrea radians)\n- Smooth star coral (Solenastrea bournoni)\n- Sea whips (Pterogorgia spp.)\n- Sea rods (Plexaura spp.)\n- Fire coral (Millepora spp.)\n- Mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides)\n- Lettuce coral (Undaria agaricites)\n- Smooth flower coral (Eusmilia fastigiata)\n- Tube coral (Oculina spp.)\nIn addition to the colorful corals living in John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, there are also many other unique and fascinating types of invertebrate animals. Sea cucumbers live on most of the reefs here, although they are excellent at hiding, so they can be hard to spot. On the other hand, sea urchins are much easier to see at the park. These remarkable sea creatures are covered with hundreds of hard spikes that protect them against predators. Brittle stars are shy and like to hide, but sometimes you can find them if you look carefully under ledges and at the mouth of tube sponges. Brittle stars come in just about every color of the rainbow and have bioluminescent hairs on their legs that glow in the dark!\nHere are a few more examples of some of the fascinating invertebrates that you might come across at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park:\n- Caribbean long-spined urchin (Diadema antillarians)\n- Decorator crab (Microphrys bicornuta)\n- Common blue crab (Callinectes sapidus)\n- Spiny lobster (Panulirus argus)\n- Banded coral shrimp (Stenopus hispidus)\n- Thorny starfish (Echinaster sentus)\n- Florida sea cucumber (Holothuria floridana)\n- Christmas tree worm (Spirobranchus giganteus)\n- Cushion sea star (Oreaster reticulata)\n- Milk conch (Strombus costatus)\n- West Indian sea egg (Tripneustes ventricosus)\n- Caribbean reef squid (Sepioteuthis sepioidea)\nJohn Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park is home to over 260 different species of tropical fish, with hundreds of different colors. For example, the males and females of many of the 15 species of parrotfish at the park are different colors. Sometimes the juvenile fish are a separate color as well, so just among parrotfish, there could potentially be around 50 different color patterns!\nIf you come across what looks like a “mini” parrotfish, it’s likely a wrasse. Groups of wrasses often gather at “cleaning stations” to help pick off dead skin and parasites from larger fish. In addition, you can always count on seeing a damselfish at the park. These small fish are harmless but extremely territorial. If you get too close to their algae garden patches, they will attack and try to scare you away — although they often look more like they are dancing than attacking.\n- Sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis)\n- Queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula)\n- Porcupinefish (Diodon hystrix)\n- Blue runner (Caranx crysos)\n- Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus)\n- Queen angelfish (Holacanthus ciliaris)\n- Black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci)\n- Ocean surgeonfish (Ocean surgeonfish)\n- Porkfish (Anisotremus virginicus)\n- Peacock flounder (Bothus lunatus)\n- Foureye butterflyfish (Chaetodon capistratus)\n- Rainbow parrotfish (Scarus guacamaia)\n- Yellowhead wrasse (Halichoeres garnoti)\n- Shortfin pipefish (Cosmocampus elucens)\n- Scrawled filefish (Aluterus scriptus)\n- Bluelip parrotfish (Cryptotomus roseus)\nLarger Marine Animals\nIf you go diving in John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, you’ll also have the opportunity to see much larger sea creatures. Sea turtles are common here, particularly the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata).\nThere are also sharks at the park, but the most common one you’ll see is a nurse shark — which is not aggressive toward humans. You might even see some gentle manatees grazing in the water if you kayak near the mangroves and seagrass beds. There are also stingrays, jellyfish, barracudas, and even crocodiles, although they are not as common.\nHere are a few examples of some of the larger marine animals you might see at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park:\n- Spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari)\n- Southern stingray (Dasyatis americana)\n- Yellow stingray (Urolophus jamaicensis)\n- Tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)\n- Lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostri)\n- Bonnethead shark (Sphyrna tiburo)\n- Reef shark (Carcharhinus perez)\n- Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata)\n- Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta)\n- Green turtle (Chelonia mydas)\n- Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus)\n- Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris)\n- American crocodile (Crocodyluc acutus)\n- Eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon corais cooperi)\nThings to Do at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park\nThere are many ways to see and experience all of the adventure, beauty, and wonder of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park! On land, you can enjoy a stroll along one of the park’s many short trails or enjoy a picnic by the beach. There is also a Visitor Center with a 30,000-glass saltwater aquarium and a theater with nature shows.\nSnorkeling and scuba diving are some of the most popular activities in the park. These allow you to get up close and personal with much of the wildlife here. However, if you’re not ready to take a dip in the ocean, you can also kayak and canoe through the park’s waters or take a tour on one of the many glass-bottom boats.\nIf you decide to take the plunge and dive, you could also check out the famous “Christ of the Abyss.” Standing around 25 feet below the water’s surface at the Key Largo Dry Rocks Reef, the 8.5 feet tall, 4,000-pound statue of Jesus Christ stands quietly amid the park’s marine life. The statue is a casting of the Cristo Degli Abissi that stands in the Mediterranean Sea near Genoa, Italy. Although separated by miles of land and sea, the two underwater statues stand facing one another.\nFAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)\nAre there crocodiles at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park?\nYes, there are American crocodiles here. They are not commonly seen, but often do spend time along the shore and especially in the mangrove areas.\nAre there alligators at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park?\nAlligators spend most of their time in freshwater environments, but they have been known to venture into saltwater as well on occasion. However, it is not very likely that you will see an alligator at the park.\nAre there sharks at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park?\nYes, there are several different types of sharks here. The most commonly seen are nurse sharks, which are not aggressive toward humans.\nIs the water clear at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park?\nIn some of the offshore areas, the water is very clear. However, water closer to shore doesn’t offer the same stunning experience. If you come to the park for just a short visit, you likely won’t be able to spot clear water or go snorkeling at the reef.\nTo really experience the beauty of this underwater park, you should dedicate a full day or more if you want to do more water-related activities like swimming, snorkeling, and seeing coral.\nAre there good beaches at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park?\nThe beaches of Key Large are quite pretty, but they are not the tropical Caribbean-type beaches that people often imagine. These beaches have harder sand with rocks and mangroves. The water is typically calm at the beaches here, but it is not as clear as the waters surrounding the coral reefs further from the beaches.\nCan you snorkel on your own at John Pennekamp State Park?\nYes, although the guided underwater tours offer the best experience at John Pennekamp State Park. However, if you just want to try out snorkeling and familiarize yourself with the sport, then shore snorkeling from the beach here can be great for beginners. The water near the beach doesn’t have the best views of the park, but it can still be a lot of fun.\nThank you for reading! Have some feedback for us?

{"question":"What are the startup challenges for space electronics versus terrestrial power systems after shutdown?","answer":"Space electronics face startup challenges from radiation damage, where ionizing radiation and charged particles degrade materials and components over time, particularly affecting unprotected electronics. For terrestrial power systems, startup after complete shutdown is challenging because power plants require energy to produce energy - steam and nuclear plants need power to generate steam, hydroelectric plants need energy to open massive valves, and there's a surge in power demand when all appliances try to restart simultaneously (for example, fluorescent lights require 10 times their normal operating power to start up).","context":["Assembly and programming of an electronic measurement device that allows to perform materials characterization in space on student satellite ESTCube-2. (EST: Mõõteseadme valmistamine ja programmeerimine materjaliuuringute jaoks kosmoses tudengisatelliidil ESTCube-2). This electronic device is one of the two major components in our developed corrosion testing module, which will be used to test a novel nanostructured coating and a smart radiation shielding material in LEO (Low Earth Orbit).\nThe preparation, programming and preliminary testing of the electronic measurement device is carried out by Hedgehog OÜ and funded by Captain Corrosion OÜ (30%) and Enterprise Estonia (70%).\nESTCube group assists us with the planning of this experiment and with the integration of our corrosion testing module to the student satellite ESTCube-2. Once the satellite is in space, we will also carry out the tests together.\nLaboratory of Thin Film Technology (University of Tartu) is our main partner for assembling the test system as well as other prototypes, that will be used to test the patented nanostructured coating. With them we also carry out laboratory-based materials characterization measurements and tests.\nWe just published one of our most sophisticated videos made so far. It is about corrosion in space due to radiation and in the video we will discuss different radiation-matter interactions.\nHow Does Radiation Cause Corrosion in Space? This is actually quite complicated as the radiation in space covers a wide spectral range and the interaction between matter and radiation depends on the wavelength (energy) of the radiation. Anyhow, radiation can be divided into two groups – ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radiation such as infrared or visible light can only damage the material if the intensity is high (e.g. laser beam). Ionizing radiation like UV-light, X-rays and gamma rays on the other hand has already enough energy to remove electrons from atoms and this degrades materials over time. In the case of high energy gamma radiation there are also other interactions possible such as the creation of electron-positron couples, compton scattering, photodisintegration and photofission. Learn more about corrosion in space by watching our new science video:\nWe just published a new video about corrosion in space due to charged particles. Its the 2nd episode in a three part series.\nHow and why do charged particles cause corrosion of materials in space? This is a question asked by many spacecraft engineers and the answer is not so simple. Namely, there is a whole zoo of different particles and every single one of them interacts with the matter in a unique way. The general rule however is that particles which have a higher mass, charge and velocity, cause more damage. For instance, electrons have a negative charge and in a scanning electron microscope they travel at about 20% of the speed of light but they hardly damage the studied substrate. Ions however have not only a charge but also a lot of mass and therefore they can also cause serious damage if their velocity is sufficient. A completely different story is with antimatter particles such as positrons and anti-protons. When these hit regular matter, then both the particle and the surface of regular matter is converted into energy in the form of gamma radiation. This radiation however can ionize the nearby matter and also do serious damage to electronics, which is shielded from particles but not from gamma rays. High energy radiation is also created when regular charged particles such as protons and electrons interact with the matter as the excess energy is released as braking light (bremsstrahlung), when the high velocity of the particle suddenly changes to zero upon hitting the surface of a material. Anyhow, the spacecrafts are constantly being bombarded with different particles and this slowly degrades the surface of the material and the resulting radiation also has a devastating effect on the electronics. Learn more by watching our new science video:\nWe completed the video about corrosion in space by atomic oxygen! It is the first episode in a three part series.\nAtomic oxygen is one of the leading candidates which causes the degradation of materials in space. That’s because atomic oxygen is highly reactive and will oxidize anything that can be oxidized. This means that most vulnerable to this type of corrosion are polymers, carbon fiber materials and unprotected electronics. So in order to extend the lifespan of a spacecraft, one first needs to counter the corrosion caused by atomic oxygen. This can be done by using proper materials for making the spacecrafts components and by avoiding the exposure of sensitive electronics to space.\nCaptain Corrosion OÜ proudly presents a three part video series about corrosion in space. These science videos were made in collaboration with the department of materials science, University Tartu and were partially funded by the “Center of Excellence” (Project TK141). Corrosion in space is actually quite relevant right now as there are more spacecrafts in the orbit than ever before and their number keeps increasing. An average spy satellite, disguised as a weather satellite, costs about 400 million euros and their lifespan is somewhat limited due to various reasons like human errors, software/hardware failure and degradation of specific spacecraft parts due to the hostile environment of space (corrosion!). This “corrosion” of materials in space however can be quite complicated as there are multiple factors that contribute to the process. In our video series we discuss some of the most important factors. The general idea of this series is to provide additional information for companies that make spacecraft component so they can better plan their devices to last as long as possible in space.\nPart 1 – How Does Atomic Oxygen Cause Corrosion in Space?\nPart 2 – How do Charged Particles Cause Corrosion in Space?\nPart 3 – How does Radiation Cause Corrosion in Space?","It isn't easy to start an electrical power grid back up after it has been shut down completely. Problems can include a lack of spare transformers, \"cold start\" loads, and the need for electricity to start up a power plant.\nClick on image for full size\nProblems Restoring Electrical Power After a Blackout\nPower grids were not designed to fail completely and be started-up all at once. The basic problem is that it takes energy to produce energy. Hydroelectric, steam and nuclear power plants all require energy to start up. Steam and nuclear plants require enough energy to bring a large amount of water to steam before operation can begin. Hydroelectric plants need power to open massive valves which opened manually normally take 300 turns. Hydroelectric plants are the easiest to start from black-out conditions. However, during the black-out of the HydroQuebec power grid in March 1989, it took 9 hours to restore 90% of the system even though it is based on hydroelectric power plants. Other types of plants might take days to restart.\nLarge transformers are very expensive pieces of equipment (~$10 million). Since catastrophic transformer failures are extremely infrequent, power plants do not keep spare units. Lead times for ordering and delivery of new units can be quite significant (up to a year). While waiting for a new transformer, a power plant would be inoperable.\nWhenever an electrical device is started up, it requires an instantaneous surge of power that is greater than the normal operating power requirements for the device. For example, a fluorescent light requires an instantaneous power surge 10 times greater than its normal operating requirements to start up. During normal operations of a power grid, the appliances in everyone's homes don't start up all at once but start ups are scattered randomly in time. After a black-out, every furnace or air conditioner, and a large number of other appliances will try to start up all at once. The power demand at start up is much larger than the normal power demands on the power distribution network.\nShop Windows to the Universe Science Store!\nOur online store\non science education, classroom activities in The Earth Scientist\nspecimens, and educational games\nYou might also be interested in:\nThe transformer is not a power source.

{"question":"What are the key benefits of local news for democratic societies, and what challenges do social media platforms pose to information integrity during elections?","answer":"Local news plays a vital role in democratic societies by creating a shared baseline of facts about communities and building trust between citizens and institutions. The shorter distance between news and readers strengthens communities and social fabric. Local journalism has also been responsible for major investigative achievements, like uncovering the Catholic Church abuse scandal and Watergate. However, social media platforms pose significant challenges to information integrity, particularly during elections. They enable the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation, while concentrating distribution power in a few unregulated companies. This has led multiple African countries to restrict social media access during elections, with at least 15 countries implementing such restrictions in the past five years. Social media's amplification effect makes it a uniquely powerful tool that can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes.","context":["Knight Media Forum 2019: Welcome remarks by Knight Foundation President Alberto Ibargüen\nInformed and engaged communities are the bedrock of a healthy democracy.\nBut that bedrock has begun to quake. We meet today not just to describe the problem, but to find solutions.\nWe’re here today because the way we inform ourselves is insufficient to meet the demands of our democratic republic. If you do not have a reliably informed citizenry, you will not have a functioning democracy. It’s that simple.\nAnd we’re here because we think one of the three ways forward is reinvigorating local news.\nThe emergence and quick dominance of search and social media; the rise of talk radio and opinion broadcasts presented as news; twenty years of layoffs and shutdowns at national and local news outlets—these changes have radically altered our news landscape. Internet platforms have decimated the business model that sustained newspapers for most of the last century, while concentrating data, and therefore power, in a few, global hands.\nThe result is that the local news ecosystem that was so uniquely and valuably American is in disarray. Communities are left without a broadly shared, common baseline of facts about what just happened, about where we are, about who we are.\nBut it’s in those local communities where we have the greatest chance to rebuild the trust we’ve lost in our institutions, in our news, in our leaders, and in ourselves.\nThe shorter the distance between our neighbors and our news, the stronger our community. There is strength in local, and local leads to trust.\nWhen there is distance, however, between news and reader, event and citizen, trust erodes and our social fabric frays.\nHaving spent most of my adult life supporting local journalism and its essential role in our democracy, I find this deeply troubling.\nBut I am also buoyed by a different emotion: hope.\nI confess to being a prisoner of hope. I believe, no matter the obstacles, in our ability to do better.\nThat belief is anchored by history and knowledge of what we’ve overcome. As an example, before Gutenberg mechanized the printing press, there was order. Publications were few and often carried the Church’s imprimatur. Everyone knew what to believe. After Gutenberg, there was a flood of information, and for a hundred years, the public had trouble figuring out what was true.\nNot long ago, most Americans got their news from print newspapers with trusted brands — including 98 percent of the registrants when we started this conference 12 years ago.\nInternet allowed social media to break the dam, multiplied the sources and concentrated the distribution systems. While more people than ever before in history now have access to more information than ever, that sea change came with a flood of misinformation, disinformation, harassment and invective. The distribution of information has been consolidated into the hands of a few, enormous and generally unregulated companies.\nI mentioned that local news was one of three avenues we need to pursue. I believe the other two are technology and legal. As a practical matter, our focus at Knight is on local news, but we should be aware of the need and possibilities of using artificial intelligence agents to solve the problems of misinformation and disinformation – the same problems that artificial intelligence agents were used to create.\nAnd we need to reconsider whether global internet companies should continue to be governed by rules written for American print and broadcast outlets in the 20th century. We need fresh concepts of economic competition. Should we return to an earlier notion of trust busting, where the public determines a corporate behemoth is just too big? Should the laws of libel and product liability apply to digital services and products?\nCongress, if I understand recent hearings, has taken note of the awesome power of the platforms and intends to act. I think the rolling thunder is just over the horizon. And it might be one of those rare moments when right and left come together.\nBut both technological advances and debates about law and regulation are largely outside the scope of this conference.\nOur focus is on finding new ways to fulfill the underlying purpose of local news: sustaining an informed citizenry. Or, as Jack Knight put it, illuminating the minds of readers “so that the people may determine their true interests.”\nFor a decade, with the help of many of you in this room, we’ve explored different approaches to helping local news adapt and we’re ready to apply what we’ve learned.\nThree weeks ago, the Aspen Institute’s Knight Commission on Trust, Media and Democracy issued its report, which I would recommend as a primer on these issues and an index of possible ways forward.\nLast week, Knight Foundation announced a new initiative to revitalize local news, doubling our previous plan and raising the ante to $300 million.\nBut I stress that it’s only the ante and that’s why I’m delighted to see you here and was so glad to read NYU professor Michael Posner’s call in Forbes for a “Marshall Plan for journalism.” That vision evokes the scale of the effort — not by government, but by we, the people.\nWe start with local news because some of the most remarkable journalistic feats in our nation’s history have been local.\nThe Watergate stories that took down a president and changed the course of history were written by two metro reporters.\nThe Catholic Church’s suppression of sexual abuse was uncovered by The Boston Globe’s local investigative unit.\nTwo weeks ago, Southern Baptist Convention’s sex scandals were uncovered by the Houston Chronicle.\nAnd last year, when a gunman murdered five journalists at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, their colleagues responded by putting out a paper the next day at a newspaper that was not liberal or conservative but just told the story of what had happened in their city and what might be next.\nThe two key parts of the Knight initiative in Trust, Journalism and Democracy that I want you to remember are: 1) it’s about local news, because that’s where we think trust can be regained, and 2) it’s structured so that anyone can participate.\nNo matter what you’re passionate about, or where you live, there’s something for you.\nIf you want to support investigative journalism, donate to ProPublica’s local investigative journalism program.\nIf you want to help local outlets pursue sustainable digital business models, donate to the American Journalism Project.\nIf you want to place reporters in a range of newspapers around the country, donate to Report for America.\nIf you understand the need for legal support for journalists, support the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and legal clinics at various law schools supported by the Stanton Foundation and others.\nChoose one – or several – that catch your attention, and you can be part of the solution. Because the solution is local.\nThe fundamental goal of this $300 million push is to reinvigorate local news as the staging ground for the middle, a place where common facts are the common prize. And in doing so, to help rebuild trust in media and strengthen our democracy.\nA few days ago, I read a piece about social change that quoted two great writers who were also social activists, James Baldwin and Simone de Beauvoir, each calling for engagement in society. Baldwin wrote about race, power and pride and said, “We made the world we’re living in and we have to make it over.” And de Beauvoir noted, “It is ours to do because the present is not a potential past; it is the moment of choice and action.”\nIf you leave this week’s Media Forum with one thought, let it be this, from their combined message: We have to make this world over, and it is ours to do.\nJoin us is renewing trust in news, and in each other.","Uganda’s social media battleground is not just an African trend\nElections are a reminder that free speech must be weighed up against information warfare when considering restrictions.\nFirst published by ISS Today\nIn the earlier days of Ugandan Yoweri Museveni’s presidential career in 2006, I remember seeing election posters routinely torn down by all sides during campaign rallies in an attempt to control the message. Now social media has become the new election battleground, propelled by the rapid proliferation and reach of cellphone technology across Africa.\n60% cent of Uganda’s population has access to a cellphone. Although social media penetration is still relatively low, it’s growing rapidly, with a 27% increase between April 2019 and January 2020.\nAs the potency of so-called information operations is recognised, it isn’t surprising that the tools used to democratise access to information (including fake news) are being reined in. States have ordered shutdowns apparently to protect the status quo. Likewise, platform controllers have found themselves under pressure to step in, in response to their own rules being violated.\nIt’s a complex balancing act – a tussle between rights and responsibilities. Facebook and Twitter have been dragged away from the relative comfort of obscurity and arguments about network neutrality and forced to take a stand. Uganda’s recent election is the latest iteration of that.\nOn 12 January, responding to reports that internet service providers “are being asked to block social media and messaging apps” on the eve of Uganda’s election, Twitter’s Global Public Policy Team posted: “Earlier this week, in close coordination with our peers, we suspended a number of accounts targeting the election in Uganda. If we can attribute any of this activity to state-backed actors, we will disclose to our archive of information operations.”\nMedia reports suggested earlier that Ugandan authorities were retaliating against big tech’s allegations that they may be using underhand means to win votes. Facebook also found itself in the firing line after it took down a network of Ugandan government-linked sites it claimed had been involved in fake news.\nAt least 15 African countries have restricted or switched off social media access during protests or elections in the past five years. Chad, Ethiopia and Tanzania are among them. Furthermore, evidence has emerged that African governments are quietly tightening up their legal frameworks to restrict social media use.\nFor savvy operators, social media platforms enable them to project a voice way beyond the confines of any hustings or campaign rally. Recent Institute for Security Studies research reveals how the amplification effect of social media makes it a uniquely powerful tool for both good and ill.\n80% of Uganda’s population is under 30. The demographics of social media usage are biased towards the young and so the potential ‘threat’ that platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp pose to the status quo is clear. Particularly as the old guard of Ugandan politics is being challenged by 38-year-old opposition frontrunner Bobi Wine. His prolific use of social media campaigning led Uganda’s government to dub him an “agent of foreign interests.”\nAlthough many African countries are reviewing their laws to control social media use, researchers found that “a third of the world’s countries have been blocking or restricting access to social media since 2015” – so it isn’t a strictly African trend.\nLesotho, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya are among those blazing the trail in social media restrictions. Kenya, which has one of the continent’s most energetic social media communities, is considering the Kenya Information and Communications (Amendment) Bill, 2019. Under the proposed legislation, bloggers must potentially apply for a licence to operate on social media.\nSocial media platform controllers may be required to hand over material to governments, and administrators of groups such as WhatsApp will need to regulate members’ behaviour online. Big social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook will also be obliged to open offices in territories where their content can be consumed – presumably to ensure they’re compliant with local laws.\nThe reflex by governments to introduce tougher laws to control social media will be considered by human rights protagonists as an assault on free speech. But the debate is no longer simply about personal freedom of expression. Issues of outside manipulation also come into play, although these can be exaggerated for political gain.\nPolicymakers must assess the risks and benefits of social media from several perspectives. They need to resist regulating or closing down platforms without considering what the motivation is to limit a free for all. Is it to protect an incumbent from opposition voices or to fortify a state against foreign intrusion?\nAs a policy prescription, greater digital literacy among the wider public may be more impactful than internet shutdowns. In any event, the prevalence of virtual private networks enables users to ‘cheat’ their location, rendering domestic shutdowns ineffective.\nMore awareness among the mainstream media about the dangers of inadvertently amplifying fake news by retweeting popular hashtags without verifying them may also encourage responsible social media use. Civil society and professional media have a role in ensuring accuracy is cherished, and authenticity of content is given primacy over speed of delivery.\nCompanies such as Facebook who can no longer sit on the virtual fence should be incentivised to engage more closely with policymakers, without risking accusations of political bias. They must also defend their platforms as tools for promoting free speech while being aware of the power of new technology to become a weapon of information warfare.\nElection monitoring must increasingly take on a digital dimension. The United Nations Development Programme and the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) have hosted events to promote awareness among election monitors about the potency of social media.\nA key theme to emerge is the need for election monitoring bodies to begin the online observation process early on in the election cycle, as narratives get shaped. They must also be acutely aware of the importance of local context in assessing the impact and meaning of messages and the timing of shutdowns during critical times such as elections.

{"question":"What was the role of John Brown in the abolition movement, and how did his actions at Harper's Ferry influence political tensions in late 1859?","answer":"John Brown was an ultra-religious abolitionist who aimed to free slaves by arming them. He attempted to raid the federal armory at Harper's Ferry to steal weapons but was caught, tried, and convicted. He was hanged on December 2, 1859, becoming a martyr for the abolitionist cause. His execution led to increased political tensions, as evidenced by the subsequent acrimonious debate over the House speakership from December 1859 to February 1860, during which Southern congressmen openly discussed secession if a Republican won the presidency.","context":["ANTEBELLUM PREVIEW 1. Slavery - a civil relationship whereby one person is legally owned by another person as property and is forced to work for that person without pay. Owner has absolute power over another slave and controls his life, health, liberty, and future. 2. States Rights – The belief that a state’s well-being is more important than that of the whole country. 3. Sectionalism - belief that people in a given region or area that their ideas and interests are better and more important than those of another region or area. 4. Nullification – the refusal or failure of a U.S. state to recognize or enforce a federal law within its boundaries (if a federal law negatively impacts a state, they should be able to ignore it). Nullify –to declare invalid. 5. Missouri Compromise – 1820 law passed by Congress: Maine entered the Union as a free state, Missouri entered the Union as a slave state. Future slavery was prohibited north of the southern border of Missouri. 6. Compromise of 1850 – Legislation passed by congress by which: California entered the Union as a free state, slave trading ended in the District of Columbia Texas gave up claims to New Mexico in exchange for $ Residents of New Mex. & Utah Terr. could determine if they wanted slavery A stronger Fugitive Slave Act was enacted 7. Fugitive Slave Act – Part of the compromise of 1850. It declared that all runaway slaves were, upon capture, to be returned to their masters (failure to assist was against the law).. 8. Georgia Platform – a response from the Georgia Convention to the 1850 compromise. We should support 1850 Compromise because it strengthened the fugitive slave law. 9. Alexander Stephens and Robert Toombs – GA Congressman – Led Whigs Party - favored protective tariff and federal help for the south. Originally, against secession & proposed GA Platform. Stephens became VP of the Confederate States. 10. Kansas-Nebraska Act – Legislation that created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska and that contained a clause on popular sovereignty that negated (cancelled) the compromise of 1850… future states may determine for themselves to have slavery or not. Led to “Bleeding Kansas” ! 11. Dred Scott Case – Dred Scott moved to free state w/ master & master died, former owner sued for his return, he sued for freedom. Case declared that all blacks -- slaves as well as free -- were not and could never become US citizens (& so couldn’t sue). The court also declared the 1820 Missouri Comp. unconstitutional, thus permitting slavery in all the country's territories. 12. Nat Turner and Slave Codes - Nat Turner was a slave who led a failed 1831 slave rebellion in Virginia. (57-85 died in the revolt) Led to slave codes which took away nearly all rights of slaves (slaves could not testify against whites, disrespect a white person, hit a white person, carry a weapon, travel w/o permission, be educated, etc., etc., ETC.) 13. Election of 1860 – County split over slavery issue (Democrats could not agree on 1 candidate so, they split & formed several parties). Abraham Lincoln elected President w/ ~ 40% (promised not to interfere w/ slavery). 1st time a party w/ votes from only one section of the nation won the election…not one vote from the south. *This caused some states to break from the US ! 14. Abraham Lincoln – Became President in 1860 … 1st Republican (abolitionist party created in 1854) …did not support slavery, but not equality of the races either. Abolition: the immediate ending of slavery. 15. John Brown (& Harpers Ferry) – Ultra religious background, wanted to free slaves by arming them. Broke into federal armory to steal weapons, but was caught, tried, & convicted guilty (hanged & became a martyr).","Chronology of Major Events Leading to Secession Crisis\nDecember 2, 1859—Radical abolitionist John Brown is hanged in Charles Town, Virginia for attempting to foment a slave revolt.\nDecember 5, 1859-February 1, 1860—A protracted and acrimonious debate over the House speakership occupies Congress for nearly two months. The Republicans initially nominate John Sherman, an Ohioan with moderate views on slavery, but Sherman’s support for a controversial anti-slavery book entitled The Impending Crisis derails his nomination. The Democrats counter with several nominations, including Thomas S. Bocock of Virginia and John A. McClernand of Illinois, but these nominees are also unsuccessful in part because of splits within their party. In February, the Republicans elect William Pennington as Speaker of the House with 119 votes, the exact number needed to win. The debates in Congress during this period are heated and many members carry weapons. Southern congressmen talk openly of secession in the event of a Republican presidential victory in November.\nJanuary, 1860—The Democratic Party of Alabama adopts a resolution which instructs the state’s delegates to the Convention in Charleston to “insist” on a clause in the national platform calling for a law to protect slavery in the territories. Moreover, the delegates are instructed to withdraw from the convention if such a clause is rejected.\nFebruary 2, 1860—Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis introduces a series of resolutions in the upper house which call for a federal code protecting slavery in the territories. The resolutions are passed by the Senate Democratic caucus, an action which further divides the party along sectional lines.\nFebruary 27, 1860—Abraham Lincoln delivers his famous Cooper Union Address in New York City, which presents a compelling case on the Founding Fathers’ objections to the spread of slavery. The speech is widely reprinted in northern newspapers and helps Lincoln secure his party’s presidential nomination.\nMarch, 1860—The Virginia House of Delegates overwhelmingly rejects a proposal by South Carolina to organize a convention of southern states.\nMarch 5, 1860—The Republican-controlled House of Representatives approves the formation of a committee to investigate alleged corruption and malfeasance in the Buchanan administration. The president criticizes the investigation as a partisan plot to besmirch his “personal and official integrity.” Hearings continue through June.\nApril 30, 1860—Fifty southern delegates to the Democratic national convention storm out of Institute Hall in Charleston, South Caroli na in order to protest their party’s unwillingness to endorse a federal code protecting slavery in the territories.\nMay 9, 1860—The newly-formed Constitutional Union Party opens its convention in Baltimore. John Bell of Tennessee becomes the party’s presidential nominee. Comprised mainly of conservative Whigs and Know-Nothings concerned about the gathering crisis, the party advertises itself as an alternative to “Black Republicanism” and Democratic demagoguery. The delegates refuse to adopt a platform, instead pledging themselves solely to the preservation of the Union and the Constitution.\nMay 16, 1860—The Republican convention opens in Chicago. William Seward emerges early as the party’s strongest presidential candidate, but is defeated by Abraham Lincoln on the third ballot. Lincoln has fewer enemies within the Republican ranks and is viewed by most members as a political moderate. The party platform calls for a higher tariff, a ban on slavery in the territories, federal money for internal improvement projects, and a homestead act.\nJune 11, 1860—Delegates who joined the walkout in Charleston meet in Richmond in an unsuccessful attempt to nominate a candidate and approve a party platform.\nJune 18, 1860—The Democratic national convention reconvenes in Baltimore after the Charleston impasse. Anti-Douglas delegates from Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Maryland, California, Oregon, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas withdraw from the meeting in order to protest the assembly’s decision to seat newly-elected, pro-Douglas state delegations. Stephen A. Douglas is nominated as the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate by the remaining delegates. Shortly thereafter, a group of disgruntled delegates assembles a competing convention in Baltimore which nominates John C. Breckinridge, a federal slave code supporter, for president. The Democratic Party is split into two sectional factions.\nJune 22, 1860—Under pressure from the Southern Democracy, President James Buchanan vetoes a homestead bill which calls for the distribution of 160 acres of government land to each citizen willing to improve it. The vote in Congress is along sectional lines. In the House, 114 of the 115 votes in favor of the bill are cast by free-state representatives, while 64 of the 65 “nays” come from slave-state Congressmen. Southerners realize that the homestead bill will disproportionately benefit the free states. The sectional divide within the Democratic Party strengthens the Republican Party’s chances for victory in November.\nJuly 6, 1860—In a letter intended for publication, New York City Mayor Fernando Wood proposes that Democrats run John Breckinridge unopposed in southern states and Stephen Douglas alone in northern ones in order to thwart Lincoln’s election.\nAugust 13, 1860—During a speech in Boston, William Seward describes Lincoln as “a soldier on the side of freedom in the irrepressible conflict between freedom and slavery.”\nAugust 25, 1860—From the steps of Norfolk’s City Hall, presidential candidate Stephen Douglas tells a crowd of seven thousand Virginians that he believes Lincoln’s election would not be a just cause for secession and that the federal government has the right to use force in order to preserve the Union.\nSeptember 5, 1860—Presidential candidate John Breckinridge tells a crowd in Lexington, Kentucky that Democratic rival Stephen Douglas espouses principles which are “repugnant alike to reason and the Constitution.”\nOctober 5, 1860—A massive “Wide-Awake” torchlight parade takes place in New York City. The Wide-Awakes were young Republicans who staged theatrical nighttime rallies during the campaign of 1860 to show their support for Lincoln’s candidacy.\nNovember 6, 1860—Americans go the polls and elect Abraham Lincoln as the sixteenth president of the United States. Lincoln receives 1,866,452 popular votes and 180 electoral votes from 17 of the 33 states. Not a single slave state endorses Lincoln. Stephen Douglas receives 1,376,957 popular votes and 12 electoral votes; John Breckinridge receives 849, 781 popular votes and 72 electoral votes; and John Bell receives 588, 879 popular votes and 39 electoral votes.\nNovember 9, 1860—Lame duck president James Buchanan convenes a cabinet meeting to discuss the national crisis that has been unleashed in the wake of Lincoln’s election. Like the country as a whole, his advisors are split over the issue of secession. Buchanan proposes a convention of the states with the object of hammering out a compromise. Secretary of State Lewis Cass (MI) argues that the Union should be preserved at all costs, even if that means using force. Attorney General Jeremiah Sullivan Black (PA) shares Cass’ opinion. Postmaster General Joseph Holt (KY) opposes both secession and Buchanan’s idea for a convention. Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb (GA) believes secession is legal and necessary. Secretary of the Interior Jacob Thompson (MS) agrees with Cobb and says any show of force by the U.S. government will force his native Mississippi out of the Union. Secretary of War John Floyd (VA) opposes secession because he believes it is unnecessary. Secretary of the Navy Isaac Toucey (CT) endorses Buchanan’s convention idea.\nNovember 10, 1860—Both of South Carolina’s senators, James Chesnut, Jr. and James H. Hammond, resign their seats. The legislature of South Carolina orders a convention to meet in Columbia on December 17 to decide whether or not the state should remain in the Union.\nNovember 13, 1860—The South Carolina legislature authorizes the raising of ten thousand men for the state’s defense.\nNovember 14, 1860—Alexander Stephens, the future vice-president of the Confederacy, addresses the Georgia legislature and speaks out against secession. He argues that the South should pursue a more moderate course and, “Let the fanatics of the North break the Constitution, if such is their fell purpose.”\nNovember 18, 1860—The Georgia legislature authorizes one million dollars for weapon purchases.\nNovember 23, 1860—Major Robert Anderson issues a report from Charleston which identifies Fort Sumter as the key to the defense of the city’s harbor. In addition, he argues that secession is a fait accompli in South Carolina.\nDecember 4, 1860—President Buchanan sends his State of the Union message to Congress, which attempts to appease both northerners and southerners. He views secession as a consequence of the “intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery” and urges the North to respect the sovereignty and rights of the southern states. At the same time, Buchanan condemns secession and signals his intent to defend any federal forts in the South that come under attack. Both sides are displeased with the speech. The House of Representatives creates a Committee of Thirty-three (one member per state) to study the country’s crisis and issue recommendations.\nDecember 8, 1860—The first rupture in Buchanan’s cabinet occurs when Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb (GA) resigns his post. A former unionist, Cobb has come to believe that the “evil” of Black Republicanism is “beyond control” and must be met with resistance. The same day, a group of South Carolina congressmen visits the White House and encourages Buchanan to relinquish federal property to their state.\nDecember 10, 1860—South Carolina congressmen meet with Buchanan and promise that their forces will not attack U.S. forts before the issue of secession is debated, or the two governments reach an agreement, as long as the military status quo is maintained.\nDecember 12, 1860—Secretary of State Lewis Cass (MI) resigns over Buchanan’s decision not to reinforce the federal forts in Charleston.\nDecember 13, 1860—Twenty-three House members and seven Senators from the South make a public announcement calling for the creation of a Southern Confederacy.\nDecember 17, 1860—South Carolina’s Secession Convention opens in Columbia.\nDecember 20, 1860—Delegates to South Carolina’s Secession Convention vote 169 to 0 to leave the Union. President Buchanan is stunned by the news. The Palmetto State’s decision emboldens secessionists in other southern states.\nDecember 26, 1860—Major Robert Anderson moves his small force from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter. He believes the former location will soon be attacked and that the change of location is necessary to “prevent the effusion of blood.” South Carolinians view the troop transfer as a violation of their agreement with Buchanan to maintain the status quo.\nDecember 29, 1860—Secretary of War John B. Floyd (VA) resigns over Buchanan’s decision not to overrule Anderson’s troop transfer.\nDecember 30, 1860—South Carolinians seize the Federal Arsenal at Charleston, making Fort Sumter the last piece of federal property in the state controlled by the United States government.\nJanuary 8, 1861—President Buchanan sends a special message to Congress which endorses Senator John J. Crittenden’s proposal to resurrect the old Missouri Compromise line. Also, Buchanan places the onus of responsibility for solving the crisis on the legislative branch. The last southerner in the president’s cabinet, Secretary of the Interior Jacob Thompson (MS), resigns.\nJanuary 9, 1861—Mississippi secedes from the Union. In Charleston, southern guns fire on the Star of the West as it attempts to re-supply Fort Sumter. The ship withdraws and sets course for New York.\nJanuary 10, 1861—Florida secedes from the Union. Lieutenant Adam Slemmer moves his small federal garrison from Barrancas Barracks at Pensacola to Fort Pickens on Santa Rosa Island. Slemmer refuses repeated surrender demands from Florida authorities, allowing Fort Pickens to remain in Union hands for the duration of the war.\nJanuary 11, 1861—Alabama secedes from the Union.\nJanuary 14, 1861—The chairman of the Committee of Thirty-three, Thomas Corwin (OH), presents the group’s report to the House of Representatives. Recommendations include a Constitutional amendment guaranteeing slavery where it exists, a repeal of northern “personal liberty laws”, and jury trials for fugitive slaves. The committee does not unanimously approve of the proposals.\nJanuary 16, 1861—The Crittenden Compromise is defeated in the Senate.\nJanuary 19, 1861—Georgia secedes from the Union.\nJanuary 21, 1861—Five senators from Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi bid farewell to their colleagues in the upper house. Among them is Senator Jefferson Davis, future president of the Confederacy.\nJanuary 26, 1861—Louisiana secedes from the Union.\nJanuary 29, 1861—Kansas is admitted to the Union sans slavery.\nFebruary 1, 1861—Texas secedes from the Union.\nFebruary 4, 1861—The convention of seceded states opens in Montgomery, Alabama as a Peace Convention called by Virginia gets underway in Washington. One of the delegates at the latter meeting is former president John Tyler. Louisiana Senators Judah Benjamin and John Slidell resign their seats.\nFebruary 8, 1861—Delegates in Montgomery adopt a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America. The document contains only a few variations from the U.S. Constitution, among which are a clause protecting slavery and one that prohibits tariffs designed to protect domestic industry.\nFebruary 9, 1861—Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens are elected Provisional President and Vice-President of the Confederacy respectively. Both men are considered political moderates. In Tennessee, voters reject a call for a secession convention.\nFebruary 18, 1861—Jefferson Davis is inaugurated as president of the Confederacy during a ceremony in Montgomery, Alabama.\nFebruary 23, 1861—Abraham Lincoln arrives in Washington on a special train at the behest of his security team. The President-elect’s clandestine journey is lampooned by a number of newspaper cartoonists, who inflate wild rumors that he was disguised as a Scotsman.\nFebruary 27, 1861—The Peace Convention proposes six constitutional amendments to Congress—most relate to the impasse over slavery. None passes. The House of Representatives rejects a call for a constitutional convention and the Crittenden Compromise.\nFebruary 28, 1861—The House passes a measure supported by President-elect Lincoln which prohibits the federal government from interfering with slavery in states where it exists.\nMarch 1, 1861—Confederate President Jefferson Davis appoints P.G.T. Beauregard as commander of southern forces guarding Charleston. Congress organizes two new territories, Nevada and Dakota, and passes the Morrill Tariff Act, which raises taxes on imports.\nMarch 4, 1861—Abraham Lincoln is inaugurated as President of the United States in Washington. He tells the crowd gathered around the Capitol that he has no intention of interfering with slavery, but that secession is illegal and the Union perpetual.\nMarch 5, 1861—Lincoln learns from Major Anderson that Fort Sumter must either be re-supplied or abandoned within a matter of weeks. The president understands that surrendering the fort would mean a loss of federal sovereignty, but that sending supplies would likely start a war. He loses sleep over the situation.\nMarch 29, 1861—After days of deliberation and careful consultation with his cabinet, Lincoln decides to re-supply Forts Sumter and Pickens.\nApril 4, 1861—In an 89 to 45 vote, the Virginia State Convention rejects an ordinance of secession.\nApril 6, 1861—Lincoln dispatches a State Department employee to inform South Carolina Governor Francis Pickens that the federal government will re-provision Fort Sumter. The president makes it clear that no additional troops will be sent to the fort if supply ships are allowed to land.\nApril 10, 1861—Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Walker authorizes Beauregard to use force if the federal government attempts to re-supply Fort Sumter.\nApril 11, 1861—Major Anderson refuses a request from the Confederate government to surrender Fort Sumter. A final request would come in the early morning hours of April 12, shortly before the bombardment of the fortress began."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:218ec10e-9085-41cc-9310-151c207b67e4>","<urn:uuid:40207fdd-b856-4e7f-8539-b1a2af47dbbd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has climate change impacted job opportunities in environmental fields, and what preparation is recommended for high school students?","answer":"Climate change has created new job opportunities, with some positions emerging that didn't exist three years ago. There's particular growth in renewable energy applications, especially in Virginia. For high school preparation, students should take a college preparatory program including chemistry, biology, and mathematics through trigonometry or pre-calculus. They're also encouraged to take environmental science classes and join environmental clubs.

Most of the programs had a wide variety of students and were geared to either working professionals (or recent graduates) and offered practical competencies and strategic connections (as well as hands-on real world experiences). Each explained how their coursework prepares students for professional roles in the industry.\nEach program had something different to offer: Dr. Salzberg detailed George Washington University’s Environment and Energy Management Institute (EEMI) certificate programs comprised of short courses (on energy systems and resilience) designed for busy professionals (who can take 4 months to complete a course). The focus of the coursework is a systemic approach – to raise the level of understanding of the importance of energy resilience to the future of an organization and how the underlying energy network drives resilience in the outcomes.\nDr. Saltzberg explained how the systems approach looks at all aspects of energy resilience – food systems, water systems, etc. all interact with each other (without good water, food, etc. you don’t have good public health, etc.). The coursework helps prepare working professionals to be better energy leaders, advisors, decision-makers, investors, regulators, and educators.\nAmy Hubbard and Dr. David Robertson gave a presentation on Virginia Tech’s Executive Master of Natural Resources (XMNR) and Climate Leadership in Global Sustainability (CLIGS) programs. The program is a hybrid format (75% online, 25% in person; 11 class weekends, and a 10-day global study trip). Students range in age from their 20s to their 60s, with varied backgrounds and experiences; and there is a cap on the number of students at 35 students per year. Career consulting and professional networking are built into the coursework. The focus is on leadership and communications competencies, peer-to-peer learning, individualized attention, career coaching (students can customize their learning experience), as well as providing access to its robust professional and alumni network. The school also offers an early admissions scholarship coupon of $1,000.\nPerhaps the most unusual learning experience was that offered by George Mason, giving hands-on conservation biology training for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and professionals at the internationally renowned Smithsonian 3,200 acre campus in Front Royal, VA. Dr. Cody Edwards explained how students learn by working with renowned professionals from all over the world – scientists, educators, administrators or animal keepers who teach/run programs. The focus is on working with practitioners (as opposed to. lectures). Begun in 2012, the program is a partnership with George Mason and the Smithsonian (Smithsonian-Mason School of Conservation). Students go on to graduate school, create their own sustainable farms or other enterprises, go on to work with scientists, researchers, and academics or work in other sectors directly related to conservation and sustainability. Students gain real-time conservation experience; some students work with organizations (NGOs) that go on to hire them (students are doing hands-on work needed by the organizations). Notably, Jane Goodall has taught at the school. There is a wide variety of levels of coursework, from summer programs, High School, undergraduate, graduate, professional and conservation internships (which often lead to jobs in the conservation sector).\nDr. Christopher Mordaunt presented on John Tyler Community College’s Energy Certificates and Engineering Technology Programs. The programs are G3 eligible (a program for any Virginia resident who qualifies for in-state tuition and whose family income falls below an identified threshold) – publically funded to prepare students to fill an increased number of green jobs in Virginia. Currently, there are opportunities in local and state-wide industries. Dr. Mordaunt said there is a tremendous growth in energy sector in general, and Virginia in particular is experiencing rapid growth in renewable energy applications. Students can take college courses in high school and get college credit; the programs get local companies involved and give students hands-on experience. The college’s energy programs prepare students for roles as energy systems installers or maintenance personnel and energy system technicians. Another program leads to an associate degree in an energy specialization.\nA few takeaways from the session included: the fact that new jobs exist today that did not exist even three years ago. There is a current greening of business and a corresponding growth of choices in green education. Young people now expect to have multiple jobs/careers over their working life (perhaps as many as 14). School is no longer linear and certificate programs are popular. However, credentials and degrees don’t necessarily lead to a job. For this reason, Virginia Tech’s XMNR, and the Center for Leadership in Global Sustainability (CLIGS) program focus on career coaching working with students one on one. Networking is important. Sometimes jobs can be created for job-seekers; workplace and workforce have both changed – portability is important to the new workforce; school programs have shifted to accommodate new paradigms and students’ desire for autonomy and flexibility (their expectations and experiences are different than in the past).\nDr. Saltzberg mentioned giving students the “banana without the peel” – getting right down to what is needed for a professional career in the new energy economy. In various ways, all the schools are developing leaders for systemic change, yet their approaches were unique. This was perhaps best summed up by Dr. Mordaunt: “There is a success story for every student.”\nLinda Mansdorf serves as the Director of Volunteers for Leaders in Energy.

What are the career opportunities in Natural Resources and Environmental Management (NREM)? Can I get a good job with a NREM Bachelor’s of Science degree?\nNREM-related careers span a wide range from traditional occupations like soil conservationist, forester or regional planner to emerging opportunities in environmental quality, coastal resource management, and sustainable development. In general, environment-related employment is expected to increase in coming years. Browse the links at NREM’s Career Help to find out about the many possibilities. With a bachelor’s of science degree, starting salaries average about $35,000 per year but can be significantly higher in some specializations. And you’ll grow in your first job to gain more work experience, technical expertise and management skills. Your salary should grow with your capabilities.\n2. What classes should I take in high school to prepare for college studies in NREM?\nTake a regular college preparatory program that includes the natural sciences, especially chemistry, biology, and mathematics through trigonometry or pre-calculus, plus the other courses required for admissions to UH Manoa. If available, high school students should consider taking an environmental science class, joining an environmental club or volunteering with a community group to become familiar with the field, get some hands-on experience, and network with like-minded peers and professional people.\n3. Instead of entering UH Manoa as a freshman, can I go to a community college first? If I go to a community college, what classes should I take?\nProspective NREM students can go to a UH community college and complete lower division (100-200 level) courses that meet UH Manoa general education and NREM B.Sc. degree requirements. Before registering at a community college, we recommend that you consult with an advisor at their counseling office who can help you plan a program study. Let the community college advisor know that you’re interested in transferring into the NREM program, and go over B.Sc. requirements with them. If you enroll at a college outside the UH system, see our advice for transfer students. When you’re ready to transfer to UH Manoa, be sure to specify the NREM major on your admissions application form so that we’ll know you’re coming.\n4. I’m not sure that I want to go to college for four years and get a bachelor’s degree. Can I still get a job in natural resources and environment?\nUsually a bachelor’s degree is the minimum education required for scientific, specialist, managerial or professional positions involving natural resources or environment. But there are many other jobs available for production workers, technicians, and service providers. The University of Hawaii has developed pathways in career and technical education with 2-year and 4-year degree options. NREM is part of the Natural Resources pathway, which has a variety of occupations at different levels of training. Some postsecondary education is required for most technical jobs. Besides providing classes in basic subjects, UH community colleges (CCs) offer technical training in selected natural resources/environmental areas. The ones most closely related to NREM include:\nIf you’re interested in one of these programs, contact the program coordinator or a community college counselor for more information.\n5. Besides NREM, what other environmental degrees are offered at UH Manoa? What’s the difference between the programs?\nUH Manoa has various undergraduate degrees related to the natural environment. One important difference is between a Bachelor’s of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor’s of Science (B.Sc.) degree. B.A. programs typically require 30-60 credits for the major and provide breadth of understanding within a given field. B.Sc. degrees require (approx.) 60-90 credits with greater depth and more exacting requirements in scientific and research methods, technical training, concentration area, management and other applied skills, and/or special experiences like an internship or student research project. TheNREM Bachelor’s of Science degree requires 75-76 credits and includes all these elements. Another key distinction is between a disciplinary degree in a single subject like Botany or Geology, and interdisciplinary programs which combine learning from different fields to prepare students for professional careers. Because students must take courses in varied subjects, an interdisciplinary major may require a lot more credits than a disciplinary one. NREM is part of the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, which is noted for its interdisciplinary degree programs. Other environment-related interdisciplinary degrees at UH Manoa include Environmental Studies (B.A.), Geography (B.A.), Ethnobotany (B.Sc.), and Global Environmental Science (B.Sc.). Each program has its own approach and emphases in studying diverse aspects of the natural world.\n6. I’m currently enrolled at UH Manoa. But I haven’t decided on a major yet, or I’m unhappy with my current major. Can I transfer into NREM and still graduate on time?\nNREM accepts transfers from other UHM programs if your GPA is 2.5 or higher. If you’re a sophomore, you can probably complete the NREM B.Sc. degree in 2-3 years. Since NREM’s lower division requirements are the same (or nearly so) as other biological or environmental sciences, even juniors and seniors can transfer major and graduate in good time. If you’re considering to transfer, consult with the undergraduate advisor in your current major, or with Arts and Sciences Advising Services if undeclared. They can check your academic progress to see how close you are to completing a degree there. Also get a copy of your Star transcript and compare it with NREM degree requirements, and think about what track specialization you’d like to do. NREM may accept courses that you’ve already taken as a specialization elective or substitute for a core requirement. Finally, contact NREM’s undergraduate advisor to discuss your case and start the paperwork to transfer major."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:df00c715-1e58-4cf7-8311-8c4119019071>","<urn:uuid:e4626037-0e5a-4487-9a62-23302d9d26bf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key mechanisms for farmers to protect against natural disasters through USDA programs, and how do these relate to the broader framework of agricultural risk management?","answer":"USDA programs offer several key protection mechanisms against natural disasters. Through the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), farmers receive financial assistance for non-insurable crop losses due to natural disasters, with basic coverage protecting 50% of crops at 55% of market value. The Livestock Indemnity Program compensates for livestock deaths from adverse weather events, while ELAP provides relief for feed/water shortages and covers up to 150 grazing days lost to floods. These programs fit into a broader risk management framework where farmers must balance production risks (weather, pests, diseases) with marketing, financial, legal, and human risks. The goal is finding solutions that balance risk and return, with crop insurance serving as a key tool to protect against both production loss and price decline.","context":["Missouri Agriculture Flood Resources\nWhen flooding, occurs farmers are often impacted.

Learn about the different ways farmers can manage risk to keep doing what they love and do best.\nWhat is risk?\nRisk is the chance of a loss, or other bad consequence, associated with any decision. Each decision we make has a risk-return tradeoff where the amount of risk is positively correlated to the amount of potential return. In other words, the riskier a decision, the larger the potential payout and vice versa. Uncertainty is defined as not knowing what will happen in the future and increases risk. Risk management involves finding the balance between the risk of a loss and the potential for profit.\nCalculating and avoiding risk\nTo calculate risk, ask yourself:\n- Is there a good chance of bad consequences? This will help you measure the likelihood of the risk. A “yes” is a red flag, and means that a bad outcome is likely.\n- Would the bad consequences drastically disrupt the farm business? This will help you measure the magnitude of the risk. Another “yes” would be another red flag, and means that the consequences would be severe.\nIf you answered “yes” to both questions, there is a good chance of a bad outcome that will drastically harm your farm. That’s a decision you probably don’t want to make!\nThe best way to avoid a bad outcome is to consider all alternatives when making a major decision. We are often quick to assume that there are only one or two solutions, but these solutions are typically the most extreme courses of action falling on either end of the risk-return tradeoff line. Push yourself to consider all alternatives — the goal is to find solutions that balance risk and return and fall somewhere in the middle of the risk-return tradeoff line. As a business owner, it’s essential that you know your personal risk tolerance to guide your decision-making and help you make a realistic risk management plan. Investment surveys can be used as a good proxy for whether you are risk averse or risk seeking.\nWhat is crop insurance?\nCrop insurance can provide protection from production loss, price decline or a combination of both. Crop insurance plans can be based on production, revenue or the farming area. Production and revenue plans are based on the farmer’s actual production history while area plans are based on averages in a specified farming area. Insurable causes of loss include adverse weather conditions (drought, flooding, frost), fire, insects, plant disease and wildfire.\nTwo programs most relevant to small and mid-sized diversified farms are the Whole-Farm Revenue Protection Program (WFRP) and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP).\nWhole-Farm Revenue Protection Program\nThe Whole-Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) program is the first crop insurance product available in every county nationwide and is available for any farm with up to $8.5 million in insured revenue. It insures all crops on the farm under one policy, meaning that individual crop losses are not considered. Instead, the overall farm revenue is used to determine losses. A farm or ranch may have up to $1 million in expected revenue from animals and animal products. A qualifying farm must provide five consecutive years of Schedule F or other farm tax forms. Qualifying beginning farmers or ranchers (“an individual or entity who has not operated a farm or ranch, or who has operated a farm or ranch for not more than 10 consecutive years”) may qualify with three consecutive years of Schedule F forms.\nCoverage levels range from 50-75% and are chosen by the farmer. The cost of the insurance program or premium varies depending on the county, coverage level and the diversity of crops, and is subsidized by the federal government. WFRP is designed to reward diversification so farms with a qualifying commodity count of three or more (meaning that you produce three or more individual crops that make up a substantial amount of your total farm revenue) can select coverage levels at 80-85% as well. The chart above shows the percentage of the total premium that is paid by the government based on the coverage level (selected by farmer) and the qualifying commodity count (determined by crop insurance agent). For example, at the 75% coverage level, a farm with a qualifying commodity count of two will have 80% of their premium paid for by the government. Qualifying beginning farmers and ranchers are eligible for an additional 10% discount on their premium.\n- Sales Closing, Cancellation and Termination Due Dates\n- Calendar and early fiscal year filers: January 31, February 28 or March 15 (by county)\n- Late fiscal year filers: November 20\n- Revised Farm Operation Report Due Date\n- All filers: July 15\n- Contract Change Date\n- August 31\nKey dates for WFRP are included in the table above and are based on your taxes. For the specific dates that apply to your county, talk to your local crop insurance agent. Premiums are not paid when you sign up for the plan, but rather in September of the year of coverage. The USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) manages the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) which provides crop insurance products to farmers and ranchers. Approved Insurance Providers (AIP) sell federal crop insurance products through a public-private partnership with RMA.\nNoninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program\nNoninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) is administered by the USDA’s Farm Service Agency and provides financial assistance to producers of non-insurable crops to protect against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop loss or prevented plantings. Eligible crops are those not already covered by another federal crop insurance program. They include crops grown for food or fiber, floriculture, grain and forage crops for animal consumption, and yield-based and value-based crops. (For a comprehensive list, contact your local FSA office.) Eligible causes of loss are generally damaging weather or natural occurrences including drought, hail, excessive moisture, freeze, tornado, hurricane, excessive wind, earthquake, flood, volcano and insufficient chill hours.\nNAP offers two types of coverage: basic coverage and buy-up coverage. Basic coverage covers 50% of your crop and is covered at 55% of the average market value. There are no premiums for basic coverage, but the service fees are $325 per crop, not to exceed $825 per county and not to exceed $1,950 per producer. All service fees are waived for qualifying beginning, minority or limited resource farmers and ranchers. Buy-up coverage covers 50-65% of the crop at 100% of the average market value but has a premium in addition to the service fees. Premiums are due in early January the following year after signing up for coverage. Qualifying beginning, minority or limited resource farmers and ranchers are eligible for a 50% discount on premiums.\nApplication closing dates vary by crop so contact your local FSA office for specific questions. Coverage periods begin the earlier of 30 days after you file for coverage or the day you plant the crop and last through the day the crop is harvested, destroyed or abandoned. For perennial crops, the coverage period ends 10 months after the application closing date.\nHow can I manage other types of risk?\nRisk on the farm can generally be broken down into five types:\n- Production — refers to the variability in actual outcomes versus your expected outcome and includes uncertain production-related activities. Examples include weather, climate change, pests, diseases, and other factors that affect quantity and quality of your products. To manage production risk, you can control or minimize the risk, reduce the variability in your output, or transfer the risk.\n- Marketing — arises due to all the factors that affect your marketing channels such as consumer preferences, weather, government actions, price and currency variability, cost of inputs, limited market outlets, and global economic conditions. The marketing chain is the process of adding value to your product through processing, wholesaling, and retailing. Marketing risk can be mitigated through the development of a robust marketing plan.\n- Financial — refers to the cost and availability of loans, your ability to pay your bills, absorb short term financial shocks (like a wet spring), and maintain and grow your business. Rising interest rates and increasing costs in family living are other sources of financial risk. The use of financial statements and ratios can be helpful in monitoring your farm’s financial status to keep you on top of any potential risks that get thrown your way.\n- Legal — include governments changing laws, regulations, and policies, and any dispute or disagreement between individuals and/or groups. The legal system of laws, courts, and contracts is designed to address these risks. Everything from the way you decide to organize your business (e.g. sole proprietorship, LLC, etc.) to your farmland lease agreement can be potential sources of legal risk. Need legal advice for your farm? Farm Commons out of the Hudson Valley is a great resource to get you started.\n- Human — the uncertainty and imperfection of being human and having relationships that affect the farm or ranch’s success. Some examples include health and well-being, family and business relationships, employee management, and transition/succession planning. Human risk may be the least technical type of risk, but it can be the trickiest to navigate due to the unpredictable nature of human beings. Some ways to mitigate human risk are having employee handbooks and standard operating procedures that lay out expectations and promote health and safety, practicing work-life balance, and doing check-ins and regular meetings where all members of the team are able to share their successes and challenges.\nFor more information on the five types of risk, check out “Introduction to Risk Management: Understanding Agricultural Risks.”\nThis project is funded in partnership by USDA, Risk Management Agency, under award number RM16RMEPP522C020.

It must be undertaken by the entire organization.David Packard of Hewlett-Packard is quoted as saying: “Marketing is far to important to be left to the marketing department.”\n22 Marketing Concepts Production Product Selling Marketing Holistic QualityInnovationCreate, deliver, and communicate valueProductionProductSellingMarketingHolisticMass productionMass distributionUnsought goodsOvercapacityThe five distinct marketing concepts are: Production, Product, Selling, Marketing, and Holistic. These philosophies have evolved over time and began with the production concept. The evolution of a new marketing concept does not mean that all companies are changing. Many companies continue to operate under the production concept.Under a production philosophy the company will seek to mass produce products and to distribute them on a wide scale. The belief is that consumers prefer products that are widely available and inexpensive.The product concept proposes that consumers prefer products that have higher quality, performance, or are more innovative. Often, managers focus too much on the product (a better mousetrap) but this does not always equal success.The selling concept argues that members of a market will not purchase enough product on their own so companies use the “hard-sell” to increase demand. Typically used with unsought goods such as insurance or cemetery plots, or when companies face overcapacity.The marketing concept first emerged in the 1950’s and focuses more on the customer with a “sense-and-respond” attitude. Companies that have embraced the marketing concept have been shown to achieve superior performance than competitors.The holistic concept takes a philosophy that everything matters in marketing. Figure 1.3 (next slide) outlines the Holistic Marketing Concept.\n23 Company Orientations Towards the Marketplace Consumers prefer products that arewidely available and inexpensiveProduction ConceptConsumers favor products thatoffer the most quality, performance,or innovative featuresProduct ConceptConsumers will buy products only ifthe company aggressivelypromotes/sells these productsSelling ConceptFocuses on needs/ wants of targetmarkets & delivering valuebetter than competitorsMarketing Concept\n24 Pemasaran secara keseluruhan (holistic marketing) merupakan ide dimana pemasaran merupakan segalanya, dikatakan bahwa organisasi yang sukses harus memiliki pendekatan secara menyeluruh pada pemasaran dimana semua bagian dari organisasi memfokuskan untuk bagaimana meningkatkan nilai tambah bagi pelanggan dan bagaimana mengkomunikasikan nilai tersebut kepada pelanggannya.\n26 Relationship Marketing Relationship marketing seeks to build mutually beneficial, long-term relationship with key constituents in order to earn and retain their business. The four key constituents are: customers, employees, partners, and member of the financial community. Attracting a new customer can cost five times as much as retaining existing customers so building long-term relationships makes financial sense for the company.Marketing networks consist of the company and its supporting stakeholders who have built a mutually profitable business relationship.Build long-term relationshipsDevelop marketing networks\n27 Integrated Marketing Create, communicate, and deliver customer value Integrated marketing holds that all activities undertaken by the company should create, communicate, and deliver value. Further, all new activities should take into consideration all other marketing activities.\n28 Internal MarketingInternal marketing is the task of hiring, training, and motivating able employees to serve customers well. You can’t promise excellent service if you can’t deliver excellent service.\n29 Performance Marketing Social ResponsibilityMarketers must understand both the financial and nonfinancial returns to a business and society from marketing programs and activities. Financial accountability involves the justification of marketing expenditures in terms of financial returns. But they must also think about the ethical, environmental, legal, and social aspects of their activities.Financial Accountability\n34 Faktor-faktor yang Mempengaruhi Strategi Perusahaan TargetConsumersProductPlacePricePromotionImplementationMarketingPlanningControlAnalysisCompetitorsIntermediariesPublicsSuppliersDemographic-EconomicEnvironmentTechnological-NaturalPolitical-LegalSocial-Cultural\n35 10 dosa pemasaranPerusahaan tidak berfokus pada pasar dan tidak digerakkan oleh pelanggan pada tingkat yang memadaiPerusahaan tidak sepenuhnya memahami pelanggan sasarannyaPerusahaan perlu menentukan dan memantau pesaingnya dengan lebih baikPerusahaan belum mengelola hubungan dengan pemangku kepentingan (stakeholder)nya secara benarPerusahaan kurang lihai dalam menentukan peluang-peluang baruRencana pemasaran dan proses perencanaan perusahaan burukKebijakan-kebijakan produk dan jasa perusahaan memerlukan pengetatanKeahlian komunikasi dan pembangunan merek perusahaan lemahPerusahaan tidak terorganisasi dengan baik untuk menjalankan pemasaran secara efektif dan efisienPerusahaan tidak memaksimalkan pemanfaatan teknologi.\nYour consent to our cookies if you continue to use this website.","BACKGROUND IMAGE: iSTOCK/GETTY IMAGES\nRelationship marketing is a facet of customer relationship management (CRM) that focuses on customer loyalty and long-term customer engagement rather than shorter-term goals like customer acquisition and individual sales. The goal of relationship marketing (or customer relationship marketing) is to create strong, even emotional, customer connections to a brand that can lead to ongoing business, free word-of-mouth promotion and information from customers that can generate leads.\nRelationship marketing stands in contrast to the more traditional transactional marketing approach, which focuses on increasing the number of individual sales. In the transactional model, the return on customer acquisition cost may be insufficient. A customer may be convinced to select that brand one time, but without a strong relationship marketing strategy, the customer may not come back to that brand in the future. While organizations combine elements of both relationship and transactional marketing, customer relationship marketing is starting to play a more important role for many companies.\nImportance of relationship marketing\nAcquiring new customers can be challenging and costly. Relationship marketing helps retain customers over the long term, which results in customer loyalty rather than customers purchase once or infrequently.\nRelationship marketing is important for its ability to stay in close contact with customers. By understanding how customers use a brand’s products and services and observing additional unmet needs, brands can create new features and offerings to meet those needs, further strengthening the relationship.\nImplementing a relationship marketing strategy\nRelationship marketing is based on the tenets of customer experience management (CEM), which focuses on improving customer interactions to foster better brand loyalty. While these interactions can still occur in person or over the phone, much of relationship marketing and CEM has taken to the Web.\nWith the abundance of information on the Web and flourishing use of social media, most consumers expect to have easy, tailored access to details about a brand and even expect the opportunity to influence products and services via social media posts and online reviews. Today, relationship marketing involves creating easy two-way communication between customers and the business, tracking customer activities and providing tailored information to customers based on those activities.\nFor example, an e-commerce site might track a customer's activity by allowing them to create a user profile so that their information is conveniently saved for future visits, and so that the site can push more tailored information to them next time. Site visitors might also be able to sign in through Facebook or another social media channel, allowing them a simpler user experience and automatically connecting them to the brand's social media presence.\nThis is where CRM and marketing automation software can support a relationship marketing strategy by making it easier to record, track and act on customer information. Social CRM tools go further by helping to extend relationship marketing into the social media sphere, allowing companies to more easily monitor and respond to customer issues on social media channels, which in turn helps maintain a better brand image.\nBenefits of relationship marketing\nBenefits of relationship marketing include:\n- Higher customer lifetime value (CLV). Relationship marketing creates loyal customers, which leads to repeat purchases and a higher CLV. In addition, loyal customers are likely to become brand advocates or ambassadors, recommending products and services to friends, family and business associates.\n- Reduction in marketing and advertising spend. Spending on marketing and advertising to acquire new customers can be expensive. Relationship marketing causes customers to do the marketing for a brand, in what’s called buzz marketing. Customers tell others about a brand’s products and services, which can drive sales. Brands with exceptional relationship marketing programs spend little to no money on marketing or advertising.\n- Stronger organizational alignment around the customer. Organizations that emphasize relationship marketing have a stronger organizational alignment around an exceptional customer experience. The teams work together to create satisfied and happy customers over the long term.\nExamples of relationship marketing\nThere are several types of activities brands can use to facilitate relationship marketing, including:\n- Provide exceptional customer service, as customers who are consistently impressed by a brand’s customer service are more likely to remain loyal to the brand.\n- Thank customers through a social media post or with a surprise gift card.\n- Solicit customer feedback through surveys, polls and phone calls, which can create a positive impression that customer opinions are valued and help to create better products and services.\n- Launch a loyalty program that rewards customers for their continued patronage.\n- Hold customer events to connect with customers and build a community.\n- Create customer advocacy or brand advocacy programs to reward customers who provide word-of-mouth advertising on a brand’s behalf.\n- Offer discounts or bonuses to long-time or repeat customers.\nHow to use CRM as part of your customer engagement strategy"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e6173b4f-359a-43c8-993b-e308d1b5e34a>","<urn:uuid:946bd33f-5601-4f37-88bd-0c8e212ee0e2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does positioning play in both criterium racing and classroom reading success?","answer":"In criterium racing, positioning is crucial - riders must stay near the front of the pack (within top 10 wheels) to respond to accelerations and avoid getting boxed in. Similarly, in classroom reading, strategic positioning is important but in a different way - students need to be positioned in an environment that allows for independent reading time, with access to appropriate books and opportunities for discussion through venues like book clubs and literature circles. Both contexts emphasize the importance of being in the right place - physically for racers and environmentally for readers - to achieve optimal results.","context":["Teacher to Teacher: Independent Reading – What should I read next?\nBy Lynne R. Dorfman\nStudents in all grade levels are always asking, “What should I read next?’ It’s an important question because you want your students to continue to find books that they can read independently – inside and outside of school. In Readicide author Kelly Gallagher talks about McQuillan’s study of reluctant readers (2001). It that showed a statistically significant gain in reading and writing fluency and writing complexity with students who had had a negative attitude towards reading at the beginning of the year, but at the semester’s end had improved significantly after having finished several books on their own. How did this happen? The students were given time to read books of their choosing in school without having to complete a book report, track points, or fill in a worksheet.\nCsikszentmihalyi (1990) talked about reading flow – where students can get lost in the pages of a book and achieve true pleasure in the act of reading for reading’s sake without the promise of extrinsic rewards or grades. If we want our students to achieve this state of reading flow, then we have to help them find books that are interesting and inviting to them. We must provide the time and space for them to read in school before we can hope that they will read outside of school. Often, we find our busy schedules do not allow much time to consider the question, “What shall I read next?’ We find that even during a library special, we hurry from the room lined with inviting books just waiting for a recommendation (“Pick me! You’ll find adventure here!) to use the prep period to record reading, math, and writing data on the schoolwide system or respond to a parent’s phone call or e-mail. There is always so much to do, and yet….\nPerhaps you can try to answer the question about what book to read next with another question. Ask your student to think about why he liked the last book he finished. Was it a mystery or fantasy or a book about animals? Did he like the way the author told the story? Was he drawn to the subject matter or the illustrations throughout the book? Tempt students with a beautiful poetry book like National Geographic’s Book of Nature Poetry. For YA readers – was it a dystopian novel or a Steampunk novel such as Heart of Veridon by Tim Akers or Cold Magic by Kate Elliott. Is your teenager looking for books about teen anxieties and the discomfort of free choice/will? Perhaps Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson or The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chobsky or Grasshopper Jungle by Andrew Smith will be a good fit.\nText sets are always a powerful way to engage students in discussion, using vehicles such as book clubs, literature circles, book talks, and book reviews. Since these books can offer classroom opportunities for individual, small group, and extended learning, multiple copies (at least two or three) make reading a book even more inviting. it is a good idea to write a short blurb on a sticky note and place inside on the end pages. “This book is for you if you enjoy reading,,,,” Students can preview books and post an invitation to read a particular book on a bulletin board. In this way, students naturally create a response partner(s). And encourage rereads! Students of all ages and stages benefit from a second read of a beloved book.\nFinally, we need to really, truly believe that allowing students to read independently in school will not only lead to more reading outside of school; it will serve as test preparation, too. Independent reads build vocabulary and content knowledge as well as the stamina and endurance to read lengthy passages on PSSA tests and the Keystone exam. The most powerful strategy we have to build lifelong readers is to provide the time for reading daily within our classroom walls. Here are some things we can all do:\n- Visit your school and local library and browse.\n- Talk with librarians to find out what is new, exciting, and available to your students. Follow book recommendations on twitter.\n- Read reviews on Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and the NY Times Book Review.\n- Talk with your colleagues.\n- Then talk with your students about good books – all kinds of good books just waiting for someone to pick them up and remain in what Nancie Atwell refers to as “the reading zone” – a place where readers are submerged in a text until they must “come up for air.’\nLynne R.

You’re slightly nervous but you’re feeling focused and ready to dig deep. Your odds of winning are perhaps 1 in 50 racers, so how do you gain an edge on the competition? Assuming you’ve put in the training hours and your equipment and hydration are dialed, it’s time to put it all out there and demand the best from body and mind.\nWinning a criterium requires proper preparation, vigilant positioning tactics, keen attention to energy conservation, and a smart finishing strategy. While fitness is important, it’s the racer with the optimal combination of strong legs and smart tactics who will almost always win the race. Follow these race-day tips to boost your crit performance and take your racing to the next level.\nYour race preparation starts before you arrive at the course. Course and racer knowledge will help you prepare mentally for the race. Of course, a good warm up will get your legs and lungs ready for the effort.\nKnow the Course and Competition\nPrior to racing an event, be sure to mentally prepare yourself by researching the race course and competition. Understand the race route, road conditions, weather including wind direction, and take a look at the registration list to assess your competition.\nGet in a Good Warm Up\nAs a general rule of thumb, the shorter the race, the longer the warm up should be. Crits are full gas from the start, so it’s important to prepare your mind and body with a focused warm up that gradually increases intensity and lifts your heart rate to threshold. The increased blood flow, increased muscle temperature, dilated blood vessels, and increased acidity in the body will prepare you for the high intensity of crit racing.\nSample Race Warm Up: 25 to 45 minutes\n10 to 20 minutes: Spin at Zone 1/2 heart rate (50 to 75 percent FTP). Aim for 90 rpm\n3 minutes: Zone 3/4 heart rate (76 to 105 percent FTP)\n5 minutes: Zone 2 heart rate (56 to 75 percent FTP)\n3 x 25 to 45 second accelerations (up to 150 percent FTP). Rest 20 seconds between efforts. Spin up to 120 rpm.\n5 to 10 minutes: Zone 1/2 heart rate (50 to 75 percent FTP).\nDuring your warm up, visualize your race strategy and mentally prepare.\nPositioning is Key\nNo matter how big or small your field is, being in the right place can make a big difference in your race. From the start to the finish, being aware of where you are and what is happening around you will help you ride more efficiently.\nLine Up Early and at the Front\nArrive at the start line at least 10 minutes early and upwards of 40 minutes early for larger races. By starting at the front of the race, you can avoid wasting energy trying to navigate through the pack and evade obstacles like stalled riders. Offer yourself a confidence boost and tell yourself you are a contender who belongs at the front.\nIf You’re Not Moving Forward, You’re Moving Backward\nMaintaining your position in the pack requires you to continually scan for opportunities to move forward in ways that require the least amount of energy. If you lose focus, you will quickly find yourself at the back of the pack being subjected to surges and decelerations producing a yo-yo effect that will quickly burn up your legs and expose you to potential crashes.\nDon’t be Afraid to Ride Near the Front\nWhile there may be more wind protection toward the back of the peloton, if you are riding without many teammates, it’s important to maintain your position toward the front of the pack but not at the front in the wind. Aim to stay within the top 10 wheels. This will allow you to quickly respond to accelerations and attacks, help you avoid getting boxed in, and allow you to conserve energy through avoiding sharp decelerations.\nConserve Your Energy\nPutting out your energy when it matters the most is an important component to having a successful race. Saving your energy for the critical moments will allow you to make it into the winning break, or take the sprint to the finish.\nDon't Show Off\nWhile it may fuel your ego to show off your fitness and ride in the wind, it’s important to be calculated with your efforts and save your energy for when it really matters. The best crit racers are always assessing which actions are improving their odds of winning and which actions are decreasing their chances. Always have a reason for what you’re doing.\nSurf Wheels and Lay off Your Brakes\nConserve your energy by paying attention to drafting and wind direction, following wheels to move up wherever possible, cornering smoothly, and learning how to modulate your accelerations and decelerations without touching the brakes.\nDetermine the Fastest Way Around the Course\nEvery lap is a learning opportunity. Practice riding the course in various positions to find which route is fastest for you. Identify which lines will allow you to conserve the most amount of energy and offer you the best chances at winning.\nYour Finishing Strategy\nKnowing your strengths and weaknesses will help you determine your overall best strategy for a win. However, you also need to dial in your strategy during the race. There are a few things you can do in the race to help you determine exactly what to do.\nPractice Your Finish\nPrime laps give you a chance to suss out the competition, identify how you’re feeling and play out your last-lap strategy. Take advantage of prime laps to gauge a successful last-lap strategy.\nAnticipate Accelerations and the Swarm\nIf the field slows in the last lap, it’s easy to get overtaken by riders behind you and lose your position. Listen, keep your eyes scanning, and anticipate which side of the road the inevitable accelerations will come from. Before it comes, start spinning up your gear to quickly hop on and move in on the incoming train.\nOne Lap to Go\nDuring the final lap of a race it’s essential to maintain your position. Depending on the course and final 500 meters of the race, you will likely need to position yourself in the top five or so wheels when the bell rings. Know your strengths and weaknesses to determine which strategy will provide you with the highest odds of winning. A winning strategy is one that requires both disciplined patience and unshakeable decisiveness. Stay focused, keep breathing, and never give up.\nThe next time you toe the start of a criterium, keep these tips in your arsenal and unleash your best performance yet. Trust your abilities and remind yourself that you have what it takes to be a contender. Every race is a learning experience and an opportunity to elevate your cycling prowess. Build on each experience and enjoy the process of becoming a better racer along the way."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b9116f47-1b35-4bba-9689-a0d277d2c6a4>","<urn:uuid:382ea3b0-80ca-44b6-86bc-fa9b34eaa1d8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role did civil rights advocacy play in Lamont's career, and how does this compare to modern scientific advocacy for protecting historical documents?","answer":"Lamont was a strong civil rights advocate who served as director of the ACLU from 1932-1954, fought against McCarthy-era Communist hysteria, and won court cases against government agencies for unlawful surveillance. Similarly, modern scientists like Rabin and Hahn advocate for the protection of historical documents by challenging institutional authorities, specifically criticizing the Israel Antiquities Authority and Israel Museum's handling of the Dead Sea Scrolls through peer-reviewed publications and calling for better conservation standards.","context":["Corliss Lamont (1902 – 1995) was born into wealth but spent his life fighting for people who weren’t wealthy. He fought and won battles over civil rights and added his voice to the Humanist consensus. He authored the seminal introductory book about Humanism titled “The Philosophy of Humanism” in 1949, which at the time of his death, was in its eighth edition. He didn’t just talk about Humanism, he lived the philosophy.\nLamont served as director of the American Civil Liberties Union from 1932 to 1954. Lamont’s politics was firmly on the left and as the Communist hysteria took over this country after World War II, he fought for basic civil rights for us all. He stood up to Senator Joseph McCarthy and later won court cases against the Postmaster General, FBI, and CIA for their unlawful surveillance. Lamont was a fighter for rights and he asked us all to do the same:\n“My final word is that in the battles that confront us today for America’s freedom and welfare, our chief aim as public-spirited citizens must be neither to avoid trouble, nor to stay out of jail, nor even to preserve our lives, but to keep on fighting for our fundamental principles and ideals.”\n– from his memoirs, “Yes to Life” rev. edition (1991)\nIt was Humanism that Corliss Lamont should also be known for. He started to be outspoken about Humanism in the 1940’s. He joined the American Humanist Association in 1941. He also served as President, was one of the original signers of Humanist Manifesto II and received the Humanist of the Year Award in 1971. Not to mention the thousands of published words he wrote in support of Humanism including the book “The Philosophy of Humanism”:\nTo define twentieth-century humanism briefly, I would say that it is a philosophy of joyous service for the greater good of all humanity in this natural world and advocating the methods of reason, science, and democracy. While this statement has many profound implications, it is not difficult to grasp. Humanism in general is not a way of thinking merely for professional philosophers, but is also a credo for average men and women seeking to lead happy and useful lives.\nI also think his essay “The Affirmative Ethics of Humanism” is timeless because in this time of current battles with overtly religious behavior in the military, this seems all too familiar:\nThe greatest difference between the Humanist ethic and that of Christianity and the traditional religions is that it is entirely based on happiness in this one and only life and not concerned with a realm of supernatural immortality and the glory of God. Humanism denies the philosophical and psychological dualism of soul and body and contends that a human being is a oneness of mind, personality, and physical organism. Christian insistence on the resurrection of the body and personal immortality has often cut the nerve of effective action here and now, and has led to the neglect of present human welfare and happiness.\nThus, Monsignor William T. Greene, a Catholic prelate in the United States, stated in reference to the Korean War of 1950-1953, that “death in battle was part of God’s plan for populating the kingdom of heaven.” And a captain in the US Army wrote me, in criticism of my book, The Illusion of Immortality, that it could ruin the morale of our soldiers by taking away their belief in an afterlife. “We in the Army,” he said, “regard death as no more important than a nosebleed.” Such apologies for international war are, in my opinion, downright immoral.\nMore information about Corliss Lamont, including many of his writings including “The Philosophy of Humanism” as a PDF file, is available at:\nSome time ago I wrote a post highlighting Lamont’s 10 Points of Humanism. I find the list useful for people wanting to know what Humanism is about.","Dead Sea Scrolls – Scientists In Berlin Criticize Israeli Cultural Authorities For Treatment Of Sacred Documents\nLast week, a peer-reviewed journal called the Restaurator published a controversial article about the Dead Sea Scrolls written by two Berlin-based scientists who charge that these sacred documents are not receiving proper care from the Israeli cultural institutions responsible for their well-being.\nThe article’s abstract does not mince words:\n“Examination of the properties of the scrolls proves that frequent travel, exhibitions and the associated handling induce collagen deterioration that is covered up by the absence of a proper monitoring program.”\n“I want the scrolls to be protected,” says Ira Rabin, who co-authored the piece entitled “Dead Sea Scrolls Exhibitions Around The World: Reasons For Concern” with her colleague Oliver Hahn at the German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing.\nThe 20-page document specifically criticizes the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, who hold responsibility for a majority of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Both defend their treatment of the scrolls (detailed below).\nBut first, the criticisms. Rabin and Hahn argue in the Restaurator that:\n1. The Dead Sea Scrolls are being exhibited far too much, and that the consequent travel and handling is seriously accelerating their degradation. The authors show that there’s been a substantial increase in international exhibitions in the past two decades.\n2. No scientifically sophisticated system is yet in place to monitor the degradation state of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The authors argue that all exhibitions should be stopped until a rigorous analytical monitoring system is established and can prove that the frequent traveling is not unduly exacerbating the fragile state of these documents.\n3. Current strategies to conserve the scrolls may, in some cases, be worsening their state. In particular the authors take issue with the reinforcement of the scrolls with Japanese tissue paper. This process requires the use of an adhesive called methyl cellulose.\nRabin and Hahn argue that use of the adhesive brings the scrolls in contact with unnecessary moisture. They say this wetness is causing collagen in the animal skin parchment to unravel irreversibly from its triple helix formation into an amorphous gelatin. They include an image of this gelatinization to make their point.\nThe article’s first author, Rabin, worked as a consultant at the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) from 2005-2006. From multiple accounts, Rabin and the IAA did not part on congenial terms. In 2007, Rabin received a letter from the IAA’s lawyers (seen by Artful Science) threatening legal action if she presented work from her time at the IAA at a conference or in a publication, based on an employment contract she had once signed.\nAs such, the criticism in the current Restaurator article is based on publically available information, the authors’ research on Dead Sea Scrolls from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem (some of which underwent conservation treatments at the IAA), and the authors’ research on a Dead Sea Scroll collection housed at the University of Manchester. The Manchester collection contains small fragments of the scrolls that don’t go on tour and are primarily used for research purposes, Rabin says.\nIn the past year, Rabin and Hahn have also published two scientific papers (here and here) on their Dead Sea Scroll research at Manchester. (They are developing an X-ray fluorescence technique to help resolve a long standing debate about where and how the scrolls were produced.)\nAnd now the responses:\nThe Israel Museum’s press officer sent a short email noting that the organization’s curators and conservators “adopt the best available tools to ensure the safekeeping of these works” and “ascribe to the highest standards” but she did not provide any further explanation about the tools or the standards. She also noted that the scrolls’ condition is “assessed on an ongoing basis” and that they are only allowed to travel “when the Museum can be satisfied regarding the conditions for transport, handling, and display.” No specifics were given.\nIn a phone conversation, the IAA’s head scroll conservator, Pnina Shor, said that the IAA’s conservation strategies were developed in collaboration with the Library of Congress and the Getty Conservation Institute. She also defended the exhibitions. When the scrolls are on the road, Shor said the IAA ensures that “the environmental conditions in display cases are exactly the same as the conditions in the vault” except for the amount of illumination the scrolls get.\nMuseums spend a lot of effort evaluating what acceptable light levels are, given that light damage is a prime culprit in the destruction of many kinds of art and artifacts, from Van Gogh pigments to plastic sculptures.\nShor said that the IAA has set a maximum amount of illumination the scrolls can receive to 15,000 lux per year. “The scrolls are made of organic material [animal skin]. We know they deteriorate no matter what we do or do not do. It is part of our duty to both ensure the safety of our heritage and to share it with the public.”\nShe acknowledged that an analytical monitoring system that could systematically evaluate degradation was not yet in place. However she pointed out that the IAA is working on a high tech multispectral imaging system, with collaborator Greg Bearman who has developed similar systems for NASA’s jet propulsion lab.\nLast year Bearman, Shor and their colleagues published two proof-of-principle articles (here and here) about how the monitoring system might work. The articles showed data for artificially-aged parchments, but not the Dead Sea Scrolls. Rabin and Hahn criticize the technique in the Restaurator article, saying that they don’t think it is going to work for the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nBearman told Artful Science in an email that Rabin and Hahn don’t fully understand the technique being developed and he added that his team has been collecting data on the scrolls for eight months. He also noted that experiments are ongoing this summer but he did not know when they would be publishing the results. He added that the team was also considering a whole battery of other analytical techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy.\nPresented with this rebuttal, Rabin responded that she’ll need to see a peer-reviewed article that shows a monitoring technique that works on the Dead Sea Scrolls before she’ll be convinced. She added that even if a fully functioning monitoring system is on the horizon, the scrolls should not be traveling until such a watchdog system is in place.\nAs for the article’s third point, that using Japanese tissue paper and methyl cellulose to reinforce the fragile scrolls is causing harm in some cases: The IAA’s Shor pointed out that this is a well-accepted strategy in the document conservation world, citing the Library of Congress as an institution that uses the method.\nIrene Brückle, an editor of the Restaurator who has written books on document conservation, said the Japanese tissue technique is indeed industry standard, but she also added that there’s no one-size-fits-all strategy for document conservation. Decisions are often made on a case-by-case basis.\nThe current controversy is actually just one of many that have swarmed around the scrolls. Discovered by nomads in desert caves starting from 1947, the Dead Sea Scrolls then found themselves in a new humid environment that kick-started their degradation.\nIll-fated conservation strategies of the 1950s and 60s only made things worse. As the IAA’s Shor has written:\n- The scrolls were at first unknowingly handled inappropriately and kept in an uncontrolled environment. Moreover, in the first years, adhesive tape used to join fragments and seal cracks caused irreversible damage. The scrolls were then moistened and flattened loosely between plates of window glass and sealed with adhesive tape. The ageing of the adhesives and the pressure of the glass caused the skins to darken – to the extent that some of the texts are no longer legible – and the edges to gelatinize.\nConservators started the herculean task of removing the tape in the 1970s and by 1991 they were placed in a climate-controlled storeroom. Conservators also began reinforcing the scrolls with various strategies, including with Japanese tissue paper. And then, as the Restaurator article points out, exhibitions of the scrolls increased substantially.\nIn the end, the current debate boils down to the precautionary principle. Rabin and Hahn think all exhibitions should be stopped until it can be scientifically proven that the traveling isn’t further harming the scrolls. The IAA and Israel Museum says they have the situation under control and that the benefits of exhibition outweigh the possible risks.\nAs it always does, time will tell which approach is wisest."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a1e7d6ff-55b1-453e-a6f7-2b39d5454107>","<urn:uuid:80570ddf-0cd7-4d77-b63c-9f4362b421db>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the similarities and differences in how the Airbus A330 and A300-600 crews handled their respective mechanical issues regarding cockpit communication and emergency procedures?","answer":"The A300-600 crew demonstrated clear communication and procedural compliance - the first officer reported the oil filter warning to the commander, they jointly consulted emergency procedures, and kept all parties (ATC, cabin crew, passengers) informed throughout the incident. In contrast, the Air France A330 crew showed signs of confusion and poor coordination - while they identified the speed sensor issue ('we've lost the speeds'), they failed to effectively diagnose and respond to the situation together. The captain was initially absent on a rest break, and when he returned 90 seconds into the emergency, there are no clear indications of his actions or communication with the co-pilots. Both incidents began with mechanical issues, but the A300-600's disciplined crew coordination led to a safe outcome, while the A330's crew's confusion and poor communication contributed to the accident.","context":["|Title:||Oil filter clog, Airbus A300-600, N70072|\n|Micro summary:||Oil filter clog light illuminated on climb, triggering diversion.|\n|Event Time:||1998-07-09 at 1145 UTC|\n|Publishing Agency:||Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB)|\n|Publishing Country:||United Kingdom|\n|Site of event:||Climb|\n|Departure:||London Heathrow Airport, London, England, United Kingdom|\n|Destination:||General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts, USA|\n|Airplane Type(s):||Airbus A300-600|\n|Type of flight:||Revenue|\n|Executive Summary:||The crew were operating a scheduled flight from London Heathrow (LHR) Airport to Logan International Airport, Boston, USA; the weather was good with a light south westerly surface wind for take off. There were no significant defects in the technical log and the aircraft appeared fully serviceable during the external and pre-start checks. Both engine starts were normal and the commander taxied out to Runway 27 Left. He was the handling pilot for the sector and used reduced power for a normal take off at 1137 hrs. |\nEverything appeared serviceable during the take off and initial climb but, as the aircraft climbed through Flight Level (FL) 100, the first officer saw the right 'Oil Filter Clog' caution light illuminate and reported this fact to the commander. Initially, the light flickered on and off, as did the indication on the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). However, after a short time, both the 'Oil Filter Clog' light and the ECAM indication remained on and steady. The crew checked the other engine indications but they were all normal; additionally, there were no asymmetric handling indications and no abnormal vibration. With clearance from ATC, the commander levelled N70072 at FL 150. Then, with the caution still indicating, the commander instructed the first officer to action the appropriate emergency drills. Initially, this required the No 2 throttle to be retarded to a position at which the caution light would go out. However, with the throttle at idle the light continually flickered on and off. Then, after 3 minutes at idle, the 'Oil Filter Clog' light was on and steady and the commander, in accordance with the emergency drills and in consultation with the first officer, decided to shutdown No 2 engine. With the commander retaining handling duties, the first officer actioned the appropriate drills.\nAfter the drill was completed, the crew declared an emergency to ATC and stated that they wished to return to LHR; they were given full co-operation by ATC. Then, with the aircraft established back towards LHR, the commander briefed the purser on the situation and of his intentions, and informed the passengers. The recovery was uneventful and the aircraft landed on Runway 27 Right at LHR at 1230 hrs. The LHR emergency vehicles had been alerted by ATC and had pre-positioned on the taxiway adjacent to the western end of the runway.\nThe aircraft weight on landing was 368,000 lb and the crew used a configuration of Slat 15/ Flap 20 with a Vref speed of 166 kt. Normal maximum landing weight is 308,700 lb but, with no fuel jettison system, overweight landings are permitted in an emergency at any weight within the maximum take-off weight of 378,590 lb. For the landing, the crew had preselected the autobrakes to the 'LO' setting, thereby selecting a deceleration rate of 1.7 m/sec2. The crew assessed the touchdown as smooth, at less than 300 feet/min rate of descent and within 1,500 feet of the threshold; speed on touchdown was approximately 165 kt and the surface wind was reported as 240°/13 kt. On the ground, the first officer confirmed that the spoilers had deployed and the commander selected medium reverse thrust on the left engine. The crew recalled that the autobrake had disconnected following the commander's use of manual brake during the ground roll and the first officer then selected 'Brake Fans'. Neither crew member considered the retardation as excessive and, although the commander was confident that he could have turned the aircraft off the runway early, he allowed it to roll to the last exit. As N70072 was turned off the runway, ATC advised the crew that there were no visible problems and transferred them to the Airport Fire Service (AFS) frequency; as they cleared the runway, the crew noted that the left brake temperatures were normal but that all four right brake temperatures were indicating at the gauge maximum of 700°C.\nOnce clear of the runway, the crew brought the aircraft to a halt, established contact with the AFS and informed the fire officer of the brake temperature indications. The fire officer confirmed that there was smoke coming from the right main landing gear area and asked the commander to keep N70072 stopped and to shut down the left engine to allow the AFS unhindered access to the aircraft. Shortly afterwards, the fire officer reported to the crew that there was a small fire in the area of the right gear but that it was under control. The commander confirmed with him that there was no need to evacuate but then briefed the purser and asked her to be prepared to react quickly if the situation changed. Thereafter, the flight crew maintained a close liaison with the AFS and the cabin crew. The AFS used water to cool the brakes and stayed in attendance until the passengers had disembarked normally through door 4L using portable steps.\n|Learning Keywords:||Operations - Evacuation|\n|Operations - Maintenance|\n|Systems - Brake/Tire/Wheel Well Fire|\n|Systems - Engine - Contained Engine Failure|\n|Systems - Landing Gear|\nAccident Reports on DVD, Copyright © 2006 by Flight Simulation Systems, LLC.

Without accurate speed information, the autopilot disconnected and probably left the pilots confused. But that does not explain the puzzling decision by the co-pilot at the controls to climb from 35,000 feet to 38,000 feet, aviation safety experts say.\n\"It's just such a tragedy,\" says John Cox, an aviation safety consultant and former airline pilot. \"They don't understand what's going on. The idea that they pulled back and climbed that 3,000 feet — I just shake my head. I'm hard-pressed to understand it.\"\nAs a result of the abrupt climb, the jet stalled. It then fell like a leaf, its wings rocking back and forth, plummeting at speeds of more than 100 mph, according to the jet's flight data recorder.\nA stall has nothing to do with a jet's engines, which the BEA said were operating normally. It occurs when the wings no longer produce enough lift to keep a plane aloft. Stalls are triggered by slow speeds or when a plane's nose is too high.\nThe French Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses, or BEA, the nation's aviation accident investigation agency, did not rule on the cause of the crash, but the data released point to confusion over misleading speed indications and the failure of the pilots to respond correctly to a stall. Based on earlier information released by the BEA, investigators believe that the jet's speed sensors became iced over and inaccurate.\n\"So, we've lost the speeds,\" one of the pilots said 11 seconds after the problem began. The comment, from the jet's cockpit voice recorder, was apparently translated from French to English by the BEA.\nThe information released by the BEA is the first comprehensive account of the accident and was made possible by the discovery of the jet's wreckage earlier this year at 12,800 feet beneath the ocean. Both of the jet's crash-proof recorders were retrieved and operated flawlessly despite spending nearly two years at such depths, the BEA said.\nThe ordeal began about 10 minutes after Capt. Marc Dubois announced he was taking a rest break, a routine pilots follow on lengthy overseas flights. A spare co-pilot, David Robert, was summoned to the cockpit to take the captain's place.\nAnother co-pilot who was flying the plane, Pierre-Cedric Bonin, ordered a slight left turn to avoid storms that they had spotted ahead and warned flight attendants that they were about to fly into turbulent air.\nTwo minutes after that, the emergency began abruptly when the autopilot shut itself off. \"I have the controls,\" Bonin said.\nAlmost immediately, the pilot pulled the jet into a climb. There was no indication in the data released by BEA why the pilot would want to climb.\nIf pilots lose accurate speed information, they are taught to fly level and maintain the same power setting until they can diagnose the problem. In several other cases, A330 jets lost accurate airspeed information and pilots flew until speed indications returned to normal, typically after a short period.\nOn the Air France jet, the speed information became accurate within less than a minute, well before the jet crashed, the BEA said.\nAnother puzzling aspect of the accident is why the pilot continued to try to pull up the nose of the jet, Cox and others said. For almost the entire plunge, the pilots kept pulling back on the joy stick that controls the plane, keeping the nose too high for the plane to fly.\nThe correct response to a stall is to do the opposite: lower the nose to increase speed and the flow of air over the wings.\nThe captain returned to the cockpit about 90 seconds after the emergency began, but there is no indication in the preliminary report what he said or what actions he took.\nMore than two minutes into the emergency the pilots briefly lowered the nose and the forward speed of the jet increased, the BEA said. But the nose did not come down enough to halt the stall and the pilots continued pulling the nose up.\nPoor reactions to stalls are a common safety problem and have been linked to dozens of crashes around the world.\nThe pilots of Colgan Air Flight 3407, which crashed near Buffalo on Feb. 12, 2009, killing 50 people, also mishandled a stall, the National Transportation Safety Board ruled. The captain on that flight, reacting to a different type of emergency, also inexplicably yanked the plane into a steep climb and then did not respond correctly to the plane's stall warning system.\nIn another sign of the confusion in the Air France cockpit, the pilots reduced the jet engine power to idle even as they desperately needed to increase their speed, the BEA said.\nThe last recorded measurement shows the plane plummeting at 10,912 feet per minute — 124 mph.\nThough the actions of the pilots appear to have triggered the stall, it is too early to parcel out blame, said Michael Barr , an instructor at the Aviation Safety and Security Program at the University of Southern California.\nThe pilot would have faced a confusing array of flashing lights, warning horns and text alerts, Barr said. \"If I was doing the investigation, I would ask how many times he was in the simulator with a loss of airspeed,\" he said.\nThe BEA may also be looking at aspects of the Airbus jet's design that could have deepened the confusion.\nFor example, Airbus designs its stall warning system to stop sounding if a jet's forward speed goes below 69 mph. As a result, the stall warning stopped for an unspecified time during the Air France jet's plunge, the BEA said. The stall warning started again during the pilots' fleeting attempt to lower the nose."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ace05475-f51a-44a2-a4f7-f1c498c78ab1>","<urn:uuid:9f3595cf-417b-4725-a25c-696e54cf1036>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do wide bandpass filters and the bandpass filter used in the de-essing circuit differ in their design approach and purpose? Could you elaborate on their specific applications and characteristics?","answer":"Wide bandpass filters and the bandpass filter used in the de-essing circuit have distinct designs and purposes. Wide bandpass filters are created by cascading high-pass and low-pass sections, with their order determined by the combination of these sections. For instance, a ±20 dB/decade bandpass filter combines first-order high-pass and low-pass filters. In contrast, the bandpass filter in the de-essing circuit is specifically contoured to simulate the equal-loudness sensitivity of the human ear at 70 phon, working in conjunction with an RMS detector to process audio signals. The wide bandpass filter is characterized by a Q factor less than 10 and focuses on passing signals within specific frequency bands while attenuating others. The de-essing circuit's bandpass filter, however, is specialized for audio processing, particularly for detecting and controlling sibilant sounds in combination with high-frequency enhancement.","context":["US 5574791 A\nTwo level detectors with logarithmic outputs receive an input audio signal. The first level detector receives the signal through a high-pass filter while the second level detector receives the signal through a band-pass filter contoured to simulate the equal-loudness curves of the human ear. The difference between the detectors' outputs (representing the log of the ratio of their respective input levels) is processed to provide quick broadband gain reduction whenever the ratio exceeds a preset threshold, providing de-essing. The difference is further smoothed and then applied to a voltage-controlled high-pass filter that provides high-frequency boost, the amount of which is controlled by the relative high frequency power contained within the input signal. This voltage-controlled high-pass filter applies automatic, program-adaptive equalization to the input signal.\n1. In a de-essing circuit where two level detectors are used to provide a first signal representative of the logarithmic ratio between high frequency power in an input signal and the loudness-contoured power and where the signal is used with a DC level to control a first voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) to reduce sibilant sounds, an improvement to provide high frequency enhancement comprising:\na non-linear low-pass filter coupled to receive the first signal;\na second VCA controlled by an output signal from the non-linear low-pass filter;\na high pass filter coupled to receive the input signal, an output of the high pass filter being coupled to an input of the second VCA;\na combiner, coupled to receive the input signal and an output signal from the second VCA;\na control to control the amount of the input from the second VCA that is fed to the combiner; and,\nwherein the first and the second VCAs have the same gain characteristics and wherein an attenuator attenuates the output signal from the non-linear low pass filter before it controls the second VCA.\n2.

The apparatus defined by claim 4 wherein the high pass filter receives the input audio signal at an output of the first VCA.\nA combined de-esser circuit and high frequency enhancer circuit is described. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific circuit components, to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the present invention can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits are set forth in block diagram form in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.\nReferring to FIG. 1, the circuit receives a signal to be de-essed and enhanced on line 100. The signal on line 100 is applied through high-pass filter 110 to a first r.m.s. (root-mean-square) level detector 150, and through band-pass filter 120 to second r.m.s. detector 160. The shape of the band-pass filter 120 approximates the equal-loudness sensitivity of the human ear at a level of 70 phon. (R.M.S. detectors' outputs are proportional to the exponentially-weighted average power at their inputs.) Both r.m.s. detectors can be type uPC1253H2, manufactured by THAT Corporation.\nDifferencing means 190 receives the outputs of r.m.s. detectors 150 and 160 on lines 170 and 180, respectively, and applies the difference signal (line 190) to rectifier 220 and timing circuit 240. Circuit 240 is a non-linear low-pass filter that has a very long time constant for signals with small envelope variations and a much shorter time constant for signals with larger envelope variations.\nDe-esser threshold control 250 generates a DC reference offset on line 340. This signal is summed with the rectified signal on line 190 in rectifier 220. This DC offset determines the signal level that will first cause the output of rectifier 220 to produce an output on line 210. The gain-control input of VCA 200 is coupled to line 210. The signal on line 210 is constant unless the level on line 190 exceeds the threshold level set by de-esser threshold control 250. If the level on line 190 exceeds this threshold level, the signal on line 210 changes to produce gain reduction in VCA 200. This gain reduction causes a reduction in the level of \"ess\" sounds.\nThe appropriate attack and release times for the de-essing function are quite fast (attack≈1 millisecond and release≈30 milliseconds). These time constants are determined by the time constants of the level detectors 150 and 160. However, the best-sounding time constants for the high-frequency enhancement function are much slower. Further, the high-frequency enhancement function sounds best when it causes no obvious modulation of the channel frequency response. This implies that the control signal deciding the amount of high-frequency enhancement must be very well smoothed, and must not respond to very small changes in the relative high frequency power content of the input signal. Timing circuit 240 performs this smoothing function.\nReferring to FIG. 2, resistor 400 receives the input signal to be smoothed (from line 190). Resistor 400 is connected to a parallel combination of two diodes 410 and 420, and resistor 430. The far side of this parallel combination drives capacitor 440. In the preferred embodiment, resistor 400 is 330 kΩ, resistor 430 is 22 MΩ, capacitor 440 is 47 nanofarads, and diodes 410 and 420 are IN4148.\nIf the variation in the envelope of the signal on line 190 is small, capacitor 440 charges slowly through the series combination of resistors 400 and 430 because the diodes' turn-on threshold (approximately 600 mV) is not exceeded. If the variation in the envelope of the signal on line 190 is large enough to turn on the diodes, then capacitor 440 charges much more quickly, with a rate set mainly by resistor 400. Because the current vs. voltage characteristic of the diodes is, in fact, approximately exponential, the switch between slow and fast time constants occurs smoothly as the variation in the envelope of the signal on line 260 increases.\nReferring to FIG. 1, the control terminal of VCA 290 receives the output of timing circuit 240 on line 260. VCA 290 receives the output of VCA 200 through high-pass filter 280. In the preferred embodiment, filter 280 is a 6 dB/octave high-pass filter with a corner frequency of approximately 4 kHz.\nIn the preferred embodiment, the sensitivity of the gain-control terminal of VCA 290 is approximately one-third that of VCA 200. Thus a large signal level change on line 230 causes the gain of VCA 290 (in dB) to change about one-third as much as the gain of VCA 200. Because, in a practical implementation, VCA 200 and 290 are the same type (the preferred type is uPC1252H2, manufactured by THAT Corp.), an attenuator 265 is placed in line 260 to effect the sensitivity change.\nHigh-frequency enhancement control 320 receives the output of VCA 290 and lets the operator decide how much of the output of VCA 290 is mixed with the unenhanced signal on line 270 in summer 300, thus setting the amount of enhancement to the operator's taste. The amount of high-frequency enhancement can alternately be set with a DC-operated control by summing an operator-controlled DC voltage with the signal on line 260 before its application to VCA 290's gain control port. This works because summation in the log domain is equivalent to multiplication, so the DC voltage would simply offset the gain of VCA 290 by a given number of decibels. This is equivalent to applying a gain control, such as on line 320, to the output line 330 of VCA 290.\nBecause the de-esser and high-frequency enhancer both operate feedforward, their order could easily be reversed. That is, VCA 200 could be inserted in line 310, with lines 100 and 270 connected together. Further, other types of detectors (such as averaging or peak detectors) could be substituted for r.m.s. detectors 150 and 160. The only requirement is that the outputs of these detectors must be proportional to the logarithm of the envelope of their inputs, regardless of the means used to measure the envelope.\nThus, a combination de-esser and high-frequency enhancer has been described. By exploiting conjoint circuitry, we obtain, by comparison with discrete functions known in the prior art, a simpler and less expensive system.\nFIG. 1 is a block diagram of the present invention.\nFIG. 2 is an electrical schematic of the non-linear timing circuit of FIG. 1.\n1. Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to the field of audio processing.\n2. Prior Art\nIn the prior art there exist circuits for removing excessively strong sibilance from electrical signals representing the human voice, one example of which is the dbx Model 263X, manufactured by AKG Acoustics Inc. This device has two level detectors with logarithmic outputs to receive the input signal to be de-essed. The first level detector receives the signal through a third-order high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of approximately 5 kHz, while the second level detector receives the signal through a band-pass filter contoured to simulate the equal-loudness curves of the human ear. The difference between the detectors' outputs (representing the log of the ratio of their respective input levels) is summed with a reference DC voltage to preset the threshold of de-essing. This sum is applied to a thresholding circuit that detects an \"ess\" by providing an output whenever the ratio between the high frequency and loudness-contoured powers in the input signal exceed the preset threshold level. The output of the thresholding circuit is applied to a voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA), which quickly and momentarily reduces the channel gain whenever an \"ess\" sound is detected.\nThere also exist circuits for performing program-adaptive equalization, such as that disclosed in my U.S. Pat. No. 5,050,217. In this enhancer circuit, a peak detector receives the input signal through a band-pass filter contoured to simulate the equal-loudness curves of the human ear. The input signal is also passed through a first-order high-pass filter to the input of a VCA. The output of the VCA is added to the original input signal to achieve high-frequency equalization. The output of the VCA is also passed through a second high-pass filter to one terminal of a comparator. The other terminal of the comparator receives the output of the peak detector. When the high-passed output of the VCA exceeds the output level of the peak detector, the comparator fires, charging a leaky integrator whose output is coupled to the gain-determining port of the VCA. The gain of the VCA decreases until the high-passed output of the VCA no longer exceeds the output level of the peak detector, at which point the comparator turns off. Thus feedback ensures that the output level of the VCA (representing high-frequency power to be added to the original signal to create the equalized output signal) is always a fixed ratio of the loudness-weighted peak level of the original signal.\nThe present invention combines a de-esser and high-frequency enhancer. Sharing a significant amount of circuitry between the two functions produces a more efficient and economical circuit.\nThe circuit of the present invention relies on a de-esser circuit like the one described above. It exploits the fact that the de-esser operates by processing the difference between the logarithmic outputs of the two level detectors, this difference being the log of the ratio between the high frequency power in the input signal and the loudness-weighted total power in the input signal. For high frequency enhancing, a non-linear low-pass filter smoothes the log ratio signal to remove small level variations. The smoothed log ratio signal is then applied to the gain control terminal of a VCA. This VCA receives the input signal after de-essing and after passing through a high-pass filter. The gain of the VCA is proportional to the exponential of the signal at its control terminal; thus, the gain (in dB) of the VCA is proportional to the signal at its control terminal. This characteristic is commonly called \"decilinear.\" The VCA's gain is thus proportional to the ratio between the high frequency power in the input signal and the loudness-weighted total power in the input signal, which is very similar to the results achieved from the high frequency enhancer circuit described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,050,217. However, the high frequency enhancer circuit of the present invention operates in feedforward mode (not feedback), and does not require a peak detector, comparator, or leaky integrator. It is therefore considerably more economical than the circuit described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,050,217, since it uses most of the de-esser's control circuitry.","Band Pass Filter\nA band-pass filter is a circuit which is designed to pass signals only in a certain band of frequencies while attenuating all signals outside this band. The parameters of importance in a bandpass filter are the high and low cut-off frequencies (fH and fl), the bandwidth (BW), the centre frequency fc, centre-frequency gain, and the selectivity or Q.\nThere are basically two types of bandpass filters viz wide bandpass and narrow bandpass filters. Unfortunately, there is no set dividing line between the two. However, a bandpass filter is defined as a wide bandpass if its figure of merit or quality factor Q is less than 10 while the bandpass filters with Q > 10 are called the narrow bandpass filters. Thus Q is a measure of selectivity, meaning the higher the value of Q the more selective is the filter, or the narrower is the bandwidth (BW). The relationship between Q, 3-db bandwidth, and the centre frequency fc is given by an equation\nFor a wide bandpass filter the centre frequency can be defined as where fH and fL are respectively the high and low cut-off frequencies in Hz.In a narrow bandpass filter, the output voltage peaks at the centre frequency fc.\nWide Bandpass Filter\nA wide bandpass filter can be formed by simply cascading high-pass and low-pass sections and is generally the choice for simplicity of design and performance though such a circuit can be realized by a number of possible circuits. To form a ± 20 db/ decade bandpass filter, a first-order high-pass and a first-order low-pass sections are cascaded; for a ± 40 db/decade bandpass filter, second-order high- pass filter and a second-order low-pass filter are connected in series, and so on. It means that, the order of the bandpass filter is governed by the order of the high-pass and low-pass filters it consists of.\nA ± 20 db/decade wide bandpass filter composed of a first-order high-pass filter and a first-order low-pass filter, is illustrated in fig. (a). Its frequency response is illustrated in fig. (b).\nNarrow Bandpass Filter.\nA narrow bandpass filter employing multiple feedback is depicted in figure. This filter employs only one op-amp, as shown in the figure. In comparison to all the filters discussed so far, this filter has some unique features that are given below.\n1. It has two feedback paths, and this is the reason that it is called a multiple-feedback filter.\n2. The op-amp is used in the inverting mode.\nThe frequency response of a narrow bandpass filter is shown in fig(b).\nGenerally, the narrow bandpass filter is designed for specific values of centre frequency fc and Q or fc and BW.

{"question":"¿Cual es la longitud total del Great Wall of China y what materials were used to build it?","answer":"The Great Wall of China extends approximately 13,171 miles in total length. It was built using stone, brick, tamped earth, wood and other materials over several centuries, with most construction occurring during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).","context":["This image essay is a contribution to Incendiary Traces, a conceptually driven, community generated art project lead by artist Hillary Mushkin. Incendiary Traces is holding a series of site-specific draw-ins taking place across Southern California. Artbound is following the draw-ins and publishing related materials as the project develops. This post was generated in conjunction with the recent draw-in at the U.S./Mexico border in San Diego, which will be published in the upcoming weeks.\nIn an upcoming post, Incendiary Traces will report on its recent visit to Border Field State Park to draw the wall that exists between the United States and Mexico. For those who haven't been to the border since its construction, the wall there is actually two sets of fences built at separate times. The first row, furthest to the south, is composed of broad strokes of rusted steel laid out consecutively every six inches and reaching up towards the sky. The second resembles a prison gate made of pale metal and mesh. Encountering them for the first time, one begins to question, why? Differences between people are often superficial in daily life, but with those walls there, they become official. This bold, double vision presence upon the land seems so strange and harsh, but in concept it is nothing new. Border walls exist all over the world today.\nI present below a list of historical and contemporary border walls to provide some global and historical context for understanding our own contested wall, as well as to consider the many reasons for and affects of erecting barriers along borders. Whether built to protect from perceived military, economic, social or cultural threats, border walls represent geographic national and territorial boundaries. Unlike an open border, their intent is to keep others out. As they cut across and wind their way over the land, these walls trace the symbolic lines that exist between customs, values and beliefs adopted by people of particular regions. However, in many cases the lines do not differentiate, dividing whole communities and cultural groups in the process. The construction of a wall makes tangible the very abstract notion of sovereignty, particularly for those caught living on the border. The presence of a border wall here in Southern California reminds us of the similarities that exist between the United States and other countries engaged in border conflict and control. (Note the many lives that have been lost at these borders.)\nPre-modern State Walls:\nThese walls were built on the boundaries of prototypical (pre-modern) states with centralized governments. They defined the geographic reach of imperial territories against lands occupied by decentralized tribes. This differs from our understanding of state boundaries in the modern world in which most of the entire globe lies within the territories of one state or another.\nGreat Wall of China\nBuilding Begun: 7th Century BC, continued over several centuries, primarily during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)\nConstruction: Stone, brick, tamped earth, wood and other materials\nTotal distance: approx. 13,171 miles\nOver the time of the Great Wall's construction, the state we recognize today as China was surrounded by marauding nomadic tribes. The Great Wall protected the people and resources of the state from invasion by these tribes while regulating trade and immigration.\nBuilding Begun: AD 122\nConstruction: Stone and turf\nThis defensive fortification in Roman Britain was begun during the rule of Emperor Hadrian. Like the Great Wall of China, it was built to keep barbarians out of the Roman Empire and also to provide customs checkpoints for the movement of goods and people.\nDemilitarized borders exist between states that no longer view one another as a threat. Both countries have since withdrawn military presence and activity from their shared boundary.\nBuilding Begun: 1930\nConstruction: Concrete, tank obstacles, artillery casemates, machine gun posts\nTotal Distance: approx. 240 miles (estimates vary greatly)\nNamed after the French Minister of War André Maginot, France constructed this permanent system of fortifications along the German and Italian borders in the run-up to World War II. The wall was mostly demilitarized after 1966. Many of the original fortifications have since been converted for other uses, including several wine cellars, a mushroom farm and a disco.\nBuilding Began: 1961\nConstruction: Concrete reinforced with mesh fencing, signal fencing, anti-vehicle trenches, barbed wire, dogs on long lines, \"beds of nails\", over 116 watchtowers, and 20 bunkers\nTotal Distance: approx. 96 miles\nThe Berlin Wall, officially referred to by the German Democratic Republic (GDR) as the \"Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart,\" was constructed to protect the East German population from perceived fascist elements conspiring to prevent a new socialist state. On November 9, 1989, after several weeks of increasing civil unrest, the East German government announced that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Over the months that followed, citizens from both sides began to dismantle the wall piece by piece. Today only a small section remains as a historical marker.\nModern Nation-to-Nation Walls:\nNation-to-nation barriers are those that were constructed on the national boundary of two or more present day countries and are ongoing sources of conflict.\nU.S. - Mexico Border Wall\nBuilding Began: 2006\nConstruction: Steel and concrete (double fence in some sections)\nTotal Distance: approx. 640 miles (construction suspended)\nIn an attempt to quell the world's highest rate of illegal border crossing, increases in drug and weapons trafficking, and related violence, President George W. Bush ordered the construction of several strategically placed sections of wall along the U.S/Mexico international border. In 2010, President Barack Obama halted construction and reallocated all funding towards researching and upgrading border technology. The state of Arizona has vowed to continue construction of its portion of the fence through private online donations. Read more about the history of our border in a previous post by Susanna Newbury.\nBuilding Began: 2003\nConstruction: Electric fence\nTotal Distance: approx. 300 miles\nThe official reason Botswana began building a fence along its western border with Zimbabwe is purportedly to stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease among livestock. However, Zimbabweans believe that it is really intended to keep people from migrating into Botswana since the 2000 land reform policy in Zimbabwe resulted in an economic crisis, leaving many desperate and in search of employment.\nBuilding Began: 2005\nConstruction: Barbed wire and concrete\nTotal Distance (Goal): I2,116 miles\nIndia is constructing a barrier to prevent illegal immigration and the smuggling of weapons and narcotics from Bangladesh to the Indian state of Assam. In recent years, it has been a site of particular focus for Human Rights Watch (HRW) because of the border patrol's controversial shoot on sight policy. HRW reported in 2010 that over 900 Bengladeshi, including children, had been killed by both sides along the border in the last decade alone.\nBuilding Began: 1991\nConstruction: Electrified fencing, concertina wire, trenches and dirt berms\nTotal Distance: approx. 120 miles\nAfter the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, international military intervention and the defeat of Iraq, the Kuwait-Iraq barrier was constructed by the United Nations Security Council to prevent future invasion by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The separation barrier extends six miles into Iraq, three miles into Kuwait, across the full length of their mutual border from Saudi Arabia to the Persian Gulf and is guarded by hundreds of soldiers, several patrol boats, and helicopters.\nIran Border Walls:\nIn July 2010, the Iranian Interior Minister, Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar announced that the country would be building walls along its entire border with Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The government has purportedly allocated 150 million dollars for this purpose.\nBuilding Began: 2007\nConstruction: Reinforced concrete, earth and stone embankments, deep ditches, observation towers and garrisons\nTotal Distance: approx. 435 miles\nThe Iran-Pakistan barrier is a separation barrier which Iran in the process of reconstructing and fortifying along its border with Pakistan. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry has said that Iran has the right to erect border fencing in its territory to deter drug smuggling and illegal crossings. However, the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan (Pakistan) opposes the wall. They maintain that it will create problems for the Baloch people, whose lands straddle the border region, dividing them politically and impeding trade and social activities.\nBuilding Began: 2007\nConstruction: Concrete and electric wire\nTotal Distance: approximately 3 miles\nThe Iranian government has built a long wall on its border with Iraq to stop drug and weapons smuggling. However, according to Iraqis and Iranians living near the border, the wall has created employment problems for the Iraqis. It is also reported that Iran has issued IDs to Iranian smugglers to regulate their activities.\nGreen Lines and Territory Walls\nGreen line and territory walls refer to those that separate nations from occupied territories or lands that are claimed by one and disputed by another.\nWest Bank Separation Barrier\nBuilding Began: 2002\nConstruction: fences, barbed wire, ditches and concrete slabs up to 26ft high sensors, sand (to help identify footprints), patrol roads and buffer zones up to 200 feet wide\nTotal Distance: approx. 436 miles\nThe Israeli-built barrier along the West Bank is primarily located within Palestinian lands. Only 15% of the barrier follows the so-called \"Green Line\", the internationally recognized border. Israel built the \"security fence\" as a military measure in the conflict with Palestinians. In 2004, the International Court of Justice in The Hague deemed the barrier was illegal. Palestinians view it as an \"apartheid wall\" which threatens their human rights, and believe that its true aim is to expand Israeli territory. Israel has also constructed fencing along its borders with Lebanon and Gaza, and is going ahead with plans to complete barriers at its boundaries with Egypt, Syria and part of Jordan.\nIndian Line of Control Fencing\nBuilding Began: 1990s\nConstruction: Double-row of electrified fencing and concertina wire 8-12 feet high, landmines, and surveillance systems\nTotal Distance: 340 miles along the 460 mile disputed border\nThe Line of Control (LoC) established in 1972 separates the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir from Pakistan's Azad Kashmir--all of which were once part of the \"five Northern states of India\" that both countries would like to claim as their own. The fence, constructed by India, is situated 150 yards inside Indian-controlled territory. Its stated purpose is to exclude arms smuggling and infiltration by Pakistani-based separatist militants.\nThe Berm (Moroccan Wall)\nBuilding Began: 1980\nConstruction: 10 foot high sand walls, landmines\nTotal Distance: at least 1,550 miles long\nThe Moroccan Wall, or The Berm, divides the entire area of Western Sahara. Morocco built the wall in response to Polisario efforts to establish Western Sahara's independence. The wall initially contained just a small northwestern part of the territory, but by building a succession of six different walls, the Moroccans expanded their occupation to the majority of the contested land.\nCeuta and Melilla Borders (Spain-Morocco)\nBuilding Began: circa 2000\nConstruction: three rows of high wire barricades ranging 10 - 20 feet high\nTotal Distance: approximately 6 miles total (surrounding both cities)\nCeuta and Melilla are free port cities on the northern tip of Africa under Spanish control since 1986. Both cities are surrounded by Morocco, which disputes Spanish sovereignty over them. Spain built the fences to deter Africans from migrating to Iberia through these ports. In 2005, fifteen people were killed trying to cross over the barrier. Still many try to make it over, some getting caught in the process or drowning while attempting to make the sea crossing. Human trafficking is common.\nFollow Incendiary Traces on Facebook."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2efe577f-bac8-4c7d-8afc-a79218837f27>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the storage conditions compare between uncured epoxy resin and fully cured epoxy projects in terms of temperature requirements and durability?","answer":"Uncured epoxy resin requires specific storage conditions - it should be kept at room temperature or slightly below (70F/21C), in a shaded spot away from direct sunlight, and in an airtight container in a cool environment. In contrast, fully cured epoxy projects are very durable and can be safely moved outdoors without fear of damage. A well-constructed epoxy project will last indefinitely, being very resistant to scratches and able to hold up weight.","context":["What is Epoxy Resin Made From?\nThe base for most common epoxy resins is bisphenol A novolac, aliphatic, halogenated, and glycidylamine.\nThe curing agent will most commonly be amines, however it can be made of homopolymerisation, anhydrides, phenols, and thiols.\nHow Durable are Most Epoxy Resins?\nVery strong. Epoxy resin after a full cure is able to hold up weight and is very resistant to scratches. A well constructed epoxy project will last indefinitely.\nHow to Color Epoxy?\nThe best two ways are with powder and wet pigments. Mica powder is the most popular type of dry pigment, while most wet pigments are based with water or alcohol.\nWhat are the Best Finish/Polishes for Epoxy Projects?\nThe most popular that we have seen for wood/epoxy projects are Odie’s Oil, Walrus Oil, Rubio Monocoat, and Osmo. Although, there are hundreds of types made from a variety of resources, you can find exactly what you’re looking for. When applying finish to epoxy, sand it to 320 grit first to allow absorption.\nWhat is an Epoxy Dirty Pour?\nA dirty pour of epoxy resin refers to using multiple colors and allowing them to flow freely. This is usually done to make countertops looking new and intricate.\nHow to Calculate Epoxy for a River Table Pour?\nFor a long straight pour for a river table, you want to take the average width, multiplied by the depth, and multiplied by the length. WxDxL will give you the cubic unit you are using, which you can convert to leaders using a simple google search.\nHow do I Remove Bubbles from My Epoxy Project?\nAfter pouring, you are going to want to wait 5-15 minutes, then go over the surface with a torch of some sort. Commonly used is a propane torch.\nHow Often can I Pour Layers for my Project?\nThis will vary by epoxy brand, but usually every 4-6 hours. The best way to test for this is to press it with a fingernail or something similar in toughness. If it can make an indent but is not too soft, it is ready for another pour.\nWhat is the Shelf Life of Epoxy Resin?\nMost epoxy resins, when stored airtight in a cool environment, will be able to last indefinitely.\nIs Epoxy Resin Food Safe?\nThis will depend on the brand, but today most epoxy resins are made to be food safe after they are fully cured, and many are FDA approved.\nIs there Shrinkage with Epoxy Resin?\nWhile epoxy resin itself won’t shrink, when pours on woods there will be some amount of it that is soaked up by the wood. This will be particularly noticeable on the cut edges.\nDo I Need to Seal My Wood Before Pouring Epoxy?\nThough it is not necessary, sealing your wood will minimize bubbles and help prevent the wood from soaking in too much of the epoxy resin.\nWhat Does Epoxy Resin Adhere To?\nThe materials are not exact, however common materials that epoxy resin works well with are wood, glass, concrete, some plastics, and clay. Even materials that commonly wouldn’t stick to epoxy can when sanded first.\nCan I Use Epoxy Outdoors?\nWhen working with epoxy, you want the temperature to be stable until cured. After cured, the piece can safely be moved outside without fear of many things being able to damage it easily.\nHow Long Does Epoxy Resin Take to Cure?\nThe average length for it to be hard is 12-24 hours. For the chemical bonds to be completed and for it to be worked on is usually 3-5 days, and depending on the brand and temperature can be a week.\nHow Thick Can I Pour Epoxy Resin?\nThe average will be between 1/8″-1/4″, however some brands create epoxy resins that are able to be poured much thicker.","We’ve covered the topic of using resin in warm/hot temperatures before, but now we’re moving towards cooler temperatures in the UK again, we’d like to switch it up and draw your awareness about working with resin in cooler temperatures.\nOne of the most important factors to ensure your epoxy resin cures properly is the temperature: the ideal temperature for both your Craft Resin and your workspace is slightly warmer than room temperature: 70-75F or 21-24C. Resin won't harden properly if the temperature is too low, so some precautions need to be taken during the colder months.\nHere are 3 simple things you can do to ensure a perfect cure in cold weather:\n- Ensure your resin is at room temperature: let it sit out for a few hours or give it a warm water bath.\n- Ensure your workspace is at room temperature: keep it no lower than 70F/21C and, ideally, above 75F/24C.\n- Ensure your workspace stays stable at room temperature for the first 24 hours of curing.\nBut why is temperature so important?\nWhat happens if you do use cold resin?\nAnd what effect can a cold room can have on your resin cure?\nWe’ll cover the why’s below:\n1. Ensure your RESIN is at room temperature.\nAt room temperature, Craft Resin is crystal clear with a honey-like consistency. Cold resin is thick with a cloudy, milky appearance due to thousands of cold-induced micro bubbles.\nYou’ll never be able to torch these out, which can be a complete pain if you want bubble free, crystal clear projects!\nCold resin is a thicker consistency, making it more difficult to pour.\nIt will have a cloudy, milky appearance due to thousands of cold induced micro bubbles.\nCold resin is thick and difficult to spread.\nIt will not self-level as easily as room temperature resin and has a frothy looking appearance.\nEven after torching, you will be left with frothy looking areas due to micro bubbles below the resin surface. You will not be able to torch these out.\nHow can I increase the temperature of my resin?\nIf your resin is cold, you need to bring it up to room temperature before you resin. You can do this by letting the resin bottles sit out to come up to temperature or an easier way is to try a warm water bath:\n- Always warm the bottles BEFORE you measure and mix.\n- Leave the lids on to prevent any water from getting mixed into your resin or hardener. (Water in your resin mixtures means a cloudy cure)\n- Place your bottles of resin and hardener in a container of warm water: the water doesn't need to be very hot ... about the temperature you'd use for a baby's bath is just fine.\n- Don’t fully submerge the bottles.\n- Let the resin sit in the water bath for 15 minutes or so (this will depend on how cold your resin was to start with and how big your bottles are).\nTo prevent any water from getting into your resin mixture, always dry the bottles thoroughly before you open them.\nRoom temperature resin is smooth, clear and with a beautiful honey-like consistency. It pours and spreads with ease.\nTIP: If you are using a water bath to warm your Craft Resin, keep in mind that heat promotes a faster cure: this means that your 45 minute working time will be cut down by about 10 minutes. It also means that the resin may thicken and cure in the cup if you leave it sitting out on the work surface while you get your artwork ready. Get everything ready first, then measure and mix your resin and pour right away. Don't leave your warm resin sitting in the mixing cup!\n2. Ensure your WORKSPACE is at room temperature or above:\nWhen working with Craft Resin epoxy resin the 3 key guidelines for room temperature are:\n- WARM - 70-75F or 21-24C is ideal, but don't go below 70F/21C\n- DRY - 50% humidity is ideal, but anything below 85% relative humidity should be fine\n- STABLE - no dips in temperature during the first 24hrs\nDuring the colder winter months, the best case scenario is to plan ahead: use a heater in the room that you're planning on resining in to increase the ambient room temperature. Leave your resin in the room so that it will come up to temperature as well.\nWorking outside in cooler temperatures is not advised, and be careful when working in outside sheds/garages/workshops, as these areas can be very hard to stabilise the temperature in for the full 24 hours.\nWhat happens if the temperature of my room is too cold?\nWhen your room temperature is too cold, the resin will take far longer to cure.\nIf the temperature of your resin room is below 70F/21C, your resin may stay sticky for days or may not cure at all. If this happens, simply try moving your piece to warmer area or increase the room temperature ... your piece should cure dry to the touch after 24 hours.\nTIP: If your resin is still sticky, even after 24 hrs in a warmer environment, then temperature likely wasn't the issue. Your sticky resin is likely due to a measuring or mixing issue. Check out our blog Recommended Technique to learn how to measure and mix Craft Resin correctly. Every resin brands guidance is slightly different, if you’re not using Craft Resin, visit the brand you are using and seek guidance from them.\n3. Ensure your resin room STAYS STABLE at room temperature or above for the first 24 hours of curing.\nThe first 24 hours of a cure are critical ... and the resin room must remain warm, dry and stable, with no fluctuations or dips in temperature.\nFor example, placing your freshly resined piece to cure in a sunny window seems absolutely ideal, but when night falls and the temperature does too ... you may very well end up with what's known as the \"orange peel\" effect. This may look like dimples in your resin, waves and other strange surface imperfections.\nSo remember, when working with Craft Resin’s epoxy resin:\n- Use room temperature resin.\n- Ensure your resin room is at room temperature or above.\n- Ensure your resin room stays stable at room temperature for the first 24 hours of curing.\nFollow these simple points to help get a perfect, Craft Resin cure every time.\nWhat is the best temperature to store Craft Resin epoxy resin?\nOpened or unopened, store your Craft Resin bottles in a shaded spot, out of direct sunlight and in a spot where the temperature will stay stable at room temperature or just slightly below ( 70F or 21C ).\nIf you are in a warmer location right now and you’d like to learn more about working with Craft Resin in warmer conditions take a look at our warm weather Blog.\nIf you have any tips on working with epoxy resin in colder temperatures please do share them below in the comments.\nTeam Craft Resin"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:20474a7a-236d-47db-8c43-1ee318c95688>","<urn:uuid:2d7323b4-6f5b-4573-a65a-0ccfe3a84e9c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the burial restrictions and record-keeping practices compare between Connecticut's historical cemeteries and Lake City's burial grounds?","answer":"Connecticut's historical cemeteries, such as Grove Street Cemetery and North Cemetery, were well-documented burial grounds with clear records of notable African Americans and veterans. In contrast, Lake City's cemeteries had varying levels of organization - the City Cemetery had no formal organization or records with burials taking place haphazardly, while the IOOF Cemetery was formally surveyed in 1877 and maintained strict burial restrictions, initially only allowing Odd Fellows Lodge members and their families, before gradually loosening these restrictions to include other fraternity members and eventually the general public.","context":["About 1940, singer Marian Anderson and her husband, looking for a home in the Northeast, found an ideal 50-acre parcel in Danbury.\nAnderson's husband, architect Orpheus H. Fisher, designed a house there for his wife, the first African American to sing a featured role at the Metropolitan Opera and the first black to perform at the White House.\nShe spent about 50 years in that home.\n\"This one conformed to my ideas of a dream house,\" she said in her autobiography, \"My Lord, What A Morning.\"\nToday, now that she and her husband have died, the Connecticut Historical Commission wants to put their property -- Marianna Farm -- on the state's African-American Freedom Trail.\nThe African-American Freedom Trail was proposed in 1995 to bring attention to the many historically significant sites in Connecticut where people lived and fought for freedom for blacks.\nSince the start of work last year, the historical commission's list of possible sites has grown to more than 60, commemorating the underground railroad, the Amistad slave revolt and other significant events in the state. Plans are to create brochures and signs about the sites by June, when officials hope the trail will be ready for public use.\nThe process of setting up the trail, however, has had its bumps.\nFor example, the case of Marian Anderson's beloved home raises questions about whether property owners should have any choice about being listed on the freedom trail.\nA group of New York investors is worried that the hubbub over the trail designation will interfere with its plans to sell Anderson's property for $1.5 million.\nRobert H. Wilder of Ridgefield, real estate agent for the New York investors who bought the farm several years ago, said they want no part of the freedom trail. He said the designation would harm the group's plans to subdivide the property or develop it as a retirement community called Marian Anderson Farm.\n\"We don't want people tromping around while some tenant is living there,\" Wilder said. He's also worried that \"some will want to keep it the way Marian Anderson had it.\"\nBut Alfred L. Marder, president of the Amistad Committee in New Haven that conceived of the trail, is adamant that Anderson's property be on the trail, and he is worried that proposed changes would be detrimental to the Anderson home and studio.\n\"Marian Anderson wrote a significant page in American history [in 1939] when Eleanor Roosevelt took the initiative in organizing a concert for Marian Anderson on the mall when the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow this magnificant African American woman to present a concert in their facility,\" Marder said. \"It aroused the conscience of the entire country and signaled that this battle against discrimination had still to be won in our country.\"\nMarder said that when he heard plans were being considered to alter the farm, he alerted organizations and political institutions of the danger.\n\"The Marian Anderson house will be on the freedom trail, period,\" he said.\n\"It will be on the trail and we'll publicize it, but people can't enter. No one has a right to hide their home or the history of the home. That belongs to the people. But, we will respect the rights of owners to their privacy,\" he said.\nDaryle Dennis, who is president of Danbury's chapter of the NAACP, said Friday that his group voted unanimously in support of the Anderson house's being on the Freedom Trail -- \"which it so richly deserves.\"\nJohn W. Shannahan, executive director of the state historical commission, said the farm could be listed for the trail, but would clearly be marked that it's not open to the public.\n\"I don't think we'll have legal problems,\" Shannahan said. \"We did houses on the underground railroad in the 1970s and we didn't get permission.\" He said there are ways to represent African American history in Connecticut with brochures that tell about sites and locations. But rather than send people on a \"wild goose chase,\" the commission specifies when particular buildings are not open to the public, he said.\nVivian Zoe, director of development for the Antiquarian and Landmarks Society in Hartford, is looking for a generous solution. She said the Anderson farm investors should consider donating the house to the state.\n\"I really think this is an important site for Connecticut. . . . They should donate the house with a $1 million endowment to care for it and make it an African American Center for Danbury,\" she said.\nState historical officials won't know if there will be any other opposition to being cited on the freedom trail until they receive answers to letters now being sent to owners of the properties being considered.\nBut another crack in plans surfaced recently when both Marder's committee and the historical commission decided not to allow any houses on the trail that are less than 50 years old or are occupied by people whose fight for justice is less than 50 years old.\nFor instance, Trude Johnson Mero of Hartford was disappointed to learn that her house won't be on the list. She is the wife of the late Wilfred \"Spike\" Xavier Johnson, the first African American to be elected as a representative to the General Assembly.\n\"That's not right,\" Mero said.\nShannahan said Johnson won the seat in 1958, which doesn't reach the 50-year mark.\nLikewise, baseball great Jackie Robinson's home in Norwalk won't qualify for the list until 1997 -- which will be 50 years after he broke the color barrier in the major leagues.\nStill, officials are looking forward to having the trail open to the public this year.\nMarder's nonprofit Amistad Committee of New Haven gave birth to the freedom trail after a study of various sites connected to the Amistad slave revolt branched from New Haven to Hartford to Farmington.\nMarder said that since the original list was announced last year, the committee planning the trail has been busy researching other places because publicity has spawned even more sites.\nThe current proposed list covers the state from Wilton to Griswold and from Bridgeport to Enfield. It includes the Enfield home of Paul Robeson, a now-deceased African American actor and singer; the Torrington birthplace of abolitionist John Brown; and the village of Glasgo, an area of Griswold named after Isaac Glasko, a black man who set up a blacksmith shop there in 1806.\nProposed new Freedom Trail sites\n1. Harriet Beecher Stowe House, 71 Forest St., Hartford.\nStowe moved into the house in 1877, long after she wrote \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" a book that had an enormous impact on the anti-slavery movement in America.\n2. Fort Griswold, Monument Street, Groton.\nTwo African Americans, Jordan Freeman and Lambert Latham, fought and died for the Colonies in one of the few places in Connecticut that is the site of a Revolutionary War battle.\n3. Grove Street Cemetery, 227 Grove St., New Haven.\nMany New Haven residents associated with the Abolitionist movement or African American history are buried here. The cemetery opened in 1796.\n4. Masonic Temple, 102 Goffe St., New Haven.\nThis structure, built in 1864, was a school for African American children for 10 years until Connecticut ended segregated education.\n5. James Mars Grave, Center Cemetery, Old Colony Road, Norfolk.\nMars was born into slavery in 1790 and became free through the gradual emancipation law that the state enacted in 1784. He published a pamphlet about his experiences and is included in \"Five Black Lives.\" Mars spent much of his life in Hartford and Norfolk fighting to improve conditions for blacks.\n6.

It is located on Cemetery Hill to the north of Lake City and just east of Colorado Highway 149 as it enters the town.\nIn February 1876, it was decided that a committee be appointed to select a site for a city cemetery.The Silver World newspaper observed: “ [The City Fathers] hope there will be no undue rivalry as to who shall be the first occupant, but if a certain party does not refrain from standing and reading copy on the case, this office will enjoy the honor of furnishing the first denizen of the ‘City of Dead.’”\nThe City Cemetery was started on several acres of hilly, pine covered ground north of Lake City which had originally been patented for a ranch. The land was never publicly owned and passed through several private ownerships, most recently the Carol White estate, before Hinsdale County acquired it in 1985.\nThere were apparently never any formal organization or records for the City Cemetery and burials took place on a haphazard basis and to this day, the majority of graves are unmarked.\nThe City Cemetery, as a common burial ground, reflects the widest spectrum of life in the late 19th century. All classes and professions of the people ended up on this quite hillside; the butcher, the baker, the Bluff Street prostitute, laundrymen and teachers, attorneys, leaders of the church and society, actors, gamblers and musicians, and of course, the ever present miners and prospectors. Immigrant burials make up a large portion of the City Cemetery, and there are identifiable sections for Catholics, Italians and paupers. “Paupers Row”, a stark row of side by side unmarked graves, runs the length of the entrance gate. There is also an area which was apparently reserved for gamblers and prostitutes. The marker of Benjamin House, a Bluff Street faro dealer, who died in October 1876, is the oldest tombstone in the City Cemetery.\nInternational Order of Odd Fellows Cemetery\nSilver Star Lodge, No. 27, International Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), decided to create their own private burial ground on the northern outskirts of Lake City in 1877. The first burial to take place in this new cemetery, which is located on Cemetery Jill approximately a quarter mile west of Colorado Highway 149, was Andrew T. Hopkins, who died in April 1877.\nJohn F. Dodds completed the first formal survey of the IOOF Cemetery on November 21, 1877. The original cemetery consisted of 3.82 acres on the Peter A. Simmons ranch. Burial in the IOOF Cemetery was intended to be very restrictive. In the early years of its existence, only members of the Odd Fellows Lodge or their immediate families were permitted to purchase burial plots. Restrictions had loosened somewhat by 1900, however, and members of other fraternities and sororities were allowed to be buried in the cemetery. The cemetery was later opened to the general public and finally taken over by Hinsdale County after the Odd Fellows Lodge was dissolved. The IOOF Cemetery remains the principal burial location for the area at this time.\nThere are subtle differences between the City and IOOF Cemeteries. Due to its burial restrictions, the IOOF Cemetery contains fewer burials and it reflects a greater percentage of Lake City’s business and professional people. The memorials and fences of the IOOF Cemetery are in general more elaborate and costly than those in the City Cemetery. Where unmarked graves and wooden markers predominate in the City burial ground, the IOOF Cemetery features more stylish and permanent markers. Immigrant burials and a majority of the miners and prospectors are noticeably absent from the IOOF Cemetery."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f2298ddb-a8e0-4c47-be6d-469afa539e14>","<urn:uuid:77dcdb3b-c6ec-48b5-9661-5156c6086222>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can we use both SWOT and Value Chain Analysis to achieve cost reduction goals?","answer":"Yes, both SWOT and Value Chain Analysis can be used to achieve cost reduction goals, but they approach it differently. SWOT analysis helps by identifying internal weaknesses and external threats that may impact costs, allowing companies to develop strategic plans to minimize these factors. Value Chain Analysis provides a more structured approach to cost reduction by breaking down the firm's activities, establishing their relative importance to total costs, identifying specific cost drivers, analyzing links between activities, and finding targeted opportunities for reducing costs. When used together, these tools provide complementary perspectives on cost optimization.","context":["Importance of SWOT Analysis in Developing a Marketing StrategyOften viewed as a key step related to planning, SWOT analysis is deceptively simple despite the immense value it delivers. The system combines information from the environmental analysis and separates it into two components: internal issues (strengths and weaknesses) and external issues (opportunities and threats).\nThis level of analysis enables an organization to determine whether there are factors present that will aid in the achievement of specific objectives (due to an existing strength or opportunity) or if there are obstacles that must be overcome before the desired outcome can be realized (due to weaknesses or threats).\nWhat is SWOT analysis?As mentioned above, the process of SWOT analysis evaluates your company's strengths, weaknesses, market opportunities and potential threats to provide competitive insight into the potential and critical issues that impact the overall success of the business. Further, the primary goal of a SWOT analysis is to identify and assign all significant factors that could positively or negatively impact success to one of the four categories, providing an objective and in-depth look at your business.\nHighly useful for developing and confirming your organizational goals, each of the four categories provides specific insights that can be used to cultivate a successful marketing strategy, including:\n- Strengths - Positive attributes internal to your organization and within your control. Strengths often encompass resources, competitive advantages, the positive aspects of those within your workforce and the aspects related to your business that you do particularly well, focusing on all the internal components that add value or offer you a competitive advantage.\n- Weaknesses - Factors that are within your control yet detract from your ability to obtain or maintain a competitive edge such as limited expertise, lack of resources, limited access to skills or technology, substandard services or poor physical location. Weaknesses encapsulate the negative internal aspects to your business that diminish the overall value your products or services provide. This category can be extremely helpful in providing an organizational assessment, provided you focus on an accurate identification of your company's weaknesses.\n- Opportunities - Summary of the external factors that represent the motivation for your business to exist and prosper within the marketplace. These factors include the specific opportunities existing within your market that provide a benefit, including market growth, lifestyle changes, resolution of current problems or the basic ability to offer a higher degree of value in relation to your competitors to promote an increase in demand for your products or services. One element to be aware of is timing. For example, are the opportunities you're catering to ongoing or is there a limited window of opportunity?\n- Threats - External factors beyond the control of your organization that have the potential to place your marketing strategy, or the entire business, at risk. The primary and ever-present threat is competition. However, other threats can include unsustainable price increases by suppliers, increased government regulation, economic downturns, negative press coverage, shifts in consumer behavior or the introduction of \"leap-frog\" technology that leaves your products or services obsolete. Though these forces are external and therefore beyond your control, SWOT analysis may also aid in the creation of a contingency plan that will enable you to quickly and effectively address these issues should they arise.\nTurning SWOT Analysis into a Strategic PlanOnce you've established specific values related to your business offerings within the four quadrants of SWOT analysis, you can develop a strategic plan based on the information you've learned. For example, once you've identified your inherent strengths, you can leverage them to pursue the opportunities best suited to your organization, effectively reducing potential vulnerability related to threats. In the same way, by identifying your organization's weaknesses with regard to external threats, you can devise a plan that will enable you to eliminate or minimize them while improving defensive strategies related to your offerings.\nIt's important to remember that SWOT analysis can be influenced (and often quite strongly) by those who perform the analysis. So it's a good idea to have an outside business consultant review the results to provide the most objective plan.","- Value chain analysis (VCA)\n- is a process where a firm identifies its primary and support activities that add value to its final product and then analyze these activities to reduce costs or increase differentiation.\n- Value chain\n- represents the internal activities a firm engages in when transforming inputs into outputs.\nUnderstanding the tool\nValue chain analysis is a strategy tool used to analyze internal firm activities. Its goal is to recognize, which activities are the most valuable (i.e. are the source of cost or differentiation advantage) to the firm and which ones could be improved to provide competitive advantage. In other words, by looking into internal activities, the analysis reveals where a firm’s competitive advantages or disadvantages are. The firm that competes through differentiation advantage will try to perform its activities better than competitors would do. If it competes through cost advantage, it will try to perform internal activities at lower costs than competitors would do. When a company is capable of producing goods at lower costs than the market price or to provide superior products, it earns profits.\nM. Porter introduced the generic value chain model in 1985. Value chain represents all the internal activities a firm engages in to produce goods and services. VC is formed of primary activities that add value to the final product directly and support activities that add value indirectly.\nAlthough, primary activities add value directly to the production process, they are not necessarily more important than support activities. Nowadays, competitive advantage mainly derives from technological improvements or innovations in business models or processes. Therefore, such support activities as ‘information systems’, ‘R&D’ or ‘general management’ are usually the most important source of differentiation advantage. On the other hand, primary activities are usually the source of cost advantage, where costs can be easily identified for each activity and properly managed.\nFirm’s VC is a part of a larger industry's VC. The more activities a company undertakes compared to industry's VC, the more vertically integrated it is. Below you can find an industry's value chain and its relation to a firm level VC.\nUsing the tool\nThere are two different approaches on how to perform the analysis, which depend on what type of competitive advantage a company wants to create (cost or differentiation advantage). The table below lists all the steps needed to achieve cost or differentiation advantage using VCA.\n|Cost advantage||Differentiation advantage|\n|This approach is used when organizations try to compete on costs and want to understand the sources of their cost advantage or disadvantage and what factors drive those costs.(good examples: Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Ford, Toyota)||The firms that strive to create superior products or services use differentiation advantage approach. (good examples: Apple, Google, Samsung Electronics, Starbucks)|\nTo gain cost advantage a firm has to go through 5 analysis steps:\nStep 1. Identify the firm’s primary and support activities. All the activities (from receiving and storing materials to marketing, selling and after sales support) that are undertaken to produce goods or services have to be clearly identified and separated from each other. This requires an adequate knowledge of company’s operations because value chain activities are not organized in the same way as the company itself. The managers who identify value chain activities have to look into how work is done to deliver customer value.\nStep 2. Establish the relative importance of each activity in the total cost of the product. The total costs of producing a product or service must be broken down and assigned to each activity. Activity based costing is used to calculate costs for each process. Activities that are the major sources of cost or done inefficiently (when benchmarked against competitors) must be addressed first.\nStep 3. Identify cost drivers for each activity. Only by understanding what factors drive the costs, managers can focus on improving them. Costs for labor-intensive activities will be driven by work hours, work speed, wage rate, etc. Different activities will have different cost drivers.\nStep 4. Identify links between activities. Reduction of costs in one activity may lead to further cost reductions in subsequent activities. For example, fewer components in the product design may lead to less faulty parts and lower service costs. Therefore identifying the links between activities will lead to better understanding how cost improvements would affect he whole value chain. Sometimes, cost reductions in one activity lead to higher costs for other activities.\nStep 5. Identify opportunities for reducing costs. When the company knows its inefficient activities and cost drivers, it can plan on how to improve them. Too high wage rates can be dealt with by increasing production speed, outsourcing jobs to low wage countries or installing more automated processes.\nVCA is done differently when a firm competes on differentiation rather than costs. This is because the source of differentiation advantage comes from creating superior products, adding more features and satisfying varying customer needs, which results in higher cost structure.\nStep 1. Identify the customers’ value-creating activities. After identifying all value chain activities, managers have to focus on those activities that contribute the most to creating customer value. For example, Apple products’ success mainly comes not from great product features (other companies have high-quality offerings too) but from successful marketing activities.\nStep 2. Evaluate the differentiation strategies for improving customer value. Managers can use the following strategies to increase product differentiation and customer value:\n- Add more product features;\n- Focus on customer service and responsiveness;\n- Increase customization;\n- Offer complementary products.\nStep 3. Identify the best sustainable differentiation. Usually, superior differentiation and customer value will be the result of many interrelated activities and strategies used. The best combination of them should be used to pursue sustainable differentiation advantage.\nThis example is partially adopted from R. M. Grant’s book ‘Contemporary Strategy Analysis’ p.241. It illustrates the basic VCA for an automobile manufacturing company that competes on cost advantage. This analysis doesn’t include support activities that are essential to any firm’s value chain, thus the analysis itself is not complete.\n|Step 1 - Firm's primary activities|\n|Design and engineering||Purchasing materials and components||Assembly||Testing and quality control||Sales and marketing||Distribution and dealer support|\n|Step 2 - Toal cost and importance|\n|Step 3 - Cost drivers|\n|Step 4 - Links between activities|\n|Step 5 - Opportunities for reducing costs|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:381154b7-8779-41cd-b945-151a9403f2be>","<urn:uuid:50eb7a34-0822-4a58-affe-924a47d074ca>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is synthetic biology's potential for innovation and scientific progress, and what security concerns does it raise in terms of potential misuse?","answer":"Synthetic biology shows great innovative potential through programs like iGEM, where students design new biological systems and create practical applications. For example, successful projects have led to startups like BentoLab's molecular biology kit and Ginkgo Bioworks, which raised $257 million in funding. However, there are security concerns regarding potential misuse, particularly around bioweapons. Research shows that replicating synthetic biology findings is not straightforward - even experienced specialists struggle to reproduce results, making it unlikely for non-experts to use published research for harmful purposes. Nevertheless, there are gaps in understanding the hands-on requirements for replicating experiments and how synthetic biology will develop in the marketplace, which affects proper security policy development.","context":["The article was first published on BioByDesign, a student blog for synthetic biology.\nIn the corner of a cavernous convention hall, the FBI hands out business cards. Nearby, someone is tested for Zika virus and a six-foot praying mantis weaves between the tables. High-school students are explaining genome editing to college graduates and Australians are teaching Austrians about a tiny robot powered by E. coli.\nIt could only be iGEM.\nLast month, I swapped my microscope for a microphone and went to Boston, USA to report on the world’s largest student synthetic biology competition. Founded by Randy Retberg in 2003 as an undergraduate design course at MIT, the iGEM (“International Genetically Engineered Machines”) foundation coordinates synthetic biology education and events all over the world and also curates the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts, a collection of modular genetic elements which can be combined to build synthetic circuits.\nEvery summer, teams from all over the world – mostly undergraduates, some high-school students and graduates – compete to design a new biological system using synthetic biology. The Giant Jamboree, held annually in Boston each autumn, brings all these teams together to share and present their work. This year’s competition involved 5,000 participants from 520 teams across 42 countries.\nI’ll be honest: before I arrived at iGEM, synbio and I were going through a rough patch. Working at a lab bench is a challenging pursuit and, after the initial wonder and excitement wear off, completing a PhD requires a lot of ingenuity. Biological systems cannot be engineered as easily as the textbooks suggest. During late nights at the lab, I sometimes wondered whether synbio could ever live up to the hype.\nVisiting iGEM renewed my passion for synbio. Chatting to competitors, flush with pride about their projects, bursting with detailed knowledge about their systems, models, hardware and designs, I rediscovered my own love for the subject. Worries began to fade. It’s true that engineering life is no easy task. It’s true that the comparison of gene circuits to electrical circuits is, at best, a limited analogy (although a useful one). But synthetic biology is more than the sum of its parts. iGEM reminded me that synthetic biology is a philosophy, a modern way of approaching biology. Living organisms are not simply something to be studied with curiosity but probed, modified, hacked. If high-school and undergraduate students can take living organisms and reprogram them in a few months, then the ideas underlying synthetic biology must be very powerful indeed.\niGEM does not only create novel ideas: it creates scientists. Camillo, a master’s student at UCL, told me that the experience of building a lab from scratch and producing results was a huge motivation to pursue a PhD. His colleagues agreed: they said that sharing their research made even the frustrations of the summer seem like a useful lesson in resilience. A sixth-form student at City of London School for Boys was worried about the competition for jobs in academic science but discovered, through iGEM, that industry offered a wealth of opportunities for scientists, too.\nMany of the students whom I met were interested in the Synthetic Biology Centre for Doctoral Training, the synbio PhD programme run jointly by Bristol, Oxford and Warwick universities. Their iGEM projects had shown them that academic research is exhilarating, liberating, risky – quite unlike their undergraduate studies – and left them passionate to learn more.\nIt may be an almost impossible feat to solve a real-world problem using synthetic biology in just one summer, but iGEM has had its share of entrepreneurial success stories. BentoLab, a startup founded by UCL’s team in 2013, launched an incredibly successful crowdfunding project for their benchtop molecular-biology kit. Imperial’s 2013 team, Customem, has been counted among Europe’s most exciting climate start-ups. And Ginkgo Bioworks, a spin-off from MIT’s project in 2006, just raised a cool $257 million in their series D funding round.\nAs I turned my back on the hundreds of posters and left that cavernous hall for the last time, I knew that the future of synbio held great promise.","The Devil’s in the Details: More Research Needed to Address Synthetic Biology Security Concerns\nA new paper examines security risks and policy questions related to the growing field of synthetic biology. While the author doesn’t think the field is ripe for exploitation by terrorists, it does highlight significant gaps in our understanding of the nuts and bolts of lab work in synthetic biology that can contribute to security risks.\n“The driving question here is whether terrorists can easily draw on published synthetic biology research to develop new bioweapons,” says the paper’s author, Kathleen Vogel, a social scientist and biochemist at NC State who focuses on biosecurity issues. Vogel directs the interdisciplinary Science, Technology and Society program. “The policy community is engaged in a long-running debate on how and whether synthetic biology should be governed or regulated to protect public well-being without stifling science and innovation.”\nSynthetic biology involves the design of new biological components, devices or systems that don’t exist in nature, or the redesign of existing natural biological systems. Synthetic biology aims to make biological systems work more efficiently or to design biological tools for specific applications – such as developing more effective antibiotics.\nTo address the security question, Vogel looked at how easily synthetic biology results could be replicated. Specifically, she looked at how technological advances diffuse and are adopted through the lens of what she calls “revolution” and “evolution” frameworks.\nThe revolution framework argues that new discoveries can be easily replicated once published, assuming that the information and relevant materials are available. The evolution framework argues that new discoveries aren’t necessarily easy to replicate – even if the information and materials are available – because there are a host of skills, work experiences, and broader contextual factors in scientific work that can be difficult or impossible to convey solely via the scientific literature. In other words a lab needs to be able to draw on particular types of expertise to replicate findings published in a journal.\nTo get a better understanding of lab practices, protocols, and training, Vogel interviewed experts in synthetic biology disciplines that are relevant to biosecurity. Vogel’s questions didn’t focus on the security aspects of the research, but on all of the things the researchers needed to know in order to do their work in the lab.\n“Based, in part, on these interviews, the revolutions framework comes up short,” Vogel says.\nVogel found that even experienced specialists in subdisciplines often had trouble replicating findings in their fields – making it unlikely that non-experts could use a journal article as a step-by-step blueprint for creating bioweapons.\nBut while looking at the “revolution versus evolution” question, Vogel identified two major gaps in the literature on synthetic biology practices and their security implications.\nFirst, Vogel found that there has been very little research on the actual hands-on labor and training required to replicate a variety of synthetic biology experiments.\n“We need this information – policy makers need this information – if we want to accurately characterize security risks associated with any synthetic biology findings,” Vogel says.\nSecond, as synthetic biology moves from a purely scientific discipline into the marketplace, researchers need a better understanding of how and where synthetic biology findings will be used.\n“What market forces will come into play?” Vogel asks. “How will products be developed? How will the public respond? If we want to consider regulatory safeguards without unnecessarily limiting innovation, we need to be able to answer these and related questions.”\nThe paper, “Revolution versus evolution?: Understanding scientific and technological diffusion in synthetic biology and their implications for biosecurity policies,” was published online Oct. 13 in the journal BioSocieties. Some of the research was previously supported by Ploughshares Fund.\nBy Matt Shipman, NC State News Services"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3c12c1c6-8518-48a6-af82-f0f2311670a9>","<urn:uuid:456c4157-47a7-4ac8-8d95-8df21d0c476a>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What is ocean acidification, and how it affects marine snails behavior in future scenarios?","answer":"Ocean acidification occurs when carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with seawater, causing chemical reactions that reduce seawater pH. Since the Industrial Revolution, ocean pH has decreased from 8.2 to 8.1, representing a 26% increase in acidity. Studies show that elevated CO2 levels impair marine snails' predator-escape behavior by affecting their decision-making abilities. While snails retain their physical ability to jump, they show reduced jumping response, increased latency in jumping, and escape at closer angles to predators, making them more vulnerable to predation. This behavioral change is caused by CO2 interfering with their neurotransmitter receptor function.","context":["by Jennifer Fields\nOcean acidification is known to have significant impacts on marine invertebrates in terms of calcification and reproduction; however, the effects of increased CO2 on marine invertebrate behavior are largely unknown. Watson et al. (2014) predicted marine conch snail predator-escape behavior to its predator cone shell would be impaired with near-future CO2 levels. The authors found that the decision-making of the conch snail was in fact impaired by ocean acidification, leaving the snails more vulnerable to predation. The change in behavior was fully restored by treatment with gabazine, suggesting that changes in acid-base regulation caused by increased CO2 in the ocean interfere with the invertebrate’s neurotransmitter receptor function. These alterations in behavior in marine invertebrates could have wide-ranging implications for the whole entire marine ecosystem.\nOcean acidification decreases concentrations of calcium carbonate and can result in changes in organismal calcification, due to decrease in calcium carbonate, reproduction, and more recently, changes in marine organism behavior due to changes in the acid-base regulation in the nervous system. Some of these behavioral aspects that are altered by elevated CO2 in the water column include exercise ability, escape response, metabolism, unwariness of risks, and decision-making. This study authors measured the predator-escape behavior of a jumping conch snail, which has a modified foot that it uses to jump away from a predatory cone shell under current (405 ppm CO2; pH of 8.17) and end of century (961 ppm CO2; pH of 7.85) ocean acidification conditions through the several behavioral assays. The jumping snails were housed in separate groups in both the control and elevated-CO2 conditions in an aquarium facility for five days and were then tested. The behavioral assays were a self-righting experiment to determine whether or not elevated-CO2 affected the ability for the snail to jump. To measure the full escape response of the conch snail, the snail was placed within an arena with a predator cone shell. The escape response, including angle of escape and number of jumps was recorded. The oxygen consumption of the snail was also measured during jumping and stationary states to see if the metabolism was affected by the increase of CO2, which could have influence on the snail’s ability to escape. Finally, the snail’s ability to respond to its cone shell predator chemical cue was tested. To examine this, snails were placed in individual tanks with the addition of predator cue water, and the jumping response of the snail was recorded. The addition of gabazine, a GABA neurotransmitter antagonist, was used in some of the trials to test the involvement of ocean acidification on the nervous system, as previously tested with marine fish (Nilsson et al. 2012). The GABA neurotransmitter maintains the function of the decision-making and most behavior aspects of marine fish and invertebrates. Elevated-CO2 interferes with neurotransmitter interfered with and its function is impaired. Gabazine allows for that acid-base regulation to return to normal and prevent the GABA neurotransmitter from being blocked.\nAs previously predicted by the authors, elevated CO2 concentrations as predicted at the end of this century will have significant impacts on marine invertebrate behavior. Higher CO2 concentrations lead to a change of escape behavior in the marine jumping snail. These concentrations impaired its instinctual predator-escape response by affecting its decision-making. However, the snail’s physical ability to jump as tested in the self-righting and metabolism experiments was not affected, therefore, the capacity to escape was retained. Elevated CO2 caused a reduction in the jumping response of the snail as well as an increase in latency of jumping, thus increasing the exposure time to predation, and escape trajectory by the snails escaping at closer angle and distance to the predator. The anti-predator response of the jumping snail was fully restored in the elevated-CO2 group with the addition of gabazine, which suggests that GABA-like receptors are responsible for the changes in behavior in these invertebrates, similar to marine fish.\nThis change in decision-making can lead to decrease in predator avoidance, wariness, and/or escape behavior, which could cause an increase in mortality from predation. With the near-future ocean acidification scenario, it is possible that changes in predator-prey interactions will have wide-ranging negative impacts on the marine food web and the fisheries that depend on the stability of that delicate dynamic.\nWatson, S.A., Lefevre, S., McCormick, M.I., Domenici, P., Nilsson, G.E., Munday, P.L. 2014. Marine Mollusc Predator-escape Behaviour Altered by Near-future Carbon Dioxide Levels. Proc. R. Soc. B published ahead of print November 13, 2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2013.2377. http://royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1774/20132377.full","What is Ocean Acidification?\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when humans began burning coal in large quantities, the world’s ocean water has gradually become more acidic. Like global warming, this phenomenon, which is known as ocean acidification, is a direct consequence of increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth’s atmosphere.\nPrior to industrialization, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). With increased use of fossil fuels, that number is now approaching 400 ppm and the growth rate is accelerating. Scientists calculate that the ocean is currently absorbing about one quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans are emitting. When carbon dioxide combines with seawater, chemical reactions occur that reduce the seawater pH, hence the term ocean acidification.\nCurrently, about half of the anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon dioxide in the ocean is found in the upper 400 meters (1,200 feet) of the water column, while the other half has penetrated into the lower thermocline and deep ocean. Density- and wind-driven circulation help mix the surface and deep waters in some high latitude and coastal regions, but for much of the open ocean, deep pH changes are expected to lag surface pH changes by a few centuries.\nOcean acidification and global warming are different problems, but are closely linked because they share the same root cause—human emissions of carbon dioxide. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is now higher than it has been for the last 800,000 years and possibly higher than any time in the last 20 million years. Humans have thus far benefited from the ocean’s capacity to hold enormous amounts of carbon, including a large portion of this excess carbon dioxide. Had the ocean not absorbed such vast quantities of carbon dioxide, the atmospheric concentration would be even higher, and the environmental consequences of global warming (sea level rise, shifting weather patterns, more extreme weather events, etc.) and their associated socioeconomic impacts would likely be even more pronounced. However, the oceans cannot continue to absorb carbon dioxide at the current rate without undergoing significant changes in chemistry, biology, and ecosystem structure.\nMeasuring ocean acidification: Past and present\nScientists know that the oceans are absorbing carbon dioxide and subsequently becoming more acidic from measurements made on seawater collected during research cruises, which provide wide spatial coverage over a short time period, and from automated ocean carbon measurements on stationary moorings, which provide long-term, high-resolution data from a single location.\nThese records can be extended back through time using what are known as chemical proxies to provide an indirect measurement of seawater carbonate chemistry. A proxy is a measurement from a natural archive (ice cores, corals, tree rings, marine sediments, etc.) that is used to infer past environmental conditions. For example, by analyzing the chemical composition of tiny fossil shells found in deep ocean sediments, scientists have developed ocean pH records from ancient times when there were no pH meters. Furthermore, because the ocean surface water is in approximate chemical balance, or equilibrium, with the atmosphere above it, a record of historical ocean pH can be inferred from atmospheric carbon dioxide records derived from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, which contain air bubbles from the ancient atmosphere. Such evidence indicates that current atmospheric carbon dioxideconcentrations and ocean pH levels are at unprecedented for at least the last 800,000 years.\nGoing back deeper in Earth history to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary about 55 million years ago, scientists have found geochemical evidence of a massive release of carbon dioxide accompanied by substantial warming and dissolution of shallow carbonate sediments in the ocean. Although somewhat analogous to what we are observing today, this carbon dioxide release occurred over several thousand years, much more slowly than what we are witnessing today, thus providing time for the oceans partially to buffer the change. In the geologic record, during periods of rapid environmental change, species have acclimated, adapted or gone extinct. Corals have undergone large extinction events in the past (such the Permian extinction 250 million years ago), and new coral species evolved to take their place, but it took millions of years to recover previous levels of biodiversity.\nHow is ocean acidification affecting ocean chemistry?\nSeawater has a pH of 8.2 on average because it contains naturally occurring alkaline ions that come primarily from weathering of continental rocks. When seawater absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, carbonic acid is produced (see Box 1), reducing the water’s pH. Since the dawn of industrialization, average surface ocean pH has decreased to about 8.1.\nBecause the pH scale is logarithmic (a change of 1 pH unit represents a tenfold change in acidity), this change represents a 26 percent increase in acidity over roughly 250 years, a rate that is 100 times faster than anything the ocean and its inhabitants have experienced in tens of millions of years.\nAcidification can affect many marine organisms, but especially those that build their shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate, such as corals, oysters, clams, mussels, snails, and phytoplankton and zooplankton, the tiny plants and animals that form the base of the marine food web.\nThese “marine calcifiers” face two potential threats associated with ocean acidification: 1) Their shells and skeletons may dissolve more readily as ocean pH decreases and seawater becomes more corrosive; and 2) When CO2 dissolves in seawater, the water chemistry changes such that fewer carbonate ions, the primary building blocks for shells and skeletons, are available for uptake by marine organisms. Marine organisms that build shells or skeletons usually do so through an internal chemical process that converts bicarbonate to carbonate in order to form calcium carbonate.\nExactly how ocean acidification slows calcification rates, or shell formation, is not yet fully understood, but several mechanisms are being studied. Most hypotheses focus on the additional energy an organism must expend to build and maintain its calcium carbonate shells and skeletons in an increasingly corrosive environment. In the face of this extra energy expenditure, exposure to additional environmental stressors (increasing ocean temperatures, decreasing oxygen availability, disease, loss of habitat, etc.) will likely compound the problem.\nThese effects are already being documented in many marine organisms, particularly in tropical and deep-sea corals, which exhibit slower calcification rates under more acidic conditions. The impact on corals is of great concern because they produce massive calcium carbonate structures called reefs that provide habitat for many marine animals, including commercially important fish and shellfish species that use the reefs as nursery grounds. Coral reefs are vital to humans as sources of food and medicine, protection from storms, and the focus of eco-tourism. In addition to corals, studies have shown that acidification impairs the ability of some calcifying plankton, tiny floating plants and animals at the base of the food web, to build and maintain their shells. Scientists have also observed increased larval mortality rates of several commercially important fish and shellfish.\nWhat can we expect in the future?\nOcean acidification is occurring at a rate 30 to100 times faster than at any time during the last several million years driven by the rapid growth rate atmospheric CO2 that is almost unprecedented over geologic history. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), economic and population scenarios predict that atmospheric CO2 levels could reach 500 ppm by 2050 and 800 ppm or more by the end of the century. This will not only lead to significant temperature increases in the atmosphere and ocean, but will further acidify ocean water, reducing the pH an estimated 0.3 to 0.4 units by 2100, a 150 percent increase in acidity over preindustrial times. Assuming a “business-as-usual” IPCC CO2 emission scenario, predictive models of ocean biogeochemistry project that surface waters of the Arctic and Southern Oceans will become undersaturated with aragonite (a more soluble form of calcium carbonate) within a few decades, meaning that these waters will become highly corrosive to the shells and skeletons of aragonite-producing marine calcifiers like planktonic marine snails known as pteropods.\nAlthough ocean acidification has only recently emerged as a scientific issue, it has quickly raised serious concerns about the short-term impacts on marine organisms and the long-term health of the ocean. Scientists estimate that over the next few thousand years, 90 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will be absorbed by the ocean. This may potentially affect biological and geochemical processes such as photosynthesis and nutrient cycling that are vital to marine ecosystems on which human society and many natural systems rely. At the same time, marine organisms will face the enormous challenge of adapting to ocean acidification, warming water, and declining subsurface-ocean oxygen concentrations.\nNews & Insights\nWHOI working to address ocean acidification; protect region’s vital shellfish industry\nA new report addresses the impacts of ocean acidification in Massachusetts and New England coastal waters on the region’s vital seafood industry.\nOcean acidification gets a watchful eye in New England aquaculture ‘hot spot’\nShellfish aquaculture is thriving in New England, but future growth in the industry could be stunted as coastal waters in the region become more acidic.

{"question":"What are the key quality standards for code in digital transformation projects, and how do they relate to technical due diligence evaluations?","answer":"In digital transformation projects, code should meet similar quality standards as other business documents - it needs to be clear, concise, and professional, as it represents important business processes. The code should be readable by multiple people in the organization and maintain certain quality standards, similar to how other departments handle documentation. During technical due diligence evaluations, these quality aspects are examined through multiple lenses: architectural standards (including availability and scalability), process standards (such as development practices and incident management), organizational standards (including team composition and PDLC structure), and security standards (covering framework, prevention, detection, and response). Poor adherence to these standards can result in both immediate technical debt and long-term operational risks that affect business value.","context":["This article will discuss code quality in the context of large scale Digital Transformation. Specifically we will look at the disadvantages to allowing poor quality code to become embedded in your applications and assess some of the risks and costs it brings.\nDigital Transformation deals with both the people process and the technology that drives organisational change in order to compete digitally. Firstly we will take a look at couple of simple facts about Software Code in general and then position them into the context of Digital Transformation.\nThere are two high level observations that we can make about software in general:\nIn the context of a Digital Transformation that involves people processes and technology, all three have a dependency on digital systems which are powered by code and that code is extremely important.\nThe close relationship between Digital Transformation and Software Code\nThe code in your organisation holds business value and process; it's a sort of living breathing document which powers your digital infrastructure to do the things that you would otherwise have to do manually.\nIf we view code as a document expressing a business process then we must realize that like any other document in an organisation, it should have certain quality standards appertaining to it.\nThe code is describing something important and needs to be read by multiple people in an organisation. In almost every other department (legal, executive, marketing etc) there are implicit controls about the standard of documentation which circulates, even if this means people double checking emails that are sent before they hit 'send', re-reading important corporate documentation or even running spelling and grammar checks.\nAlmost every official documentation in an organisation is expected to be:\nIt would not be a good scenario if the CEO sent out an email with bad spelling and grammar, or a marketing executive put together a brief that didn't read correctly. We ensure that we don't do this in business because as professionals we don't want to waste each others time with low quality communication or create an inferior image.\nSo if this is a standard that we set with natural language documents why should software code be any different? It shouldn't be but unfortunately it often is.\nOnly a small slice of the company is able to reliably detect these code quality problems early on in the development process (the software developers themselves) so you can see how a business can potentially be exposed to a large amount of risk. This is because in almost every other process where complexity is involved there is some level of external auditing to make sure standards are adhered to.\nFor example; builders have a site foreman, accountants are independently audited and even doctor's results are scrutinized year upon year. However, with software this quality control often doesn't take place to a rigorous enough standard. Very often we just leave it to the teams that are writing the code and it's easy enough to see how quality problems can quietly creep in deep inside an organisation, slowly eroding the immense investment that they hold whilst they aren't even aware of the issue. Of course this isn't to say teams can't self-regulate; they often do and do it well (I have been on a number of them). But when we talk about quality control at an organisational level often this attitude of self regulation can leave gaping holes in a company's investment in digital infrastructure.\nInvariably as time passes, organisations eventually become aware that they have quality issues; excessive bugs, late releases, high developer churn and often the straight up inability to retain customers can all be symptoms of bad code ; we refer to this bad code as 'technical debt'.\nA study by Cast Software performed an audit of 75 code bases and produced some interesting but also quite startling costs which provide us with an indication as to the financial burden that problems with code quality can place upon an organisation. What they found is that on average a code base has exactly $2.82 of technical debt per line of code. What this means is an average cost of fixing some problems with that code base will equate to that cost per line. They identified problems by running a code analysis tool and identifying (Security, Performance, Robustness and Changeability) problems in the code. Whilst this automated tooling is not enough to spot software quality problems, it does provide us with at least a repeatable way of gathering data on this topic.\nThe conclusion was interesting; they found that the average size of a code base was 347,000 lines of code and this produces approximately $1,055,000 of technical debt! That means that on average a code base is carrying a million dollars worth of value locked up in 'Bad Code' or 'Technical Debt'.\n'The Average Technical Debt in a Code Base Equates to $1,055,000.'\nWe have seen how poor quality code can carry cost, but in the world of business it's impossible to address cost without considering risk. A high risk business venture may yield short term capital gains but if it promptly puts you out of business it probably isn't a wise move. So looking at code quality through the lens of risk is the second way to evaluate it.\nA study performed by Seapine cited data it collected which identified that 24% of organisations were seeking to reduce the risk of poor customer satisfaction from the digital products they provide. Interestingly, later on in the report, organisations claim that software quality and reliability are lifelines to securing long term customer retention and growth.\nThe relationship between cost and risk and code quality is inverselely proportional\nIf keeping customers happy is a core part of your business strategy then addressing quality in a pragmatic way will help you ensure your long term financial goals can be not only met but improved upon. This article has only cited a small amount of evidence but there are an abundance of independent research papers published which add to the argument that improved software quality helps to dramatically reduce costs.\nThe topic of marginal gains is an exciting new business topic that has emerged in recent years. It is related to being able to optimise at the small scale in order to produce seismic shifts at the large scale; the basic idea is that this is a bottom-up approach to business which uses, data, feedback and statistics at the micro level in order to drive strategy at the higher level.\nAn interesting article from the Economist goes into more detail about marginal gains. The great thing about taking code quality seriously in your organisation is that it is a very tangible asset which holds value in the form of information and process. If we are adopting a marginal gains approach to your business and are looking to optimise at the small level to drive higher competitiveness, then improving code quality provides a huge opportunity for maximizing growth. It does this firstly by addressing debt and secondly by driving greater customer experience.\nOrganisations can and do chug along with poor quality code and it is possible to keep the wheels turning without paying sufficient due care and attention.\nHowever, as we have seen, this comes loaded with higher risk and increased cost over the long term. If you then take this increased risk and cost to it's conclusion it will simply drag an organisation down to its weakest point and will make it uncompetitive.\nIn a modern Digital Transformation programme an organisation should firstly look to unlock the hidden value in improving code quality and reducing technical debt for direct cost savings. Secondly they can reduce operational risk and improve customer satisfaction by driving up the internal quality of their applications. Improving code quality should be used as a tool to leverage faster and more efficient Digital Transformation.","Managing Risk with Technical Due Diligence\nYou should not buy a home without an inspection by a licensed home inspector and you should not buy a used car without having a mechanic check it out for you. Diligence - it just makes good sense. Similarly, it is prudent to include technical diligence as part of the evaluation for a potential technology company investment.\nDiligence Informs Risk Management\nPrivate equity and venture capital firms typically evaluate many areas preceding a potential investment. The business case, legal structure, competitive analysis, product strategy, financial audits and contractual landscape are all examples of diligence deemed necessary prior to an investment. A company with a great product but three years left on an extremely expensive office lease will probably have a lower value. Breaking the lease or living with it until the term expires means higher costs and thus lower EBITDA. A hot start up with an inexperienced CFO that has run on cash-based accounting from day 1 and is rapidly approaching $6 million in annual revenue needs to move to accrual-based accounting. That takes time and effort and possibly a talent search - this affects the value of the investment.\nBut what about the technical underpinnings of the product itself? A company with a solitary production database and a marketing analyst with access to directly query that database is likely headed for performance and availability incidents. Single points of failure create a high probability of non-availability. Solutions that don’t allow for seamless and elastic scalability may run into either capacity or cost of operations problems.\nPreventing these incidents and altering the conditions that enabled them to exist takes time and effort. All of these assessment areas boil down to risk management. Further, understanding the cost of fixing these solutions helps a company understand their true cost of investment. Your investment includes not just the “PIC” or capital that you put into the company - it also includes all the costs to ensure continuing operations of the product that enables that company. A comprehensive diligence including technical diligence will prepare the investor to make an informed business decision - know the risks and adjust the value proposition accordingly.\nTechnology Risk Areas\nTechnology risks can be grouped into four broad areas - Architecture, Process, Organization, and Security. Each area has several subordinate themes.\nArchitecture - subordinate themes are availability, scalability, cost control.\n• Commodity hardware - Corollas, not Carreras\n• Horizontal scalability - scale out, not up\n• Design for monitoring - see issues before your customers do\n• N+1 design - everything fails eventually\n• Design for rollback - minimize the impairment\n• Asynchronous design - stateless systems\nProcess - subordinate themes are engineering, operations, and problem management\n• Product management - a product owner should be able add, delay, or deprecate features from an upcoming release\n• Metrics - development teams should use effort estimation and velocity measurement metrics to monitor progress and performance\n• Development practices - developers should conduct code reviews and be held accountable for unit testing\n• Incident management - incidents should be logged with sufficient details for further follow up\n• Post mortem - a structured process should be in place to review significant problems, assign action items, and track resolution\n• PDLC - the Product Development Lifecycle should align with the company’s desires to be customer driven (not desirable in most cases) or market driven (resulting in the highest returns and fastest saturation of any market)\nOrganization - subordinate themes are PDLC (Product Development Lifecycle) structure, product alignment and team composition\n• Product or Service Alignment - cross functional teams should be aligned by product or service and understand how their efforts complement business goals\n• Agile or Waterfall - if “discovering” the market or choosing the best possible product for a market then Agile is appropriate - if developing to well defined contracts then waterfall may be necessary.\n• Team composition - the engineer to QA tester ratio should ideally exceed 3.5:1. Significant deviations may be a sign or trouble or a harbinger of problems to come\n• Goals - measurable goals aligned with business priorities should be visible to all with clear accountability\nSecurity - subordinate themes are framework, prevention, detection and response\n• Framework - use NIST, ISO, PCI or other regulatory standards to establish the framework for a security program. The standards do overlap, think it through and avoid duplication of effort.\n• Policies in place - a sound security program will have multiple security related policies such as employee acceptable use, access controls, data classification, and an incident response plan.\n• Security risk matrix - security risks should be graded by their impact, probability of occurrence, and controlling measures\n• Business metrics - analysis of business metrics (revenue per minute, change of address, checkout value anomalies, file saves per minute, etc) can develop thresholds for alerting to a potential security incident. Over time, the analysis can inform prevention techniques.\n• Response plan - a plan must be in place and must have regular rehearsals.\nTechnology Cost Impact on Investment Value\nTechnology costs can have a significant impact on the overall investment value. Strengths and weaknesses uncovered during a technical diligence effort help the investor make the best overall business decision.\nTechnology costs are normally captured in 2 areas of the income statement, cost of revenue (production environment and personnel) and operating expenses (software development). Technology costs can also affect depreciation (server capital purchases) and amortization (pre-paid licensing and support). These cost areas should be reviewed for unusual patterns or abnormally high or low spend rates. It is also important to understand the term of equipment purchase, software licensing, and support contracts - spend may be committed for several years.\nCost Cautions - tales from the past\n• Support for production equipment purchased from a 3d party because the equipment is old and no longer supported by the OEM. Use equipment as long as possible, but don’t risk a production outage.\n• Constant software vendor license audits - they will find revenue, but the technology team that leaves their company vulnerable on a recurring basis is likely to have other significant issues.\n• Lack of an RFP or benchmarking process to periodically assess the cost effectiveness of hardware, software, hosting, and support vendors. Making a change in one of these areas is not simple, but the technology team should know how much they should pay before a change is better for the company.\nA technical diligence effort should also identify the level of technical debt and quantify the amount of engineering resources dedicated to servicing the technical debt.\nTechnical debt is a conscious choice to take a shortcut in the technology arena - the delta between the desired or intended way and quicker way. The shortcut is usually taken for time to market reasons and is a sound business decision within reason. Technical debt is analogous in many ways to financial debt - a complete lack of it probably means missed business opportunities while an excess means disaster around the corner.\nJust like financial debt, technical debt must be serviced, and it is serviced by the efforts of the engineering team - the same team developing the software. AKF recommends 12% to 25% of engineering effort be spent servicing technical debt. Whether that resource allocation keeps the debt static, reduces it, or allows it to grow depends upon the amount of technical debt. It is easy to see how a company delinquent in servicing their technical debt will have to increase the resource allocation to deal with it, reducing resources for product innovation and market responsiveness.\nPut It All Together\nThe investor has made use of several specialists in an overall diligence effort and is digesting the information to zero in on the choice to invest and at what price. The business side looks good - revenue growth, product strategy, and marketing are solid. The legal side has some risks relating to returning a leased office space to its original condition, but the lease has 5 years to run. Now for technology;\n• Tech refresh is overdue, so additional investment is needed or a move to the cloud accelerated - either choice puts pressure on thin margins.\n• An expensive RDBMS is in use, but the technology team avoids stored procedures and keeps their SQL as vanilla as possible - moving to open source is doable.\n• Technical debt service is constantly derailed by feature requests from sales and marketing. Additional resources, hired or contracted, will be needed and will raise the technology run rate. More margin pressure.\n• Conclusion - the investment needed to address tech refresh and technical debt changes the investment value. The investor lowers the offer price.\nInterested in learning more about technical due diligence?

{"question":"What are the diagnostic implications and symptom patterns for both celiac disease and lactose intolerance, particularly in terms of their onset and manifestation?","answer":"Lactose intolerance symptoms typically appear 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming dairy products, with onset varying by ethnicity - affecting African Americans as early as age 2 and Caucasians usually after age 5. It can be triggered by factors like bowel surgery, infections, or intestinal diseases. Celiac disease, on the other hand, can arise at any age and has a genetic component, with first-degree relatives having a 1 in 10 chance of developing the condition. While lactose intolerance produces symptoms from dairy consumption, celiac disease symptoms (including bloating, chronic diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and nausea) are triggered by gluten consumption, leading to immune system attacks on the small intestine's villi.","context":["Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose. Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products.\nLactase deficiency; Milk intolerance; Disaccharidase deficiency; Dairy product intolerance\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors:\nLactose intolerance happens when the small intestine does not make enough of the enzyme lactase. Enzymes help the body absorb foods. Not having enough lactase is called lactase deficiency.\nBabies' bodies make this enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk.\nPremature babies sometimes have lactose intolerance. Children who were born at full term usually do not show signs of lactose intolerance until they are at least 3 years old.\nLactose intolerance can begin at different times in life. In Caucasians, it usually affects children older than age 5. In African Americans, lactose intolerance often occurs as early as age 2.\nLactose intolerance is more common in people with Asian, African, Native American, or Mediterranean ancestry than it is among northern and western Europeans.\nLactose intolerance is very common in adults and is not dangerous. Approximately 30 million American adults have some amount of lactose intolerance by age 20.\nCauses of lactose intolerance include:\n- Bowel surgery\n- Infections in the small intestine from viruses or bacteria, which may damage the cells lining the intestine (most often in children)\n- Intestinal diseases such as celiac sprue\nSymptoms often occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after you eat or drink milk products, and are often relieved by not eating or drinking milk products. Large doses of milk products may cause worse symptoms.\nInfants or children may have slow growth or weight loss.\nSigns and tests:\nOther intestinal problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome , may cause the same symptoms as lactose intolerance.\nTests to help diagnose lactose intolerance include:\nDecreasing or removing milk products from the diet usually improves the symptoms.\nMost people with low lactase levels can drink 2 - 4 ounces of milk at one time (up to one-half cup) without having symptoms. Larger (more than 8 oz.) servings may cause problems for people with lactase deficiency.\nThese milk products may be easier to digest:\n- Buttermilk and cheeses (they have less lactose than milk)\n- Fermented milk products, such as yogurt\n- Goat's milk (but drink it with meals, and make sure it is supplemented with essential amino acids and vitamins if you give it to children)\n- Ice cream, milkshakes, and aged or hard cheeses\n- Lactose-free milk and milk products\n- Lactase-treated cow's milk for older children and adults\n- Soy formulas for infants younger than 2 years\n- Soy or rice milk for toddlers\nYou can add lactase enzymes to regular milk or take these enzymes in capsule or chewable tablet form.\nNot having milk in the diet can lead to a shortage of calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, and protein.\nYou may need to find new ways to get calcium into your diet (you need 1,200 - 1,500 mg of calcium each day):\n- Take calcium supplements\n- Eat foods that have more calcium (leafy greens, oysters, sardines, canned salmon, shrimp, and broccoli)\n- Drink orange juice that contains added calcium\nRead food labels. Lactose is also found in some non-milk products -- including some beers.\nSymptoms usually go away when you remove milk products or other lactose containing products from the diet.\nWeight loss and malnutrition are possible complications.\nCalling your health care provider:\nCall your health care provider if:\n- You have an infant younger than 2 or 3 years old who has symptoms of lactose intolerance.\n- Your child is growing slowly or not gaining weight.\n- You or your child has symptoms of lactose intolerance and you need information on food substitutes.\n- Your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment, or you develop new symptoms.\nThere is no known way to prevent lactose intolerance.\nIf you have the condition, avoiding or restricting the amount of milk products in your diet can reduce or prevent symptoms.\nGenauer CH, Hammer HF.

June 2009.","Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition characterized by an intolerance to gluten – a protein naturally present in wheat, rye, and barley, and which acts as a “glue” in foods such as bread, cereal, and pasta.\nWhen an individual with celiac disease consumes foods containing gluten, the body’s immune system attacks the small intestine, damaging finger-like projections called villi, which are important for absorption of nutrients from food.\nSymptoms of celiac disease include bloating, chronic diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, and nausea and vomiting.\nThe only way for people with celiac disease to avoid these symptoms is to adopt a gluten-free diet, but – as the new study affirms – it seems that even people without the condition are moving toward a preference for gluten-free foods.\nThe gluten-free diet has gained enormous popularity in recent years; according to market research company NPD, around 26-30 percent of adults in the U.S. claim to be reducing their gluten intake or avoiding gluten completely, despite not being diagnosed with any form of gluten sensitivity.\nThis dietary shift has been attributed to studies that claim avoiding gluten can have significant benefits for the average person, such as weight loss and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The gluten-free diet has even been touted by celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jenny McCarthy.\nSome studies, however – such as one published in the journal Gastroenterology in 2013 – claim that a gluten-free diet has no health benefits for people without celiac disease.\nAssessing prevalence of celiac disease, adherence to gluten-free diet\nFor this latest study, co-author Dr. Hyun-seok Kim, of Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, and colleagues set out to determine the prevalence of celiac disease in the U.S. in recent years, as well as adherence to a gluten-free diet.\n- Celiac disease is estimated to affect 1 in 100 people across the globe\n- The condition can arise at any age\n- Celiac disease is hereditary; people with a first-degree relative with the condition have a 1 in 10 chance of developing it themselves.\nThe team assessed 2009-2014 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), which included 22,278 individuals aged 6 years and older.\nDiagnosis of celiac disease among participants was established through blood tests, and information on adherence to a gluten-free diet was gathered through interviews.\nA total of 106 (0.69 percent) participants were diagnosed with celiac disease during the study period, the team found, while 213 (1.08 percent) subjects reported following a gluten-free diet, despite not receiving a diagnosis of celiac disease.\nApplying these numbers to the U.S. population, the team estimated that 1.76 million people have celiac disease, and 2.7 million people without celiac disease adhere to a gluten-free diet.\nLooking at the prevalence of celiac disease over the 6-year period, the researchers found it remained steady; prevalence was 0.70 percent in 2009-2010, 0.77 percent in 2011-2012, and 0.58 percent in 2013-2014.\nHowever, adherence to a gluten-free diet among individuals without celiac disease increased over the same period, with 0.52 percent following a gluten-free diet in 2009-2010, 0.99 percent in 2011-2012, and 1.69 percent in 2013-2014.\nThe researchers note that the small number of NHANES participants diagnosed with celiac disease is a major limitation, as is the small number of people without the condition who reported following a gluten-free diet.\nWhy are more people going gluten-free?\nThe team says it is possible that adherence to a gluten-free diet has increased because gluten has been identified as a risk factor for celiac disease, and in turn, this could explain why prevalence of celiac disease has not risen.\nHowever, the researchers say it is also possible that more people without celiac disease are adopting a gluten-free diet because of widespread perceptions that it is healthier.\nWhat is more, greater availability of gluten-free products may have also spurred greater adherence to a gluten-free diet.\n“[…] there is also an increasing number of individuals with self-diagnosed gluten sensitivity but not the typical enteropathic or serologic features of celiac disease who have improved gastrointestinal health after avoidance of gluten-containing products,” the authors add.\nIn an editorial linked to the study, Dr. Daphne Miller, of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of California-San Francisco, says these findings should not dismiss gluten-free as a beneficial diet for people without celiac disease.\n“Although the choice to be gluten-free may be driven in part by marketing and a misperception that\ngluten-free is healthier, it is important that this choice not be dismissed as an unfounded trend except for those with celiac disease and wheat allergy,” she notes.\n“Instead, researchers and clinicians can use this as an opportunity to understand how factors associated with this diet affect a variety of symptoms, including gastrointestinal function, cognition, and overall well-being.”\nLearn about whether a gluten-free diet is good for children."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ff31d05c-f9a8-4975-9e3c-b03c7e70c42f>","<urn:uuid:a1646263-4352-4f3d-958b-68ff359ecd97>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare how tannins are managed or modified during the ripening process between wine grapes and persimmons? I'm particularly interested in how the maturation process affects their astringency levels.","answer":"In wine grapes, tannin management occurs both in the vineyard and winery. During grape ripening, tannins change naturally and can be affected by agricultural practices like pruning - unripe tannins taste different from ripe ones, making harvest timing crucial. In the winery, tannin intensity can be moderated through aging, increased through oak barrel aging, or softened through bottle aging. For persimmons, the ripening process naturally binds up the tannins into storage cells, making them unable to react with proteins in the mouth. While both ripe and unripe persimmons contain similar amounts of tannins, only in ripe fruit are they bound up and unable to cause astringency. This process can be accelerated when the fruit produces acetaldehyde under oxygen-deprived conditions at warm temperatures.","context":["What is in a Glass of Wine serves as a foundation for learning about the chemical components of wine: This post is about tannins in wine but there are also acid, alcohol, sugars and aromatic components…Though water remains the most abundant.\nThese components, called “Structural Components”, help define the taste of wine, and they are very helpful in understanding the wide variety of aromas, flavors, tastes and textures of wine. This series of posts explains how these components appear in wine and how they affect the taste, with special attention on the different aspects that can make them change or evolve.\nHere it comes: What is in a Glass of Wine? (III): Tannins\nAmong the 3% of other components of wine, in this video we take a look at tannins.\nWhat are tannins?\nTannins are components responsible for the structure of the wine and belong to a chemical group called phenolic components. Among them, there are other famous substances of wine, like anthocyanins (responsible for the color of wine) and resveratrol (well-known and discussed due to its antioxidant properties).\nBiologically, tannins are molecules developed by plants as natural defenses and preservatives… And they affect the taste of the wine. Tannins come from the skins, the seeds or the stems of the grapes and are also present in wood. So, wines fermented in contact with the skins, seeds or stems of the grapes or aged in oak barrel, have tannins. According to the winemaking techniques, red wines and rosé wines always have tannins. White wines can have tannins too if they spend time in oak.\nHow tannins are perceived?\nTannins in wine are described as structure, as a sensation of dryness and bitterness. The dryness is caused because tannin molecules associate with saliva molecules, “kidnapping” them that makes the mouth feel dry with no saliva. Tannins also have a bitter taste, noticeable in the center and at the back of the tongue.\nThe taste and intensity of tannins depend on the grape variety. Here is a scale of some varieties ordered by the intensity of their tannins (from less to more tannic):\nLESS TANNIC – Gamay – Pinot Noir – Sangiovese – Grenache – Zinfandel – Syrah – Malbec – Merlot – Mourvèdre – Cabernet Franc – Cabernet Sauvignon – Petite Syrah – Nebbiolo – MORE TANNIC\nThe perception of tannins depends on 2 factors:\n– The management of the vineyard: tannins change in the grape during the ripening process. This ripening process can be affected by several agricultural practices as pruning. Unripe tannins taste different than ripe tannins, so the level of ripening or maturation of tannins when the grape is harvested is crucial to the final taste of the wine.\n– The winemaking process: many techniques in the winery affect intensity of tannins. They can be moderated by aging the wine, increasing their intensity by aging in oak barrels or softening their intensity by aging in the bottle.\nPerception of tannins depends not only on the amount of tannins wine has, but also on the quality and characteristics of these tannins.\nRemember that tannins make a drying sensation in the mouth? Therefore, something you eat and pair with wine can affect the taste of wine. For example, pairing high tannic wine (which dries the mouth) with rich and oily food like lamb, pork chops or cheese softens the impact of the tannins.\nIn Spanish, there is a curious saying: “do not let them to give it to you with cheese”. This reflects the idea that a harsh, unbalanced wine with unripe tannins can appear better to your palate paired with a rich food such as cheese.\nWhat else about tannins?\nSince tannins are natural preservatives of the wine, wines that have a good tannic structure age better that wines that don’t.\n⇒ See related posts:\nLast note: I’ve separated this post in 4 parts, so they are easy to manage.

By examining ripe and unripe fruit treated with an iron solution, the student will compare the effect of tannins when they are diffused throughout an unripe fruit and when they are bound up in a ripe fruit. By forcing the projection of acetaldehyde, students will learn how how tannins can be bound up – and thereby “defanged”.\nThe goal is to examine astringency in food products and ways of minimizing that astringency.\nMaterials and Equipment\n- Persimmons (get the American or Hachiya persimmons. Other types will not work!) If you live in a place where persimmons grow, you can use the fruit on your trees.)\n- Iron solution\n- Magnifying lens (optional)\n- Baking soda\n- Saran Wrap\n*Almost all of these materials can be found at the grocery store. An iron solution can be found in plant nurseries or aquarium stores. In a pinch, ground iron filings can be used instead.\nAmerican persimmons are commonly found hanging on trees in the autumn months. When unripe, these orange spheres are so astringent that they are inedible. The ripe fruit is tasty, but has not been used commercially because the fruit becomes increasingly mushy as it ripens. It is highly desirable to find a way to ripen this fruit while maintaining a nice firm texture so that the fruit can be packed and shipped.\nA class of chemicals called tannins is responsible for this astringent taste. While ripe and unripe fruit both have roughly the same amount of tannins, the tannins in ripe fruit get bound up so they cannot react with the proteins on one’s tongue and saliva.\n- What makes persimmons so astringent?\n- Can the astringency be removed?\n- What effect does oxygen have on the ripening process?\n- What effect does acetaldehyde have on the ripening process?\nTerms, Concepts and Questions to Start Background Research\nUnripe persimmons are inedible because of the tannins that are diffused throughout the fruit. This tannins cause proteins in the saliva and tongue to coagulate. This coagulation of proteins produces the puckery, furry taste in the mouth that we refer to as astringency. This also happens with unripe bananas, some red wine and tea.\nAs ripening takes place, the tannins get bound up in storage cells. This prevents the reaction in the mouth from taking place. When fruit is deprived of oxygen, the fruit uses up the remaining oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide helps the fruit make acetaldehye, which, in turn, causes the tannins to move into storage cells. This process can be speeded up at warm temperature (but not so warm as to damage the fruit!)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aaa816cc-b674-4788-8cd8-41f2a2dfdadc>","<urn:uuid:5bcfd783-1596-4c6b-9cf5-aff43a1db437>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain the relationship between radial velocity measurements and calcium index corrections in detecting Earth-like planets, and compare this with dark matter detection techniques used in experiments like DAMA/LIBRA?","answer":"Radial velocity measurements for detecting Earth-like planets require corrections using the calcium (Ca) index to account for stellar convection effects. When using Ca index corrections, detection limits can improve from above 7 MEarth to potentially reaching 1 MEarth, but this requires excellent sampling (>1000 observations) and very high Ca signal-to-noise ratio (>130). Similarly, dark matter detection experiments like DAMA/LIBRA also require careful correction methods, but for background radiation from rocks and cosmic rays. DAMA/LIBRA uses sodium iodide crystals with sensitive photodetectors to detect light flashes from potential dark matter particle collisions, and must account for annual variations in the signal that could be due to Earth's orbital motion relative to galactic dark matter or other terrestrial factors.","context":["Volume 551, March 2013\n|Number of page(s)||17|\n|Section||Planets and planetary systems|\n|Published online||01 March 2013|\nUsing the Sun to estimate Earth-like planets detection capabilities\nIV. Correcting for the convective component\nUJF-Grenoble 1/CNRS-INSU, Institut de Planétologie et d’Astrophysique de Grenoble (IPAG) UMR 5274, 38041 Grenoble, France\nReceived: 29 June 2012\nAccepted: 12 December 2012\nContext. Radial velocity (RV) time series are strongly impacted by the presence of stellar activity. In a series of papers, we have reconstructed solar RV variations over a full solar cycle from observed solar structures (spots and plages) and studied their impact on the detectability of an Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone of the Sun as seen edge-on from a neighbour star in several typical cases. We found that the convective contribution dominates the RV times series.\nAims. The objective of this paper is twofold: to determine detection limits on a Sun-like star seen edge-on with different levels of convection and to estimate the performance of the activity correction using a Ca index.\nMethods. We apply two methods to compute the detection limits: a correlation-based method and a local power analysis method, which both take into account the temporal structure of the observations. Furthermore, we test two methods using a Ca index to correct for the convective contribution to the RV: a sinusoidal fit to the Ca variations and a linear fit to the RV-Ca relation. In both cases, we use observed Ca and reconstructed Ca to study the various effects and limitations of our estimations.\nResults. We confirm that an excellent sampling is necessary to have detection limits below 1 MEarth (e.g. 0.2−0.3 MEarth) when there is no convection and a low RV noise. With convection, the detection limit is always above 7 MEarth. The two correction methods perform similarly when the Ca time series are noisy, leading to a significant improvement (down to a few MEarth), which is above the 1 MEarth limit. With a very good Ca noise (signal to noise ratio, S/N, around 130), the sinusoidal method does not get significantly better because it is dominated by the fact that the solar cycle is not sinusoidal, but the RV-Ca method can reach the 1 MEarth for an excellent Ca noise level.\nConclusions. For Sun-like conditions and under the simplifying assumptions considered, we first conclude that the detection limit of a few MEarth planet can be reached providing good sampling and Ca noise. The detection of a 1 MEarth may be possible, but only with an excellent temporal sampling and an excellent Ca index noise level: we estimate that a probability larger than 50% to detect a 1 MEarth at 1.2 AU requires more than 1000 well-sampled observations and a Ca S/N larger than 130.\nKey words: techniques: radial velocities / Sun: activity / Sun: surface magnetism / stars: early-type\n© ESO, 2013\nCurrent usage metrics show cumulative count of Article Views (full-text article views including HTML views, PDF and ePub downloads, according to the available data) and Abstracts Views on Vision4Press platform.\nData correspond to usage on the plateform after 2015.

New research suggests that this halo could extend out to a million light-years. A new experiment is coming online in Australia soon that could potentially help resolve the existence of this mysterious material.\nHow big is the Milky Way? Given our location, buried deep within the spiral disk that defines our galaxy, this has been a difficult question to answer. Over the last century, astronomers have surveyed the sky and charted the distances to stars, revealing the disk of the Milky Way to be about 160,000 light-years across, showing warps and flairs of galactic collisions, and circling the immense bulge of stars hosts the black hole at its heart.\nThe edge of the Milky Way’s stellar disk is not well-defined, but the density of stars falls rapidly after about 80,000 light-years from the Galactic centre. Astronomers can point to this and be confident that the vast majority of stars lie within this radius. But have they truly established the edge of the Galaxy?\nBy the late twentieth century, astronomers realised there was a lot more to a galaxy than the starlight we see. By tracing the motions of gas and stars, astronomers, including Vera Rubin in the US and Australia’s Ken Freeman, realised that there was also unseen mass, a lot of unseen mass, more than ten times that is visible. We now know that this “dark matter” dominates the mass of the Milky Way, and every other galaxy we have observed.\nScience Check: What is Dark Matter?\nEverything we can see in our Universe, through the interaction of electromagnetic radiation is considered baryonic, or ‘normal’, matter. This matter absorbs, reflects, emits and interacts with electromagnetic spectrum (such as radio waves, visible light waves, x-rays). But matter can also be detected through its gravitational influence - and the more matter (mass) an object has, the higher its gravitational influence.\nIn 1933, Fritz Zwicky (a colourful character) was observing the Coma galaxy cluster and measured the total light the cluster produced by its galactic members. He was also able to measure the motion and velocities of individual galaxies within these clusters - which is when he stumbled across something interesting.\nThere was too much gravity, which in turn was driving higher velocities of galaxies, that could be accounted for - based on the amount of light the cluster was outputting. There was an unseen, dark matter that was generating more gravity.\nFor decades there was not much interest in the idea until, by the 1970s, new technology and new observations started to hint that something strange was going on. Astronomers including Ken Freeman in Australia and Vera Rubin in the US deduced that there was indeed an additional gravitational signature surrounding galaxies that could not be accounted for with the visible light measured. The idea of Dark Matter was reignited.\nIn the late 1990s, astrophysicists were studying the expansion of the Universe by observing distant supernovae explosions using the Hubble Space Telescope - and found that counter to what was expected - the Universe was expanding at an accelerated rate. They termed this force, Dark Energy and were able to calculate how much of the total energy density of the Universe it contained.\nIt turned out that this force accounted for the majority component of our Universe - roughly 68%. Once scientists knew this value, they could then place a value against the total amount of dark matter in the Universe, and it turns out it’s about 27%. This means - everything else we see and have ever observed with our variety of telescopes, all the “normal” (baryonic) matter - only makes up 5% of the entire Universe.\nWhere is Dark Matter in our Galaxy?\nDark matter is spread more extensively than stars, and astronomers wondered how much further it went, but being invisible, detecting any edge in dark matter is far more difficult than for stars. Now Alis Deason, a Royal Society Researcher at the University of Durham, thinks she has the answer.\nDeason and her international team started by looking at synthetic universes, supercomputer simulations of the evolution of matter in an expanding cosmos. These simulations are extremely detailed, allowing astronomers to trace the flow of gas into stars, and the impact of supernovae and black holes on the growth of galaxies. And, of course, they can accurately map out the ebb and flow of dark matter and its impact on the stars we can see.\nDeason found that the distribution of dark matter influenced the motions of dwarf galaxies, small systems with only a few billion stars, as they orbited a larger galaxy. Importantly, the orbital properties of the dwarfs also revealed the location of the edge of dark matter, where its gravitational influence dwindled rapidly.\nLooking at the dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way, Deason concluded that the edge of the Milky Way’s dark matter lies almost one million light-years from the centre of the Galaxy. This is an astonishingly large distance, much larger than the extent of the stellar disk. But it is also surprising as the Milky Way is not alone in this patch of the universe.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is about two million light-years from the Milky Way, and observations suggest that its mass is comparable to our own. Given that Andromeda is heading towards the Milky Way at about 120km/s, in a few billion years the two galaxies will collide, destroying their spiral structure, and merging into a featureless elliptical galaxy. But given that the extensive dark matter haloes of these two giant galaxies are probably already in contact, the true collision has already begun.\nDark Matter Experiments\nThe true nature of dark matter remains a mystery, a mystery that is the focus of astronomers and physicists around the globe. Most think that it is a fundamental particle, something that we have not nailed down in our theories or observed at the Large Hadron Collider, so the hunt continues. Some tantalizing clues have come from an experiment in Italy, in a laboratory hidden in the Gran Sasso road tunnel under the Alps. Here sits DAMA/LIBRA, a series of sodium iodide crystals encased in sensitive photodetectors, waiting to detect a tiny flash of light if a dark matter particle crashed into an atom in the crystal. The experiment is sensitive to background radiation from the rocks in the tunnel and cosmic rays from space and it’s essential that physicists can accurately calibrate this in the search for dark matter.\nDAMA is not the only “direct detection” experiment search for dark matter, but it is the one that claimed an intriguing detection. As well as the background, DAMA sees an excess in light flashes which they interpret as being interactions with dark matter particles. But this signal is not constant but smoothly varies over the period of a year.\nWhat is the source of this variation? Physicists suggest that it might be due to the Earth’s orbit about the Sun, which is strongly tilted with regards to the Sun’s motion around the Galaxy. For a portion of the Earth’s orbit, its motion adds to that of the Sun, whilst the other portion of the orbit subtracts from the Solar motion. This means that the Earth motion changes relative to the underlying dark matter of the Galaxy and this modulates the rate of dark matter detections in DAMA.\nOf course, there are many other things that vary on the timescale of a year, such as the seasons and even the quantity of traffic flowing through the Gran Sasso tunnel, and physicists are continually checking whether all these external effects could be producing the observed signal.\nHunting Dark Matter in Australia\nOne obvious test would be to examine the signal of an instrument like DAMA in the Southern Hemisphere as if the observed signal is due to dark matter, it should match that seen in the North, but if it is due to something boring like weather or people heading on holiday, then the signal should be shifted by six months. But, as yet, such a functioning dark matter detector does not exist. Yet!\nEarly next year, in a gold mine in the town of Stawell in Victoria, SABRE, short for Sodium-iodide with Active Background Rejection, will be turned on, with an identical detector opening Italy. As more sensitive versions of DAMA, these will search for the annual variation already claimed, and in a few years, we will know whether the claimed variations are terrestrial and boring, or extra-terrestrial and represent the first true detection of dark matter.\nVery soon, we might actually shine a light on the dark side that dominates the Milky Way.\nPROF.

{"question":"How did the scale of stone quarrying compare between medieval French cathedral construction and ancient Egyptian architecture? I'm interested in understanding the differences in their building materials and construction methods.","answer":"In medieval France from 1050-1350, more stone was quarried than in the entire history of ancient Egypt. While both civilizations used stone extensively, they had different approaches based on local conditions. Medieval French builders primarily used limestone, working with skilled stonecutters who marked their work for payment. The ancient Egyptians mainly used limestone, sandstone, and granite, but notably didn't use wood due to Egypt's dry climate. Instead, they relied on sun-baked mud bricks from the Nile River for common buildings. The transportation methods also differed - medieval French builders used horses and citizen laborers (who received religious indulgences), while the Egyptians likely used sledges lubricated with water to move stones across the desert.","context":["NOTE: Removed blog post 5, and doubled the length of this one.\nWhat is an ambition so grand as a Gothic cathedral without the workers to complete it? An effort as large as this took hundreds to thousands of people, working between the stone quarries and the work sites. In the quarries, skilled stonecutters plied their mallets and chisels to cut down limestone blocks as much as possible. Even in the middle ages, efficiency was key. The less they had to transport from the quarry to the build site, the easier it would be for them in the long run. For this reason, cathedrals were often built a short distance from a quarry. Given the number of limestone pits that existed in Europe at the time, this was not a difficult task. There were so many cathedrals constructed during this period, in fact, that “More stone was quarried in France [from 1050-1350] than in ancient Egypt during its whole history” (Gimpel).\nIn addition to shaping the stone, stonecutters would often make a mark on it indicating that they were the ones to cut the stone. Being paid by the piece, this was a convenient way to both show off one’s workmanship and tally your payment. When the stonecutters finished cutting their stone in the quarry, they would usually move on to another job. Being skilled labor, these masons could find work elsewhere, since there were usually several construction projects going on at one time.\nMason’s mark on a stone in the Durham Cathedral.\nOf course, the stone needed to get to the build site somehow. Some construction crews had horses or other animals to lug the cut stone up the roads, but the church would also hire average citizens to pick up the slack in transportation. Because the church funds were always tied up in the skilled labor and build costs, they would offer indulgences- forgiveness of sins- for those laborers who participated willingly in this work of the Lord.\nThe other group, those at the building site, was much more occupationally diverse. Unskilled laborers dug out foundations and removed other detritus around the site, while the skilled plaster-men, masons, glaziers and others laid the actual stones. These men used many tools in their work, including plumb lines and levels to ensure complete accuracy. In addition, based on recent research, they would also have been reinforcing walls and pillars with iron, perhaps laying stones in place in or around iron supports.\nGothic illuminated rendition of the construction of the Tower of Babel. Workers include the stonecutter, the mortar carrier and the masons laying stones.\nAs for lifting the heavy stones into place, any manner of windlass would do this job. Smaller stones could take a simple pulley, while larger ones worked with a setup at the top of the vault, where one person would walk inside a wooden treadmill. In this instance, they themselves were the pulleys. Everyone in the build site had a vested interest in working quickly, whatever their job, for while the stone quarry functioned year-round, the build site shut down in the winter as the all-important mortar froze and would not adhere to the stones.\nAnother example of Gothic construction. There is a windlass in the upper left lifting stones up to the masons. In the lower right, a stonecutter utilizes a c-square for exact corners on his stones.\nFinally, once the frame of the building was nearing completion, only then would the sculptors and glassmakers do their parts. Broken statues and shattered glass do nobody any good. Their processes are covered in the section on integration of art.\nWhile every worker had their role, hundreds of disparate workers do not a cathedral make. They needed a leader, whether they liked it or not. The master masons were those leaders. Very highly respected in the community, they were revered to the point that in some Gothic art, God was depicted as a master mason, complete with cap, gown and measuring tools. However, despite their status and mastery, early medieval master masons were also described as typical overbearing, micro managing bosses. Jacques de Vitry and Nicolas de Biard, French writers and critics are quoted as complaining that master masons did nothing but order their workers around, receiving a ludicrously high salary in exchange for no real labor.\nThese criticisms are not unfounded. The master masons certainly knew what they were talking about. They were the designers, rather than the builders. Your average master mason, of which there were only a couple hundred, had an average education. They knew how to read and write, but more importantly, they had an innate grasp of math and geometry and the know-how and experience to apply it. They dealt practically, most often by rule of thumb, since they had none of our modern engineering training to utilize. They designed the cathedrals on the tracing floor with nothing but their c-squares, their compasses and their minds to guide them.\nNow, given all these unskilled workers, plus masons, stonecutters, glassworkers, sculptors, and master masons, and the colossal amounts of stone, glass, iron and other materials, where does all this money come from? The short answer is the church. The longer answer, of course, is much more complicated. The laws in the Catholic Church varied during the middle ages, and at first required that “all clerical beneficiaries had to give support commensurate with their means” (Scholler), when a church needed renovation or rebuilding. However, this changed with the advent of a specific fund designated for building, the ‘bona fabricae’, and only had to provide from their own salary when absolutely necessary.\nWhere did they get the money for the bona fabricae? Besides the obvious tithes and offerings, the Catholic Church had many methods to make money. In many cases, people would pay well to see ancient relics. Sometimes the church could elicit extra donations to build a fitting home for a relic belonging in the area, or sometimes they would even send their relics ‘on tour’, so to speak, and bring income from other regions paying to see the marvelous item. In addition, the churches brought in money from several other widespread sources, from food produced by monks to rent money off of a piece of land.\nAs incredible as the cathedrals are, some believe that the overwhelming political power of the Catholic Church had an economically detrimental effect on the middle ages. In her thesis on the costs of Gothic cathedrals, Amy Denning discovers that “over this 150-year period [in the high Middle Ages], on average, 21.5 percent of the regional economy was devoted to the construction of these Gothic churches, 1.5 percent of which is directly related to the implicit cost of labor… during the period known as the High Middle Ages, between 1100-1250, the Catholic Church built over 1400 Gothic churches in the Paris Basin alone.” This is certainly a colossal investment, and Denning argues that sinking such incredible amounts of money into these projects had an economic impact that prolonged the Middle Ages by several hundred years.\nWhether this is true or not, it is unarguable that the Catholic Church had highly effective methods at its disposal to pay for everything they needed, be it materials or skilled labor, and these monies were not carelessly spent- the countless Gothic cathedrals still standing after over 500 years are a testament to that.","Ancient Egyptian Architecture\nThe architecture of this ancient country is one of the most fascinating parts of not just ancient Egypt’s history but the history of the world. The Egyptian’s constructed grand temples and pyramids which have survived the ravages of time and continue to attract the attention of scientists and common people alike. Most ancient Egyptian architecture was inspired from the theology of ancient Egypt which was mainly polytheistic, although during later times of the Egyptian empire monotheism was introduced. Some of the most magnificent masterpieces of ancient Egyptian architecture include the Pyramid of Giza, the Great Sphinx of Giza, and the famous Temple of Horus.\nPreliminary forms of ancient Egyptian architecture existed from the beginning of the Egyptian kingdom as early as 3150 BC. However, structures of importance began to be constructed mainly during the Second and Third Dynasties, around 2700 BC. It was during this time of that step pyramids began to be constructed which eventually became the precursors of the later actual pyramids. The Pyramid of Giza and the Great Sphinx were constructed around 2600 BC during the Fourth Dynasty. The practice of constructing grand pyramids in ancient Egypt ceased around 1700 BC but other structures continued to be built. For instance, the famous Temple of Edfu was built during the Ptolemaic Period which fell between 237 BC and 57 BC.\nCharacteristics of Egyptian Architecture\nPerhaps the chief characteristic of ancient Egyptian architecture was the conspicuous absence of wood in the structures. This was because Egypt was a dry land and it was not possible to find abundant wood to use in construction, other materials such as sun-baked mud brick and limestone were therefore used. Common houses were built from mud extracted from the Nile River. The ancient Egyptian architecture of grand religious monuments and temples has a few common characteristics as well, for instance, they had thick and sloping walls with only a few openings. Huge stone blocks were used in to construct flat roofs of temples and these roofs were supported by large beams and columns. Ancient Egyptian architecture was fairly advanced with respect to building standards and techniques used at the time.\nBuilding Materials used in by the ancient Egyptians\nThe most common building materials that were used in ancient Egyptian architecture were sun-baked mud bricks and stones. Limestone was the primary form of stone used in architecture, although sandstone and granite were also frequently used. Eventually, stone became to be used almost exclusively for temples and tombs while houses and even palaces were constructed with bricks. One of the most important features of ancient Egyptian architecture is that no wood was used in construction.\nAncient Egyptian Building Methods\nVarious innovative construction techniques and methods were employed for ancient Egyptian architecture. Since there is a difference in the construction of earlier and later buildings, particularly the pyramids, it is clear that these techniques evolved over time. Various hypotheses exist for the construction methods that were employed for ancient Egyptian architecture. The central problem to be tackled was to move the large blocks of stone across the desert. Special tools were used to cut the stones in the quarries. The generally accepted hypothesis for the transportation of these stones to the construction sites is that sledges used to transport these stones were lubricated by water which made it easier to drag the large weight on the sand. However it is still not known conclusively exactly how the Egyptians managed to build such precise and sophisticated structures which would be challenging even with modern technology.\nArchitects of Ancient Egypt\nNames of various famous architects of ancient Egyptian architecture can be found in historical records. One of the most famous architects was Amenhotep who was also a priest and a scribe. He was born during the reign of Thutmose III and supervised the construction of various famous monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon. Other famous architects of ancient Egyptian architecture included Amenhotep III who was also the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Imhotep, and Senenmut etc.\nFamous Pieces of Architecture in Egypt\nA wide variety of famous Egyptian architecture has survived the intervening centuries and continues to be included in the wonders of the ancient world. The most obvious examples are the Great Pyramid of Giza and the Great Sphinx which were built around 2500 BC during the reign of pharaoh Khafire. The Great Pyramid of Khufu is another architectural wonder of ancient Egyptian architecture and was built by Pharaoh Khufu. Other noteworthy examples of ancient Egyptian architecture include the religious site of Karnak with its giant columns, the rock temple of Abu Simbel, Valley of the Kings, Red Pyramid, Luxor Temple, Step Pyramid of Djoser, the Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut, and others. These great structures of ancient Egyptian architecture continue to be a source of fascination for people of all ages.\nGrand Buildings and Temples\nThe main emphasis that was given to the construction in their architecture was the building of temples and grand buildings. The most important examples are the pyramids which served as the burial site for the pharaohs. Among the temples, The Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut is noteworthy which is located on the west bank of the Nile. It was constructed during the reign of the Pharaoh Hatshepsut and the construction was overlooked by the royal architect named Senenmut. The temple consists of three layered terraces which reach to the height of about 97 feet. Another example is the Luxor Temple in the ancient city of Thebes. This temple was dedicated to three Egyptian gods named Amun, Mut, and Chons. Other grand religious constructions of architecture include the Temple of Abu Simbel and the religious site of Karnak.\nAncient Egyptian Architecture in Summary\nAncient Egyptian architecture is the most fascinating and awesome architecture of the ancient world and it is hard to find any other examples during the same era. The main driving force behind the construction of these monuments, temples, and pyramids was the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians. For instance, the pyramids served as the burial sites of the pharaohs and the temples were dedicated to various gods of ancient Egypt. Various kinds of materials including stones and bricks were used in the construction of these buildings, however, wood is conspicuously missing from ancient Egyptian architecture because Egypt was a dry land and procuring massive amounts of wood for construction was not possible."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d83ebde9-dff5-4783-b3b1-c15ee2d66656>","<urn:uuid:50fea2f9-43bd-46b6-a29d-5ad31374e649>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Analyze how physical shape affects movement patterns in Conolampas and Candy Cane Coral - 请解释形态对运动模式的影响","answer":"Conolampas and Candy Cane Coral have very different morphologies that influence their movement. Conolampas has a cone-shaped body with fine, hair-like spines and tube feet that allow it to move across sediment, leaving distinctive trails as it feeds on carbonate grains and foraminiferans. It has more spines around its flattened bottom edge to assist movement. In contrast, Candy Cane Coral has branching polyps with short sweeping tentacles (about 2 inches long) that extend primarily for feeding rather than locomotion, as it remains fixed in place after settlement.","context":["What is Conolampas?\nConolampas is a member of the Irregularia, a major subgroup within the Echinoidea aka the Sea Urchins.\nThe \"irregular\" sea urchins includes all those which have become modified to live in or on unconsolidated sediment (i.e., mud, dirt, sand, etc.)..Sea biscuits (spatangoids), and sand dollars (clypeasteroids) are \"irregular\" sea urchins.\nIrregular urchins are unusual in that they have\n1. Bilateral symmetry imposed over their typical echinoderm 5-part symmetry 2. Instead of big, solid rigid spines, they have fine, hair-like spines that are adapted to burrowing or at least, not getting in the way of burrowing...\n3. A modified or absent jaw (aka Aristotle's Lantern).\n4. An anus and/or mouth moved into different positions relative to \"regular\" sea urchins.\nIrregular urchins live all around the world.\nSand dollars tend to live in shallow habitats whereas sea biscuits (aka spatangoids) live in shallow and deep-sea habitats.\nSpatangoids are very diverse and can get VERY weird very quickly... Conolampas itself is not known from fossils (although some of its close relatives were around during the time of the dinosaurs) and is known from one species in the Atlantic (west indies) and three in the Indo-Pacific.\nSo, what's cool about Conolampas?\nShape! The great Echinologist Alexander Agassizi described this animal in 1878 (pg. 190) and named the species after Captain Sigsbee, the commanding officer of the U.S. Coast Survey Steamer Blake which collected the first known specimens of this species.\nAgassiz was SO impressed by this critter that the first thing he had to say about it in the original description is this:\nThis magnificent species is by far the most striking sea urchin I have seen. I shall always remember the particular haul when, on the edge of the Yukatan Bank, the dredge came up containing half a dozen of these huge brilliant lemon-colored Echini.The overall body shape of this animal looks like this... The top is here...\nand as you can see, the bottom actually FLATTENS out..\nThe scientific name of this animal, Conolampas can be broken down into \"Conos\" for \"Cone shaped\" and \"lampas\" for Lamp...hence.. Cone-shaped Lamp (old fashioned lamps were shaped like this).. (thanks to Kevin Z. and Matt J. for assist with the translation).\nTo a more casual and perhaps hungry observer, the shape resembles a steamed chinese pork bun...or perhaps a ghost from Pac-ManOr one of those cartoon scrubber bubbles from \"Scrubbing Bubbles\" bathroom cleaner! Biology! What we know about its biology can literally be summarized here in a few sentences... Based on observations summarized by Mooi (1990) the Bahamian species Conolampas sigsbei lives in the deep-sea, approximately 120-800 m depths where it lives on coarse carbonate sand, made up mainly pf coral and algae fragments, leaving tracks that look like this:\n|(ecological reconstruction of Conolampas by Echinoblog Art Dept.! Blue=coarse, carbonate sand)|\nThese animals use the fine, hair-like spines for both movement and feeding. Although full feeding biology is unknown Conolampas will fill its gut with carbonate grains and small foraminiferans (shelled ameoba) leaving distinctive trails in its wake. The higher number of spines around the edge of the flattened bottom, likely assist in its movement.\nLike all echinoderms, tube feet are also present on the 5 ambulacra that are directed towards the mouth. Tube feet are primarily responsible for movement-but also for feeding and respiration.Here are further details of the spines on the surface... And what the \"test\" (i.e., the body cleaned of spines) looks like.We know a little bit about Conolampas' reproductive biology! Like the fact that they aggregate when they spawn.\n(This is Conolampas sigsbei on the Bahamian slope, image is taken from Young 1994)\nAlso worth mentioning is a paper by Craig Young, Paul Tyler and Roland Emson (1995) that shows that embryos of this species, during a 12 hour incubation, show the embryos developing most readily at pressures closer to their actual depth range, with increasingly abnormal embryonic development as pressure (and presumably depth) increase.\nSo, admittedly, we don't know much about these animals -but the fact that you've got these weird trail-making lamp/bun/ghost/scrubber bubble shaped sea urchins roaming around deep-sea sediment and rubble eating who knows what?? That have sexy threesomes/orgies???\nTHAT is awesome. And apparently no less then Alexander Agassiz would agree with me!","Caulastrea furcata, often known as candy cane, trumpet, or bullseye coral, is a bright and colorful LPS (large polyp stony) coral. Characterized by striped polyps inspiring its common name, it can be found in vivid yellow, green, red, or blueish brown. Each branching polyps contains a neon green mouth. Some common varieties available to purchase are Kryptonite, Orange, Green, and Alien Eye Candy Cane Coral.\nCandy Canes originate from the Indo-Pacific Ocean from Fiji to Australia and the surrounding waters. In the wild, they can usually be found in shallow waters, tide pools and even lagoons. Though they prefer moderate water flow and lighting, they can flourish in a variety of conditions making them perfect for a beginner hobbyist.\nIn this article, we will talk you through everything you need to know to care for your Candy Canes and keep your saltwater aquarium looking vibrant and healthy.\nCandy Cane Coral Care\nCandy Cane Coral is extremely easy to keep as it is a hardy coral, meaning it’s resistant to variations in lighting, flow, and other minor changes in its environment. This makes it forgiving to mistakes commonly made by novices and a great choice whether you are experienced or just starting out.\nAre Candy Cane Coral Aggressive?\nCandy Cane Coral is considered not very aggressive since it has relatively short (2 inch) sweeping tentacles, unlike many other LPS corals. However, it could still sting corals which are close by, so it is important it has plenty of room to grow. As it is one of the fastest growing corals you should aim to give it around 6 inches of space at a minimum.\nCandy Cane Coral Placement\nThe best placement for Candy Cane Coral is in an area of moderate lighting and flow, although it can also thrive in low flow or light intensity. For this reason, it is ideally placed at the bottom of your tank and no higher than the middle. You can place it directly on the sand bed as sand is its preferred substrate.\nIf the flow is too high, it can damage the fleshiness of the polyps; too low and the coral will need more help with feeding, although this isn’t an issue if you plan to feed it regularly yourself. To ensure it takes well to your desired placement it’s recommended to start with a darker and lower flow part of your tank and gradually move it over the course of a few weeks.\nCandy Cane Coral Lighting Requirement\nCandy Cane Coral does not have a high lighting requirement, responding best to low-to-moderate intensity. Anything from 30 to 150 PAR is acceptable, though between 50-70 is recommended. Avoid more than 150 though as light intensity that’s too high could bleach or irritate the coral.\nPlacing your Candy Cane Coral towards the edges of your tank can help to soften the intensity it’s exposed to. Alternatively, a shaded area can be a good spot to provide the right conditions too.\nCandy Cane Coral Temperature\nThe temperature preferred by Candy Cane Coral is between 75°C-82°C/24°C-28°C. Higher temperatures cause thermal stress, resulting in much of the zooxanthellae algae being expelled and depriving the coral of the nutrients they provide.\nCandy Cane Coral pH\nA pH range of 8.1-8.4 is ideal for Candy Cane Coral. The calcium levels should also be kept between 350-420ppm. As it is an LPS coral, these parameters are essential to prevent erosion of the coral’s hard skeleton and to keep it strong and healthy.\nCandy Cane Coral Growth Rate\nCandy Cane Coral has a fast growth rate, especially compared to other corals. This is particularly true when it is fed on a regular basis. The exact growth speed will depend on the available nutrients, light and space, including nearby competition and rocks which could limit the area it spreads.\nCandy Canes grow by dividing a polyp into two identical polyps. This is a big reason why their growth is so rapid if their environment allows it, as their polyps can quickly multiply, and the process can occur with multiple polyps simultaneously.\nCandy Cane Coral Growth Height\nThe growth height of Candy Cane Coral can depend on a number of factors from the amount of food to the light intensity it receives, just like its growth rate. In the average aquarium you can probably expect it to grow up to several inches tall. However, due to their variability it’s difficult to predict exactly how high Candy Canes will grow.\nWhat Do Candy Cane Coral Feed On?\nIn general, Candy Cane Coral is happy to feed on a variety. Bitesize meaty food is most suitable, such as prawns, mysis shrimp and small pieces of krill. It will also accept LPS pellets and other coral foods, or even pellets and flakes intended for fish.\nWhen feeding your Candy Canes, you’ll get the best results if you use some form of feeding apparatus, or even a regular turkey baster. Try to place the food directly into the mouths to make it easiest for the sweeping tentacles to reach. This also helps to prevent your fish from stealing it – they are sometimes known to harass the coral by biting it to access the food inside if given the opportunity.\nIt’s useful to remember that Candy Canes are nocturnal, so the tentacles will naturally come out at night, or when the lights are off. While they extend during the day if they detect food nearby, strategic timing can speed up the process. You should aim to spot feed them 2-3 times a week.\nIn some cases, you may not need to directly feed your Candy Cane Coral at all. Providing that the flow isn’t too low, and you feed the rest of your tank heavily enough, it may get enough nutrients on its own. It will also benefit from its symbiotic relationship with the zooxanthellae algae living in its surface tissues photosynthesizing and giving another source of nutrients. However, spot feeding Candy Canes can help them to grow faster and appear brighter in color, so it’s up to you which approach will achieve your desired effect.\nHow to Split Candy Cane Coral\nIn order to split Candy Cane Coral, look for an outer branch for easy access and ensure you cut as far away from the polyps as you can to avoid damaging them. Glue the piece to a frag plug or rock to allow it to heal.\nBone cutters or a band saw work well as a cutting tool – the latter has the advantage of creating a flat base which is helpful when gluing. After a couple of weeks of healing the frags should be ready to be traded or even sold.\nCandy Cane Coral Dying\nIf your Candy Cane Coral is dying you will notice a change in appearance – in particular, the polyps not opening or puffing up is a tell-tale sign that something is wrong. In some cases, the flesh may recede, causing the skeleton to show. You may also see changes in color.\nDon’t panic if you notice these symptoms however, as with careful monitoring you should be able to get your Candy Canes back to being happy and healthy. The most common cause of these changes is a chemical composition in the water that is harmful to Caulastrea. To diagnose the problem, start by measuring the levels of calcium, magnesium, nitrates, and water hardness. The ideal ranges for these variables are as follows:\n- Calcium: 350-420ppm\n- Magnesium: ~1350ppm\n- Nitrates: <10ppm\n- Water hardness: 8°-12° dH\nIf your water falls within these recommendations, there could be an issue with the temperature or pH. As previously mentioned, Candy Canes require a temperature of between 75°C-82°C/24°C-28°C and alkalinity ranging from 8.1-8.4 pH. Check the light intensity too as anything higher than 150 PAR can cause the polyps to retreat. If the water flow is too high, it can also damage the coral.\nIt’s also possible that the coral is simply adjusting to recent changes in conditions. If you have moved it to a different spot in the tank, replaced your lighting or made other alterations, it can affect the appearance. If this is the case, your Caulastrea should recover quickly on its own.\nSometimes the cause is other livestock in your tank. Try observing your Candy Canes to spot fish or other coral bullying them, especially around feeding time. If this is the case you may be underfeeding your fish, or there may not be sufficient space between your corals. Keep in mind though that at times this behavior from fish is unavoidable and you might need to manage the problem instead of attempting to prevent it entirely.\nFinally, if none of the above methods prove successful, you may need to resort to fragging a healthy segment and starting over.\nThat concludes our guide to Candy Cane Coral!

{"question":"What are the key factors affecting aquarium stocking density, and how should beginners approach selecting compatible fish species?","answer":"The key factors affecting aquarium stocking density are water change schedule and volume. While volume sets a general range for maximum fish capacity, water change schedule is most crucial as it dictates water quality. Without proper water changes, even extensive filtration in a large tank cannot support basic fish populations. Additionally, compatibility between species is essential when selecting fish. Factors to consider include environmental requirements (water chemistry, temperature, habitat preferences), size differences (ensuring smaller fish won't fit in larger fishes' mouths), and temperament (territorial behavior, aggression levels). Other considerations include feeding habits, as mixing slow and fast eaters or species with specialized dietary needs can be problematic. The welfare of the fish must always come first, and it's important to research thoroughly before making selections rather than impulsively buying whatever is available at the pet shop.","context":["There seems to be a lot of bad information and bad ways of thinking about stocking an aquarium. The most common mistake and way of thinking is that ‘X many gallons can handle Y number of fish’.\nThere are many things that affect the maximum bioload (rate of waste production) that an aquarium can handle. The two most important are volume and water change schedule. The volume basically sets a general range for the maximum amount of fish. The most important factor is the water change schedule.\nThe water change schedule dictates water quality. Without water changes tons of filtration on a 300 gallon tank can’t handle even a school of tetras. Massive water changes on a smaller tank with adequate filtration can allow for a larger bioload than the average water change schedule on the same size tank.\nThere are mistakes being made on both sides when stocking is being discussed. The person simply asking ‘How many fish can go in my 29’ is assuming that stocking level is based just on volume, but they are not taking into account the water change schedule and other factors. More at fault are all of those who simply start answering the question without asking ‘what is the water change schedule?’ or even ‘What filtration do you have?’. The person asking may simply not be advanced enough to realize they need to be aware of these other issues, but they are asking for help. The others are neglecting to fully address the issue at hand and allowing others to keep looking at stocking in the wrong way. Anyone who answers these types of questions without focusing mainly on water quality is not only unhelpful, but negligent. Answering without focusing on water quality harms the person asking the question by falsely affirming that stocking is based on volume.\nFiltration does not just clean a certain volume of water the way the packaging suggests. Filters clean up after fish. A 75 with a school of full grown fancy goldfish needs a lot more filtration than if it housed a smaller bioload, like a few schools of tetras. Part of stocking an aquarium is providing the filtration to deal with those fish. Filtration can limit stocking. More filtration is never a bad thing. Barely meeting the minimal filtration needs of a certain setup is risking problems down the road. When the only or one of the filters stops running and you can’t replace it for another week, if you only had the minimal to start with you are now faced with an under-filtered and overstocked tank.\nIn general the best measure of water quality is nitrate concentration. Nitrate is in general the end of the nitrogen cycle in an aquarium. In freshwater there are two main ways to remove nitrate, water changes and plants. With plants there has to be a very small bioload for the tank size and a lot of plants. This is rarely the case and even then small water changes are still needed. So in effect water changes are the only way to remove nitrate from the system. Nitrate itself will build in concentration over time. This can stress the fish, cause stunting, and can lead to illness and death. In addition, there are many other things that can build up over time. Growth inhibiting hormones are given off by many species of fish which can severely stunt fish of the same or closely related species and cause the same problems as nitrate. There are also dissolved organic compounds and other things that slowly build up over time. These also cause stress, illness, and even death. Even if extremes such as illness and death are not caused, a general failure to thrive can occur. This means that even though the fish seem fine, they should be doing even better (sometimes much better) if water quality was better. In general these chemicals will not build up if adequate water changes are done. Although we cannot test for these other harmful chemicals, they do tend to correlate well with nitrate concentration which is easily tested for. It is very important to keep the nitrate concentration under 20ppm. In cases of the tap water having a significant concentration the goal is then to keep the nitrate within 10ppm of the tap.\nSo a more appropriate answer to ‘How many fish can I put in my X gallon tank?’ without asking any questions would be: ‘However many you can have with your water change schedule and keep the nitrate concentration under 20ppm’.\nThis brings us to another important aspect, the upper limits of aquariums. Even if you can keep the nitrate concentration down (high water quality), there is still an upper limit to the stocking density. I tried this with a 40high. I did massive weekly water changes and the water quality was in the ideal range. However, at a certain point it is simply so crowded that the fish are stressed not by water quality, but by the simple presence of so many other fish in the tank. This became apparent at about 80 fish in my situation in the 40high. At about that population mystery deaths started to occur as well as other signs that the fish were not thriving. I cut down the population and a happier, healthier community resulted. I do not suggest this and it is much better to prevent issues than treat them (don’t fill your tank until they start dying to figure out the maximum population). Understocking is always better than risking overstocking.\nIn addition to simply being crowded, we come to the topic of big fish and their minimal tank sizes. Water quality is still most important, but with big fish you face a minimum in addition to that of maintaining water quality and space. In general, the tank should be at least as wide as the longest fish is long. So a cichlid that is 15″ long should be in a tank at least 15″ wide, to allow for an arguably comfortable turnaround. There are a few exceptions to this. Fish that are very long and extremely flexible do not require the turnaround width like bulkier fish do. These would be fish like ropefish and eels. These fish can be 18″ long and turn around comfortably in a 12″ wide tank. This does not mean you can crowd a bunch into a 55, but that the minimum width rule is not really in effect. Schooling fish also require larger than expected tanks. For example: giant danios generally only get to about 4″ or so, but since they are so active and do like to school (a school is generally considered at least 6 fish) they should be in something like a 30long at minimum, some would even say a 55. Goldfish are another example. Many suggest 20 gallons for one and an additional ten gallons for each additional goldfish. This is a good guide, but since they do school this means that in order to have fancy goldfish you should really have at least a 75 gallon aquarium. For the more active, and larger, long-bodied goldfish it is generally recommended to have at least a 125 (or ideally a pond).\nFish behavior also needs to be taken into account. An active species needs more space than a less active species of the exact same size. So things like danios, although small, need a larger tank because they are so active and they school. Aggressive species need special attention as well. Although they can turnaround in a 125 and you may maintain the water quality, five oscars in a 125 will most likely end up killing each other, there is simply not enough room for all of them. This is especially true of cichlids when they pair off, they will become extremely aggressive and may lay claim to the entire tank as their territory. Many of them have territories in the wild larger than almost any aquarium they are kept in. So when they pair off they can turn what was once a relatively peaceful tank into a battlefield and even death camp.\nAnother commonly overlooked aspect is nocturnal fish. They hide away unseen during the day, but can be very active at night when the lights are out and the aquarist is not watching. As far as the keeper knows it is a medium fish that hides all the time and is very lazy. Only they do not realize that at night that fish is all over the place, possibly stressing out the diurnal fish that are now trying to rest. This can even cause things like mystery disappearances of fish. People see healthy fish and yet they keep disappearing. The culprit may be that otherwise very lazy catfish that at night goes after the sleeping fish the keeper has noticed are disappearing.\nAn increase in tank size does not mean the aquarist can now become lazy about water quality. Yes, a larger tank does mean that water quality will stay a little better, but that does not allow any laziness on the part of the aquarist. Since many upgrades are made for a growing fish, the water quality will still need to be maintained and water changes should remain just as often and as large.\nAny aquarist needs to occasionally check the nitrate concentration to ensure that water quality is actually being maintained. Many have a tendency to get in the habit of a water change schedule but fail to adjust it to the fish growing. In addition, what seemed like a great water change schedule at first, may actually just mean that the nitrate concentration will rise much slower than usual, not actually maintain the ideal level of no more than 20ppm. If the tank is being under-maintained in other ways there could also be a significant increase in nitrate concentration. If debris is trapped in the gravel and not being removed it will eventually break down and be converted into nitrate. Many or probably most keepers tend to not maintain their filters often enough. This can cause the same problem. The debris they collected will eventually break down and cause nitrate problems. To help prevent these issues and catch them early it is important to check nitrate concentration on a regular basis (for example, once a month) even on tanks that are doing amazingly well. In addition the bioload of the tank increases over time simply due to the growth of the fish. A tank full of juvenile fish has a smaller bioload than the exact same stocking a year later. This increases the likelihood of the old water change schedule being inadequate.\nMany aquarists feel it should ‘not be fixed if it is not broken’. Unfortunately this can mean that problems that are slowly developing but not causing any major problems immediately are overlooked and develop to the point where they cannot be fixed and the result is harm to the fish, either by stunting, severe stress, or death. Assume you can improve things and work toward doing so.\nFor some reason many people believe that extra filtration helps keep the tank cleaner and therefore the tank doesn’t need as many or as large of water changes. This is absolutely not the case. It is almost impossible to not have enough biofiltration (any cycled tank will have no ammonia and nitrite, therefore it has enough biofiltration). The other main function of filtration is to create healthy water flow and collect debris for you the aquarist to remove. So you can see the functions of filtration do not overlap with the functions of water changes. More filtration cannot compensate for inadequate water changes.\nJust to be clear, all fish need a certain minimum amount of space regardless of how good the water quality is. This will vary based on tank size, shape, fish types, decor, and other factors. This article is meant to specify that any rules or online calculators that base stocking on a certain number of fish in a certain tank size are missing the even more important side of the equation, the water quality.\nStocking is far from a very over-simplified quick rule of thumb like ‘one inch per gallon’, ‘one inch of fish per inch of tank length’, and other ‘rules’. It is very complex and everything from fish behavior to your ability to properly maintain water quality needs to be considered.","It is easy to decide that owning an aquarium would be a nice idea, but it can be difficult to know just where and how to start. These are the questions you must ask yourself first.\n- What size aquarium can I accommodate (and afford)?\n- What sort of fishes would I like to keep?\n- Small or large (aquarium size permitting)?\n- Freshwater or marine?\n- Coldwater or tropical?\n- What are their specific requirements and habits?\n- Will they live in my tap water and, if not, am I prepared to go to the trouble and expense of providing the right conditions?\n- Will they get along with each other?\n- Do I want to grow plants?\n- Will my preferred fishes eat them?\nLife being what it is, you may have to compromise when it comes to your personal inclinations, but never do so when it comes to the fishes’ welfare. That must always come first.\nAlthough considerations of expense and the space you have available may limit your options, do, if possible, let your preferred choice of fishes dictate factors such as aquarium size rather than vice versa, as keeping the species you really want is bound to increase your motivation and enjoyment. Establishing your preferences will require a certain amount of effort in finding out what species are available, making a list of those you find attractive, and applying the above questions to them. You are bound to find that some are incompatible with available space, each other, and your personal concept of a miniature underwater paradise, but the wide choice available should enable you to compile a suitable shortlist without undue trouble.\nIn deciding what fishes to keep you must consider how many your aquarium can accommodate. This is often calculated in terms of oxygen requirement, based on centimeters of fish (length excluding the tail when full-grown) relative to the surface area of the tank: for freshwater fishes 2.5 cm of fish per 194 cm’ (1 inch per 30 square inches) of surface (coldwater) or 2.5 cm per 64 cm’ (1 inch per 10 square inches) (tropical). For marines the formula is 2.5 cm of fish per 18 liters (1 inch per 4 gallons) for the first 6 months, then 2.5 cm per 9 liters (1 inch per 2 gallons). For some fishes, however, population density may be governed by territorial requirements, and fewer fishes can be kept than is suggested by the above formulae. Carassius auratus (the goldfish) is a coldwater fish which can be kept in an aquarium or pond, but should never be confined to a bowl or other small container.\nThe compatibility (or otherwise) of fish species must always be taken into consideration before they are mixed. First of all, environmental requirements must be similar. Mercifully, few people try to mix marine and freshwater species, but many attempt (unsuccessfully) to keep brackish water fishes in freshwater aquaria. Even more fail to realize the varying degrees of hardness and acidity/alkalinity occurring in different freshwater biotopes, and that fishes from these different water chemistries do best if given natural conditions in captivity. Temperature requirements should also be similar. Some fishes come from fast-f1owing streams, others from still pools, and the needs of both cannot be satisfied in one aquarium. Some prefer rocky habitats, others jungles of plants, yet others open space; some require bright light, some require dim. All these points must be considered when evaluating their environmental compatibility.\nSize and temperament are just as important.\nAlthough not all species feed exclusively on other fishes, it is natural for larger fishes to eat smaller ones. So, except where dealing only with strict vegetarians, always ensure the smallest fish is too big to fit into the largest mouth ? and that, allowing for future growth, it will remain so. Some fishes are territorial, occupying an area which usually represents either their private larder or their intended nursery (feeding and breeding territory respectively). They are usually aggressive towards con-specifics (members of their own species) in particular, and frequently towards other species as well. They can sometimes be kept with other fishes if the latter are evenly matched (in size and temperament), but they may need their own tank.\nThink about feeding.\nDo you really want to keep fishes with varying specialized dietary needs, requiring you to serve a variety of foods at each meal?\n- Will the slow and steady eaters get any food at all if you include a number of fast-swimming greedy species?\n- Will that harmless but large and boisterous fish you like the look of frighten the life out of smaller, shyer tank mates?\nThese are all questions that must be answered. Never make any assumptions on the basis of apparently successful and uneventful cohabitation in a dealer’s tank; the fishes’ behavior may be affected by relative crowding, lack of decor, and by their age (often fishes offered for sale are sub-adult). Give them space, something to fight over, and a few months’ growth, and the story may be quite different!\nMaking Your Selection\nDon’t succumb to your understandable impatience to get up and running this preliminary research should be regarded as all part of the fun. Patience is an essential quality to cultivate if you want to succeed, so the sooner you practice it the better! We cannot over emphasize the importance of getting everything right first time. There is no point in setting up your tank and then finding it won’t do for the fishes you want to keep; that will mean settling for second best or starting again from scratch. Get it wrong and you risk causing suffering to your fishes, not to mention wasting your time and money; what should have been a source of immense enjoyment for many years could turn into a nightmare.\nFar too many aquarists set about the task in completely the opposite fashion, setting up an aquarium and populating it with whatever their local pet shop has to offer that month. Only later do they realize what they are missing when they see a fish they really like, often totally unsuitable for their aquarium. The sensible few go home and find out about their dream fish before buying it. The majority, regrettably, take it home without doing any homework, usually discovering their error the hard way upsetting for the aquarist, but catastrophic for the fishes.\nThe Fishkeeping Network\nApart from books, there is another invaluable source of information available to you the accumulated knowledge of other aquarists, both professional (dealers) and other amateurs like yourself. Fish keeping is a friendly hobby, and you will find that most enthusiasts are more than willing to help. If it was seeing a friend’s aquarium that stimulated your interest in the first place, don’t be afraid to go back to him or her and pick his or her brains. He or she may know other aquarists who will be only too happy to let you see their set ups and answer your questions.\nConsider joining your local aquarists’ club\nYou will be made welcome even though you don’t yet have any fishes of your own. Such clubs exist in most large towns and cities, although it is not always easy to obtain a contact address. Local aquarium shops may be able to help; if not, most countries have a national federation of fish keeping clubs which can supply details, and whose contact address can usually be found in fish keeping magazines.\nEven if you are not by nature the sociable type, there are many advantages, apart from shared knowledge, to belonging to a club. If you have fish keeping friends then you have people you can call upon in all sorts of otherwise difficult situations getting a large tank home and into place; looking after your fishes while you are on holiday;. helping out if some vital item of equipment fails at .3 am on Sunday morning. There is the possibility of spare equipment and home bred fishes at bargain prices, and perhaps the loan of extra reading material.\nThe Aquatic Dealer\nIt will also be to your immense advantage to find a good aquatic dealer and make a friend of him. You will need guidance when it comes to buying equipment, because the quantity and variety available nowadays is confusing even to the expert, and positively daunting to the beginner. He will be able to advise what is best suited to your particular circumstances, and what brands are most reliable. A good dealer is also a mine of information on fishes and fishkeeping. You may not buy all your fishes from him (he may not have what you want ,though if you are a good customer he may get it for you), but you should reward his investment of time and patience in you, his customer, by always going to him for “dry goods”. He may not be right on your doorstep, but his help will more than recompense you for any expenditure in time and travel.\nSo, how do you find a suitable dealer? Firstly, ask other aquarists for a recommendation. Failing that, the most important difference between a good dealer and a bad one is one of attitude. Both have a living to make, but money is the chief motivation of the bad dealer. He will rarely be prepared to spend time talking. Don’t expect him to net out a particular fish from a batch of 20 it will be too much trouble. He will grumble if you insist on a pair, even if the species is easily sexed. He will allow you to buy any combination of equipment and fishes without question.\nThe honest dealer, by contrast, will try to deter you from any folly, and perhaps even refuse to sell he values his reputation and integrity more than the proverbial quick buck. If he can’t answer your questions, he will get a book out. Ask for two fishes, and he will catch you a pair if they are sex-able. He will be patient and will take time to talk, even if you are a stranger who may never darken his doors again and he will probably recognize you when you do go back.\nIf in doubt, try going along with an outrageous shopping list of totally incompatible fishes (we suggest, for example, the oscar cichlid and the neon tetra), and let it be known that you have just (yesterday) set up a 60cm (24-inch) tank and intend introducing both to it immediately. The bad dealer won’t bat an eyelid and will get out his nets and polythene bags. The good one will likely make a choking sound? then explain the error of your ways and make an alternate recommendation"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4ddc0100-2f4e-429e-b424-2be88927d92f>","<urn:uuid:68993f42-90e6-4d26-b3e2-7b2ce071a9d0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the ways to prevent tooth decay when consuming sugary foods, and how exactly does sugar consumption lead to cavity formation in the mouth?","answer":"To prevent tooth decay while consuming sugary foods, there are several key measures: drinking plenty of water (especially fluoridated water) to clean the mouth and prevent sugar from causing acid damage, taking anti-decay supplements or artificial saliva products containing xylitol, maintaining consistent oral hygiene by brushing twice daily and flossing once per day, considering low-sugar food options, and consulting dentists regularly for cavity prevention procedures. As for cavity formation, sugar doesn't directly cause cavities - instead, the mouth's natural bacteria metabolize sugar as an energy source, producing acid as a waste product. This acid then dissolves the tooth enamel, leading to cavities. The damage is influenced by three factors: the amount of sugar consumed, the frequency of consumption, and the length of time sugar remains on teeth.","context":["The Halloween season is here, which means candies and chocolates are almost everywhere. But for those with a sweet tooth, sugary treats are always available all year round. Ever since we’re kids, our parents have restricted us from consuming too many sweets. Some even have rules at home to prevent their children from developing a sugar addiction. We are told that candies and chocolate cause tooth decay or even tooth loss.\nThe truth is, sugar doesn’t directly bring cavities. It causes tooth decay when you fill your mouth with cavity-causing bacteria, which transforms sugar into acid that destroys the tooth enamel. Bacteria in the oral cavity treat sugar as an energy source. They produce more acid that damages the teeth. Once the sugar and acid coat the tooth, it becomes prone to decay, which results in cavities. When left untreated, tooth decay may require a major procedure to save the rest of your teeth. Some even undergo jaw surgery to avoid excessive wear and breakdown of their teeth.\nDespite this scary fact, you can still enjoy sweet treats without experiencing tooth decay. How’s it possible? Taking the right precautions and following good oral hygiene allow you to enjoy your sweet addiction. To know more, here are ways to protect your teeth when eating sweets.\nDrink plenty of water\nDrinking water, particularly those that contain fluoride, is the best way to prevent cavities. When you eat sugary foods, unwanted sugar remains stuck in between the teeth. Water helps clean the mouth and prevents sugar from causing acid that accelerates wear in the enamel.\nWater also helps in diluting an acid, or the bacteria produced by your mouth. If saliva production is low, you feel more dehydrated, which leads to a dry mouth, making you prone to tooth decay. A great tip is to rinse your mouth with water after snacking. Do this for 30 to 60 seconds and wait for 30 minutes to brush your teeth.\nTake anti-decay supplements\nHere’s some good news: You can take supplements that provide an extra boost for your mouth’s decay-fighting agents. For people with low saliva production, you can take a saliva supplement to help your mouth eliminate excess saliva. When taking oral prescription products, make sure to consult a trusted dental professional before consuming any supplement. They can even provide suggestions based on your needs.\nAnother alternative is artificial saliva, which comes in several forms, such as gel, swab, oral rinse, oral spray, and dissolving tablets. You can also try over-the-counter saliva substitutes containing xylitol to prevent bacteria growth.\nMaintain consistent oral hygiene\nYour best bet in fighting tooth decay is to observe regular oral hygiene. Plaque can promote bacteria in the mouth within 12 to 24 hours. In this case, you need to brush your teeth after eating anything sweet to keep your teeth healthy and your mouth clean. Brush your teeth but make sure to allot 30 minutes after consuming sugary foods. Dental experts say that brushing too soon right after eating removes the enamel.\nWhen brushing, look for a toothpaste that restores natural calcium and reinforces the tooth enamel. Dentists also recommend brushing twice a day for two minutes each and flossing once per day using 18 to 24 inches of floss.\nConsider low-sugar options\nAlthough it may not be an ideal option for sugar addicts, low-sugar options are more beneficial for your oral health. You’ll find a lot of low-sugar options in the market, such as fruits, dark chocolate, and sugarless cake. These sweet treats don’t only taste great, but they’re also good for the health.\nIf there’s one thing you should avoid, reduce the intake of chewy and long-lasting sweets. Their composition allows sugar to stay on your teeth, causing more damage. One example is chewing on taffy chocolate bars which leads to prolonged acid attacks.\nConsult a dentist\nEvery person has unique dental concerns and priorities. If your concern is to prevent cavities caused by sugar consumption, consult a dentist regularly to undergo cavity prevention procedures. The dentist will check for potential issues, such as tooth decay, and apply the proper treatment before it worsens.\nCavity prevention procedures include dental cleanings, x-rays, dental exams, sealants, oral hygiene aid, and home care suggestions.\nWhether your sugar addiction is genetic or you’re simply obsessed with chocolate, there are plenty of ways to protect your teeth to ensure your love for sweets won’t damage your oral health. At the end of the day, too much of anything is always bad. Remember, candies and chocolate are always available, but you only have one set of teeth to take care of.","You probably know that eating or drinking sugar and not brushing and flossing your teeth is how you get cavities, but it might be helpful to understand a little more about how that process actually occurs.\nYour mouth, like all parts of your body, has a population of natural bacteria at all times. There are many, many types of bacteria, and the numbers and ratios of each must be kept in balance. These bacteria are simple creatures, and enjoy metabolizing the simplest food of all: Sugar.\nIf you feed these bacteria, they grow in number. The amount you’re feeding your bacteria can be increased in three ways: Amount, Length and Frequency\nAmount: This is where dietary choice comes into play. Sugar, Crackers, Cookies, and Carbohydrates that get stuck in the grooves of your teeth are major offenders, but what you drink is often even worse, because the amount of sugar in soda, juice, coffee and dessert beverages is often super high. The worst dietary choice out there is sugary soda due to the amount of sugar, and the tendency to sip over long periods of time, increasing the frequency of feeding the bacteria.\nFrequency: How often you consume the above types of food and drink also increases your bacteria. If you sip a soda, if you’re taking a sip every 30 minutes, the acid level (that bacteria thrive under) in your mouth is the same as if you were to continuously hold the soda in your mouth.\nLength: As above, frequency can turn into length, but the other component that affects length is how often you remove the food debri and bacteria from your mouth with brushing and flossing. We recommend you brush 2-3 times per day and floss at least once per day. In some cases greater frequency is required due to underlying conditions. The greatest of these being, dry mouth. The saliva in the mouth works throughout the day to remove (some of) the food debri and bacteria. We find that people with dry mouth (due to radiation or prescription side effects) to have a very difficult time controlling the bacteria, thus the decay in their mouths, because carbohydrates and bacteria simply stay on the teeth longer.\nWhat exactly do bacteria do to make these cavities? I mentioned earlier, that bacteria like acidic environments and thrive in them. This is natural because bacteria MAKE ACID. It is actually the acid that is produced as a waste product when they consume food debri that dissolves the teeth creating cavities. This is why sugar and acid together (soda) is super bad, but also why acid alone (diet soda) is also harmful to teeth.\nHow can we address these three issues to keep bacteria and cavities at bay? We will look at the three categories and find good choices and habits!\nAmount: Choose foods low in sugar and carbohydrates like Meats, Vegetables, Whole Fruits, Whole grains . Cheese and Nuts have been shown to have a negative effect on bacteria, thus a positive effect on teeth!\nFrequency: Keep snacking under control, and it’s especially important to choose wisely (cheese, nuts, whole fruits, veggies, beef jerky) when it comes to snack items. If you do drink soda or juice, keep it to mealtimes only, so you’re not prolonging the acid environment.\nLength: Brush at least 2 times per day. Brush and Floss last thing before bed, only consuming water after. This gives your teeth the whole night free of acid attack. See your dentist for regular cleanings at least every 6 months. If you do have dry mouth, you might need to work with your dentist on a special plan."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5b652217-f0c3-46d8-ade9-cb470653b3f8>","<urn:uuid:0676abd7-5a88-48d0-bfb2-172f7e696664>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do nuclear explosions and volcanic eruptions compare in terms of their atmospheric effects and global climate impact, and what specific types of particles do they release into the stratosphere?","answer":"Nuclear explosions and volcanic eruptions both affect global climate but through different mechanisms and particles. Nuclear explosions release black carbon (soot) into the stratosphere that efficiently absorbs radiation and can last up to a decade, causing severe temperature drops. A nuclear war could release about 180 teragrams of soot, leading to a nuclear winter with a 10°C reduction in global mean surface temperature. In contrast, volcanic eruptions primarily release sulfate aerosols that don't absorb much radiation and only last 1-2 years in the stratosphere. Volcanic particles can cause some global cooling, with effects varying based on eruption force, ash column height, and emission volume. For example, Indonesia's Tambora volcano eruption in 1815 led to 'the year without a summer' in Europe.","context":["The thought of nuclear war may conjure images of looming mushroom clouds, duck and cover drills, or local radiation fallout. These immediate effects are terrifying, but scientists say the fallout of a nuclear war would likely last well beyond the initial explosions.\nIn a new paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, researchers detail a decade of destruction following a nuclear war between the United States and Russia. Smoke from smoldering cities is projected to make its way to the stratosphere, where it will trigger a nuclear winter.\nThe team used new climate models to approximate just how long—and how severe—the nuclear winter might be if Russia and the United States engage in nuclear conflict. They estimate a decade-long winter could linger after the explosions, wreaking havoc on temperatures, sunlight, and precipitation worldwide.\nA Dark Decade of Winter\nIf nuclear war broke out between the United States and Russia, the global repercussions would extend beyond politics and trigger major climatic trauma—specifically, a nuclear winter. A nuclear winter would occur in the aftermath of nuclear blasts in cities; smoke would effectively block out sunlight, causing below-freezing temperatures to engulf the world.\nTo weigh the intensity of a nuclear war between two well-armed nations, the team considered the current arsenals of the two countries. They noted that important metropolitan areas—population centers or cities with strategic value, for example—would likely be targeted. And if those cities were hit, everything would likely burn.\n“Even asphalt can burn at the temperatures these bombs get to,” said Joshua Coupe, an atmospheric science doctoral candidate at Rutgers University. He said these urban fires would burn everything in sight, producing “a very dirty, sooty, smoke.”\nThis soot, or black carbon, is the key factor in producing a nuclear winter. “What’s important about black carbon is it absorbs radiation very, very efficiently,” said Coupe. He explained that the lofted black carbon absorbs radiation and heats up and “the air surrounding it becomes very buoyant and it’s able to lift [the soot] into the stratosphere.”\nIf the black carbon stayed in the troposphere, it could eventually be removed by precipitation, but Coupe said that once black carbon is in the stratosphere, it can last for years, triggering a long-term, global climate response.\nThere are other nonnuclear events that can trigger aerosol releases into the stratosphere, including volcanic eruptions and wildfires, but Coupe noted that neither produce the same effects as soot released as a result of nuclear war.\n“Volcanoes produce sulfate aerosols that don’t absorb much radiation,” he said, and “because they don’t absorb as much, their lifetime is somewhere between 1 and 2 years.” Comparatively, he said their research shows nuclear-produced soot lasts up to a decade.\nWildfire soot can also reach the stratosphere, but Coupe noted that wildfires produce black carbon on a much smaller scale than what would result from dedicated nuclear attacks on cities. For example, the researchers state that a 2017 forest fire in British Columbia injected a few tenths of a teragram of black carbon into the stratosphere (1 teragram is 1 billion kilograms). In contrast, they estimated a nuclear war would blast 180 teragrams of soot into the atmosphere.\nClimate Modeling Black Carbon\nThe team used climate modeling to predict what might happen to Earth after the influx of an enormous amount of black carbon into the stratosphere.\nCoupe said their Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 4 (WACCM4) has a much higher resolution than that found in previous studies, allowing the researchers to add more detail to predictions. Specifically, WACCM4 allowed the team to reach higher elevations, into the stratosphere—an important step in capturing lofting soot effects, said Coupe.\nThe team also used an aerosol module called Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA) to better represent how airborne particles might grow and stick together. Coupe said using CARMA allowed the team to treat the aerosol particles more realistically.\nThey found that after simulated nuclear blasts, almost the entire Northern Hemisphere was engulfed in stratospheric soot within the first week. In 2 weeks, soot had invaded the Southern Hemisphere.\n“That’s the power of black carbon,” said Coupe. “It lofts very high very quickly and it spreads very, very fast.”\nThe researchers looked at changes in global average temperatures, radiation, and precipitation over a 15-year period following a nuclear war. Coupe said their results can be summed up in one word: grim.\n“Our research shows that in this U.S./Russia nuclear war scenario, nuclear winter would happen,” he said, adding that the models show an almost 10°C reduction in global mean surface temperature, extreme changes in precipitation, and a 90% reduction in the growing season across many parts of the midlatitudes.\nTo put things into perspective, Coupe said that the temperature change from preindustrial times to today was only 1°C. “But in nuclear winter, it approaches 10°C below the climatological mean after 2 or 3 years.”\nSolar radiation, important not only for surface temperatures but also for photosynthesis, drops precipitously. Within the first couple of years of a nuclear winter, “there’s around a 75% decrease in surface radiation—which is substantial,” said Coupe.\nPrecipitation rates don’t fare any better, and global averages drop about 58% after soot injection into the stratosphere. Patterns of rainfall also shifted, including the weakening or disappearing of monsoons and new rainfall over desert regions.\nWhat exactly happens during a nuclear winter is a complex scenario, said Jon Reisner, a numerical modeler at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Reisner was not involved in the study but researches how nuclear weapons can affect global climate.\n“The impact on climate from a nuclear exchange is still an unresolved issue,” Reisner said. He added that the researchers’ predictions appeared to be on the upper end of the spectrum for global cooling. “They’re assuming the worst, worst-case scenario,” said Reisner.\nReisner said he thinks the researchers are “exaggerating how much soot is being produced from fires” and noted that soot produced from urban fires is not well understood. “The big question is: What is the actual fuel loading?” He noted the intensity and duration of a fire can also affect soot production.\nAlthough he thinks more work needs to be done to better define global climate effects, Reisner noted “at the end of the day, the direct impacts [of a nuclear war] will be significant—you can’t downplay those.”\nA U.S.-Russia nuclear conflict reaches far beyond the two warring nations, said Coupe. “There are dire consequences if nuclear weapons were used, not just for countries involved, but for the rest of the world.”\nCoupe hopes that their study will help inform governments and the military in their risk assessment of using nuclear weapons. “The decisions between generals could affect the entire world for years,” he said.\n—Sarah Derouin (@Sarah_Derouin), Freelance Journalist","When the pressure inside a volcano grows to a point where the overlying surface can no longer contain is, an eruption occurs. Erupts are as unique as each volcano, from gentle lava flows and fountains to destructive pyroclastic eruptions.\nThere are many hazards and dangers associated with volcanic activity. These hazards can be local, or even global in scale.\nLearn more about two main forms of eruptions, and some of the hazards associated with each.\nExplosive eruptions occur when volatile (unstable and reactive) magma and volcanic gases are released. Magma can be under extremely high pressures due to its volume or its content of dissolved gases. Explosive eruptions are the most hazardous, involving large volumes of tephra and gases emitted from the volcano. Lahars, pyroclastic flows, ashfall, and many other volcanic hazards are commonly associated with explosive eruptions. Explosive eruptions are very dangerous. Basically, any form of hazard can occur. Here are some of the main hazards that can result from explosive eruptions:\nExperience national parks where explosive eruptions have occurred.\nAniakchak National Monument and Preserve, Alaska\nLake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska\nKatmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska\nMount Rainier National Park, Washington\nEffusive eruptions are generally considered to be gentler than explosive eruptions. During an effusive eruption, large volumes of lava pour from a vent onto the ground. These lava flows can vary in volume, area covered, thickness, length, and composition. Though effusive eruptions are generally associated with lava pouring out of a vent, some eruptions can include fantastic displays of fire and fury. Lava fountains can reach hundreds of meters into the air. Here are some of the hazards that can result from effusive eruptions:\nExperience national parks where effusive eruptions have occurred.\nHawaii Volcanoes National Park\nHaleakala National Park\nWrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve\nAn unpredictable nature mixed with an ability to release massive amounts of energy make volcanoes extremely hazardous. The types of hazards that threaten an area will vary based on the type of volcano. Some hazards are local in scale, while others can affect the entire planet.\nTephra is the term used to describe solid or molten rock fragments of any size ejected from a volcano. The smallest fragments (less than 2 millimeters in diameter) are called ash. Mid-sized fragments (2 to 64 millimeters in diameter) are called lapilli. Anything ejected from a volcano that is larger than 64 millimeters in diameter is called a block if it was ejected in a solid form and a volcanic bomb if it was ejected in a liquid or semi-solid form.\nTephra clouds can rise thousands of meters into the atmosphere and blanket areas hundreds of kilometers downwind of the eruption with ash. The dense tephra clouds can cause periods of darkness, even at mid-day, affecting plant, animal and human activity. Plants whose leaves are blanketed with ash are unable to perform photosynthesis or respiration. Animals experience disruption in their daily routine due to darkness at unusual times. Animals and humans can experience respiratory distress from inhaling tephra.\nDarkness caused by tephra clouds reduces visibility on highways. Tephra deposits can short-circuit electric transformers and power lines. Tephra clouds are extremely dangerous to aircraft that fly into or near them. A large enough accumulation of ash can cave in roofs and collapse structures in addition to inhibiting travel on roads. The tephra clouds generate lightning, which can create interference for communications and also start fires.\nMagma contains dissolved gases. During and between eruptions, these gases are released. When an effusive eruption occurs, the magma is fluid enough that the gases can escape from it easily. In the more explosive eruptions, the thick magma traps gases until they build pressure and are released explosively.\nIncreased gas emission is one of the first signs of activity around a volcanic vent, and often precedes eruptions. For hundreds or even thousands of years after an eruption, gases can still be emitted from fumaroles.\nSteam (water vapor) is the largest component of volcanic gas. Carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur compounds, and chlorine compounds are other volcanic gases.\nWind controls the distribution and concentration of volcanic gases. Even low concentrations can cause damage to some plants and animals downwind. Close to a vent where concentrations are high severe damage to eyes and respiratory systems of humans and animals can occur. Acid rain is created when sulfur dioxide gas reacts with water droplets in the atmosphere. It causes corrosion of metal and stone, as well as harming vegetation. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air, and can collect in basins or low-lying areas. Sometimes concentrations in these valleys and pockets can reach lethal levels and suffocate animals and people.\nVolcanic smog, called \"vog\" for short, is a hazardous mix of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other volcanic gases that can collect downwind of a volcano and cause a persistent air pollution problem. Vog aggravates respiratory problems and causes acid rain.\nLava flows can burn, crush, or bury anything in their path. Lava flows are slow enough that they are rarely a threat to human life, and people can evacuate the area where the flow is heading and avoid danger. However, lava can travel at varying speeds. The path and distance of a lava flow can be predicted with knowledge of variables such as rate at which lava is flowing from the vent, fluid properties of the lava (viscosity), volume of lava, slope steepness of the volcano and surrounding landscape, channel geometry, and any obstructions to flow.\nAn 'a'a lava flow from Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii set fire to a house in its path. Lave flows move slow enough that people can be warned to evacuate their homes before the lava reaches them. Lava flows cause large amounts of property damage and loss in Hawaii.\nLava from an eruption of Kilauea Volcano flowed over this road in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in Hawaii. This road was formerly part of the Chain of Craters Road, but after the eruption, several sections of the road had to be rebuilt.\nThe word pyroclastic comes from Greek words - pyro meaning \"fire\" and klastos meaning \"broken.\" Pyroclastics are the materials formed when magma and rock are fragmented during explosive eruptions and ejected from the volcano. Volcanic ash is the smallest pyroclastic fragment. Lapilli, blocks and bombs are larger.\nPyroclastic flows are avalanches of high-temperature rock, ash, and gas that race downslope from a volcano during explosive eruptions. These flows are extremely dangerous because they can reach temperatures of 1500 degrees Fahrenheit and speeds up to 450 miles per hour. At that temperature and speed, they can obliterate anything in their path.\nA pyroclastic flow is also called Nuée Ardente, which means \"glowing cloud\" in French. Depending on the concentration of gases and red-hot incandescent materials, the pyroclastic flow can have a glowing appearance. The flows can originate from the mouth of the volcano, like a pot boiling over. They can also be the result of the fallout from the eruption column.\nPyroclastic surges are low-density versions of the pyroclastic flow. A \"hot\" pyroclastic surge is made up of dry gas and rock debris with temperatures above 100 degrees Celsius. \"Cold\" surges contain water and rock debris at temperature below 100 degrees Celsius.\nLahar is an Indonesian word, used to describe the debris flows and mudflows that originate from a volcano. Lahars contain rock debris and water. Mudflows contain less rock fragments and more water, and flow more cohesively. Debris flows are coarser and have a higher density of rock. They are more viscous and flow much less smoothly.\nBecause lahars have a high density of rock fragments and originate on a slope, they have high internal strength and can exert enough force to uproot trees, carry boulders and smash buildings as they flow downstream. Lahars can vary greatly in size, from centimeters wide and deep flowing less than 1 meter per second, to hundreds of meters wide and tens of meters deep flowing at tens of meters per second. Large, high-velocity lahars can reach many kilometers from a volcano.\nLahars are triggered by large landslides of water-saturated debris. This saturation is caused by heavy rainfall on volcanic deposits, sudden melting of snow and ice near volcanic vents from radiant heat on the flank of a volcano or from pyroclastic flows, or from water released in the breakout of glaciers and crater lakes.\nLahars can be either hot or cold, depending on the temperatures of the water and debris that they contain. Hot or cool, historically lahars are one of the most devastating volcanic hazards because they pose threats of burial and impact by debris.\nWhen pyroclastic materials (gas and tephra) are forced out of a volcano in an explosive eruption, the blast can be extremely forceful. Volcanic blasts can be directed vertically (straight up), laterally (sideways along the ground), or at some angle between. Lateral blasts are most devastating because all of the energy of the blast is directed across land.\nThere are three zones associated with a lateral blast. The direct blast zone is the area that experiences the maximum force of the blast. Usually everything in this zone is completely obliterated - either burned or carried away. The channelized blast zone is an intermediate zone, where the blast still carries enough force and energy to level anything in its path, even whole forests. The last zone, the seared zone is a fringe area where trees and structures are left standing, but still affected by the heat and gas content of the blast.\nThe direction of the blast can be illustrated by the position of the felled trees and other debris. The action of a volcanic blast knocking down trees and buildings is called a \"blow-down.\"\nTsunamis are also referred to as tidal waves, although they are unrelated to tides. In Japanese, Tsunami means \"harbor wave.\" These waves can devastate coastal communities. A tsunami is a large, fast seismic ocean wave that is triggered by underwater earthquakes exceeding magnitude 7.5 on the Richter Scale. Landslides, volcanic eruptions, or other disturbances on the ocean floor also trigger tsunamis.\nDuring any of these events great volumes of water are displaced. The water sloshes back and forth in the ocean for several hours. In deep and open ocean waters, a tsunami consists of a series of waves that are a few feet high, and a hundred or so miles apart. Tsunami waves can travel thousands of miles from their origin. They move at speeds near 600 miles per hour, close to the speed of a commercial aircraft.\nAs the waves near the shore, they bunch together, grow taller, and slow down. At the shore, tsunami waves may crest higher than 100 feet and have velocities of thirty miles per hour. The waves reach the shore in series, and frequently, the first is not the worst. Many coastal cities have extensive warning systems to alert residents of approaching tsunamis.\nClimatologists have been studying the interactions between volcanoes and Earth's global climate. It is thought volcanic particles in the air are responsible for some degree of global cooling. The extent of the cooling depends on the force of the eruption, the height of the ash column, the volume of ash and gas emitted, and the location of the volcano in relationship to Earth's atmospheric currents.\nThe effects of some volcanoes can be substantial. For example, the eruption of Indonesia's Tambora volcano in 1815 led to 1816 being called \"the year without a summer\" as far away as Europe!\nThe sulfate particles emitted by volcanoes can increase the strength of CFC's (compounds that deplete the ozone layer) in the atmosphere. The effects of volcanic emissions on atmosphere and climate changes are measured and monitored by instruments on satellites. Remote sensing plays a large role in our knowledge of volcanic clouds.\nThe image shows how the tephra and volcanic gases emitted in the early 1990s by Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines traveled all around the globe. The red and yellow areas show where the volcanic ash was present in the atmosphere. Atmospheric currents carry particulates emitted from the volcano around the globe, affecting weather patterns and temperatures on the other side of the world.\nIntroduction to Volcanism\nEruptions and Hazards\nLandforms and Features\nMonitoring and Forecasting\nVolcanisim in National Parks\nChallenge Your Understanding\nReturn to Views of the National Parks"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1ffcfe40-4b46-4c59-9c47-f5adcb2dd96a>","<urn:uuid:01fae126-a928-4ce5-bd16-a7ad2b510149>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has exercise equipment evolved from machines to functional training, and what are the main benefits of combining cardio and strength training?","answer":"Exercise equipment has evolved from static machine-based training invented by Dr. Jonas Gustav Wilhelm Zander in the 19th century to more dynamic approaches like calisthenics, Olympic lifting, and kettlebells. This shift addresses the problem of excessive sitting during workouts. As for combining cardio and strength training, particularly through High-Intensity Resistance Training (HIRT), it offers multiple benefits: it simultaneously decreases fat and increases muscle, enhances cardiovascular health more effectively than either method alone, strengthens bones, requires less time to complete, and provides a more sustainable and engaging workout routine.","context":["Damon Young is one of Australia’s most celebrated philosophers. He recently put out a book called How to Think About Exercise, which explores the link between fitness and mental wellbeing. We enjoyed it so much that we reached out for a chat.\nWhat is the relationship between exercise and the mind?\nIt’s more than we often think. There’s plenty of scope within exercise to encourage imagination, to prompt thought, and offer meditation. There are even opportunities to develop virtues, such as courage and discipline.\nYou seem to be a particularly big fan of walking as exercise. Why?\nWhen you’re walking you can encourage a state called Transient Hypofrontality or – as I call it – “walker’s reverie”. It’s a creative state that allows ideas that were previously kept apart to intermingle. It’s almost like meditation. Charles Darwin was someone who knew all about this. He would go for a walk every day on a path he had around his home. The walk, and the state of mind that went with it, helped him to do a lot of hard creative work and ultimately change millennia of dogma.\nThere’s no doubting that exercise equipment has progressed along way since its invention in the 19th Century by the Swedish physician Dr. Jonas Gustav Wilhelm Zander. But just when we started getting swallowed up by our own machines, savvy fitness experts are returning to core basics. The shift away from static and machine based resistance exercise is thanks to the rise in dynamic focussed strength training. Skill development in this area is a vital key to harnessing and maximising one’s development.\nThe problem with the old machine approach is that it’s a symptom of our society's obsession with sitting: First at your desk at the office, then commuting to the gym and finally on the equipment itself where you’re sitting down again while pushing weights.\nImproving body movement, technique and stability to increase strength and power is now a welcome change to the very “unfitness-like” training of the past. We’ll outline three key ways you can contribute to the downfall of machine and eradicate the static in your routine.\nThe basis of Calisthenics boils down to this: the ability to control your own body weight in various movements and angles. And it’s benefits are manifold. The lack of equipment required, the opportunity to develop huge strength improvements, show off eye-catching movements, and develop a lean physique has inspired many to take up the gymnastics-inspired discipline. A Professional World Cup Circuit is now in full flight and there’s resurgence in the sport thanks to social media heavyweights such as Barstarzz and Frank Medrano inspiring thousands to incorporate it into their fitness repertoire.\n2. Olympic Lifting\nOlympic Lifting is experiencing a similar uptake in mainstream popularity primarily due to it being a vital component in Crossfit Training. And rightly so; the method can develop dramatic increases in power and strength. The aim is to attempt a maximum-weight lift in a single go. The key lifts, perhaps amusingly named (snatch, clean and jerk and power clean), are not to be underestimated in their ability for developing the body’s major muscle groups. It takes time and dedication to master the method, but the payoff is functional strength and increased mobility. Find an experienced trainer to get you started and get those hands powdered.\n3. Kettle Bells\nOriginally developed in 18th Century Russia, these dense little hooped iron or steel cannonballs are an increasingly common sight these days. While not a sight for sore eyes, they’re definitely a tool for sore arms – in a good way. Also known as the Girya, they allow the user to carry out varied swinging or ballistic exercises that combine the holy trinity of cardiovascular, strength and flexibility training. For those of a more competitive bent, Kettlebells even have dedicated sport known as Girevoy, which involves 10 minute snatch and / or jerk routines. Leading Educators in the field, such as Strong First, showcase the true precision and versatility of this classic piece of training equipment to develop a truly functional lean physique.","Cardio Vs Strength Training: Which Is Better for You?\n- 5 Benefits of Cardio Training\n- 5 Benefits of Strength Training\n- 5 Benefits of High-Intensity Resistance Training\nIf you’re a fitness enthusiast, then you already know the value of including both cardio and strength training into your workout regimen.\nBut if you’re a beginner, or maybe returning to exercise after time off, you may be wondering if you should do cardio vs. strength training, what the differences are between the two, and how best to structure your workouts. Let’s dig in:\n5 Benefits of Cardio Training\nCardiovascular exercise is an aerobic activity where you raise your heart rate for a sustained period to train the heart and lungs and boost stamina. Think jogging, hitting the stair climber or row machine, swimming laps, or cross-country skiing. Cardio benefits the body in many ways, including:\n1. Cardio Training Improves Heart Health and Endurance\nIncreased cardio means increased aerobic capacity — the amount of oxygen your blood receives and uses. This improved cardiovascular health allows your heart and lungs to move oxygen through your body more efficiently, which increases your endurance to get through longer training sessions.\n2. Cardio Exercise Reduces Body Fat\nDue to the elevated heart rate and continuous intensity, cardio burns more calories than strength training. This higher calorie burn is why cardio workouts are more often associated with fat loss. That said, there are two types of cardio for fat loss to consider.\nHigh-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): For HIIT workouts, you want to get to at least 80% of your maximum heart rate during the high-intensity intervals and not allow it to drop below 50% for the low-intensity intervals or breaks.\nHIIT workouts help you to retain current muscle mass. HIIT fat loss is believed to be related to an increase in hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a fat-burning enzyme activated by the release of hormones.\nLow-Intensity Steady State (LISS): LISS workouts consist of aerobic activities (walking, jogging at a leisurely pace, swimming laps, etc.) performed at low intensity for an extended period. It’s the opposite of HIIT.\nResearch suggests that LISS workouts may help burn fat at a higher rate than high-intensity workouts. As a result, LISS is often considered better for anyone with significant fat loss goals, especially since it’s suited for all fitness levels.\n3. Cardio Workouts Increases Energy\nThere’s a complex relationship between stress, hormones, and energy. When you do cardio, your body releases stress hormones (epinephrine and norepinephrine). When released in small amounts through exercise, these hormones give your body energy.\n4. Cardio Regimens Lower Blood Pressure Levels\nRegular cardio activity makes your heart stronger, allowing it to pump blood with less effort, decreasing the pressure on your arteries while lowering your blood pressure. In addition, studies have shown that endurance exercises like running, cycling, or rowing are effective at decreasing blood pressure.\n5. Cardio Activity Increases Mental Clarity\nThe increased blood flow from your cardio routine is good for your body and brain. Improved circulation can lead to better memory, as well as increased alertness and brain function.\n5 Benefits of Strength Training\nStrength training (often called weight training) consists of exercising the muscles against resistance to increase muscular endurance and strength. The muscles are challenged to overcome forces that come from your workout equipment, be it YBells, kettlebells or dumbbells, selectorized machines, or your body weight. Some of the benefits of strength training are:\n1. Strength Training Builds Muscle\nLifting weights builds and sculpts your muscles through hypertrophy, which is an increase in the size of muscles. Weights put more resistance on your muscles, breaking down tissue quickly and triggering your body to heal and build muscle in the process.\nA study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that participants increased their lean mass through a weight training program.\n2. Strength Training Burns Calories Even After the Workout\nWhile cardio training burns more calories during the actual workout, strength training burns calories long after the workout ends. Your muscle is constantly being broken down and built back up, which requires energy (calories). This after-burn leads to a more significant calorie burn throughout the day.\n3. Weight Training Protects Bone Health\nWeight training helps to increase your bone density, which strengthens your bones. Stronger bones can slow down or help to prevent osteoporosis, not to mention avoiding breaking or fracturing your bones.\n4. Strength Training Prevents Injuries\nStronger muscles support your joints, increase your mobility, and reduce your risk of hip or knee damage or arthritis. Strong joints also prevent injury through better balance, coordination and improved posture, decreasing lower back and neck pain.\nA study from the National Library of Medicine showed that strength training reduced the risk of falling by 40% in older people (who are at higher risk of falling).\n5. Weight Training Improves Cardiovascular Health\nWeight training increases lean muscle mass, allowing your lungs to process more oxygen as you breathe and your heart to pump more blood with less pressure. Lowered pressure on your arteries puts less demand on your heart, reducing heart-related health issues.\nIf you regularly lift weights, you’ll reap the benefits of a lowered risk of a stroke or heart attack.\nMeet HIRT: The Perfect Blend of Cardio and Strength Training\nYears ago, gym members had straightforward divisions of cardio vs. resistance training. Today, with the rise of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), Tabata training, and high-intensity resistance training (HIRT), the pure distinction between cardio and strength work has blurred. Sweat sessions often combine the two.\nSo instead of 30 minutes of pure cardio or strict strength, you might do 5 minutes of cardio, followed by 5 minutes of strength. Or you may perform 50 jumping jacks, 15 YBell pick-up cross catch squat presses, 25 burpees, and 15 YBell push-ups.\n5 Benefits of High-Intensity Resistance Training\nWith HIRT, you get all the benefits of HIIT, cardio, and strength training.\n1. HIRT Decreases Fat and Increases Muscle\nCombining cardio and strength gives you the best of both workout regimens: cardio’s fat loss and strength training’s muscle gain.\nHIRT training increases your resting energy expenditure, causing increased fat oxidation. Much like in strength training, HIRT increases your excess post-exercise oxygen consumption as your body recovers from the workout. So you’re burning more energy and breaking down stored fat while you build muscles.\n2. HIRT Enhances Your Cardiovascular Health\nA recent study showed that participants who did resistance and cardio training for eight weeks lowered their heart disease risk factors more than those who did just cardio or just strength.\n3. HIRT Strengthens Your Bones\nBy stressing your bones, resistance training increases bone density and reduces the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures. Several studies have shown that women who do regular resistance training see significant increases in the bone density of their hips and spine.\n4. HIRT Takes Less Time\nGroup classes might last 30 to 40 minutes, but you can achieve a highly effective HIRT workout at home in as little as 10 minutes. It’s all about keeping up your intensity for the elevated heart rate and muscle gain.\nIf you’re low on spare time, you can still sneak in a quick workout during your lunch break or between household chores.\n5. HIRT Is a Sustainable and Fun Workout\nExperienced athletes and those new to working out often find that they can commit to HIRT training better than traditional weight or cardio workouts. That’s because HIRT workouts are much more engaging, requiring you to be agile and focused, whether you’re working out alone or with a group.\nSo Is Cardio or Strength Training Better for You?\nFor optimal fitness, both cardio and strength work are necessary. But, beyond that stipulation, there’s lots of flexibility in how you put together your workout routine.\nVarious research draws conflicting conclusions regarding whether it’s better to do cardio or strength training first. Intuitively, it makes sense to perform cardio first if your goal is to improve endurance so you can run a marathon. However, if you want to build strength and muscle, hit the weights first while your body is fresh.\nVariety and cross-training deliver the best results, so mix up your routine with multiple modalities when possible. If you like doing cardio workouts on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and strength training on Tuesday and Thursday, do that.\nIf you do a HIRT workout with YBells twice a week, that counts as both your cardio workout and strength training. Pick other exercise modalities on alternating days, such as yoga or swimming laps for active recovery.\nLots of options exist. What’s most important: get in both cardio and strength, and adhere to regular workouts!\nFor more than 25 years, Julie King has been a certified group exercise instructor and personal trainer, holding certifications from the American College of Sports Medicine, the American Council on Exercise, the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America, the Aquatic Exercise Association and Schwinn/Mad Dogg Athletics.

{"question":"What are the key differences between soil-based and oceanic carbon sequestration mechanisms in terms of their storage capacity and stability?","answer":"Soil and oceanic carbon sequestration mechanisms differ significantly in their storage capacity and stability. Oceans have a much greater storage capacity, absorbing and storing 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere through both physical and biological mechanisms. Ocean sequestration occurs through CO2 dissolution in seawater and ocean circulation, where dense water drags down sequestered carbon. In contrast, soil carbon sequestration relies on biological processes involving plants and soil microorganisms, with perennial grasses being particularly effective due to their extensive root systems. Soil storage stability can vary - while healthy soil contains billions of organisms that help lock up carbon, there are concerns that rising global temperatures may disturb this equilibrium and release more carbon dioxide than is being sequestered.","context":["My dad, raised on a farm and once a farmer, said he could tell what dairy cows ate by the taste of their milk. In his day, cows grazed on perennial grasses and forbs, such as alfalfa and clover. By the 1950s, farmers were using commercial chemical fertilizers to grow row crops. As they plowed more cropland, they turned to corn and wheat—seeds of annual grasses—to fatten, or finish, livestock. But now there's a movement afoot to return animals to pasture.\nA growing number of restaurants and food markets feature meat and milk from grass-fed animals. Some customers say they simply prefer the taste of these foods. Market demand also reflects other consumer concerns, including animal welfare and human health.\nConservation is another good reason to restore grazers to grasslands. This issue's lead story, \"Where Cattle Roam and Wild Grasses Grow,\" tells how grazing can help create better wildlife habitat on wildlife management areas.\nIn partnership with livestock producers, the DNR and other conservation organizations are trying a new twist on traditional grazing. The practice calls for grazing of cattle in a carefully timed and measured rotation, simulating the way bison grazed the landscape over time. On well-managed grasslands, some native plants, such as prairie smoke and pasque flowers, have a chance to multiply. Migratory and resident wildlife alike stand to prosper among a greater diversity of plants of various heights.\nOur story focuses on conservation grazing as a tool for managing today's grasslands, including restored and highly degraded prairies. This tool might not prove to be as useful for managing our precious few remnants of original prairie. \"The unfortunate situation for native prairies in Minnesota today is that we have relatively small fragments within a sea of invasive species,\" says DNR ecologist Fred Harris, \"[It is] a totally different scene from 200-plus years ago. That's why we should be cautious about how we apply grazing to the best remaining prairies, particularly those with wetter soils or that have populations of rare native species.\"\nConservation grazing on selected lands has the potential for benefits beyond those cited in our story. Most important, perennial grasses keep the soil covered year-round. With their extensive root systems, prairie plants are especially valuable because they hold soil firmly in place. Grasslands thus help prevent erosion and control runoff and flooding.\nAt a fall 2012 workshop called Restoring the Soil Resource: Insuring for Resiliency and Profit, Midwestern farmers and ranchers spoke about the advantages of integrating livestock and grazing into their operations. Microbiologist Kristine Nichols discussed her research on soil health. Continuous green cover acts like insulation, she said, keeping soil warm enough for microorganisms to stay active longer. Underground microbial activity not only supports plant life, but it also relies on plants above ground. Management practices such as perennial cover, plant diversity, and grazing systems can improve the habitat for soil livestock. And there can be a lot of livestock, Nichols pointed out: A handful of healthy soil holds billions of organisms—more than all the people who ever lived on Earth.\nEarth, the planet, could be the biggest beneficiary of prairie and grasslands conservation. Over a span of 12 years, U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers examined the impact of different cattle grazing scenarios on soil. According to results published on their website, \"land that was grazed produced more grass than ungrazed land [did], and grazing led to the most carbon and nitrogen being sequestered in soil.\" Like trees in the forests, perennial grasses can lock up these major contributors to the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the world's climate.\nTo capture all the benefits and address all the threats to our prairie and grassland landscapes, grazing needs to be practiced with conservation in mind. Conservation of natural resources is the ultimate goal and the best guide for measuring success.\nKathleen Weflen, editor","Soil carbon sequestration\nA guide to soil carbon sequestration, where healthy soils absorb water and carbon dioxide\nWhat is soil carbon sequestration (meaning/definition)?\nSoil carbon sequestration is the process of removing carbon dioxide from the air via plants and trees. Carbon becomes locked up in the soil through many biological processes including the incorporation of leaf and other plant litter by creatures living in the soil. Sometimes this process happens as part of the agricultural cycle and plant remains are incorporated during ploughing and tilling.\nSoil carbon sequestration is the process of locking carbon into soils. There are many processes that contribute to sequestration. In agriculture remains from the harvest may be incorporated into the as part of the cultivation process: ploughing and discing for example. Composts and manures applied as top dressing or through injection are other routes used in farming to provide nutrients and carbon rich materials into the surface layers. In forests and uncultivated lands leaves, plant litter and fire debris are all degraded and incorporated into the surface layers through natural processes; actions of fauna and fungi for example. The net effect of such processes is to incorporate carbon into soils and as such remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the previous plant growth that led to the plant, crop litter or animal feed. These processes do not lead to a total permanent removal of carbon dioxide. They are rather part of a dynamic equilibrium between the above examples of carbon incorporations and soil processes that release carbon dioxide and methane (and nitrogen oxides) back into the atmosphere. Where the soil is less disturbed by agriculture carbonaceous rich material does build up in the soil.\nThere are concerns that rising global temperatures may disturb this equilibria and release more carbon dioxide than is being sequestered. In turn this may create a feedback loop with yet more warming etc.\nThe role of biochar in soil carbon sequestration\nBiochar is a material with high stability in the living environment. Through incorporation into the soil it can help improve soil performance in agriculture and horticulture. Importantly it remains stable in the soil for decades, centuries and possibly longer. It is a viable means for carbon sequestration and at the same time helps plants grow better in many conditions. This double benefit is in sharp contrast to some other approaches to carbon sequestration that are currently being developed and trialled.\nOther natural carbon sinks\nWhilst soil and the addition of biochar is one very important carbon sink, there are other natural carbon sink systems to be aware of\nThe ocean absorbs and stores x50 more carbon than the atmosphere via physical and biological mechanisms.\nCarbon dioxide easily dissolves in sea water, which then helps support animal and plant life. The dead material then sinks to the seabed and is then essentially sequestered longer term.\nThe physical mechanism is the natural process of ocean circulation where dense water drags down sequestered carbon.\nPlants and trees depend on the soil for health. They sequester carbon via the process of photosynthesis and become a carbon sink until they die. At this point the material slowly begin to break down and release the carbon as carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.\nPeatlands are similar to soil but stay very stable due to them being waterlogged, slowing down the decomposition process trapping the carbon as a sink. If they dry out or are mined then the carbon is released as carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.\nIn some cases peat builds up in bogs over millennia making deposits metres deep.\nShale contains organic carbon (OC) and carbonates. It is believed to make up ~33% of all rock formations on the earths surface and therefore is the largest total mass of organic carbon on earth. It should not be underestimated as to how important it is.\nLimestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It essentially locks up the carbon from decaying organic material like shells, algae and coral. The process of turning limestone into concrete is an energy intensive one, which releases the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nThe benefits of carbon farming and regenerative agriculture\nReduce disturbance of the top soil, make fine drills and plant directly into the ground.\nThis leads to more water storage, microbe growth and healthier more vigorous plants.\nPlant cover crops between seasons, this provides diversity of root exudate, feeding the soil biology, building a healthy diverse soil.\nThis is the process of combining trees and agriculture together. This can either be planting trees directly into crop fields, growing trees next to agricultural fields or farming in a forest environment that already exists.\nThis optimises the beneficial interactions between trees and crops under ground, as well as bring in pollinators and biodiversity above ground.\nAnimals are a great way to improve soils. They eat the top layer of organic material, drop manure/urine full of microbes and nitrogen as well as break up the top layer of material with their hooves, stimulating growth. Its important to move them on quickly and allow that patch of land to rejuvenate. It is worth the extra planning and work involved.\nProvide the ground with with material that will breakdown and provide the soil with nutrients and microorganisms.\nAll of these techniques can lead to more localised rainfall, pull carbon out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis and reduce the risk of desertification – turning the soil into dust, making it vulnerable to wind and water erosion.\nFuture carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies\nThere is also growing interest in capturing carbon dioxide at the end of industrial processes such as power generation, cement or steel manufacture etc. This typically would use a chemical system to capture the carbon dioxide in one step and release it in a second step thus producing a concentrated stream of pure carbon dioxide that can be dried and compressed for piping or shipping to a well and pumped as a super critical fluid into a deep sub-surface formation (rock) where it would be permanently stored. An alternative is to separate the carbon dioxide using a membrane that is selective for transmitting the gas but resists transmitting other gases. The carbon dioxide would then be dried and compressed before being piped or shipped and pumped into the reservoir. These simple sounding steps hide a multitude of challenges that will need to be overcome to make these processes work. The projected costs for these processes are very high. The carbon dioxide in the ground has no value but represents a long term liability w.r.t. the need to maintain monitoring for well and reservoir stability as well as leakage.\nSome are seeing advantage in directly stripping CO2 out of the air to offset earlier CO2 emissions eg by Microsoft. Others see commercial advantage in using the recovered CO2 in greenhouse horticulture. Climeworks recently reported costs to strip out the gas at $800/tonne but they aim for $100 per tonne. This would be before costs to dispose of the collected gas eg by sequestration in a sub-surface aquifer. With current approaches the DAC route appears to be very expensive. $800/tonne for capturing CO2 is equivalent to ca $2900/tonne for carbon. On this basis biochar would be a bargain.\nThere are at least a couple of alternative approaches to CCS. One that has very recently been in the news is the use of basalt or silicate rock flour spread on the land to absorb and react with carbon dioxide in the air to form a mineral carbonate. A paper in Nature claimed there were stockpiles of basalt available as a by-product from mining.\nBeerling, D.J., Kantzas, E.P., Lomas, M.R. et al. Potential for large-scale CO2 removal via enhanced rock weathering with croplands. Nature 583, 242–248 (2020)\nWith all these approaches, the costs are high, there are many technical obstacles to overcome and the scales required are enormous. There is an opportunity for biochar to be used to offset carbon dioxide emissions. Biochar is resistant to degradation in the environment making it a suitable vehicle for offsetting. What’s more it is a product with value and prospectively value at very large scale through its use in agriculture, horticulture, forestry and in the urban environment. The traditional methods for making biochar are themselves carbon dioxide intensive but using electrical heating with renewable electricity this can be radically reduced. The market in biochar needs to be expanded with some urgency to enable this opportunity to flourish."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b535439-aa8d-4afc-8371-0d90e62a4143>","<urn:uuid:f76d14ea-a31b-40ec-8cd9-731851399436>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the pastoral roles and responsibilities described in early religious texts compare to the modern challenges of conducting online communion services? Can you analyze the evolution of pastoral care from traditional shepherding to digital ministry?","answer":"Traditional pastors, as described in religious texts, had clear responsibilities of physically tending to their flock - feeding sheep, protecting them from harm, and being constantly vigilant. They were expected to fully dedicate themselves to their pastoral duties, avoiding other pursuits like commerce or farming. In contrast, modern digital ministry presents new challenges around conducting services like online communion. While traditional pastors like Jacob would physically watch over sheep day and night, today's religious leaders must consider how to maintain spiritual connections through virtual means. Some churches like LifeChurch.tv have embraced online communion where participants prepare their own bread and drink, while others remain cautious about virtual sacraments. The traditional physical presence and direct care of pastors has evolved into questions about whether spiritual communion can be effectively delivered through digital channels, with some religious leaders arguing that the Holy Spirit's presence isn't necessarily limited by physical proximity.","context":["THE Revd Tim Ross, the Methodist minister who announced last month that he was going to run a holy communion service on Twitter, the social-networking website, is not the first person to attempt communion on the net (News, 20 August).\nLifeChurch.tv, a multiple-campus church in the United States which broadcasts streamed video in real time, includes communion for those sitting at their computers. The instructions posted online say: “You’ll want to have these elements on hand: 1) Bread — small piece of bread, cracker, etc. 2) Small glass of something to drink — grape juice, wine, Kool-Aid, etc.”\nThis upfront approach is light-years away from the deference originally accorded to religious worship by older media such as radio and television. One famous story has it that when the BBC first proposed broadcasting worship on the wireless, the Dean of St Paul’s objected because the services might be heard by “men in pubs wearing hats”.\nBy the 1980s, however, something that looked rather like communion was being delivered every Sunday morning on This is the Day on BBC1. The programme was broadcast live from ordinary homes, and the set included flowers, a candle, a Bible, and a bread roll — but no wine. Those in the “viewing congregation” were invited to bring their own bread, and to eat it as an act of fellowship. There was no prayer of consecration.\nGeoffrey Marshall Taylor, who worked on the programme, says the producers were “at pains to be clear that this was a non-eucharistic service. However, central to it was linking a virtual community of viewers, whom we saw as participants, not voyeurs.” Vital to this experience was the live transmission, which meant that the bread was shared in real time.\nIt was precisely this detail — sharing in real time — that gave Mr Ross the idea for his Twitter communion. Here, however, the theological caution of the TV age was replaced by theological adventure, facilitated by the open channel of Twitter.\nMr Ross writes: “What I love about Twitter is the instantaneous contact it gives you with your followers. It gave me the idea that we could do a live communion service for believers around the world, sharing together the bread and wine as the one Body of Christ.”\nTHIS enthusiasm is not shared by the UK’s main online churches, which for several years have been wary of embracing any form of e-eucharist.\nThe Revd Pam Smith is Priest-in-Charge of i-church, an online community launched by the diocese of Oxford in 2004. She notes that the church would need specific permission from its Bishop to introduce a new format for the sacraments. She says, however: “I think it’s an issue that will keep coming back. Some people who find it hard to get to an offline church have found Christ present in their online Christian community, and naturally want to express that through communion.”\nThe Anglican Cathedral in the online world of Second Life is also subject to a this-worldly church in the form of the Bishop of Guildford, the Rt Revd Christopher Hill. He speculated in 2008 that an online sacrament could possibly be seen as “spiritual communion”, the non-sacramental service followed by people, such as servicemen and women, when they are not able to receive full communion (Comment, 25 July 2008). Yet this promising idea has not been taken up so far, and no sacraments are celebrated in the virtual cathedral.\nOver in St Pixels, an ecumenical community with no external hierarchy to satisfy, there is little demand from the grass-roots members for BYOB&W services alongside their other chatroom-based worship. Mark Howe, a member of the management team, says: “Doing anything still looks too divisive to happen as a mainstream event.”\nSO, AMONG the sensible caution, risk-aversion, and the postponement of Twitter communion, is it possible to receive the eucharist online from any church in the UK?\nThe answer lies with Luss Parish Church, Loch Lomond. This Church of Scotland community holds 150 weddings each year, because of the picturesque and patriotic location, and has been streaming marriage services on the web for the past six years, so that family and friends abroad can “be there”, too.\nWhen the church added its regular services to the stream on its website, up to 10,000 people at a time joined it online. The Minister, the Revd Dane Sherrard, says: “Quite a number of people who join us every week for our service were, off their own bat, gathering together their own elements of bread and wine, and sharing with us at communion time. What we are really doing is sharing our service with those who are unable to get to a traditional church to worship.”\nTheological support for the idea came last year from the Baptist systematic theologian Paul Fiddes. He argued that avatars (characters appearing onscreen in computer worlds) could receive the bread and wine of the eucharist within their world, and this might be seen as an indirect means of grace for the person controlling the avatar.\nThe Revd Dr Michael Moynagh, a missioner for Fresh Expressions, is also positive. While conceding that different eucharistic theologies will produce widely different responses to the idea of virtual communion, he asks: “If the presence of the Spirit makes the sacrament effective, is there a need for worshippers to be physically in the same place? Can the Spirit not be powerfully at work through communion even though the community is scattered?”\nWhile there is no pressure from virtual churches in the UK to push the boundaries, maverick projects such as Twitter communion will probably keep raising the questions. Watch this virtual space.\nSimon Jenkins is editor of Ship of Fools (www.shipoffools.com), and was project leader of the Church of Fools.","|« Prev||Of Pastors.||Next »|\nDemonstration X.—Of Pastors.\n1. Pastors are set over the flock, and give the sheep the food of life. Whosoever is watchful, and toils in behalf of his sheep, is careful for his flock, and is the disciple of our Good Shepherd, who gave Himself in behalf of His sheep.10171017 John x. 11, sq. And whosoever brings not back his flock carefully, is likened to the hireling who has no care for the sheep. Be ye like, O Pastors, to those righteous Pastors of old. Jacob fed the sheep of Laban, and guarded them and toiled and was watchful, and so received the reward. For Jacob said to Laban:—Lo! twenty years am I with thee. Thy sheep and thy flocks I have not robbed and the males of thy sheep I have not eaten. That which was broken I did not bring unto thee, but thou required it at my hands! In the daytime the heat devoured me and the cold by night.10181018 Gen. xxxi. 38, 40. My sleep departed from my eyes. Observe, ye Pastors, that Pastor, how he cared for his flock. He used to watch in the night-time to guard it and was vigilant; and he used to toil in the daytime to feed it. As Jacob was a pastor, so Joseph was a pastor and his brethren were pastors. Moses was a pastor, and David also was a pastor. So Amos was a pastor. These all were pastors who fed the sheep and led them well.\n2. Now, why, my beloved, did these pastors first feed the sheep, and were then chosen to be pastors of men? Clearly that they might learn how a pastor cares for his sheep, and is watchful and toils in behalf of his sheep. And when they had learned the manners of pastors, they were chosen for the pastoral office. Jacob fed the sheep of Laban and toiled and was vigilant and led them well; and then he tended and guided well his sons, and taught them the pattern of pastoral work. And Joseph used to tend the sheep along with his brethren; and in Egypt he became guide to a numerous people, and led them back, as a good pastor does his flock. Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father-in-law, and he was chosen from (tending) the sheep to tend his people, and as a good pastor he guided them. Moses bore his staff upon his shoulder, and went in front of his people that he was leading, and tended them for forty years; and he was vigilant and toiled on behalf of his sheep, a diligent and good pastor. When his Lord wished to destroy them because of their sins, in that they worshipped the calf, Moses prayed and besought of his Lord and said:—Either pardon the people for their sins, or else blot me out from Thy book that Thou hast written.10191019 Ex. xxxii. 31, 32. That is a most diligent pastor, who delivered over himself on behalf of his sheep. That is an excellent leader, who gave himself in behalf of his sheep. And that is a merciful father who cherished his children and reared them up. Moses the great and wise shepherd, who knew how to lead back the flock, taught Joshua the son of Nun, a man full of the spirit, who (afterwards) led the flock, even all the host of Israel. He destroyed kings and subdued the land, and gave them the land as a place of pasturage, and divided the resting-places and the sheepfolds to his 384sheep. Furthermore, David fed his father’s sheep, and was taken from the sheep to tend his people. So he tended them in the integrity of his heart and by the skill of his hands he guided them.10201020 Ps. lxxviii. 72. And when David numbered the flock of his sheep, wrath came upon them, and they began to be destroyed. Then David delivered himself over on behalf of his sheep, when he prayed, saying:—O Lord God, I have sinned in that I have numbered Israel. Let Thy hand be on me and on my father’s house. These innocent sheep, in what have they sinned?10211021 2 Sam. xxiv. 17. So also all the diligent pastors used thus to give themselves on behalf of their sheep.\n3. But those pastors who did not care for the sheep, those were hirelings who used to feed themselves alone. On this account the Prophet10221022 Ezek. xxxiv. 2–4, 9, 10–12, 18, 19. addresses them, saying to them:—O ye pastors who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord: Lo! I will visit My sheep as the pastor visits his flock in the day of the whirlwind, and I will require My sheep at your hands. O foolish pastors, with the wool of the sheep do ye clothe yourselves and the flesh of the fatlings do eat, and the sheep ye do not feed. That which was sick ye did not heal, and that which was broken ye did not bind. The weak ye did not strengthen, and the lost and the scattered ye did not gather together. The strong ones and the fatlings ye did guard, but with harshness ye subdued them. The good pastures ye yourselves graze upon, and what remains ye trample with your feet. The pleasant waters do ye drink, and whatever remains ye defile with your feet. And My sheep have eaten the trampled (herbage) which your feet have trampled, and they have drunk the waters which your feet have defiled. These are the greedy and base pastors and hirelings, who did not feed the sheep, or guide them well, or deliver them from the wolves. But when the Great Pastor, the chief of pastors, shall come, He will call and visit His sheep and will take knowledge of His flock. And He will bring forward those pastors, and will exact an account from them, and will condemn them for their deeds. And those who fed the sheep well, them the Chief of Pastors will cause to rejoice and to inherit life and rest. O stupid and foolish pastor, to whose right hand and to whose right eye I committed my sheep. Because thou didst say concerning the sheep, let that which dieth, die, and let that which perisheth perish, and whatever is left, let them devour the flesh of one another; therefore, behold I will make blind thy right eye and I will wither up thy right arm. Thy eye which regarded a bribe shall be blinded, and thy hand which did not rule in righteousness shall waste away.10231023 Zech. xi. 9, 17. And as for you, my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, ye are men; but I am the Lord your God.10241024 Ezek. xxxiv. 31. Behold henceforth will feed you in a good and rich pasture.10251025 Ezek. xxxiv. 14.\n4. The good shepherd giveth himself for the sake of his sheep.10261026 John x. 11. And again He said:—I have other sheep and I must bring them also hither. And the whole flock shall be one, and one shepherd, and My Father because of this loveth Me; that I give Myself for the sake of the sheep.10271027 John x. 16, 17. And again He said;—I am the door of the sheep. Every one that entereth by Me shall live and shall go in and go out and find pasture.10281028 John x. 9. O ye pastors, be ye made like unto that diligent pastor, the chief of the whole flock, who cared so greatly for his flock. He brought nigh those that were afar off. He brought back the wanderers. He visited the sick. He strengthened the weak. He bound up the broken. He guarded the fatlings. He gave himself up for the sake of the sheep. He chose and instructed excellent leaders, and committed the sheep into their hands, and gave them authority over all his flock. For He said to Simon Cephas:—Feed My sheep and My lambs and My ewes.10291029 John xxi. 15–17. So Simon fed His sheep; and he fulfilled his time and handed over the flock to you, and departed. Do ye 385also feed and guide them well. For the pastor who cares for his sheep engages in no other pursuit along with that. He does not make a vineyard, nor plant gardens, nor does he fall into the troubles of this world. Never have we seen a pastor who left his sheep in the wilderness and became a merchant, or one who left his flock to wander and became a husbandman. But if he deserts his flock and does these things he thereby hands over his flock to the wolves.\n5. And remember, my beloved, that I wrote to thee concerning our fathers of old that they first learned the ways of tending sheep and in that received trial of carefulness, and then were chosen for the office of guides, that they might learn and observe how much the pastor cares for his flock, and as they used to guide the sheep carefully, so also might be perfected in this office of guidance. Thus Joseph was chosen from the sheep, to guide the Egyptians in the time of affliction. And Moses was chosen from the sheep, to guide his people and tend them. And David was taken from following the sheep, to become king over Israel. And the Lord took Amos from following the sheep, and made him a prophet over his people. Elisha likewise was taken from behind the yoke, to become a prophet in Israel. Moses did not return to his sheep, nor did he leave his flock that was committed to him. David did not return to his father’s sheep, but guided his people in the integrity of his heart.10301030 Ps. lxxviii. 72. Amos did not turn back to feed his sheep, or to gather (the fruit of) trees, but he guided them and performed his office of prophecy. Elisha did not turn back to his yoke, but served Elijah and filled his place. And he10311031 Sc. Gehazi. who was for him as a shepherd, because he loved fields and merchandise and vineyards and oliveyards and tillage, did not wish to become his disciple; and (therefore) he did not commit the flock into his hand.\n6. I beseech you, ye pastors, that ye set not over the flock, leaders who are foolish and stupid, covetous also and lovers of possessions. Every one who feeds the flock shall eat of their milk.10321032 1 Cor. ix. 7, sq. And every one who guides the yoke shall be ministered to from his labour. The priests have a right to partake of the altar, and the Levites shall receive their tithes. Whoever eats of the milk, let his heart be upon the flock; and let him that is ministered to from the labour of his yoke, take heed to his tillage. And let the priests who partake of the altar serve the altar with honour. And as for the Levites who receive the tithes, they have no portion in Israel. O pastors, disciples of our great Pastor, be ye not like hirelings; because the hireling cares not for the sheep. Be ye like our Sweet Pastor, Whose life was not dearer to Him than His sheep. Rear up the youths and bring up the maidens; and love the lambs and let them be reared in your bosoms; that when ye shall come to the Chief Pastor, ye may offer to Him all your sheep in completeness, and so He may give you what He has promised: Where I am, ye also shall be.10331033 John xii. 26. These things, brief as they are, will be sufficient for the good pastors and leaders.\n7. Above, my beloved, I have written to remind thee of the character that becomes the whole flock. And in this discourse I have written to thee about the pastors, the guides of the flock. These reminders I have written to thee, beloved, as thou didst ask of me in thy dear letter.\n8. The Steward brought me into the King’s treasury and showed me there many precious things; and when I saw them my mind was captivated with the great treasury. And as I looked upon it, it dazzled my eyes, and took captive my thoughts, and caused my reflections to wander in many ways. Whosoever receives thereof, is himself enriched, and enriches (others). It lies open and unguarded before all that seek it; and though many take from it there is no deficiency; and when they give of that which 386they have received, their own portion is greatly multiplied. They that receive freely let them give freely10341034 Matt. x. 8. as they have received. For (this treasure) cannot be sold for a price, because there is nothing equivalent to it. Moreover the treasure fails not; and they that receive it are not satiated. They drink, and are still eager; they eat, and are hungry. Whosoever is not thirsty, finds not ought to drink; whoever is not hungry, finds nothing to eat. The hunger for it satisfies many, and from the thirst for it flow forth water-springs. For the man who draws nigh to the fear of God is like the man who in his thirst draws near to the water-spring and drinks and is satisfied, and the fountain is not a whit diminished. And the land that needs to drink in water, drinks of the fountain, but its waters fail not. And when the land drinks, it needs again to drink, and the spring is not lessened by its flowing. So is the knowledge of God. Though all men should receive of it, yet there would come no lack in it, nor can it be limited by the sons of flesh. He that takes from it, cannot take away all; and when he gives, he lacks nothing. When thou takest fire with a candle from a flame, though thou kindle many candles at it, yet the flame does not diminish when thou takest from it, nor does the candle fail, when it kindles many. One man cannot receive all the King’s treasure, nor when a thirsty man drinks of the fountain, do its waters fill. When a man stands on a lofty mountain, his eye does not (equally) comprehend the near and the distant; nor, when he stands and counts the stars of heaven, can he set limits to the hosts of the heavens. So when he draws nigh unto the fear of God, he cannot attain to the whole of it; and when he receives much that is precious, it does not seem to be diminished; and when he gives of that which he has received, it is not exhausted, nor has it come to an end for him. And remember, my beloved, what I wrote to thee, in the first discourse, about faith, that whoever has freely received ought to give freely as he has received, as our Lord said:—Freely ye have received, freely give.10351035 Matt. x. 8. For whosoever keeps back part of anything he has received,10361036 Matt. xxv. 29. even that which he has obtained shall be taken away from him. Therefore, my beloved, as I have been able to obtain now from that treasure that fails not, I have sent unto thee from it. Yet though I have sent it to thee, it is all with me. For the treasure fails not, for it is the wisdom of God; and the steward is our Lord Jesus Christ, as He testified when He said:—All things have been committed to Me by My Father.10371037 Matt. xi. 27. And while He is the steward of the wisdom, again, as the Apostle said:—Christ is the power of God and His wisdom.10381038 1 Cor. i. 24. This wisdom is imparted to many, yet nothing is lacking, as I explained to thee above; the Prophets received of the spirit of Christ, yet Christ was not a whit diminished.\n9. Ten treatises have I written unto thee, my beloved. Whatsoever thou hast asked of me, I have explained to thee without (receiving) ought from thee. And that which thou enquiredst not of me, I have given unto thee. I have asked thy name and written unto thee. I have asked of myself thy question, and I have answered thee as I was able, for thy persuasion. Whatsoever I have written unto thee, meditate in these things at every time; and labour to read those books which are read in the church of God. These ten little books that I have written for thee, they borrow one from another, and depend one upon another. Separate them not one from another. From Olaph to Yud I have written for thee, each letter after its fellow. Read thou and learn thou and the brethren, the monks, and the faithful, they from whom mocking is far removed; as I wrote unto thee above. And remember that which I pointed out to thee, that I have not brought these matters to an end, but short of the end.

{"question":"What are some ways that artists portray family separation in their work, and what mental health issues can separation cause in children?","answer":"Artists address family separation through powerful works like Bill Viola's video 'Walking on the Edge', which shows a father and son walking together in a desert before their paths diverge, symbolizing the universal experience of separation between parent and child. Regarding mental health impacts, separation can cause significant anxiety disorders in children, leading to symptoms like unrealistic worries about loved ones' safety, reluctance to sleep alone, and psychosomatic symptoms. This anxiety can persist beyond normal developmental stages and may require professional intervention if it impairs social functioning or academic performance.","context":["Surprising is the recently born Cartagena de Indias International Biennial of Contemporary Art in Colombia, that opened within the framework of one the most beautiful cities in the world. Under the direction of the well-known curator Berta Sichel, and a team of curators such as the American Barbara S. Krulik, the Nigerian Bisi Silva, the Belgian Paul Wellemsen and the German Stephanie Rosenthal, over 120 international and Colombian artists showed work that not only impressed us but also left an indelible mark in the art world.\nRomuald Hazoume, from Benin, brought us a work that consisted of a motorcycle used in his country to transport petroleum and water to far-away areas, painstakingly built to reach equilibrium, with which the artist held a coherent discourse that the future wars in the world will not be caused by petroleum but by water. He also made a balanced criticism on the social problems facing his country.\nJanet Biggs (USA) presented an impressive 4-channel video called “Step on the Sun”, filmed in the Ljen volcano in Eastern Java (Indonesia), where brave men in the midst of total adversity, recover the sulphur left by the burning lava of the active volcano, as a means of subsistence in an extreme environment, in the ambiguity of nature’s beauty and the human exploitation, thus dealing with a discourse on global biopolitics and humanism.\nNick Cave (USA), mono-channel video and “soundsuit”. These are objects and mannequins wearing strange and colorful dresses made in the 90s for dancing performances in stop-action, furnished with visual effects and singing of crickets and Native American drum beats.\nAnother interesting work during the biennial is by Helena Almeida from Lisbon. By means of photography, she made a series of visual reflections on space-time and the adverse human relations in the contemporary world in such a way that the spectator is forced to reflect on their own human condition, limitations, and possibilities.\nPeter Campus (USA) brought us a beautiful and poetic work, posing a conflict between what is real and what is virtual, the relationship between a work of art and the spectator, existentialism and narcissism. His work stands out for the highly sophisticated technical articulation in terms of the creation of an image. He presented four videos during the biennial, using this technique to create “paintings” in the videos paused in the moment, mixing light and color showing some kind of painting imagery, meditating on the passage of time and the concept of humanity in the natural world.\nBill Viola (USA) came with one of his sensorial perception videos, “Walking on the Edge”. This mono channel video (2012) showed another universal human experience, using the internal language of subjective thoughts, representing the separation between the father and the son when they take different paths in life, a separation symbolized in a nebulous desert, and at a certain moment, the paths cross and they walk side by side to be separated again.\nThe Colombian Elias Heim, sculptor and installation artist used a diverse mechanic technology in his works envisioning the world from three aspects as he himself noted: religion, science, and art. His work in the Biennal is an installation called “Gulgolet”, where these three aspects stand out with well configured skulls in neon light placed in a frontal mural of the exhibition space, and a compilation of the same profiles in pieces of wood piled up on the floor. This reminds us of the Shoah burial grounds and the unmarked burial grounds of the wars in Colombia.\nJulie Mehretu (USA-Germany) painted in huge format, in a complex pictorial language that reflected in a mimetic way on the changing cosmology, she uses an abstract and chaotic language that contains brushstrokes, graffiti, calligraphy, and architectural elements.\nIt’s important to mention the works by Ming Wong (video-performance in a dramatic work speaking of the genre of travestism and melodrama), Khalil Rabah (Palestinian conceptual artist with an installation of piles of postcard photographs taken in different Palestinian villages that are now occupied, organized in the space as an aerial cartography), Xi Ziuzhen (mysterious libraries in which the books are covered in dress clothes, as testimonies of a determined period or moment of history) and Candida Hofer with a diaporama of beautiful realistic photographs on the daily life of the Turkish people in Germany. It would be too extensive to name all the artists, but it was certainly a refreshing biennial that should be see\n* Picture on slider – Bill Viola – video Walking On The Edge","What is seperation anxiety?\nSeparation anxiety is a fairly common anxiety disorder that affects children and young adolescents. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV-TR), a child with separation anxiety experiences recurrent excessive anxiety beyond that expected for the child's developmental level. This anxiety results from separation or impending separation from the child's attachment figure (for example, primary caretaker, close family member). As defined, this condition affects children younger than 18 years of age and occurs over a period of at least four weeks.\nCharacteristic features of separation anxiety disorder include severe distress, fear, or worry leading to impairment of functioning and frequently accompanied by somatic symptoms such as headaches or stomachaches (see Prognosis).\nWhat causes seperation anxiety?\nSeparation anxiety is a developmentally normal characteristic in infants and toddlers younger than 4 years of age upon separation from their primary attachment figure. Mild distress and clinging behavior are anticipated for short periods of time when young children are separated from their primary caregivers (attachment figures) in situations such as day care or initial exposure to school. Short-term developmental fears such as fear of the dark are expected in young children and are generally not severe enough to interfere with daily functioning or result in long-term difficulty.\nResearch studies indicate that some children who are overly fearful early in life may eventually develop anxiety disorders that result in substantial impairment. Significant symptoms of anxiety may emerge when a child enters school for the first time and is expected to adjust to daily separation from a parent or caregiver. In some cases, initial separation anxiety resolves over the first few weeks of school, while less commonly, the anxiety does not resolve spontaneously and worsens over time. Children who persist with significant anxiety disorders may have difficulty adjusting to the classroom leading to compromised academic performance.\nResearchers have hypothesized that children who develop separation anxiety disorders may have altered sensitivity to endocrine influences such as maternal cortisol, and the way in which they process emotionally intense experiences of separation. It is well known that certain parts of the brain (such as the amygdala) are involved in modulating the processing of emotional experiences.\nBullying and experiences of recurrent social rejection may contribute to the development of separation anxiety in vulnerable children and adolescents.\nHow do I know if my child has separation anxiety?\nSymptoms of separation anxiety disorder include the following:\n- Subjective feeling of anxiety\n- Unrealistic worries about the safety of loved ones\n- Reluctance to fall asleep if not near the primary attachment figure\n- Excessive dismay (for example, tantrums) if separation from the primary attachment figure is imminent\n- Nightmares with separation-related themes\n- Psychosomatic symptoms such as:\nWhen to Seek Medical Care for Separation Anxiety\nSeek medical evaluation when social functioning becomes impaired, that is when a child or adolescent is refusing to go to school, is not socializing, is avoiding participation in sports or recreation, or is unwilling to be separated from the primary caregiver.\nAnxiety Disorder Pictures: Symptoms, Panic Attacks, and More with Pictures\nQuestions to Ask the Doctor about Separation Anxiety\n- Can you perform an evaluation to determine if my child is socially isolated due to anxiety or depression?\n- Can you perform or refer for a family assessment?\n- How can the child be supported in the school environment to prevent secondary school refusal?\n- What other tests should be performed to rule out other causes of anxiety symptoms?\nSeparation Anxiety Exams and Tests\nThe following structured and semistructured interview scales, administered by a medical professional, can be extremely helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of separation anxiety disorder:\n- The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS)\n- The Anxiety Rating Scale for Children (Revised)\n- Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) - Duke University\n- Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale\n- Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (Revised)\n- Interview Schedule for Anxiety Disorders for DSM-IV (Child Version)\n- Social Anxiety Scale for Children (Revised)\n- Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents Revised (DICA-R)\n- National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC)\n- Child Behavior Checklist (Achenback ASEBA)\n- The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) - Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC)\n- The Separation Anxiety Test (Wash U)\nA physical exam with clinically pertinent medical testing should be performed, preferably by the primary-care physician. Tests may be performed to rule out metabolic abnormalities (for example, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia), cardiovascular abnormalities, or central nervous system infections because they may cause symptoms of acute anxiety that, in children, might appear to be separation anxiety.\nSeparation Anxiety Treatment\nThe child or adolescent and his or her family, school staff, and primary-care physician should work together to design a plan to accomplish a gradual return to developmentally expected function in settings such as school, sports, and social events. It is very important to acknowledge the level of distress that the child or adolescent feels.\nUtilizing positive reinforcement aids in encouraging the child's return to the feared situation and becoming comfortable with anticipated brief separations from parents and caregivers.\nCognitive-behavior therapy, including response prevention and exposure therapy has been shown to be effective, especially in helping the child or adolescent return to normal daily function.\nAntianxiety medications may be effective but are not U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for people younger than 18 years of age.\nSeparation Anxiety Home Remedies\nDeveloping a routine of self-directed relaxation exercises, including breathing routines of about five to six deep and slow breaths during periods of discomfort, may be beneficial in reducing anxiety symptoms; however, avoiding continuous deep breathing leading to hyperventilation is important.\nMedical Treatment for Separation Anxiety\nMedical treatment should include treating any contributory medical causes of anxiety if present.\nOther Therapy for Separation Anxiety\nGentle exercises that encourage relaxation, such as meditation or yoga or tai chi, may be helpful in reducing anxiety symptoms. In older children and teenagers, mindful meditation can be especially helpful.\nFollow-up for Separation Anxiety\nThe child's progress in regaining normal function should be closely monitored. Factors that discourage the child from returning to health, such as family stressors, should also be explored. The therapist's approach to a child with separation anxiety should be low-key and expectations should progress at a pace that does not increase the child's anxiety.\nSeparation Anxiety Prevention\nTechniques such as modeling, role-playing, relaxation techniques, and positive reinforcement for independent functioning can be helpful in preventing young children from developing crippling symptoms associated with separation anxiety.\nfor Separation Anxiety Prognosis\nHelping children with separation anxiety to identify the circumstances that elicit their anxiety (upcoming separation events) is important. A child's ability to tolerate separations should gradually increase over time when he or she is gradually exposed to the feared events. Encouraging a child with separation anxiety disorder to feel competent and empowered, as well as to discuss feelings associated with anxiety-provoking events promotes recovery.\nChildren with separation anxiety disorder often respond negatively to perceived anxiety in their caretakers, in that parents and caregivers who also have anxiety disorders may unwittingly confirm a child's unrealistic fears that something terrible may happen if they are separated from each other. Thus, it is critical that parents and caretakers become aware of their own feelings and communicate a sense of safety and confidence about separations.\nPanic attacks are repeated attacks of fear that can last for several minutes.\nMedically reviewed by Margaret Walsh, MD; American Board of Pediatrics\n\"Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7088fa46-a89a-4f69-bc65-f9d7797d311b>","<urn:uuid:1aafed97-d5c1-4da9-8a54-55d2e5d02704>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Japanese quince differ from regular quince in terms of uses and characteristics, and what food safety protocols would be needed for its commercial production?","answer":"Japanese quince (Chaenomeles) resembles regular quince (Cydonia oblonga) in appearance, hardness, and taste. Both are astringent when raw but become aromatic when cooked, and can be used similarly in jams and jellies. Japanese quince is commonly grown as an ornamental bush, especially in urban landscapes. For commercial production, ISO 22000 requirements mandate developing product descriptions for raw materials and end products, establishing process flow diagrams, ensuring proper infrastructure and work environment to prevent contamination, and training personnel in food safety hazards, personal hygiene, sanitation, and product handling. A traceability system must be implemented including product name, date of manufacture, batch number, and best-before date.","context":["It looks like a quince, it smells like a quince and it is rock hard, just like a quince.\nWhat is it?\nWell, it is almost a quince. It is a relative, it is Japanese quince.\nThough the Japanese quince (Chaenomeles) is usually planted for its flowers, the smallish fruits are edible too. The taste is almost identical to the true quince (Cydonia oblonga) and they can be used in the same way. I got a bucket from friends who have one shrub in the garden and are aware of their edibility, but were at a loss as to how to use them. I happily took them on and promised a jar of jelly in return.\nBecause Japanese quince is a pretty, easy to grow bush, it is present in many gardens that are not primarily edible. Here in the Netherlands it is also a very popular plant for urban landscaping and thus great for city foraging.\nJust like the true quince the fruits of the Japanese quince are astringent and harsh when raw but become aromatic and pleasant when cooked. Use them for jams or jellies, on their own or combined with apples. The fruit is best harvested after a frost.\nJapanese quince jelly with star anise\nIf you don’t have enough quince, you can substitute part apples or crabapples, another ornamental edible. The recipe can be used for true quince (Cydonia oblonga) as well. To set the jam, I use Marmello, which is a Dutch brand of organic citrus pectin powder, sold in little packets of 25 g. The use of pectin allows the jam to set with a smaller amount of sugar. You can of course substitute a different pectin brand. If you can’t find it, or prefer your jelly sweeter, it is possible to make the jelly with just sugar, but more of it is needed for the jelly to set (see bellow for amounts) and it takes a lot more time – about half an hour. But because of the longer cooking time, the jelly will also turn a beautiful reddish colour.\n2 kg (4 1/2 pounds) Japanese quince (or a mix of Japanese quince and apples)\n3 pieces of star anise\nabout 2 liters (8 cups) water\n2 x packets (50 g) of Marmello (citrus pectin powder) mixed with 600g (3 cups) sugar\n450 g (1 pound) of sugar to every 600 ml (2 1/2 cup) of liquid\nRoughly chop the fruit – be careful, it’s rock hard. Put it in a large pan together with the star anise and cover with water – I used 2 liters. Cook until the fruit falls apart, which takes about an hour and a half. Mash with a potato masher and pour into a colander lined with cheesecloth. Tie the cheesecloth together and suspend it over a large pan (see photo). Let it drip overnight and don’t be tempted to squeeze the cloth or the jelly will be cloudy. This amount yielded 1,5 liters of liquid. Bring the liquid to boil and add the Marmello mixed with sugar. Boil for 1 minute and pour into sterilized jars. Turn the jars upside down for ten minutes. The jelly will keep for about a year. Once open, store in the refrigerator and use within a week.\nIf making the jelly with just sugar:\nPrepare the quince as directed above.\nBring the strained liquid to the boil, than add sugar and stir to dissolve it. Boil rapidly until the jam reaches setting point. This you can test by putting a teaspoonful of the jam on a cold saucer (I keep it in the fridge) and leaving it to cool. If the jam wrinkles when you push it with your finger, it’s ready. In my case the jam took about half an hour to reach the setting point. Remove any scum that has formed.\nCarefully pour the jam into the jars, close them and turn the jars upside down for ten minutes.","ISO 22000 Certification in Manila (FSMS) – Requirements\nNew users are recommended to refer to the Food Safety Management System Standard to learn the specific requirements of ISO 22000 Certification in Manila (FSMS).

{"question":"How do wireless network extenders function to improve coverage, and what types of security authentication methods are used to protect these extended networks?","answer":"Wireless network extenders, also known as repeaters or signal boosters, work by connecting to an access point or router to extend the network's strength and reach. They act as two-way stations for relaying radio signals to connect equipment to the network, making it possible for distant devices to access the internet. This is particularly useful in large homes or offices where some rooms might not receive the Wi-Fi signal. Regarding security, these extended networks can be protected through two main authentication methods: open system and shared key authentication. In open system authentication, clients don't need to present credentials to the access point, and only the WEP key is used for encryption. In shared key authentication, a four-way challenge-response handshake process is used, where the client must properly encrypt a challenge text using the WEP key to gain access. However, WPA and WPA2 security protocols are considered more secure, offering both personal (WPA-PSK) options for home networks and enterprise solutions with 802.1x authentication for business organizations.","context":["For a home or office wireless network to function properly, it requires a variety of hardware components. Unless you are an IT expert, you may not be familiar with all of these components. The purpose of this write-up is to introduce you to the various hardware you need to create a wireless network. Here we go.\nLet’s Take a Look at the Hardware you Need for Wireless Networks\nWireless Network Adapters\nThe other names for the wireless network adapters include the wireless network cards or wireless NICs. They are required for older computers and laptops which do not incorporate wireless capabilities. If you have the newer smartphones, tablets, and laptops, you can be sure they already have wireless capability. For the older computers, buy add-on wireless adapters to be connected either via USB or PCMCIA. This will enable these computers to automatically connect to your wireless network.\nWithout a wireless router, there would probably be no network. Just line cable routers, these devices are the first to receive internet signals and then transmit to devices such as computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, cameras, and so on.\nCurrently, the recommended wireless router standard is the 802.11ac, which allows for smooth online video streaming and responsive gaming. Even though a little slower, older routers are still up to the task. The good thing with an AC router is its incomparably fast speed. They can provide fast internet by more than 12 times the 802.11n routers.\nIf you want a router that’s capable of handling multiple devices, buy the AC router. Picture the many devices in your home. Most likely, you have desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, streaming boxes, smart TVs, smart speakers, smart cameras, and so on. You need a router with the capability to supply internet to all of your devices without breaking down.\nThe work of a wireless router is to tap an internet connection from the modem by a wire connection. It then creates a wireless network to which all of the other devices connect. It is, therefore, an integral part of your wireless network.\nWireless Access Points\nThe purpose of access points is to connect wireless networks to existing wired networks. If your home or office already has a wired router, you will need to have an access point. As such, you won’t need to replace your router with a wireless one.\nThe work of access points is to connect devices to a wireless network without the need for cables. With a wireless network, the number of devices can increase almost infinitely. What the access point does is to amplify the network. The wired router is the one providing the bandwidth while the access point only extends it to support a number of devices. It also extends the range of the network so that the devices can connect to it from further off.\nIn addition to amplifying and extending the network, an access point supplies key information on all the devices connected to the network. It also secures the network and ensures hackers don’t get easy access. When buying an access point, consider the standard on which it operates. Depending on the standard, access points can deliver varied bandwidth on varying frequencies. The number of channels supported also greatly differ.\nEven with the best routers and access points, your Wi-Fi signal may not reach as far as you would hope. That’s why you need a dedicated wireless antenna. Its purpose is to increase the range of the wireless radio signal. For the modern routers, the antennas are in-built. However, on older equipment, they are removable, since they are optional. Whatever the case, you can mount add-on antennas on the existing equipment to widen the range of the Wi-Fi signal. If you are building a home wireless network for your home, you may not require a wireless antenna. For a large office complex, the antenna is necessary to enable internet access from all locations.\nThe work of a wireless repeater is to extend the strength and reach of the network by connecting to an access point or router. A wireless repeater may also be referred to as a range expander or signal booster. It is basically a two-way station for relaying radio signals to connect equipment to the network. It makes it easier for far-off devices to also access the internet. If you have a large home with rooms that aren’t receiving the Wi-Fi signal, you definitely need a wireless expander.\nClearly, there are different kinds of hardware required to build a wireless network. For these hardware components to work properly, the right software must be installed. Also, you need an internet connection from a broadband provider. When you have all the necessary ingredients, there is just no reason you cannot have a home or office wireless network.","What is Network Security Key and how to find Network Security Key for Router, Windows, and Android phones:\nIn our earlier tutorials, we have learned more about security protocols, authentication, authorization and access methods that are used to access a network or wireless devices.\nWe have also explored the various kinds of network security measures that are taken to make our overall network system secure from unauthorized access and virus attacks.\nHere, in this tutorial, we will briefly learn about Network security keys that are used for safeguarding our network along with its various kinds.\nWhat You Will Learn:\n- What is a Network Security Key?\n- Types of Network Security Key\n- How to Find Password on Router, Windows, and Android\n- What is Network Security Key Mismatch Error and How to Fix It\n- Is Network Security Key Same As The Password?\nWhat is a Network Security Key?\nThe network security key is a kind of network password or the passphrase in the form of physical, digital signature or biometric data password that is used to provide authorization and accessibility to the wireless network or device on which the client requests to connect with.\nThe security key also provisions to establish a secure connection between the requesting client and the serving network or wireless device like routers etc. These protect our network and devices from unwanted access.\nThe security key is of various kinds and is widely used everywhere in our day to day services like online banking, money transactions in the form of OTP’s (one time password), online shopping, accessing the Internet service, login into the mail account or any network device etc.\nTypes of Network Security Key\nThe most common types of a network security key that are used for authorization in wireless networks include Wi-Fi protected access (WPA and WPA2) and wired equivalent privacy (WEP).\nWEP uses a 40-bit key for encryption of the data packet. This key is combined with a 24-bit IV (initialization vector) to make an RC4 key. This 40 bit and 24 bit of IV makes a 64-bit WEP key.\nThere are two kinds of authentication methods used i.e. open system and shared key authentication.\nIn the open system authentication method, the requesting client host need not present the credentials to the access point for authentication as any client can try to associate with the network. Here, only the WEP key is used for the encryption process.\nWhile in the shared key authentication, the WEP key is used for authentication by deploying a four-way challenge-response handshake process.\nFirstly, the host client sends the authentication request to the access point. Then the access point in response sends back the clear-text challenge. By using the WEP key, the client host will encrypt the challenge text and send it back to the access point.\nThe response will then be decrypted by the access point and if it is identical to the challenge text, then it will transmit a positive reply. Later the authentication and the association process will get completed and again the WEP key is used for encryption of the data packets using RC4.\nFrom the above process, it seems that this process is a secure one, but practically the key can easily be decoded by anyone by cracking the challenge frames. Therefore, this method of encryption and authentication is less in practice and the WPA which is a more secure method than this has been evolved.\n#2) WPA and WPA2\nThe host device which wants to connect to the network requires the security key to start the communication. The WPA and WPA-2 both work on the principle that after the validation of the key, the exchange of data among the host device and the access point is in an encrypted form.\nThe WPA deploys a temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP) which uses a per- packet key which means that it dynamically produces a fresh 128-bit key each time when a packet arrives and allocates the same to the data packet. This saves the packet from any unwanted access and attacks.\nIt does have a message integrity check, which guards the data against the viruses that can modify and re-transmit the packets according to themselves. In this way, it replaces the cyclic redundancy check method for error detection and correction that was used by the WEP.\nThere are different divisions of the WPA depending upon the kind of the user using it.\nWPA and WPA-2 -Personal (WPA-PSK): This is used for home networks and small-scale office networks as it doesn’t need the server based authentication. The data is encrypted by extracting the 128 bit key from the pre-shared key of 256 bit.\nWPA and WPA2 Enterprise: It deploys the 802.1x authentication server and RADIUS server authentication which is a much secure one and is already described in detail in our previous tutorials for encryption and access.

You can also derive it from the manual that comes with the router when you purchase it.\nYou can also learn the Network security key of the router by logging in into its default settings on its web interface.\nHow to Find Network Security Key for Windows?\nThe network security key for the Windows PC or laptop is the WI-Fi password to connect to the Internet network.\nI am using windows 10, so the steps to be followed to enter the network security key or password are as follows:\n- Go to the start menu and select the settings option, after that select the network and Internet option and go to the Network and sharing center.\n- In the network and sharing center, select the name of the network on which you want to connect with, and then in the Wi-Fi status, select the wireless properties.\n- In the wireless network properties, select the network security key option and enter your password and then enter the next button. After checking the network requirements and after acquiring the IP address, you will be connected to the internet.\n- Now you will get connected with the Internet network and then it will display as connected. You can also check the properties, by clicking on the button.\nWith the help of the below snapshots, you will get a clear picture of the settings.\nWireless network connection settings Part-1\nWireless network Connection Settings part-2\nHow to find the network security key for windows:\nWhen our PC is connected to a network, then it will memorize the password or the security key of the network on which it is connected.\nBut if you want to find out the password then follow the below steps:\n- Go to the control panel of the computer and then select the network and internet option.\n- In that, select “manage wireless networks” option and click on the network SSID on which you are connected.\n- Right click on the network name and click on properties and then choose the security tab.\n- Checkmark on the show characters option to find out the network security key.\nHow to Find Network Security Key for Android?\n3G and 4G mean LTE supported android phones support the use of data or the Internet on the handset itself. We just need to enable the mobile data button on the android phone to activate the data services.\nBut a network security key is required to make a mobile hotspot from an android phone for pairing it with some other devices through which that device can also access the Internet.\nWhile the smartphones these days have the icon for enabling the mobile hotspot in settings, from where we can allow the pairing of devices with android phones. Remember that the mobile hotspot will work only when the mobile data is enabled in the handset.\nThe steps of enabling the mobile hotspot and entering the security key are as follows:\n- Go to the wireless and networks settings of the android phone. Then select the tethering and portable hotspot option.\n- Now go to WLAN or Wi-Fi hotspot option and press on the button so that the WLAN hotspot mode will get enabled.\n- Then go to set up a WLAN hotspot option and select it. When you select this option, it will display the default network SSID (your android phone network name), type of security (open, WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK) and network security key (password). The network SSID and password is unique for each Android phone by default. This way you can find out the network security key for your android phone.\n- You can modify these details according to your choice and then save the changes you made.\n- The device that you want to pair with this can access the Internet by entering the network SSID and password in its wireless and network settings. Now hotspot is activated between the handset and the network device.\n- The mobile hotspot will keep working until the services are deactivated from the android phone or till the data limit on the android phone exhausts.\n- If some unauthorized user is accessing your Internet, then you can block that as well from the hotspot settings, as this is also a feature of the smartphone in which you can see how many numbers of users are connected with the phone.\nActivating Mobile Hotspot for an Android phone\nWhat is Network Security Key Mismatch Error and How to Fix It\nWhen we connect our network device like a router, PC, laptop or Android phone to a wireless network for accessing the Internet in any LAN network or home network, then we require the network security key as a password to access the network.\nThis network security key is a unique combination of alphanumeric characters and is different for each network which is available in the range.\nWhen you enter the password and if a message appears that there is network security key mismatch, then it means that the combination of characters that you are entering to get access to the network is incorrect and it doesn’t match with the password of that particular network.\nHow to Fix Network Security Key Mismatch Error?\nThere are various ways to resolve the issue and we can try them to get the right security key.\nFollowing are some of the tips:\n- A most common reason for network key mismatch is that when we enter a wrong password. As a password is case sensitive, make sure that you will enter the letters in the upper and lower case exactly in the same way as they were used in the password.\n- If you are entering the right password and if still the problem persists then restart your device like restart the router or PC whichever you are using. Sometimes the device will hang and when you give a restart, it will start working normally.\n- Another reason for key mismatch can be that the Wi-Fi network which you are trying to access is not compatible with your device. Therefore it is showing a password mismatch message. Hence, check out which version of the Wi-Fi network your device can support and then try to log in only into those range of networks.\n- Things will get worse if all these solutions do not get the issue resolved. In such cases of routers, one has to reset the entire system. Thus, login into the router and then create a new network name and a new network security key and write it down properly for memorizing it.\n- Now in your PC or laptop network and sharing center settings, delete all the details of the network and restart your PC.\n- Again search for the network that you want to connect with and then add the new network security key. Try to connect manually and You will definitely get through the network.\n- In this way, you can fix the mismatch issues of the network key.\nIs Network Security Key Same As The Password?\nThis is the most frequently asked question. Often the reader’s or users get confused with the meaning of a network security key and the password.\nThe security key is the technical term which is generally used with routers, switches, and modems, where for each network SSID there is a unique and different type of security key named as WPA key or WPA2 key or passphrase depending upon the maker of the network device.\nAlso for the windows PC, the network security key as a password is used in association with the network name to access the wireless network. The key is nothing but a unique combination of alpha-numeric characters.\nBut in general, when we are accessing the Internet services from an android phone, the security key will be displayed as the password for activating the services. Thus both are the same but different terminologies are used depending on the makers of the device, kind of the device and network environment that is been deployed.\nFrom this tutorial, we have understood the concept of network security key along with its various types.\nWe have also seen the different applications of a network security key with the various kinds of network devices and networking environment.\nWe have learned some useful methods to resolve the mismatch issue of a security key and simple steps to configure the security key in the windows PC, routers and Android phones."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b836f70f-dad9-4c22-8887-301b3b95fddb>","<urn:uuid:63dc7ddf-bd35-4a03-a21a-3556c5cff320>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál es la diferencia entre SEO Blackhat y el SEO apropiado para optimizar un sitio web?","answer":"The key difference is that Blackhat SEO uses deceptive techniques to trick search algorithms, while proper SEO focuses on providing relevant and original information to improve user experience. Blackhat SEO techniques have become less effective over time and can result in Google penalizing your site by dropping it to the last pages of search results. The recommended approach is to always provide visitors with relevant and original content while focusing on improving their experience, which ensures your website remains search engine friendly.","context":["Got a small business? Are you looking to step into the world of digital marketing and SEO in particular? If yes is your answer, then you’ll be glad to know that you’re on the right path. However, you should be aware that small business SEO is not as straightforward as it sounds—it could even turn out to be the most difficult form of promoting your business online. But the good news is, the right SEO can give your small business a better chance of getting strong organic search visibility, and that’s huge. As you may know, organic listings help build trust with website visitors, and that’s one of the most important things you need for the long-term success of your business.\nWhat is SEO?\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of increasing the quantity of quality traffic to your site via organic search engine results. In a nutshell, SEO increases your website’s chance of ranking high in Search Engine Ranking Positions (SERPs) of search engines like Google or Bing.\nHow Does SEO Work?\nThe entire process of SEO begins with your website, and Google is the big player in the picture. For the most part, Google sends out crawlers, or “spiders”, to discover and scan every accessible page on just about every website on the web. What do they do? The robots follow links and gather information on each webpage and eventually send it to Google servers across the world.\nWhen this happens, web surfers can freely search for terms related to your site and get answers to their questions. Essentially, when a user enters a relevant search term, the Google algorithm starts processing all the information that has been previously gathered from your website and similar sites. At this point, Google sifts through the sites and picks the ones that are most relevant to the search query, placing the best options at the top and least relevant at the bottom.\nStill a bit confused?\nWell, just picture the internet as your local library: Your website is the newest book on the shelf and the Google robot is the librarian. The librarian looks through your book and figures out the most reasonable section to place it in—this will make it easier for visitors to find your book and that’s important. Remember, visitors will have to explore through several different titles to find what they’re looking for, and if things go well and the librarian has placed your book in the right section, your book might turn to be exactly what the visitor was looking for!\nWhat More Do You Need to Know About SEO?\nWell, among other things, you should be aware that SEO is constantly evolving and site owners have been trying to figure out how to make their websites rank in top search engines—it has been this way since the 1990s. As time went on, a deceptive type of optimization was developed by some SEO practitioners—it was meant to trick the Google algorithm into thinking their site was more relevant than it actually was. This is called “Blackhat SEO” and it has since been frowned upon by search engine algorithms primarily because of the terrible user experience it created for web users.\nLook: Blackhat SEO techniques are becoming less effective by the day and SEO is in a constant state of evolution. That said, you should know that what worked a few years ago may be totally useless or blacklisted right now. For the most part, Google would waste no time to penalize your site if it finds that you’ve been using Blackhat SEO techniques—it could be shot down to the last page of SERPs!\nSo how can you avoid this? Well, it’s pretty simple—always provide visitors with relevant and original information, and stick to improving their experience. When you do this, you can be 100% sure that your website is search engine friendly.\nAlright, let’s move on!\nMain SEO Areas to Consider As A Small Business\n- First things first: You need a professionally designed website to get started. It’s also crucial for it to be fast and mobile-friendly. To find the right ecommerce platform for you, check out this roundup of the best ecommerce platforms.\n- Always stick to high-quality content and be sure to emphasize why a customer should choose you over the competition.\n- Try to craft informational blog content at all times—doing this can boost awareness and place you at the forefront of a bigger audience.\n- On-Page SEO\n- It’s also an excellent idea to work with basic optimization, so you should be looking at page titles and meta descriptions. Check out our guide to SEO here.\n- Local SEO\n- Your small business will also want to promote its product and services to local customers at the time they need it the most. Sticking to Local SEO best practices is crucial.\n- Want your clients to see your business as the real deal? If yes, look into case studies, reviews, portfolios, testimonials, and reviews—all these can help you seal the deal in no time.\n- Authority Building\n- When your business becomes an authority, you’ll find that many other websites will be linking to you. The good thing is, these high-quality links can help your business’ website rank highly in Google’s SERPs, and that’s huge.\nHow to Optimize Your Small Business Website For Search Engines\nHere’s the thing; SEO can be a bit complicated, but you can actually make the most of it if you play your cards right. Here are seven sure ways to get things started.\nAs you probably guessed, these are words or phrases that prospective clients are likely to type into the search box when looking for your type of business. As a website owner, it’s in your best interest to make the keywords on your page relevant to what people are searching for. Doing this will give them a better chance of finding your content on the SERPs.\nSo how can you do this?\nFor starters, you’ll want to come up with the ones users are likely to search for and then use a keyword research tool to get an idea of other terms that could draw quality traffic to your website. After doing your research, you’ll get to know how competitive terms are as well as how often web users search for them. Now that you’ve created your list, you’ll want to use them in just about every piece of content on your site.\nNext up is the title tag. It’s an HTML title element that describes the topic and theme of your site’s content. Since it acts as the title of each page, you can be sure that it means a lot to search engines. For the most part, you should ensure that each title tag is unique and relevant to the content of your site (it must contain the right keywords). Moreover, it’s crucial for the title tag to follow a consistent format throughout your website. It’s great to include a keyword specific to the page and be sure to include your brand name, if possible. Got space to include your brand name? If yes, use a hyphen (-) or vertical bar (|) to separate keywords from your brand name. Finally, remember to keep the copy to roughly 55 characters—this is crucial.\nNow that you’re looking to create engaging web copy, you’ll want to ensure that it contains relevant keywords. Essentially, you should look towards crafting high-quality, readable content and try not to overuse your keywords. It’s in your best interest to follow these rules since Google crawlers read the text like humans and you wouldn’t want to get flagged for poor quality content. It’s highly recommended not to overuse your keywords in your web copy—doing this can create a negative experience for users and hurt your website’s rankings. The bottom line; always stick to high-quality, error-free copy and never fail to double-check before hitting the publish button. Remember, search engine crawlers read like us, humans.\nHeading tags are part of the HTML coding for a web page and are typically defined with H1 to H6 tags. As you may have guessed, H1 is the most important heading that carries a lot of weight with search engines. It’s best practice to apply the H1 tag to the page headline and be sure to only use it once per page. On the flip side, the other tags (H2 to H6 ) can be used several different times on a page.\nLooking to create a page with a lot of copy? If yes, you can use the H1 tag as the headline and proceed to apply the H2s to each sub-headline. Doing this will send relevant signals to Google crawlers and make it incredibly easy for users to read through your content. Finally, be sure to place your keywords in the heading tags—this is great for SEO.\nIt’s also good to know that URLs can help display your keywords to search engines—you only have to figure out how to include them. For the most part, you should include the keywords in the resource path or the part of the URL that comes after the domain name.\nTrying to figure out what meta descriptions are? Well, regardless of how daunting it may seem, a meta description is simply a text that summarises the content of web pages. It appears in SERPs under the blue clickable link and URL.\nLook: The right meta description can give users a better idea of what you have in store for them, and that’s great for business. It’s in your best interest to provide Google with a meta description when creating content for your site. Failure to do this will cause the search engine to display random text from your page that may turn out to be irrelevant to users. Finally, try to keep the copy under 150 to 155 characters and remember to add a call-to-action.\nSearch engine crawlers read text but can’t see images. Essentially, the robots rely on the code behind the image to get a better understanding of what’s being displayed. That being said, you’ll want to work on the alt tag, image title, and filename.\nHere’s a blurb about each:\n- Alt Tag Text: This is the copy that users see when an image can’t be displayed for one reason or the other. It should be a brief explanation of the image. A good example is, “Trail walking shoes for men.” It’s up to you to decide what works best.\n- Image Title: The image title is meant to shed more light on the alt tag text description—it typically appears when you hover the cursor over an image. That said, an excellent example will be, “White trail walking shoes for men.”\n- Filename: This is the name that’s used to save an image—be sure to make it descriptive and always stick to lowercases. Also, remember to separate the words using hyphens.\nDevelop A Long-Term SEO Strategy\nAt this point, there’s a good chance that your website is optimized for search engines and that’s great. However, you should know that you still have a lot of work to do. In essence, you’ll need to create an ongoing SEO strategy that drives results—doing this will give you an edge over the competition and that’s a big part of the plan.\nThree critical things to focus on along the way:\n- Great Content\n- Inbound Links\n- Local SEO\nHere’s the thing; content is and will always be king. It’s important to note that the Google algorithm holds quality content in high esteem, so it’s in your best interest to play along. So how can you create great content for SEO purposes?\nIt’s pretty simple; just make it fresh, relevant and unique! And do not forget to promote it.\nEssentially, fresh content gives Google the impression that your site is still active and that’s huge. As for relevance, it’s highly recommended that your content is related to your business and its offerings. Straying off-topic may end up confusing the crawlers and visitors.\nFinally, try as much as possible to present your visitors with unique content. Just work on crafting content that’s not available on other sites or use their ideas to make yours outstanding. Copy and paste is a big no-no!\nIt’s also good to know that inbound links can help you get favorable search engine rankings. It’s important to note, however, that high-quality links (those from top websites) are more likely to work great for your ranking as opposed to links from average sites. The bottom line: Crafting high-quality content and obtaining inbound links go hand in hand—just try to make it work!\nAs a small business, you’ll want to do all you can to be visible to those who are interested in your offerings. At this point, you should be looking to make it appealing to people in your community. This process of optimizing your site to attract the attention of people close to you is known as local SEO. For example, if you sell outfits for women in a particular area, you’ll want to work on making your store visible to local searchers looking to get their hands on your offerings.\nIt’s also an excellent idea to sign up for a Google My Business Account. When you do this, you can be sure that business contact information will be consistent across Google search, Maps and Google +. Moreover, creating an account will boost awareness in ways you never thought possible—all those positive reviews are sure to draw in more and more customers! What could be better?\nPlatforms to Build SEO-Friendly Small Business Websites\nWhen it comes to building SEO-friendly websites, you’ll want to stick with the best platforms available. The top platforms to consider include Shopify, WordPress, and Magento—they’re sure to work great for business. Other self-provisioning platforms you’ll want to check out include Weebly, Wix, and Squarespace. You can use these options to create easy-to-use SEO-friendly websites without burning a hole in your wallet.\nGreat Small Business SEO Tools\nLooking to have a go all by yourself? If yes, you’ll want to put a toolset together. These tools will give you a better idea of what you can optimize to improve your site’s performance. It’s important to note that some of the big tools typically come with a monthly fee and subsequent payments can add up and even cost as much as a professional SEO provider.\nThat being said, here are five tools you’ll want to consider:\n- SE Ranking SEO Software\n- Google Products:\n- Volume SEO Calculator\n- Screaming Frog\nWith all that has been said, it’s glaringly clear to see that small business SEO can take your website to a whole new level. The most important thing is for you to create and implement a strategy that works and never fails to make it better than that of your competitors. And most importantly, always stick to high-quality content.

{"question":"How do national cultural heritage goals and local archaeological planning requirements compare in protecting historic sites?","answer":"National cultural heritage goals and local archaeological planning requirements take different approaches to protecting historic sites. The national cultural heritage goals focus broadly on themes of commitment, sustainability and diversity, emphasizing public engagement by ensuring everyone has the opportunity to get involved in cultural heritage protection through voluntary organizations and local communities. In contrast, local archaeological planning requirements take a more structured regulatory approach, with archaeological officers employed by local planning authorities to provide specific guidance on protection and management of archaeological sites. They maintain formal databases, assess planning applications, require investigations when needed, and attach conditions to planning consents to protect archaeological remains. While cultural heritage goals emphasize public participation, archaeological planning focuses on technical assessment and regulatory compliance.","context":["The Directorate for Cultural Heritage is an Associate Partner for the Deep Cities project in Norway. Here, Special Advisor at the Directorate Marit Huuse writes about the importance developing our historic urban environments.\nWe live in a time of great and rapid change in our physical environment. In particular, cities are constantly changing. But the cities also have traces of history, through its streets, property structure, buildings and building environments. These are cultural heritage and cultural environments that help to give the city a distinctive character and uniqueness. Squares, marketplaces, and buildings of different ages provide an experience for both residents and visitors.\nCultural heritage and cultural environments enrich the peoples experience in a city and are also providers of knowledge. A lot of knowledge about past times lies precisely in these physical traces. Cultural heritage hints at the historical development, about people’s relationship to each other and to nature.\nThey tell about access to and use of resources, about businesses and people’s social, religious, and ritual lives. They testify to both continuity and change through the ages and are an important basis for our interpretation and understanding of the past.\nCultural heritage provide an opportunity for recognition and belonging, but also a curiosity, a thirst for knowledge, and an experience of closeness to the past. In addition, they can be an important identity-creating factor in that they contribute to the distinctiveness and character of places, through continuity, variation, contrast and character in the human-influenced environment.\nThe cultural heritage that the cities carry with them is important for the uniqueness of the places, but also for unity and belonging. The city’s historical and cultural content is also potentially valuable. It is a resource for visitors and for everyone who lives in the city, it creates attractive urban environments, and it provides a basis for tourism and business development.\nWhat makes places attractive to visit – what do we look for when we travel? Very often it is the historical places because this gives character and experiences. Cultural heritage and cultural environments are common goods and resources for the local communities and represent great societal values. Conservation and use also contribute to socio-economic resource management.\nThe evolving nature of cities\nAt the same time, a city must function, meet needs, be a good framework for individuals and as a society need in everyday life. It must therefore constantly evolve. New stories and narratives are added to the city and the challenge is to at the same time take care of the important stories that are already there.\nTo take care of and utilize this, a planning and management practice is required that considers the cultural environment as a premise for development, but also as a resource and an opportunity. Cultural heritage’s positive opportunities in urban and local development, as well as its important contribution to sustainable development, must be emphasized.\nIt is a goal to ensure sustainable urban and community development. Preservation and use of the resources that the cultural environments represent in the cities is important in this context. And it is especially important from a climate and environmental perspective since most of the buildings of the future have already been built.\nPreservation has major benefits for the climate\nThe most climate-friendly building is the one that is already there. The recent report from the research institute SINTEF “Green is not just a color – Sustainable buildings already exist”, show that it is almost always better to preserve and rehabilitate than to build new, especially in a scenario where we have to cut greenhouse gas emissions sharply over the next 30 years.\nThe study concludes that there is a large untapped potential for environmental benefits in the existing building stock. The environmental impact from existing buildings is only about half of that from new buildings. Since most of the world’s building stock by 2050 already exists, rehabilitation and reuse of existing buildings will be a crucial contribution to a sustainable future.\nA strategy that contributes to taking care of older buildings has major climate benefits and will contribute to sustainable development. It is therefore important with national planning policy that aims to achieve sustainable management of the country’s total resources and to create a good physical environment.\nThrough my work at the Directorate for Cultural Heritage, I have been involved in developing the Directorate’s role in urban development matters. The Directorate is a professional adviser to the Ministry of Climate and the Environment in the development of the state’s cultural environment policy, at the same time as we are responsible for the implementation of the state’s cultural environment policy. We also have an overall professional responsibility for the municipalities ‘, county municipalities’ and Sami Parliament’s work with the cultural environment.\nThis means that we work in two ways. We are a professional body that works with the development of knowledge, tools, methods and is an advisor to other actors. But we are also an authority under the Cultural Heritage Act and the Planning and Building Act and must ensure that national cultural heritage values are safeguarded.\nThrough the development of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage’s urban strategy, we wanted to contribute to quality in urban development and to preserve and further develop our historic urban environments. Long-term and sustainable management of the historic urban environments presupposes that the buildings are used and maintained and that the historic building environments retain their distinctive character and are still perceived as attractive buildings and places to live.\nNew National Goals for the Cultural Environment\nThe new cultural environment Proposition to the Parliament (Meld. St.16 2019-2020), which was adopted in June, introduced new national goals for the cultural environment field with the themes of commitment, sustainability and diversity. These are goals that embrace more broadly and to a greater extent emphasize the importance of the cultural environment for society than the previous goals.\nThese are excellent goals, but at the same time challenging. The commitment goal is: Everyone should have the opportunity to get involved and take responsibility for the cultural environment. We know that people think cultural monuments and cultural environments are important and many get involved through voluntary organizations, among other things.\nMany individuals and organizations make a huge effort to take care of the cultural environment in their immediate area. But how do we better facilitate more people to get involved, participate and participate? How do we facilitate that individuals and local communities can participate better in the work with cultural environments and be able to bring out what is important to them and their local communities.\nWhat we need is a good framework for engagement, but also good methods and tools for participation and involvement. It is therefore exciting to be part of this project, which has as its main goal to develop a management tool to better understand how change can be handled in urban development where participation from the public is central.","To help develop this article, click 'Edit this article' above.\nA great deal of damage was done to the UK’s archaeological heritage by construction works in the 1960’s. As a consequence, in the 1970’s, local planning authorities began to appoint archaeologists to provide guidance and advice on the protection and management of archaeological sites and the impact of proposed developments on archaeological remains.\nAll local planning authorities now employ, or retain the services of, archaeological officers. Sometimes this role may be combined with that of conservation officer, although they are very different, albeit related, functions.\nArchaeological officers ensure that archaeological remains are identified, recorded, protected, managed, promoted and interpreted.\nTheir role might include.\n- Maintaining a database of archaeological remains, known as the 'Historic Environment Record' (HER) (or Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) or Urban Archaeological Database (UAD)).\n- Commenting on draft proposals to ensure that they properly consider the conservation of archaeological remains.\n- Assessing planning applications and considering whether proposed developments are likely to affect archaeological remains.\n- If they believe there is a reasonable risk that proposed developments will affect archaeological remains, requiring that applicants undertake desk-based studies, and if necessary further evaluations such as site investigations.\n- Proposing conditions that might be attached to planning consents to help protect or manage archaeological remains.\n- Assessing the competence and suitability of archaeological contractors appointed to undertake archaeological projects.\n- Monitoring archaeological projects. This requires that they are given adequate notice of proposed works commencing.\n- Providing advice on agricultural an forestry schemes.\n- Providing advice on the conservation of ancient monuments and historic landscapes.\n- Promoting awareness and understanding through education and outreach programmes.\nWhere archaeological evaluation of proposed developments is considered necessary, this can be analogous to geotechnical site investigation with comparable costs, duration and lead-in times. Because of the time required, it can somtimes be appropriate to begin evaluations even before they have been required by the planning authority.\nManaged intelligently and with foresight, archaeology need not inconvenience any construction project. However, this often requires engagement with the local planning authority’s archaeological officer as soon as possible if it is suspected that proposals may affect archaeological remains. This will help identify the procedures that must be followed and avoid abortive work.\nNB All historic buildings embody interpretable archaeological information about the people who designed and used those buildings, much of it not available from other sources.

They often affect people who aren't used to exercising; they can be caused by increasing the intensity of your workout too fast, wearing worn-out shoes or by jumping or running on hard ground.\nPrevention and treatment: Wearing good shoes, cross training, stretching, and not increasing workout intensity too quickly are the best preventive measures. As for treatment, ice, stretching and anti-inflammatory medications are your best bets.\nLower back pain\nAlthough lower-back pain is much less common among athletes than among sedentary and overweight people, it can affect runners, cyclists, golfers, tennis, and baseball players. While there are many types of lower-back pain — bulging discs, back spasms, and pain reaching down the leg from the lower back, known as sciatica — the most common reason for sports-related back pain is simply improper stretching. In the case of runners, having even the slightest discrepancy in leg length can cause back pain.\nPrevention and treatment: Although some lower-back injuries cannot be prevented, warming up properly before exercising will greatly reduce your risk of injury. While bulging discs and sciatica require fast medical treatment, you can treat a simple muscle pull or back spasm yourself with RICE, anti-inflammatory medication and stretching. Runners with a difference in leg length can get orthotic lifts from a podiatrist to correct the problem.\nNot warming up properly, fatigue, lack of flexibility, and weakness can cause all types of athletes to pull a muscle. The most commonly pulled muscles are hamstrings (especially in sports involving running, such as jogging, basketball and soccer) and calves (particularly in older tennis players). The hamstrings are the muscles behind your thighs; pulling them is painful and can even cause bruising. While these are the most common, you can pull many different muscles depending on the sport you are performing.\nPrevention and treatment: The best way to prevent pulling a muscle is to stretch properly before and after exercising, and avoid working out when you are fatigued and weak. As with most injuries, RICE and anti-inflammatory drugs are helpful, as well as gentle stretches. When the injury has begun to heal, you can begin exercising again, but stop every so often during your workout to stretch until you are completely healed.\nTennis or golf elbow\nElbow injuries account for 7% of all sports injuries. Tennis elbow consists of tendon degeneration in the elbow due to repeated backhand strokes in tennis. It causes pain on the outside of the elbow. Golf elbow, on the other hand, usually affects the inside of the elbow, although it can sometimes attack the outside. The pain experienced is a result of an inflammation of the epicondyle, the area on the inside of the elbow where the forearm-flexing muscles attach to the upper arm.\nPrevention and treatment: The best way to prevent these ailments is to perform forearm-strengthening exercises, such as wrist curls, reverse wrist curls and squeezing a soft rubber ball. Also, improving your swing technique and wearing an elbow brace can be very helpful. Treatment can be as simple as RICE and anti-inflammatory medications, but in some cases physiotherapy and a prolonged break from the sport may be necessary.\nRELATED: 5 Effective Arm Workouts\nWatch out for your ankles, shoulders and the most vulnerable part of your body..."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8ed039f0-db43-43ab-b87f-22fa79f4382c>","<urn:uuid:8a469e93-a039-4a79-b12c-f7ac30304207>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the mechanical characteristics of modern motorcycles, and what specific maintenance requirements must vehicle operators follow for safety?","answer":"Modern motorcycles are two-wheeled auto-propelled vehicles with power transmitted through the engine or chain, featuring transmissions with 4-6 speeds and twist-type controls on handgrips for clutch and throttle operation. Their steering geometry is critical for cornering, and they can be customized for different purposes like racing or street use. Regarding maintenance requirements, vehicle operators must conduct thorough pre-trip safety inspections, particularly of critical components like tires and brakes. For commercial vehicles, operators must ensure loads are properly balanced and secured to prevent rollovers or loss of control, and they must check that no loose materials create road hazards. Regular vehicle maintenance is essential for safe operation.","context":["Automobiles are vehicles that run on two or four wheels, and have seats for passengers. They usually run on gasoline or diesel fuel, and have a battery for power. They also have a steering wheel that’s in the driver’s hands.\nAutomobiles have been a main mode of transportation on roads for a long time. Initially, they were used as self-propelled carriages. But the automobile evolved over time, incorporating new technologies and safety laws. Today, they are complex technical systems involving thousands of component parts. Manufacturers have a competitive advantage in the market due to their ability to design and produce automobiles in different segments.\nThe first motorcycles were built in the United States in 1898 by Charles Metz. In the 1920s, the automotive industry had a rough time. However, after World War II, production began to pick up again. Some of the companies that helped boost the industry during that period were Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors.\nThere are several subtypes of the automobile, including the passenger car and the commercial vehicle. Commercial vehicles are used primarily for business purposes. A passenger car is usually designed to be a primary family vehicle. These cars have a seating capacity of up to eight passengers.\nMotorcycles are often confused with cars. While they have a steering wheel and two or three wheels, they don’t fall under the definition of a car. Because of this, legal matters can get a little nit-picky. Nevertheless, there are many people who use the term “automobile” to describe a motorcycle.\nAlthough the definition is not completely clear, most countries and jurisdictions define a motorcycle as a two-wheeled auto propelled vehicle. Most of the time, the power is transmitted through the engine or chain. Sometimes, the driver will be able to control the steering by shifting gears by hand.\nA motorcycle can be a dual purpose, or can be a street vehicle. It can also be a racing machine. A motorcycle can be customized to the rider’s personal taste. Depending on the manufacturer, they can be made to be lighter, larger, or stronger. This can make them more stable, or improve their cornering ability.\nVehicles that are meant for off-road use are tougher, as they must be able to handle extreme operating conditions. The vehicle’s engine performance must also be improved, as well as its stability. They must also be resistant to overloads.\nTo protect themselves from potential injuries, riders must wear helmets. The steering geometry is a critical factor for cornering, as is the tire type. Typically, transmissions have four to six speeds. On some models, the clutch and throttle are operated by twist-type controls on the handgrips.\nNew technologies have improved the body and drivetrain of automobiles, as well as the emission control system. As the United States and the European Union have stricter regulations on the emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, more and more motorcycles are being fitted with catalytic converters. Emissions from the 2007 model year motorcycles were 0.3 grams of hydrocarbons and 0.1 grams of nitric oxides per mile. Additional reductions will be implemented by 2020.","Awesome Hughson motorcycleAccident Legal Services\nMake motorbike riding safety your leading precedence!\nRunning a motorbike can take various expertise than driving an automobile; nonetheless, the legal guidelines of the highway implement to every driver just the same.

{"question":"What's the best way to arrange furniture for optimal heating efficiency in rooms with central air vents?","answer":"To optimize heating efficiency, furniture should never block air vents or obstruct air flow. Instead of placing large pieces like sofas in front of vents, use alternative arrangements such as placing two side chairs with the air vent between them. This ensures unobstructed airflow and prevents your furnace from having to work harder to heat the home.","context":["There are lots of things you can do to your home to make it more energy efficient — buy new appliances, blow insulation into your rafters, seal leaks and cracks throughout your home, and more. However, you might not know that the way you decorate also plays a role in the energy efficiency of your home. Check out these four interior design tips that will make your home more green.\nPosition Furniture so it doesn’t Block Air Vents\nOne of the easiest things you can do when decorating for better energy efficiency is to rearrange your furniture for good air flow. This means you should never place furniture over air vents or block the flow of air. This can be tricky since most air vents are located in the center of rooms. Your furnace won’t have to work as hard to heat your home if the flow of air is unobstructed.\nOne way to get around the interior design challenge of air vents is to use two side chairs with the air vent in between instead of placing a large sofa in front of the vent. When choosing furniture for your home, also think about areas that get drafty and choose high-back furniture with skirts to prevent drafts when needed. Think about your space and the air flow needs before buying new furniture.\nUse Area Rugs & Throws for Room Warmth\nHardwood and tile floors are a greener option than carpet because they last longer and are easier to clean. However, carpet is better at retaining heat and makes a home feel more warm. Therefore, get the best of both worlds by decorating your hardwood floors with area rugs. Area rugs and throws help absorb heat and keep it in a room.\nAlso keep in mind that dark colors absorb heat and light, while light colors reflect them. That’s why it makes more sense to use dark rugs and throws to decorate in the winter when you want to retain heat in a room, and light colors in the summer when you’re trying to keep it cool.\nInstall Thick Curtains to Block Drafts & Heat\nCurtains can absorb or reflect heat like area rugs and throws. Therefore, if you want a room to feel warmer, choose thick drapes. They act as a layer of insulation between your windows and your room and absorb heat. You can buy curtains with built-in thermal backing, too. However, if you want your room to stay cool, go with light, translucent curtains.\nChoose Lights that Use Less Electricity\nSome people stay away from energy-efficient bulbs, like LED lights, because of the perceived harsher light. However energy-efficient bulbs have come a long way. You can get energy-efficient bulbs in a variety of shades from soft white to a warm incandescent glow. This helps you create any look in your home while still being energy efficient.\nThese are just a few energy efficient interior design tips. Don’t forget to also pay attention to what’s inside your walls and the quality of your windows. Do you have any other energy efficient interior design ideas?

{"question":"Which requires more frequent cleaning: stormwater runoff systems in Florida or porous asphalt pavements, and what are their respective maintenance needs?","answer":"Porous asphalt pavements require more frequent scheduled maintenance, needing vacuuming 2-4 times per year to prevent clogging of the voids that allow stormwater passage. In contrast, stormwater runoff in Florida typically receives no treatment at all, flowing directly from yards and parking lots into storm sewers and then to nearby water bodies. However, the stormwater system does require implementation of various preventive measures like rain gardens, bioswales, and proper landscape management to reduce pollution and slow water movement.","context":["Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ – Reduce stormwater runoff\nFlorida is an amazing state, in many ways. Chief among these is the variety of water resources available to us. We can boast of nearly 3,000 miles of shoreline, more than 650 miles of coastal beaches, some 7,800 freshwater lakes, 700-assorted springs, and a whopping 11 million acres of wetlands. And underlying all this – literally – is the Floridan aquifer, an underground water-carrying system of rocks and caves that is the source of 8 billion gallons of water used by Floridians each day.\nIt’s critical to note that, no matter where we live, our actions can and do impact those water resources. And it is incumbent upon all of us to do our utmost to protect them.\nThat brings us to our latest stop on our journey through the nine principles of Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ (FFL): reduce stormwater runoff. We need to find ways to slow the movement of water from our landscapes and properties, and clean the water that does trickle away.\nUnderstand that stormwater runoff is not waste water; at least, not the kind of waste water we typically think of, like that generated in our homes and businesses. Municipal governments typically treat that waste water in sewage plants.\nBut, storm water generally receives no treatment. Instead, it often moves directly from yards and parking lots into storm sewers, and then on to nearby bodies of water. Along the way, it can pick up fertilizers and pesticides used on landscapes, oils and other petroleum products leaked from vehicles, pet and animal waste, and a host of other pollutants.\nThe pollutants then can move from one water body to the next, posing serious problems for ecosystems and wildlife at each point along the way.\nMany of the FFL principles help cut this waste. Using the right plant in the right place reduces the need for chemical treatments. Fertilizing appropriately and managing yard pests responsibly also cuts chemical applications. Watering efficiently, by its very nature, curbs runoff.\nThere are other steps we can take, as well.\nAdd a rain garden – a low, water-collecting area with plants tolerant of periodic flooding and drought – and point downspouts from gutters to that area. Water will pool in the area, and gradually seep into the ground rather than wash into the sewers. (Note: water should seep away quickly enough to avoid mosquito issues). Downspouts also could empty into rain barrels or cisterns, to be used later for irrigation during dry times. We offer monthly rain barrel workshops.\nBerms and bioswales – sunken areas, like wide and gently sloping ditches – slow down water movement or guide it to areas where it can percolate into the ground. We installed a bioswale at our Twin Lakes Park office, in part to collect and purify runoff from a nearby parking lot but also to demonstrate what can be done. Stop by to learn more, or visit the county page about bioswales.\nAnother way to keep water on the landscape rather than in storm sewers is to use porous walkways and driveways, where possible. Gravel, spaced bricks or flagstones, mulch, and even ground-cover plants create beautiful paths while still allowing water to percolate through to the ground. Mulch and plants also help to slow soil erosion.\nIt’s unrealistic to think we can keep all the rain that falls on our yards in our yards. But, we can help our environment by slowing down the storm water moving across our landscapes, and then using what we can while allowing as much as possible of the remainder to percolate into the ground.\nEven small steps can have a big impact. And the more steps we take, the bigger the impact.\nContact your local Extension office to learn more:\nSarasota County: 941-861-9900 or firstname.lastname@example.org\nManatee County: 941-722-4524 or email@example.com\nCharlotte County: 941-764-4340 or firstname.lastname@example.org","What is a Porous Asphalt BMP?
