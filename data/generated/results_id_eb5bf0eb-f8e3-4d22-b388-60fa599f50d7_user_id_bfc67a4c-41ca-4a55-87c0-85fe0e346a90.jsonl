{"question":"How do houseplants affect air quality during day versus night, and which plant species are best suited for different indoor environments like bathrooms and workspaces?","answer":"During daytime, plants purify air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, with studies showing they can remove up to 87% of air toxins in 24 hours. However, at night, most plants stop photosynthesis and oxygen release, except for certain species like succulents, orchids, bromeliads, and snake plants, which continue releasing oxygen throughout the night. For different indoor environments, bathrooms are ideal for air plants and Japanese hanging moss, which thrive in steam and heat, along with ferns and palms that do well with extra moisture. For workspaces, any large-leafed plants can be beneficial, and specific options like English ivy (which helps eliminate mold), pothos, and birds nest fern are particularly well-suited as they require minimal maintenance and can adapt to various light conditions.","context":["I never considered myself the “green thumb” type. My grandma gave me a whole pot of succulents before college, and I managed to kill all the allegedly indestructible plants by the end of the year.\nI swore off plants and said I would never put another sweet green creature through such misery again. I didn't keep my promise to myself — my dozen or so plants can attest to that — and I'm happy that I didn't. In fact, science suggests I may actually be happier because of my plants, and I am sure all my fellow plant moms and dads can attest to that.\nBehind the Science\n“Biophilia” describes the connection humans have to nature, and since humans spend almost 85% of our time indoors, many of us are severely lacking in that connection. Bringing plants inside is one of the easiest ways to bring nature to us and reap all the health benefits included.\nPlants can contribute to our physical and mental health in incredible ways. For example, just like trees make oxygen, our house plant friends purify the air. As we exhale carbon dioxide, our houseplants absorb it and admit oxygen. NASA even uses plants as a natural filter, with studies suggesting plants can remove 87% of air toxins in 24 hours.\nAnother study suggests houseplants reduce both the mental and physical elements of stress. According to research published in US National Library of Medicine, after working with houseplants, participants felt less stress and more “comfortable, soothed, and natural.” They also experienced physical benefits, including lower blood pressure levels. Seeing all that green and feeling more connected to nature helps us feel calmer and happier.\nAfter working with houseplants, participants felt less stress and more comfortable, soothed, and natural.\nFurthermore, plants also help people recover from illness quicker. A study published in Hort Technology determined patients in hospital rooms with houseplants recovered at a faster rate than patients without houseplants. Positive side effects include lowered blood pressure and heart rate, decreased feelings of anxiety, pain, and fatigue, less medication, and a more positive attitude.\nPlants even help stimulate the mind and improve concentration. According to a University of Michigan study, subjects reported feeling up to 20% more concentrated while working with a plant nearby. Putting a plant in your favorite work area may be exactly what you need for a productivity boost!\nOur green friends also decrease depression or anxiety. Caring for a living thing is rewarding, and humans receive a dopamine hit from watching them grow, thrive, and flower. Just being in the presence of plants triggers the same calming and happy feelings we receive when taking a walk through nature, except you never have to leave the house.\nBeing in the presence of plants triggers the same calming and happy feelings we receive when taking a walk through nature.\nHaving issues with your roommates, landlord, or family? Plants might actually be able to help with that. Plants make us nicer, according to a series of studies published by Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. The studies suggest plants help foster human connection and bring people together. What is a more rewarding project than growing a plant and watching it blossom, together?\nWhen turning your brown thumb to green, it's best to start with hardy plants that can tolerate the adjustment to becoming a plant parent. Succulents and cacti are always a great bet because you can forget to water them for more than a month, and they will still keep on living (although I recommend an every-other-week schedule, with reminders).\nSucculents and cacti are always a great bet because you can forget to water them for more than a month, and they will still keep on living.\nOther tough-to-beat plants include the Swiss Cheese plant (Monstera deliciosa), various types of ivy, and spider plants. The large, green leaves transport you to a jungle while only needing to be watered once or twice a week. If you forget, they will let you know by looking limp and losing their vibrancy, and once watered can quickly perk back up again.\nWhile some plants are easier than others, all plants can be happy and thrive with the right care. Don't always listen to the information on the plant card; make sure to do online research to make sure you are caring for your plants properly and giving them the best start to life.\nReceiving the Maximum Health Benefits from Your Plants\nAs soon as nighttime falls, plants stop photosynthesis, meaning they no longer release oxygen into the air. To get a better night's sleep, try introducing succulents, orchids, bromeliads, and snake plants into your room. They continue omitting oxygen throughout the night.\nHot and steamy places like the bathroom are great for air plants and Japanese hanging moss, which can live almost entirely from the steam in the shower. Other plants that thrive in the heat and steam with an extra watering include ferns and palms.\nWorkspaces and other areas of the house can benefit from any large-leafed plant or flowering plant. As long as you don't keep your house at freezing temperatures, many environmentally moderate plants will thrive in almost any part of your home, and so will you!","As was discussed in parts 1 and 2 of this series, the use of plants in a commercial office has a variety of benefits. Many offices choose to enjoy bringing nature inside and yet feel it is not in their budget to have the plants professionally cared for as often as may be necessary for the type of plants involved. Each plant species has its own needs when it comes to maintenance and care, especially in the area of proper light and the right amount of moisture. The correct kind and amount of fertilizer used properly is also a concern. Whoever is responsible for the care and maintenance of plants in your office should research each type of plant and make a note as to its care and maintenance requirements. Here are some of the most common office plants and the recommendations for having them thrive in an office environment:\nPhilodendrons: do not have to have direct light, so they work well in inner office settings. Keep soil moist, but they will live quite a while if the soil gets dry. You can see the leaves begin to sag when the plant is thirsty.\nModern bamboo: needs moderate or indirect lighting. Water when the soil is dry to the touch but try not to overwater.\nMonstera: gets quite large, so it is great for filling an area of empty floor space. It only needs a little light and a small amount of moisture.\nPeace lily: Noted for cleaning up the air. It likes low light and medium moisture.\nCactus plants : are popular in offices and range from large to small. They like sunlight but not a lot of watering. Keep the soil almost dry to the touch.\nEnglish ivy: thrives in almost any light condition and looks lovely trailing from a plant hanger or climbing up a pole. Light watering twice a week keeps the soil just barely damp. This plant is known to help eliminate mold.\nAfrican violet: a favorite for desks and reception areas. Their care, however, is somewhat tricky as these lovely flowering plants require plenty of light and moisture. They don’t last long if not cared for properly.\nUmbrella plant: grows tall, and its care is determined by its location and the amount of light it receives. If placed in low light, keep the soil fairly dry. If placed in bright light, give this plant more water.\nZZ plant: great for offices as it likes low light and to be kept quite dry.\nBoston ferns: often used in offices as they give off a peaceful appearance. Be careful, though, as they must have moist soil and adequate lighting.\nPothos: another small plant that is easy to care for and looks attractive on desks or cabinet tops. This plant can tolerate light from low to bright and needs once a week watering.\nSpider plant: Easy to grow inside and fun to watch the spiderettes develop on the hanging stems. Medium to bright light and once a week watering keeps this plant healthy.\nBirds nest fern: Needs watering only every one to two weeks and requires only low light—the perfect office plant.\nEnjoying plants in the office is a healthy and enjoyable way to increase the satisfaction and physical well-being of workers. It is important to remember, however, that plants like people need attention to thrive. Check with a plant specialist or online for the right kind and amount of fertilizer to use for each type of plant you are planning to keep. It is usually best to have a specific person (one who enjoys gardening) to oversee plants in the office, as like small children, plants need care and nurturing. And don’t forget to shine the leaves, especially on those plants in areas where there is a lot of foot traffic."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:540fd376-ce65-4f5c-83cd-73d1e5e4fc5d>","<urn:uuid:be387f9e-5da2-4056-8c72-466a0b761859>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare the effects on bone development between Madelung's deformity and Robinow syndrome, particularly focusing on their impact on limb and skeletal structure.","answer":"Both conditions affect bone development but in different ways. Madelung's deformity primarily affects the wrist, causing bowing of the distal end of the radius which curves in a volar direction, while the ulna continues growing normally. This creates a visible prominence on the dorsal and ulnar aspects of the wrist. In contrast, Robinow syndrome causes mesomelic or acromesomelic limb shortening, with forearm shortening being more pronounced than leg shortening. Interestingly, Madelung deformity has also been reported in Robinow syndrome patients. Additionally, while Madelung's deformity mainly affects the wrist area, Robinow syndrome has more widespread skeletal effects including spinal abnormalities with kyphoscoliosis, chest deformity, fusion of thoracic vertebrae, and frequent hemivertebrae.","context":["Madelung’s deformity is an abnormality of the wrist caused by a growth disturbance that retards development of the ulnar and volar portions of the distal radial physis.\nThe eponym gives credit to Otto W. Madelung, who described this entity. Carpus curvus, radius curvus, and progressive subluxation of the wrist, manus valgus, and manus furca are other terms used for this condition.\nThe primary deformity is bowing of the distal end of the radius, which in the most typical form curves in a volar diorection while the ulna continues to grow in a straight line. The distal ends of the radius and ulna are at different levels in the lateral plane. That of the ulna has maintained its original normal position, while that of the radius has curved down to a volar level.\nIt is the distal end of the radius that is displaced. Becaue of its curvature and growth disturbance, the radius has become short while the ulna has ocntineus to grow normally and has become relatively longer.\nEtiology of Madelung Deformity\nThere are four categories of Madelung deformity\nFollowing trauma that disrupts growth of the distal radial ulnar-volar physis.\nAssociated with bone dysplasias like multiple hereditary osteochondromatosis, Ollier disease, achondroplasia, multiple epiphysial dysplasias, and the mucopolysaccharidoses . This type can also be seen secondary to sickle-cell disease, infection, tumor, and rickets.\nThe most important dysplasia associated with Madelung deformity, however, is Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis.\nAs in Turner syndrome\nWhere no cause or association can be found\nThe exact nature of the pathologic process that causes the disturbance in the growth of the distal radial physis is unknown.\nWhen Madelung deformity is a hereditary disorder, it is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance.\nSporadic forms do occur.\nIt is more common in the females and involvement is frequently bilateral.\nNormally, the distal articular surface of the radius is tilted 5 degrees toward its volar surface and 25 degrees toward the ulna, with its dorsal surface and radial margin convex and its volar surface and ulnar border concave.\nThere are two types of Madelung’s deformity.\n- Typical, or regular\n- Atypical, or reverse.\nIn the typical form, the distal articular surface of the radius may tilt toward its palmar surface as much as 80 degrees and ulnarward as much as 90 degrees. In the normal wrist, the proximal row of the carpal bones is arranged in an arc, with its proximal surface forming a convex dome.\nIn Madelung deformity, this dome becomes peaked, its apex resting on the lunate bone. The radius and ulna are separated, with the peak of the carpal bones wedged into the interosseous space. The entire carpus is shifted toward the ulnar and volar side of the wrist. Coalition of carpal bones may be present.\nIn reverse, or atypical, Madelung deformity (it is rarer form), the distal end of the radius is tilted dorsally, reversing the plane of the distal end of the articular surface with a shift of the carpus toward the dorsal side. The distal end of the ulna then appears to be displaced volarly instead of dorsally.\nPathophysiology of Madelung Deformity\nPrimary chromosomal association with Madelung deformity has been observed in patients with Turner syndrome (Patients having only one X chromosome). Within families affected by a short stature dysplasia, a mutation has been found in short stature homeobox-containing gene, SHOX, present on X chromosome.\nBut families with this mutation and individuals with Turner syndrome and families with a history of MD have been shown to exhibit a variable expression of MD and dyschondrosteosis. This raises a possibility of a modifier gene on another area of the X chromosome or on an autosomal gene may be involved.\nDeformity of the wrist is the initial presenting complaint; it usually becomes obvious in late childhood or early adolescence, between the ages of 8 and 12 years.\nIn typical Madelung’s deformity the distal end of the ulna remains in its normal anatomic position and grows distally, causing a visible prominence on the dorsal and ulnar aspects of the wrist.\nNormally, the radial styloid process is long and is located 1 cm distal to the ulnar styloid. In Madelung’s deformity, the radius is shortened at the wrist; the radial styloid process may be on the same horizontal line as the ulnar styloid or may reach a point proximal to it.\nThe range of motion of the wrist is limited, especially in dorsal extension and ulnar deviation. Because of the diasthesis between the distal radius and ulna and the displacement of the carpus between the two separated bones of the forearm, pronation and supination of the forearm are also limited; as a rule, supination is definitely decreased, and pronation is impaired to a slight degree.\nIn reverse Madelung’s deformity palmar flexion of the wrist is decreased, while dorsiflexion is increased. Range of rotatio in of the forearm, especially pronation, is decreased. When it is minimal, madelung’s deformity may be asymptomatic. In moderate or severe deformity, however, pain develops insidiously at the wrist.\nInitially it is minimal, disappearing on rest. With progression of the deformity and impingement of the displaced carpus on the distal ulna, the pain increases. Volar displacement of the carpus may cause discomfort in the region of the median nerve and flexor tendons. Weakness of the wrist may result from progressive instability of the joint.\nCharacteristic radiographic findings include dorsal and radial curvature of the distal radius; exaggerated palmar and ulnar tilt of the distal articular surface of the radius; pyramiding of the carpal bones; greater length of the ulna as compared with the radius; wide interosseous space; and assumption of a relatively dorsal position by the ulnar head, which appears to be enlarged.\nCT scan provides better details of three dimensional deformity though CT scans and 3-dimensional imaging are not necessary for routine treatment.\nTrauma (dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint), rickets, inflammatory conditions of the wrist such as rheumatoid arthritis, and infection involving the ulnar half of the distal radial physis.\nTreatment is primarily directed toward the relief of pain and the restoration of function, with cosmetic improvement as a secondary consideration.\nThe majority of patients with Madelung’s deformity do not require surgical treatment.\nConservative measures consist of curtailing physical activities that may cause forced dorsiflexion of the wrist and wearing a plastic wrist splint to provide support and relieve symptoms.\nSurgical treatment options are\n- Shortening the ulna – Milch’s cuff resection in children or Darrach’s resection.\n- Correcting the bowing deformity of the distal radius by wedge osteotomy\n- Sstabilization of the carpus\n- Prevention of recurrence of deformity by controlling the asymmetrical growth of the distal radius.\nDeformity correction is achieved by either a closing wedge or an opening wedge osteotomy of the distal radius at its metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction.\nFusion of the radial half of the distal radial physis will prevent recurrence of deformity.\nIncoming search terms:\n- madelung deformity (95)\n- madelungs deformity (32)\n- reverse Madelung deformity (9)\n- madelung\\s deformity (9)\n- madelung deformität (6)\n- madelung bone deformity (5)\n- madelung deformity and tennis elbow (4)\n- madelung deformity rheumatoid arthritis (4)\n- madelung disorder (3)\n- madelungs (2)","In 1969, Robinow and colleagues described a syndrome of mesomelic shortening, hemivertebrae, genital hypoplasia, and “fetal facies”. Over 100 cases have now been reported and we have reviewed the current knowledge of the clinical and genetic features of the syndrome. The gene for the autosomal recessive form was identified as the ROR2 gene on chromosome 9q22. ROR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase with orthologues in mouse and other species. The same gene, ROR2, has been shown to cause autosomal dominant brachydactyly B, but it is not known at present whether the autosomal dominant form of Robinow syndrome is also caused by mutations in ROR2.\n- Robinow syndrome\n- fetal facies\n- ROR2 gene\n- TK, tyrosine kinase\n- RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase\n- Ig, immunoglobulin-like\n- CRD cysteine rich domain\n- KD, kringle domain\n- BMP, bone morphogenic proteins\nStatistics from Altmetric.com\nIf you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center’s RightsLink service.

Robinow proposed the term “fetal facies” to describe the characteristic facial appearance and this term has continued to be used. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance have been described suggesting there is allelic heterogeneity. Recently, the gene for the autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome has been mapped2 and identified,3,4 which leads the way to a new understanding of this multisystem developmental disorder.\nMedical publications now include over 100 cases and cover most ethnic groups, but relatively few reports have emerged in Afro-Caribbean or Japanese patients. With the autosomal recessive form, clusters have been reported from Turkey,5 Oman,6 and Czechoslovakia.7 This reflects the high degree of consanguinity in these populations.\nThe facial features in early childhood are characteristic (fig 1). There is marked hypertelorism with midfacial hypoplasia and a short upturned nose. The nasal bridge may be depressed or flat. The forehead is broad and prominent. Robinow8 illustrates the resemblance to a fetal face by emphasising the relatively small face, laterally displaced eyes, and forward pointing alae nasi. The appearance changes with time and the resemblance to “fetal facies” becomes less marked with time. This point is well illustrated in the paper by Saraiva et al,9 which shows the progressive changes with age in a pair of monozygous twin boys. The facial appearance in adult life is not well documented. Bain et al10 illustrate the facial features in an affected father who had two children affected by the autosomal dominant form. The fetal facial proportions have been lost and there is no midfacial hypoplasia, but hypertelorism with a broad nasal root and broad forehead have persisted.\nThere are a number of specific oral features, which greatly aid in the diagnosis. The upper lip tends to be “tented”, that is, to have an inverted V appearance with tethering in the centre. This defect in the lip may expose the incisors and upper gum. Midline clefting of the lower lip has also been reported. In the mouth, gum hypertrophy may be present from birth. A similar pattern of gum hypertrophy at birth may be seen in storage diseases such as I cell disease. Dental crowding and irregular teeth may be seen with both primary and secondary dentition. Another feature commonly seen in the mouth is the presence of ankyloglossia or “tongue tie”. When it is marked it may give the appearance of a bifid tongue.\nThe eyes may be very prominent and give the appearance of exophthalmos. This feature in Robinow syndrome differs from true exophthalmos as the eyes do not protrude from the orbit. Instead there is a deficiency of the lower eyelid that gives the eyes a more prominent appearance. This pseudoexophthalmos may need surgical correction if the eyes cannot close fully. The ears may be low set and simple or have deformation of the pinna. Occasionally there may be a midline capillary haemangioma.\nIn most skeletal dysplasias with dwarfism, the limb shortening is rhizomelic. In Robinow syndrome the limb shortening is mesomelic or acromesomelic (fig 2). The shortening of the forearm tends to be more striking than the shortening in the leg. Madelung deformity has been reported. In the hands, there is also brachydactyly with shortening of the distal phalanx and nail hypoplasia or dystrophy. The thumb may be displaced and on occasions there may be a bifid thumb. Partial cutaneous syndactyly occurs in the hands and feet, but does not produce a consistent pattern. In a number of the patients, especially those reported from Turkey, there has been a split hand (ectrodactyly). The dermatoglyphic pattern5 reflects the underlying maldevelopment of the hands with absent interphalangeal creases, bilateral transverse creases, and a hypothenar whorl pattern. Radiological examination may show fusion of the phalanges and fusion of the carpal bones. One very striking feature is the splitting of one or more distal phalanges.\nSpinal abnormalities are frequent and may be severe (fig 3A). Externally there is kyphoscoliosis and chest deformity, but radiologically there is widespread fusion of thoracic vertebrae with frequent hemivertebrae (fig 3B). There may also be fusion of the ribs (fig 3A). The radiological appearance in severe cases may resemble that of Jarcho-Levin syndrome and spondylocostal dysostosis.\nGenital abnormalities may be noted at birth and in some cases cause concern regarding gender assignment at birth. In females, the anatomical defect is not always very obvious. There is reduced clitoral size and hypoplasia of the labia minora. One report by Balci et al11 described associated vaginal atresia and haematocolpos. In males, the characteristic pattern is to find a micropenis with normal scrotum and testes (fig 4). There has been some debate about whether this is because of a defect in androgen receptors, as suggested by Schonau et al.12 Lee et al13 found normal androgen receptor activity and 5α reductase activity in genital skin fibroblasts in two patients, and Soliman et al6 showed a good response to prolonged HCG stimulation in three prepubertal boys leading to improvement in penile size. The other significant endocrine finding in the study of Soliman et al5 was the presence of an empty sella in the majority of cases studied. This finding did not appear to be associated with abnormality in the LH or FSH levels. There is relatively sparse information about the onset of puberty, but it appears to take place spontaneously in both males and females. There are also several reports of both male and female patients having children. The reports of normal fertility in affected men have been in families with autosomal dominant inheritance,10,14 but it is not clear whether there would be reduced fertility in the autosomal recessive cases.\nRenal tract abnormalities have been associated with the genital abnormalities. Hydronephrosis is relatively common where it is screened for and might in theory predispose to urinary tract infections. Cystic dysplasia of the kidney has also been reported.5,15 As would be expected in a syndrome with limb shortening and spinal deformity, there is also reduced stature. Birth length is reduced and in the series of Soliman et al6 the growth was –2.17 SD below the mean. There is a normal growth hormone response and normal levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1). Growth hormone should be used with care as there may be a theoretical risk of exacerbating the scoliosis. Short stature has not been universal and normal growth has been reported.9,10\nA number of reports16,17 have drawn attention to the association of congenital heart disease in Robinow syndrome. Around 15% of published cases have had a congenital heart defect. Among the abnormalities reported are atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, severe pulmonary stenosis or atresia, and tricuspid atresia. It is difficult to recognise any specific pattern in the heart defects but the commonest abnormality appears to be pulmonary stenosis or atresia. It is important to screen for congenital heart defects at birth as they are probably the major cause of mortality in this syndrome in the first years of life.\nIntelligence is usually normal but developmental delay occurs in 10-15% of cases. Macrocephaly is commonly found in Robinow syndrome and does not specifically indicate a risk factor for developmental delay. One reported patient with developmental delay has been reported with an MRI brain scan which showed cortical dysplasia.18 It is not known whether this is the explanation for the developmental delay in other affected children.\nA number of complications that have been associated with Robinow syndrome may be coincidental especially if the child comes from a highly consanguineous population. The report by Nazer et al19 of Crigler-Najar syndrome in association with Robinow syndrome is almost certainly explained in this way. Similarly, a report from Kuwait by Sabry et al20 in which cutis laxa and immune deficiencies occur with Robinow syndrome might be coincidental.\nGenetic counselling in the presence of a family history is relatively easy and prenatal diagnosis may be offered at 19 weeks using fetal ultrasound.21 The main problem in genetic counselling arises when there is an isolated case, as the phenotypic features for autosomal recessive cases and new autosomal dominant cases are similar. In general terms, the severity tends to be greater in autosomal recessive cases, but table 1 indicates some of the features which may guide genetic counselling in this situation and, in addition, mutation analysis may now resolve the issue.\nThe gene for autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome was first localised to a 4 cM interval on chromosome 9q22 between markers D9S1836 and D9S1803, with a maximum multipoint lod score of 12.3.2 This was done using homozygosity (autozygosity) mapping on patients from Oman, Brazil, and Pakistan. The Omani cases shared a common haplotype at this locus (RBNW1), so were considered likely to have originated from a single founder mutation. Mapping to this region has also been described in people of Turkish origin to 4.9 cM.4 The ROR2 gene was also located in this region and heterozygous mutations in ROR2 had been shown to cause the autosomal dominant condition brachydactyly type B.22 Moreover, homozygous mutations in the mouse Ror2 gene cause mesomelic dwarfing.23,24 These reports made ROR2 a strong candidate gene for autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome. Confirmation of this was reported by Afzal et al3 and van Bokhoven et al.4\nROR2 belongs to the ROR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) closely related to Trk, with at least two structurally very similar members, ROR1 and ROR2, with 58% overall amino acid identity and, more importantly, similar domain structures. ROR1, which is located on chromosome 1p31-32,25 encodes a 3358 bp transcript with a protein product of 937 amino acid. ROR2 contains nine exons and encodes a 4092 bp transcript. The protein product consists of 943 amino acids and is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to an as yet unidentified ligand. It contains distinct motifs including an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, a frizzled-like cysteine rich domain (CRD), and a kringle domain (KD) in the extracellular region, a transmembrane section, and an intracellular region with tyrosine kinase (TK), serine/threonine rich and proline rich structures (fig 5A). The extracellular motifs of the ROR2 protein are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions by analogy with other similar proteins.26\nROR2 AND ITS ORTHOLOGUES IN OTHER SPECIES\nIn mice, the Ror1 and Ror2 genes are located on chromosome 4 and chromosome 13 respectively. Mouse Ror1 and Ror2 have a very similar structure not only at the DNA level but also at the protein level with 58% amino acid identity. Both proteins contain similar conserved domains.\nIt has been suggested that Ror2 is necessary for proper proliferation, maturation, motility, and function of chondrocytes, and the resulting normal formation and ossification of the limbs, tail, vertebrae, and ribs, and gives rise to the overall skeletal size.23,24 In early stages of mouse development both Ror1 and Ror2 are highly expressed in the anterior part of the embryo. However, Ror2 is also expressed in entire regions of the primitive streak. They are both expressed in the developing face, that is, the frontonasal process and branchial arches. Comparatively, Ror2 has a low expression in proximal regions of the limb buds and brain and neither is expressed in the ectoderm. In the later stages, Ror1 is expressed in the anterior and posterior parts of the limbs, whereas Ror2 is expressed in the proliferative chondrocytes of the skeletal system, for example, the perichondrium of the digits and on the margin of the developing limbs. They are both expressed in myocardium, interventricular septum, aortic valve, atrium, and primitive alveoli in the lungs, but not the epicardium. Ror2 alone is expressed in cortex, hippocampus, and caudate putamen and only Ror1 is expressed in lens epithelium.26,30\nThere are two mouse models for this disease. The first one is produced by replacement of the tyrosine kinase domain of the orthologous Ror2 with a lacZ-neo cassette. This dramatically affects cartilage patterning and growth in pups homozygous for the insertion, and show lethality in the perinatal period.23 Interestingly, heterozygous mice for this mutant allele were viable, fertile, and appeared normal. The second model produces a similar phenotype in mice homozygous for replacement of the exon encoding the immunoglobulin-like domain of Ror2 with a PGK-neo cassette. In this second model, the pups had severe cyanosis and died within six hours owing to incomplete expansion of alveoli.24 Interestingly, both mouse models, although showing early lethality, have similar abnormal features to each other and to the human Robinow syndrome. The homozygous knock out model of Ror2 in the mouse mainly affects all bones that undergo endochondral ossification but not bones that undergo intramembranous ossification. The resulting dwarfism is associated with shortened and deformed limbs, brachydactyly, a short tail, costovertebral segmentation defects, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia/malformations (cleft palate), and congenital heart anomalies (ventricular septal defect).23,24 Heterozygous mice show a normal phenotype.\nHeterozygous terminating mutations in the ROR2 gene were recently shown to cause the autosomal dominant condition of brachydactyly type B,22,31 which is characterised by terminal deficiency of fingers and toes.\nAutosomal recessive Robinow syndrome is caused by different homozygous missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations. The reported mutations were mainly in exons 5 and 9 of the gene.3,4 The mutations can be divided into two groups. The first group contains missense mutations (fig 5A) in cysteine rich, kringle and tyrosine kinase domains. Cysteine rich and kringle domains are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions and are consistent with a ligand binding function, although no ligand or ligands for ROR2 have been identified. The second group contains terminating mutations, which occurred 3` to the Ig-like domain, and are predicted to truncate the protein in different regions (fig 5B). At present the phenotypic differences produced by these two groups are being actively studied.\nWhile the heterozygous mutations in ROR2 in brachydactyly B have been predicted to be associated with gain of function,22 homozygous mutations in ROR2 in autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome are likely to cause loss of function. The loss of function hypothesis is supported by the similarity in phenotype between autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome and the homozygous mouse model. It is not clear at the present time whether the autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome is caused by mutations in the ROR2 gene or whether it is caused by mutations in a different gene. The data so far favour the latter hypothesis.\nThe occurrence of distinct phenotypes associated with recessive and dominant mutations within a single gene is unusual but not unprecedented. For example, dominant negative mutations of the insulin receptor (another receptor tyrosine kinase) are associated with insulin resistance and recessive mutations with additional growth retardation (leprechaunism).32 Heterozygous mutations of GDF5, a member of the bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) family, cause brachydactyly type C,33 whereas homozygous mutations are associated with acromesomelic dysplasia Hunter-Thompson type34 and Grebe syndrome.35\nThe existence of clinically similar cases of Robinow syndrome inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion8 raises the possibility of further genetic heterogeneity of this disease. It is possible that such patients might harbour mutations in the genes for the ligand or other components of the ROR2 pathway and, if this were the case, the discovery of these other loci would greatly assist accurate genetic counselling.\nThis work was supported by the Birth Defects Foundation (UK) and the Wellcome Trust."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:427b6282-ec45-4eca-9fe9-ab67a4ed89f1>","<urn:uuid:14983fd5-4415-41dd-9fd9-2fd4adbf7019>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Qué método de limpieza es más respetuoso con el medio ambiente: el hidrojet o la limpieza ultrasónica? Es importante saberlo para mi proyecto! ✨","answer":"Both methods are environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional cleaning methods. Ultrasonic cleaning is specifically noted as an environmentally friendly alternative to harsh chemical cleaning agents. Similarly, hydro jetting is more environmentally friendly compared to chemical washing in acid baths, which requires enormous baths and is not environmental. While both use water as their primary cleaning medium, hydro jetting uses high-pressure water, and ultrasonic cleaning uses water or specialized cleaning solutions with improved conductive qualities. Both methods avoid the environmental hazards associated with chemical cleaning methods and their subsequent disposal problems.","context":["Hydro jetting heat exchanger thoroughly and efficiently with high pressure water blasting . Deposits get lodged in the heat exchanger tubing, reducing the efficiency of heat transfer. Any reduction can result in higher expenditures for the operator.\nHeat exchanger is device that transfer thermal energy from one substance to the other. The substances flow through the heat exchanger in the same, contrary or crossed direction. In most case heat exchangers are made of metal, but there are also heat exchangers made of enamel, plastic, glass, silicon carbide, copper, aluminum or steel, especially stainless steel.\nThey have the form of pipes , normally water,thermal oil, molten salt or liquid metal are used as heat carrier.\nHigh pressure hydro jetting pipe cleaning can be offered with specially designed accessories for heat exchanger cleaning . In this application, cleaning the inside diameter of the condenser and heat exchanger tubes. Removing the pit speaks exposes the pit and permits flushing out of the acidic deposits, retarding the pitting action. This special cleaning process increases the efficiency of the condenser, as well as the life of the tube. This high pressure method is faster and more effective in removing deposits than brushes.\nCleaning heat exchanger with hydro jetting saving downtime\nCleaning process can be increased efficiency and much energy saved by regular and residue free cleaning of heat exchangers. Technical requirements and local conditions vary and are to be taken into account there already in the planning of the cleaning:\nVery large total surfaces with at times complicated geometric structure, e.g. U-shaped pipes or small bore pipes with only 12 mm diameter\nWide range of deposits with often very hard cover layers with hydro jetting heat exchanger\nIn some cases,internal and external cleaning is necessary, it is not possible to clean the heat exchanger on the spot . There is too little space or there is no more better way to choose.\nThe cleaning task can be completed as quickly as possible so that production can be restarted immediately.\nLiquid media often contain dirt and baked on components, e.g. carbonates, minerals, oxides, burned chemicals or deposits of oils .\nHigh pressure water jetting heat exchangers comparing with other cleaning ways\nEach cleaning method has its benefits and drawbacks.Hydro jetting heat exchanger can be used everywhere for heat exchanger . For internal and external cleaning as well as for very different surfaces, media and coatings. In comparison, other cleaning methods have considerable drawbacks in terms of applicability, cleaning results and cost.\nChemical washing in acid baths is very complicated and requires enormous baths and not environmental as well . Ultrasonic cleaning takes time and is not effective in reaching into indentations. Sandblasting is abrasive and involves high material and disposal costs. Mechanical drilling is complicated and only suitable for straight pipes.\nHeat exchangers are vital components in plants in the chemical or other industrial . Heat exchanger downtime means lost production and lost revenues and everything stopped due to the heat exchanger.\nHence, it is mandatory to have a heat exchanger in good working condition at all time.\nIt is required to clean internal and external tube bundles and remove hard deposits in internal pipes by hydro jetting .\nHydro blasting will improve the operating efficiency and increase the flow rate of pipe system back to its original condition.\nOur aim is to increase your production with our services and technology through cleaning efficiency and time saving at shutdowns.\nTo improve the performance of heat exchangers require that the tubes be cleaned periodically. Each time the tube deposits, sedimentation, bio fouling and obstructions are removed. The tube surfaces are returned almost to bare metal, providing the tube itself with a new life cycle.\nWater jetting save the cost\nConsideration of cost saving, some people use chemicals cleaning method or mechanical cleaning methods for tube cleaning of heat exchanger. But this type of conventional methods is expensive in long period, takes longer for the operation to be completed. And the subsequent disposal of the chemicals, an environmental hazard, creates its own set of problems. In chemicals cleaning method . It has been found quite frequently that some residual material will still need to be removed by mechanical cleaning methods. During this kind of conventional methods of cleaning, there is also a gradual erosion of tube metal. Which ultimately reduces the life of heat exchanger tubes.\nTo avoid such type of problems, high pressure water blasting pumps like hydro jetting pipe cleaning are most appropriate solution for heat exchanger tube cleaning. Waterjetting pumps are user friendly and clean the hard scale deposits from the tubes very effectively in a lesser time.\nOperation of hydro jetting machine for heat exchanger\nOver a period of time scale builds up and acid pockets form, causing pitting in heat exchangers and condenser. This process, knows as biofouling, increasingly reduces the efficiency of the tubes.

And refer to our cleaning suggestion as well .","by Breana Cronk, IQS Editor\nIn a world of ever advancing technology it seems that even something as routine as a trip to the dentist yields the discovery of new and improved instrumentation. Bi-annual check-ups for teeth seem also to mean bi-annual updates on dentistry. In recent years one of the most exciting new pieces of equipment has been the ultrasonic cleaner used to clean, protect and inspect teeth. Though relatively simple in design, these devices not only promote the health and safety of patients, but that of the dentists and hygienists that use them as they allow for the fast and efficient cleaning of both teeth and instruments. Far from a dental phenomenon, however, this technology has actually been around since the early 1950’s and has proven useful in a number of different industrial, commercial and even residential applications.\nUltrasonic cleaners image courtesy of ESMA, Inc.\nAs the name would suggest, ultrasonic washers use inaudible sound waves to gently but efficiently clean even small and hard to reach components where bacteria, debris and other sources of contamination are easily hidden even after manual scrubbing. These waves are created by the high frequency expansion and contraction of electronically powered ultrasonic transducers. Some units reach sounds up to 120 kHz, while other applications require forces as low as 18 kHz. The resulting ultrasonic oscillations reverberate throughout a reservoir or tank filled with a conductive fluid in which parts and components to be cleaned are immersed. While hot water may be used on its own, more often specially designed cleaning solvents and solutions with improved conductive qualities are used. No matter the material, the tremendous force creates millions if not billions of microscopic bubbles that implode creating a powerful hydraulic shock which loosens and removes debris for a thorough cleaning of even the smallest crevices or cracks.\nWith the capacity to remove up to 99.9% of contaminants, ultrasonic cleaning has become the standard in both dental and medical applications. As mentioned before, however, this beneficial technology is not limited to healthcare as it is easily adapted to a number of situations and in fact began as a method for cleaning complex aircraft components. These ultrasonic parts cleaners can be large enough to accommodate engine components and turbine blades. Other models are significantly smaller than these industrial ultrasonic cleaners and have even been made into novelty items such as ultrasonic jewelry cleaners and golf club cleaners. Although once relegated to industrial plants and facilities, ultrasonic cleaning systems have quickly found purpose in a number of applications such as automotive and marine industries, as well as businesses including hair salons, pharmacies and sporting good retailers.\nThe growing popularity of ultrasonic cleaners is evident in the ever expanding number of applications for which they are preferred. Speed and efficiency obviously play a role as these devices offer complete and thorough cleaning of even heavily greased industrial parts in ten minutes or less. Additionally, ultrasonic cleaning equipment is a non-destructive, energy efficient and often environmentally friendly alternative to the use of harsh chemical cleaning agents or burdensome manual scrubbing. From teeth to tools, ultrasonic cleaners offer industry a better and more consistent clean.\nPhoto courtesy of Ultrasonic Power Corporation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a1a74617-0231-4972-b7ac-d589eb6efdb0>","<urn:uuid:04feab3d-b5ca-4a94-9628-bba277db4361>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the historical significance of Hamadryas baboons in Ancient Egypt, and where are they found today?","answer":"In Ancient Egypt, Hamadryas baboons were considered representatives of the Egyptian god of learning and were known as Sacred baboons. Although they are now extinct in Egypt, these primates currently inhabit Ethiopia, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, having the northernmost natural range of all baboon species. They can be found in diverse habitats from the Red Sea in Eritrea to the southwestern Arabian Peninsula, preferring sub-deserts, steppes, alpine grass meadows, plains, and short-grass savannahs near water sources.","context":["The strong and robust Hamadryas baboons belong to Old World monkeys. They are highly intelligent animals. Mature males of this species are identified by their silver manes and pink faces. In Ancient Egypt, they were considered representatives of the Egyptian god of learning. Hence, they are otherwise known as Secret baboons. Nowadays, these animals are extinct from Egypt and are currently found in Ethiopia, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The Hamadryas baboons have the northernmost natural range of all baboons. These primates are known to form large troops of several hundred individuals.\nThese primates are found from the Red Sea in Eritrea to Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia as well as Yemen and Saudi Arabia in southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Preferred types of habitat are sub-deserts, steppes, alpine grass meadows, plains and short-grass savannahs. The Hamadryas baboons always remain close to water. Hence, during the wet season, some populations move to mountain areas.\nThe Hamadryas baboons lead diurnal lifestyle, being active by day and sleeping by night. Although they are generally terrestrial, they prefer sleeping in trees or cliffs. The multi-level social system of these primates is rather complex: the Hamadryas baboons form so-called one male units (OMUs), consisting of 1 - 9 females and their young that are aggressively herded, controlled and guided by a single leading male. Usually, females of an OMU compete to groom and stay close to the leading male. On the other hand, leading males of various OMUs are often related. They closely associate, gathering into social units known as 'clans'. Each group also contains a subordinate, \"follower\" male, which is typically related to the dominant male. Group members engage in collective activities such as sleeping, travelling and foraging. Several OMUs occasionally form bands - groups of 30 - 90 individuals. Multiple such bands, in turn, may sleep in the same area, forming troops - aggregations of up to several hundred Hamadryas baboons.\nAs an omnivore, the Hamadryas baboon consumes food of both animal and plant origin such as fruits, tree gums, acacia seeds, acacia flowers, seeds, grass, rhizomes, corms, roots, tubers as well as small vertebrates, insects and eggs.\nThese primates have a polygynous mating system. The dominant male of an OMU mates with the females of the group. Hamadryas baboons don't have a breeding mating season. Instead, they breed year-round with peak a period, occurring in May-July. Meanwhile, the population in Ethiopia typically breeds in November-December. Females produce offspring at intervals of 15 - 24 months. Gestation period lasts for 170 - 173 days, yielding one infant, which remains with its mother for the first few months of its life. The weaning process takes about 9 months, lasting from 6 to 15 months old. The Hamadryas baboons are independent at around 2 years old, after which males continue living with their natal clan, whereas females often move between clans and bands. The age of reproductive maturity is 4 - 6 years old in males and 4 years old in females.\nThe Hamadryas baboons are locally hunted for their skin and trapped for medical research. These animals are also killed as pests due to destructing crops. In some parts of their range, these primates suffer from loss of their natural habitat and come into serious conflict with humans as a result of overgrazing, agricultural development and irrigation projects.\nAccording to IUCN, the Hamadryas baboon is abundant and widespread throughout its range but no overall population estimate is available. However, in Djibouti, its total population is estimated to be around 2,000 animals. Overall, Hamadryas baboons are classified as Least Concern (LC) and their numbers are increasing today.\nOn one hand, due to their habit of digging for tubers, roots, rhizomes and corms, Hamadryas baboons probably contribute to the soil aeration within their range. On the other hand, they may act as important seed dispersers of plants that they consume. Additionally, these primates form an irreplaceable link in the food chain of their habitat: by feeding upon various plants and animals, they get certain nutrients that later become available to larger animals, which feed upon Hamadryas baboons.","- CLASS: Mammalia (Mammals)\n- ORDER: Primates\n- FAMILY: Cercopithecidae\n- GENUS: Papio\n- SPECIES: hamadryas\nThis baboon is no buffoon: Once revered by Ancient Egyptians as representatives of the Egyptian god of learning, hamadryas baboons are also referred to as Sacred Baboons. These hardy Old World monkeys display complex social behaviors, and can live in troops of several hundred individuals. Though currently extinct in Egypt, these monkeys can be found in large populations in Ethiopia, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. In fact, no other species of baboon resides as far north as hamadryas baboons. The remarkable silver manes and pink faces of adult males add to the unique nature of these intelligent primates.\nHamadryas baboons are large-bodied monkeys with a strong build and a dog-like muzzle. Both males and females have brown or light gray fur. While the females of this species have hairless black and brown faces, the male hamadryas baboon has a distinctive mantle (mane) of long silvery hair and a bright pink face and backside. These baboons sport a relatively short, tufted tail that is not prehensile.\nHamadryas baboons are diurnal animals, meaning that they are active during the day. After awaking around sunrise, troops of several hundred baboons will come together to \"monkey around.\" This includes chasing, playing, and social grooming within their \"One Male Unit\" (OMU) social group. Afterward, their work begins. The troop leaves the sleeping site, breaks off into smaller groups called bands, and the bands separate into OMUs to forage for food. The troop reunites in the afternoon for a water break, especially during dry times. Then, it’s back to more foraging in OMU formations. As the sun sets, the groups return to the sleeping site, and the monkeys coelsce once again for more social grooming before it is time for bed.\nAlthough staring contests and lip-smacking may seem like trivial, if not amusing, ways of interacting with our friends, these behaviors have completely different meanings to hamadryas baboons. In fact, staring is considered a threat behavior! Other threat behaviors include tension yawns, during which a baboon’s canine teeth are clearly exposed, as well as head bobbing. But fear not, these baboons have behaviors known to comfort one another as well. Social grooming is extremely important for building relationships. Teeth-chattering and lip-smacking are considered reassurance behaviors, and are usually performed by dominant males as a sign of comfort. Dominant males may also produce a two-phase bark to ward of predators and other male baboons.\nHamadryas baboons are Old World monkeys. This means that they belong to a group of monkeys found in Africa and Asia. (New World monkeys are found in the tropics of Central and South America.) There are many physical differences between Old and New World monkeys. Hamadryas baboons have classic Old World monkey characteristics like non-grasping (or prehensile) tails, they are primarily terrestrial, and they have opposable thumbs that are very similar to a human's thumb. These traits are rarely seen in New World monkeys.\nHamadryas baboons can fall prey to leopards, hyenas, and Verreaux’s eagles; however, many animals that may have been natural predators to the baboons historically no longer exist within the baboons’ habitat. Hamadryas baboons rely on assembling into large groups for protection. Groups are largest while getting water and sleeping, as these are times when baboons are most vulnerable. As another level of security, troops of baboons favor sleeping in high places.\nHABITAT AND DIET\nHamadryas baboons live in diverse habitats ranging from subdesert to savanna and into steppe, plains, and arid brushland. Rather than trees, these primates prefer to live near high cliffs where they can gain access to acacia, opuntia cactus, and a water source.\nHamadryas baboons forage for food by day in One Male Units (OMUs) made up of a small group of monkeys from the larger troop. At night, the smaller groups coalesce at the sleeping site to form troops of several hundred individuals. Sleeping sites are often located on cliff sides, but hamadryas baboons will also occasionally find shelter in trees. Above all else, these monkeys make sure to find a home near water.\nIn the wild, the hamadryas baboon is omnivorous; however the majority of its diet consists of plant matter. Hamadryas baboons in Africa and Arabia share a similar diet to some extent: both populations primarily eat grass seeds, roots, berries, and the flowers, leaves, and pods of acacia trees. Baboon populations in Arabia commonly eat cactus fruit and palm nuts, as well. Non-plant food sources make up a small portion of their diet and include bird eggs, carrion, small mammals, and occasionally insects like locusts. Since most baboons live in arid habitats, they are able to survive on low-quality diets for long periods of time in the wild.\nHamadryas baboons have a polygynous mating system, where the dominant male mates with more than one female. Within these social groups, called One Male Units (OMUs), females bond with males by grooming the male leader of their unit. This is where the male’s mantle (mane) comes into play, as it seems that grooming behaviors are exclusively focused on the male.\nFemales give birth to one baby at a time. For the first 3 weeks of its life, a baby will hold onto its mother by gripping her hair as she moves around. Hamadryas baboon babies have pink skin and black hair until they are one year old, at which point their hair turns brown and resembles that of the adults.\nMales begin to establish their own units when they are between 4 and 6 years old, while females begin looking to join an OMU between the ages of 4 and 5. Female members of OMUs may change groups depending on changes in male dominance, which occurs often. Multiple OMUs will often work together forming a group called a band, hence, they \"band together\" at night to share sleeping sites. These groups are called troops and can include hundreds of individual baboons.\nAT THE ZOO\nA large group of hamadryas baboons can be seen in the Zoo's new Ethiopian Highlands habitat at Conrad Prebys Africa Rocks. The group—led by a 19-year-old male named Elvis—includes 12 females and eight males, ranging in ages from 3 months to 23 years.\nWant to get to know the hamadryas baboons even better? Check them out on the San Diego Zoo's new Baboon Cam.\nHamadryas baboons are listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They exist in stable, even growing populations. Once collected in great numbers for medical research, they currently face only a few localized threats. Their range often overlaps urban and agricultural areas. While these monkeys are commonly tolerated by humans, they are occasionally considered a pest, as they can destroy crops and can become aggressive when approached. As agricultural and irrigation development continues to expand, it may result in greater conflict with humans as well as habitat loss."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:360bc832-97b8-4f4c-b5cc-fa7bd3ec1d61>","<urn:uuid:6b789942-135d-439b-b397-af59863a1ed7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the concepts of 'space' and 'fixed-feature space' differ in their characteristics and significance?","answer":"Space and fixed-feature space have distinct characteristics and roles. Space is an abstract and undifferentiated concept often expressing freedom or potential, as in phrases like 'give me some space.' It can be good for personal growth and identity formation, though new spaces can feel lonely and disorienting. In contrast, fixed-feature space refers specifically to immobile elements like walls, stairs, windows, and sidewalks. In performance venues, fixed-feature space includes elements like the building, lobby, auditorium, ceiling, stage, and fixed seats, which serve to embody, protect, and impose specific rules and purposes.","context":["Place and Space: An Excerpt from The Space BetweenBy Eric Jacobsen for FRONT PORCH REPUBLIC\nPlace and Space\nPlace, in contrast to space, is a context-speciﬁc, meaning-rich concept. Although many use the two words interchangeably, a fairly clean distinction can be made between them. Space is more abstract and undifferentiated than place. Space often is used to express a freedom from or a potential for something—“give me some space” or “we need space for this relationship to develop.” Place, by way of contrast, describes a realm where something signiﬁcant has happened or is happening; “there’s no place like home.”\nWalter Brueggemann identiﬁes place as “storied.” One way to easily visualize the relationship between space and place is to think of a college dorm room. Before a student moves in, the dorm room has everything that is needed for college life, but it’s generic, undifferentiated space. Typically, there is a desk, a bed, a closet, a mirror, and a light. Within a week or two after the student moves in, this space is transformed into a place. There are pictures on the mirror, a cover on the bed, posters on the walls, and bric-a-brac on the desk. The story of that particular semester of college in that student’s life has already begun to be inscribed on the walls.\nThere is a dynamic relationship between space and place. Place is good, but we sometimes need a break from it. As a person lives life, one’s narrative begins to etch meanings on a particular space, causing it to become a place. As the meanings and memories crowd a place, a person may express a desire for more space. This is why we go on vacations to be restored or sometimes long to start over.\nSpace can be good in and of itself as well. Space is sometimes necessary for personal growth or identity formation within a group. Often we go on retreats not to disengage, but to reconnect with God, with ourselves, or with others. Often, however, new spaces are lonely and disorienting. Strangers ﬁnding themselves in this kind of situation long to ﬁnd a place that they can call home.\nThe Demise of Place\nJohn Inge discusses how modernity has diminished the importance of place in contemporary life. In ancient and premodern cultures, place was a signiﬁcant determiner of one’s identity. A person typically was born, lived, and died in one particular place and was closely identiﬁed with that place (Jesus of Nazareth or Joseph of Arimathea). With the universalizing impulse of modernity typiﬁed in the scientiﬁc method, the particularities of place began to be perceived as a liability to the modernist project. For an experiment to be valid, it had to be repeatable regardless of the particularities of place. Through this and other developments, space began to be valued more highly than place.\nWith increasingly faster modes of transportation and communication, place became swallowed up by time. As people could get information and goods from various places and could easily travel, places (and the people associated with them) became less and less important. In the nineteenth century, a person from North America would have to travel on a boat for many weeks to experience the taste of a kiwi or would have to wait months for news from the mission front in interior China. In the twenty-ﬁrst century, a North American can eat a bowlful of kiwis in the middle of winter while participating in a video conference with missionaries from six continents at once. If you want to make a direct connection with another person today, the most important thing you need to coordinate is the time of your connection. With the cell phone, Skype, and Facebook, your location and theirs are insigniﬁcant.\nGlobalization and the horizontal integration of corporate structures have more recently introduced the notion of placelessness into the modern vocabulary. Big-box chain retail stores and identical, production-built tract houses can be understood as placeless places. These are technically places in that stories are lived in them, but the generic nature and short time span of the buildings make them resistant to holding the stories that are generated there. More and more of the contemporary landscape is being taken over by developments in which it can be very hard to tell where one happens to be located.\nWhile one would be hard-pressed to try to make a convincing case against the scientiﬁc method, improvements in communications technology, or the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of expanding productivity in industry, it may still be helpful to consider some of the implications of the diminishing importance of place in contemporary life.\nAs one’s connection with a particular place becomes more tenuous, it can be harder to make sense of one’s identity. Gaston Bachelard makes the argument in The Poetics of Space that our identity is formed by our early interaction with places like the homes of our childhoods. This notion suggests that placelessness might play a contributing role in the current crisis of identity.\nThe loss of place can have a detrimental effect on our collective and individual memory as well. Places of signiﬁcance hold memories, and when they are designed with standardized elements or for short-term use, they tend to hold memories less well. To people who have been commanded in the Bible to “remember,” this should be particularly concerning. We will explore this theme in more detail later in this chapter.\nThe boundedness of place has been an important element in relational development. We know one another more deeply when proximity forces us to interact on a regular basis. The contemporary ease by which we can move from one place to another has tended to pull us further apart from one another rather than bring us closer. Martin Heidegger has observed that in contemporary life “the frantic abolition of all distances brings no nearness.” This theme will be taken up in chapter 3.\nAmbiguity about Place\nNot all of the attributes of place can be considered unequivocally good, however. For some people, place is primarily associated with oppression. A place can signify the stigma of one’s identity in a particular context. One woman who encountered Jesus understood only too well that her place carried with it certain restrictions, “for Jews do not associate with Samaritans.” A place can evoke painful and destructive memories, and place can provide the pretext for relational disassociation and social stratiﬁcation—“they ought to know their place.”\nIn many ways, postmodernity has been concerned with navigating the assets and liabilities associated with place. On the one hand, postmodernity has revived an interest in narrative and localism in an attempt to recover some of the richness of place. On the other hand, postmoderns have embraced the ﬂuidity and mobility allowed by modern communication technologies. Modernity brought the radical notion that a son of a blacksmith from Bath could grow up to be a lawyer in London. Postmodernity presents us with the possibility of making up an online identity that needs no correspondence with our actual geographical or demographic particularities. We have yet to discover the implications of this radical dismissal of place.\nEric O.

Hall. He proposed that the way a person uses the space around him/her should also be taken into account in studies of behavior and communication and he called this field of study “proxemics.” In proxemics it is maintained that people use the space according to the related social codes in their culture and those codes become more and more accepted and established as the usage is repeated.\nHall stated that people “locate” their bodies according to three types of space:\n1. Fixed-feature space (immobile things, such as walls, stairs, windows, sidewalks, etc.).\n2. Semifixed-feature space (movable furniture and objects).\n3. Informal (personal) space (space around the body and the distance to others).\nThe theater semiologist Keir Elam applies this classification to performance spaces:\n1. The building, lobby, auditorium, ceiling, stage, fixed seats, etc. constitute the fixed-feature space.\n2. Set, curtain, lights belong to semifixed-feature space.\n3. Spaces around and between the actors and spectators form the personal space. (Elam, 62-63)\nThe architecture and design of performance spaces are built and designed to serve specific purposes, according to specific rules. Once built, those structures embody, protect and impose those rules.\nLet us look at the theater auditoriums where most performances take place: even now, in the 21st century, they are being built in the bourgeois “playhouse” style developed about two centuries ago, consisting of a stage facing or surrounded by fixed rows of seats. The “stage” (elevated or not) connotes status, hierarchy and immunity as inherited from temples, churches and courts.\nThe center of the stage (altar) is the focal point, it forms the core of the symmetrical architecture of the auditorium. That is the spot where the orchestra’s conductor, the lecturer, the soloist stands. During the curtain call of a theater performance the lead actor stands there, the others line up on two sides in a hierarchy determined by the importance of their roles in the play. The ticket prices are set according to the distance to this center spot: those who pay more (usually dressed elegantly) sit closer and those who pay less end up sitting at a distance. Economical and demographic characteristics reflect the architectural symmetry. Performers enter the stage from some invisible spaces and they basically “disappear” when they exit. In short, the fixed space supremely dominates and controls the semifixed and informal spaces.\nThose who build these spaces are not the ones who perform there: they are either investors who want to make a profit or organizations that have to or want to provide cultural services to society. Naturally, the major concern of these individuals and organizations is to fit in as many spectators as possible. They don’t have any reason to build flexible spaces that can be arranged in different ways for different works or to utilize existing structures to offer alternative spaces. Indeed, most of these builders tend to be unaware of the existence of such ideas.\nOne doesn’t hear demands from the performing arts audiences for different, alternative spaces because they tend to prioritize the comfort and untouchableness of their personal spaces (comfort zone) and, therefore, are content with the existing design and decorum. There seems to be an ongoing reciprocal cause-effect relationship between the builders and the audiences: builders give what the audiences demand and the audiences demand what they were given.\nThose who produce and present the works of art are usually left out of this vicious supply-demand circle. The work is evaluated and accepted for presentation in a given space according to its suitability for the architectural and operational features – basically, its “salability.” If we accept that search for the new is the most essential motive in the arts, we can say that fixed-feature spaces and the relationships stemming from them do not comply with the nature of the arts.\nWe can notice the importance of proxemics when we look at the history of modern theater. Proxemic arrangements may have been the most discussed topic since the beginnings of the 20th century: some didn’t use the backstage, some asked the audience to watch standing and walking, some placed the audience on stage, some made the actors meet the audience at the entrance, some invited the audience to touch the actors, etc. These experiments can be summarized, using two somewhat technical terms, as efforts to move from “sociofugal” to “sociopetal” space arragements.\nSociofugal arrangements are aimed at allowing people to preserve their personal and private spaces in solitude, without having to communicate with each other. The waiting rooms of hospitals, government offices, airports are typical examples of sociofugal spaces (usually arranged in grids). On the other hand, sociopetal spaces allow people to see and hear each other, to communicate and interact with each other. They aim for setups where personal spaces can be mobile. Cafes, cabaret theaters where spectators sit at tables, plazas of small Italian towns are often given as examples to sociopetal space arrangements (usually circular or radial). (Elam, 64-65)\nThe spatial experiments in modern theater gave way to new ideas in performer-spectator relationship but they were not effective enough to start radical changes in fixed-feature spaces. Smaller performance spaces called “black box,” where all walls are painted in black, appeared in the 1960s and became popular. At first glance, these look like a reaction to the limits of the playhouse but in reality they serve the purpose of quick and inexpensive accommodation of smaller productions in the same, traditional manner.\nIn both traditional spaces and black boxes the audience is often seated in sociofugal arrangements, where personal spaces remain separate. Interestingly, the need to look and be seen, to watch and to show, to talk and to listen tend to be satisfied at the sociopetal environment of the lobby. This may be one reason why the sizes of the lobbies have been expanding in recent years, almost reaching the size of the auditorium, particularly in buildings where opera, ballet, orchestral concerts and large theatrical productions take place (Bennett, 130-131).\nSocializing at the sociopetal lobby ends when the spectators enter the sociofugal auditorium: they go quiet, find their seats and sit and wait, as determined by the architecture and the traditional codes generated from it. When the performance begins, every person watches from his/her personal space, as an individual, with minimal interaction with each other despite the fact that they sit elbow to elbow. That is, the event that is supposed to be a collective experience turns into an individual one.\nModern dance may be a good field to look at to understand proxemics. Generally modern dance groups are born at dance studios which do not have fixed seats for an audience. As a result, the choreography does not target one direction, there is no “exit” area for the dancers who step out of the dance, the dancer can enter the action from any point in the space, etc. Dance groups usually present their initial performances in such studios to a small number of spectators who can be seated anywhere in the space which often allows them to see the dancers and each other up-close.\nIf the dance group establishes itself and becomes known, then they will want to perform to more people and will move to a standard building. This will mean that they will be dancing in a three-sided box with entrances and exits mostly from two sides and that they will get viewed from one direction only. That is, the number of choices in the open dance studio will get reduced significantly. As the group “develops,” they move to bigger and more institutional spaces where they get viewed by more people from further distances. In other words, the work and its presenters become “cinematized” and the “human-to-human” aspect diminishes. Standard architecture forces the performance to standardize itself. As the number of viewing eyes increases, the number of choices and the possibilities of doing something new or antithetical decreases.\nIn order to change the space from being “the location of presentation” into “one of the components of the performance” and to enable the practitioners to control the space, I personally think that the artists have to compromise on the number of viewing eyes (therefore, income). When this can be done, then the alternative space choices increase notably.\nThe experiments in the past proved the unavoidability of certain physical requirements by the spectators: they get tired if they stand for a while, they feel uncomfortable if it is cold or hot, they sometimes need to go to the restroom, they don’t like to be touched, they don’t like tiring travels to reach the performance space, etc. As long as these requirements are met, I think every space can accommodate a performance.\nIn the current century all societies have been experiencing the ever increasing dependency on electronic devices. The process of “dehumanization” in communications had begun to devalue the significance of human-to-human interaction. Then, almost like a punishment from the heavens, humans were obliged to physically disconnect from each other as a result of the Covid-19 epidemic of 2020. The performing arts, inevitably, began “going online.”\nIt is still impossible to predict what the world will go through in the near future (as of May 2021, in New York), but I personally believe that the necessity of live interaction among humans has been clearly understood and appreciated. Witnessing the absurd demand for “live” streamings as opposed to recordings, I think the performing arts will go back to live performances as soon as they can and proxemics, sociopetal arrangements and interaction between personal spaces will be considered anew in the light of the lessons learned during the pandemic."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:538b2f47-ebd0-42b6-adfd-df38d4c84cce>","<urn:uuid:34080f2a-96bd-436b-8d84-db0712917f9d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between narcolepsy and Alzheimer's disease in terms of their impact on sleep patterns and cognitive function?","answer":"Narcolepsy and Alzheimer's disease have distinct impacts on sleep and cognition. Narcolepsy primarily affects sleep regulation, causing people to fall into REM sleep randomly during the day, experience irregular sleep cycles, and suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness. It also involves symptoms like sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and cataplexy. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease primarily affects cognitive function, with sleep disturbances being a secondary symptom that typically appears as the disease progresses. Alzheimer's patients experience changes in sleep patterns, often waking up at night, but their primary symptoms include memory loss, difficulty performing familiar tasks, language problems, and eventual loss of basic cognitive abilities.","context":["Alzheimer diseaseSenile dementia - Alzheimer type (SDAT); SDAT; Dementia - Alzheimer\nDementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior.\nThe exact cause of Alzheimer disease is not known. Research shows that certain changes in the brain lead to Alzheimer disease.\nYou are more likely to develop Alzheimer disease if you:\n- Are older -- Developing Alzheimer disease is not a part of normal aging.\n- Have a close relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent with Alzheimer disease.\n- Have certain genes linked to Alzheimer disease.\nThe following may also increase the risk:\n- Being female\n- Having heart and blood vessel problems due to high cholesterol\n- History of head trauma\nThere are two types of Alzheimer disease:\n- Early onset Alzheimer disease -- Symptoms appear before age 60. This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified.\n- Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear.\nAlzheimer disease symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:\n- Emotional behavior or personality\n- Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills)\nAlzheimer disease usually first appears as forgetfulness.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging, and the development of Alzheimer disease. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease.\nSymptoms of MCI include:\n- Difficulty performing more than one task at a time\n- Difficulty solving problems\n- Forgetting recent events or conversations\n- Taking longer to perform more difficult activities\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include:\n- Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines\n- Getting lost on familiar routes\n- Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects\n- Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood\n- Misplacing items\n- Personality changes and loss of social skills\nAs Alzheimer disease becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include:\n- Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night\n- Delusions, depression, and agitation\n- Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving\n- Difficulty reading or writing\n- Forgetting details about current events\n- Forgetting events in one's life history and losing self-awareness\n- Hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior\n- Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger\n- Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences\n- Withdrawing from social contact\nPeople with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer:\n- Recognize family members\n- Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing\n- Understand language\nOther symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease:\n- Problems controlling bowel movements or urine\n- Swallowing problems\nExams and Tests\nA skilled health care provider can often diagnose Alzheimer disease with the following steps:\n- Performing a complete physical exam, including a nervous system exam\n- Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms\n- Mental function tests (mental status examination)\nA diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made when certain symptoms are present, and by making sure other causes of dementia are not present.\nTests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including:\n- Brain tumor\n- Long-term (chronic) infection\n- Intoxication from medicines\n- Severe depression\n- Increased fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus)\n- Thyroid disease\n- Vitamin deficiency\nThe only way to know for certain that someone has Alzheimer disease is to examine a sample of their brain tissue after death.\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. The goals of treatment are:\n- Slow the progression of the disease (although this is difficult to do)\n- Manage symptoms, such as behavior problems, confusion, and sleep problems\n- Change the home environment to make daily activities easier\n- Support family members and other caregivers\nMedicines are used to:\n- Slow the rate at which symptoms worsen, though the benefit from using these drugs may be small\n- Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion\nBefore using these medicines, ask the provider:\n- What are the side effects? Is the medicine worth the risk?\n- When is the best time, if any, to use these medicines?\n- Do medicines for other health problems need to be changed or stopped?\nSomeone with Alzheimer disease will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can help by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems. It is important to make sure the home of a person who has Alzheimer disease is safe for them.\nHaving Alzheimer disease or caring for a person with the condition may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by seeking support through Alzheimer disease resources. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nHow quickly Alzheimer disease gets worse is different for each person. If Alzheimer disease develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly.\nPeople with Alzheimer disease often die earlier than normal, although a person may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after diagnosis.\nFamilies will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care.\nThe final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the person becomes totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or organ failure.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall the provider if:\n- Alzheimer disease symptoms develop or a person has a sudden change in mental status\n- The condition of a person with Alzheimer disease gets worse\n- You are unable to care for a person with Alzheimer disease at home\nAlthough there is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer disease, there are some measures that may help prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer disease:\n- Stay on a low-fat diet and eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.\n- Get plenty of exercise.\n- Stay mentally and socially active.\n- Wear a helmet during risky activities to prevent brain injury.\nKnopman DS.

This does not mean, however, that is a condition that is easy to dismiss.\n- 1 What is Narcolepsy?\n- 2 Narcolepsy Symptoms\n- 3 What Causes Narcolepsy?\n- 4 Diagnosing Narcolepsy\n- 5 Narcolepsy Treatment\n- 6 Conclusion\nWhat is Narcolepsy?\nNarcolepsy is a sleep condition that affects .05% of people in the world, making it a rare condition without reducing its substantial impact on those who suffer from it.\nFolks with narcolepsy are said to suffer from attacks of sleep – which is a simple way of addressing the condition’s impact on a person’s day to day life.\nMore specifically, those who have narcolepsy fall into REM sleep seemingly at random over the course of the day when, a few moments earlier, they could have been entirely awake. It doesn’t matter what that person was doing beforehand, they can’t manage to stay awake.\nYou may find it funny if one of your close friends happens to fall asleep in the middle of your working lunch, but for folks with narcolepsy, even simple tasks like eating or driving can become difficult.\nSometimes, the narcoleptic victim will continue the activity that they were undertaking even while they sleep – such is the case with eating, which is considered an automatic activity. However, if the person in question was driving, they probably won’t be so lucky.\nFolks who experience narcolepsy are also prone to depression, excessive sleepiness, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and the occasional loss of muscle control. Narcolepsy also increases the risk that a person may suffer from increased anxiety or stress.\nThese conditions (excluding depression, which is a more complex topic) stem from a lack of hypocretin in the body.\nHypocretin keeps folks awake and works along with our circadian rhythms in order to keep us up and going during the sunnier hours of the day.\nNarcolepsy symptoms are said to develop when you are a child, but they can be hard to pin down, as said symptoms can be affiliated with a number of other conditions.\nThat said, if you are narcoleptic, you’ll have experienced a number of the following since you were rather young, and you may have been misdiagnosed in the past.\nIrregular Sleep Cycle\nThough it may seem like an obvious symptom, irregular sleep cycles are part and parcel of life with narcolepsy.\nWhile you may find that you fall asleep at seemingly random times of the day, you may also find that you are unable to sleep peacefully through the night.\nWhether this is due to nightmares or simply because you wake up at odd hours, the lack of sleep and the irregularity of a narcoleptic’s sleep cycle contributes to the overall sleepiness its victims may have to deal with.\nThis disrupted sleep cycle comes as a result of narcolepsy’s disruption of a person’s day to day REM cycle.\nREM, it should be noted, is the fourth stage of sleep and the deepest; the acronym stands for “Rapid Eye Movement,” or the twitching of your eyes that occurs when you start to dream.\nWithout this level of sleep, your health is likely to be compromised, and you’ll have an exceptionally difficult time feeling well rested.\nSpeaking of which, one of the other signs of narcolepsy is extreme sleepiness.\nOver the course of a day, a person with narcolepsy may find that they’re moving through something like a mental fog and that completing their responsibilities at work, around the home, or in school is, in turn, quite difficult.\nThis lack of energy is often attributed to laziness, but with narcoleptics, it is a lacking that exceeds the norm.\nThis sleepiness may also result in trouble with a person’s memory, as short terms memories will be more difficult to form due to the victim’s inability to pay attention to their surroundings.\nCataplexy is, in a number of ways, similar to sleep paralysis, a condition which this article will touch on momentarily.\nHowever, cataplexy is far more an extreme version of muscle weakness. Narcoleptics are likely to experience muscle weakness and cataplexy as symptoms of their condition, especially when they’re experiencing strong emotions.\nThis brand of muscle weakness is said to arise when a person is laughing uproariously, crying, or when a person’s mood swings abruptly.\nPerhaps one of the scarier symptoms of narcolepsy is the potential for a victim to start hallucinating. These hallucinations will seem especially real and can impact a person’s sense of smell, taste, sight, and their ability to hear.\nOften, hallucinations are paired with sleep paralysis, but the lack of sleep that a narcoleptic experiences may also result in hallucinations appearing while a person is walking down the street or going about their day to day responsibilities.\nSleep paralysis is the inability to move or speak when awake. This kind of paralysis often occurs when you’re wide awake and can be scary, especially, as mentioned, if it’s paired with hallucinations.\nFolks who suffer from sleep paralysis also report feeling as though there’s a weight resting on their chest.\nFits of sleep paralysis are somewhat unpredictable and can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.\nWhat Causes Narcolepsy?\nUnderstanding narcolepsy can be somewhat difficult, but luckily, all of its potential causes are rooted in a chemical imbalance, making treatment a little easier to handle.\nLow Levels of Hypocretin\nAt the most basic level, narcolepsy is caused by low levels of hypocretin in the brain. Hypocretin, as has been mentioned, is the chemical that keeps us awake and enables us to be active members of society.\nWhen your body doesn’t produce enough hypocretin, or when the receptors in your brain are unable to accept the hypocretin when it arrives, the result is an altered sleep pattern and, in more severe cases, narcolepsy.\nWhat impacts whether or not your body produces enough hypocretin, though, or what prevents your brain from properly assessing the chemical’s influence on your body? Some additional causes are listed below.\nSome sources, including the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, claim that environmental influences like the presence of heavy metals, pesticides, and weed killers can make it more difficult for your brain to process the chemicals that your body makes.\nIn the case of narcolepsy, it’s been proposed that exposure to these kinds of influences would explain why it would be more difficult for a narcoleptic’s brain and body to produce and interpret hypocretin.\nIt has also been proposed that narcolepsy is a genetic disorder, passed on from parent to child. Research in this area is limited, however.\nIt has been determinedly said, though, that genetics alone do not cause narcolepsy – there must be some other influence at play to bring about the inability of a person’s brain or body to work adequately with hypocretin.\nAs such, if you have narcolepsy and are worried about passing it along to your child, don’t put too much weight on the influence of genes.\nReceiving a concussion, developing a tumor, or having a stroke can all limit the brain’s ability to interpret the purpose of hypocretin once it’s been delivered to the brain.\nThese brain injuries are often more environmentally-oriented, of course, so if you’re playing football or trying your hand at parkour, you may want to be cautious.\nBe sure that while seeking out a diagnosis for what you suspect might be narcolepsy, you take into account your family’s history and see whether or not blood clots or different types of cancers run in your family.\nWhile brain injuries are one explanation for narcolepsy, they are more often than not the result of something far more sinister.\nInfections will naturally make you more tired, as your body will be trying to fight off intruding bacteria and thereby using its resources differently.\nHowever, if you find that you have a tendency to become ill frequently or have been diagnosed with any autoimmune diseases, then you may find that narcolepsy will plague you as a secondary condition.\nIt’s possible, should you suffer from frequent infections or an autoimmune disease, that your body won’t be able to produce the sorts of chemicals it needs to function appropriately – or that the white blood cells in your body will begin to attack more than just the invading bacteria.\nIf you find that you are both excessively sleepy and prone to illness, check in with your doctor in order to get a better understanding of what’s going on.\nLower Levels of Histamines\nIn addition to a lack of hypocretin, though, you may find that you have lower levels of histamines in your blood.\nHistamines, like hypocretin, help you stay awake over the course of a day, and their lack can, in turn, result in an increased need for sleep and an inability to focus.\nHere’s a video explaining more on narcolepsy.\nAs has been mentioned, narcolepsy can look, in terms of its symptoms, like a number of other conditions. As such, it can take between ten and fifteen years to properly diagnosis – not in the least because the disorder is so rare.\nMany doctors may misdiagnose narcolepsy as depression, infection, or other sleep disorders – as well as, in children, a learning disorder, seizures, or general laziness.\nIn order to accurately determine whether or not you have narcolepsy, your doctor needs to consider the aforementioned symptoms, your family medical history, and the impact that your environment may have had on your body.\nMost importantly, a doctor will need to assess how much hypocretin your body produces and whether or not your brain can process the chemical.\nSleep studies tend to be exceptionally helpful during the diagnostic stage, though you may be referred to a sleep specialist and have to stay overnight in a medical facility if that is the case.\nThese sleep studies allow medical professionals to get a better understanding of how much REM sleep you are getting and to what degree your body fluctuates from the norm while you rest.\nDetermining a narcolepsy treatment can be somewhat difficult, as the disorder does not have a cure.\nThe symptoms of narcolepsy, however, can be treated, as is discussed below.\nIt may not be a stretch to encourage you to incorporate caffeine into your diet, but folks who suffer from narcolepsy may need more than the average office employee.\nStimulants like caffeine and other prescription medications will help you stay awake over the course of the day – but make sure to stop taking them at least three hours before you want to fall asleep!\nYou may also want to ask your doctor about hypocretin supplements. After a proper diagnosis, it may be possible for you to try and tend to your body’s inability to produce hypocretin through an artificial substitute.\nAs such, you’ll be able to force your brain to acknowledge the presence of hypocretin in your body and thereby stay awake for a more significant part of the day.\nWhile an odd suggestion, some medical professionals believe that because depression and narcolepsy have similar symptoms, the two can be treated with similar medications. As such, your doctor may prescribe anti-depressants in order to treat your narcolepsy.\nThe physical symptoms of depression (as opposed to the mental) mirror narcolepsy and anti-depressants may allow you to find the energy in your day to see to all of your responsibilities.\nSetting a Routine\nAn adjustment to your lifestyle may also help you combat narcolepsy.\nMake sure that you limit your exposure to electronics before bed, and that you try to incorporate some kind of relaxing activity into your nightly routine.\nCoping With Wakefulness\nIf you find that you’re still waking up at odd times in the middle of the night, do your best to stay in bed and try to fall back asleep for at least fifteen minutes.\nIf this does not work, then feel free to get out of bed and engage in some sort of relaxing activity, like reading, or making yourself a cup of warm milk in order to coax yourself back toward sleepiness.\nWhatever you do, though, don’t have your coffee at 3 am – caffeine will be useful to you during the day, but it’s the last thing you want at night!\nHere’s a video explaining more about diagnosing narcolepsy.\nEven though it is rare, narcolepsy is a serious and complex disorder that impacts a significant number of people.\nWhile an entirely effective treatment is yet to be determined, folks who suffer from this disorder can take comfort in understanding it in more detail and by adjusting their lives accordingly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d9e2ac79-dd6f-47b9-a320-a609a7d67278>","<urn:uuid:b76b1036-b1c3-46f9-94d4-d1830fc73601>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how thermography helps in building assessments and what privacy concerns it raises with AI integration? I'm really curious about combining these technologies! 🏠📸","answer":"Thermography is a visual method that uses infrared cameras to detect heat energy patterns in buildings, helping assess thermal performance without destructive testing. It can identify issues like heat loss, missing insulation, thermal bridging, and moisture problems. For effective surveys, specific environmental conditions are needed, such as a temperature difference of at least 5°C between inside and outside, and proper timing to avoid solar radiation. Regarding privacy concerns with AI integration, as sensors and AI become more prevalent in building monitoring, privacy-protective designs are being developed. For example, some smart home monitoring cameras can be configured to disable recording when familiar faces are present, demonstrating that intelligent perceptive devices can deliver valuable capabilities while protecting privacy.","context":["What is thermography?\nThermography is a visual method of illustrating invisible heat energy. This is typically captured using an infrared camera, which displays a map of the temperature variations emitted by all objects with a surface temperature above absolute zero (-273°C).\nObjects are then illustrated as thermal patterns, using different colours or shades of grey depending on the palette selected. The thermal patterns illustrate the variations of heat energy being emitted from the surface of the object.\nThe subsequent interpretation of the thermal patterns requires an understanding of the environmental conditions at the time of capturing the image, as well as surface characteristics of the materials being viewed.\nEmissivity (an object’s ability to emit infrared radiation) and reflectivity (the property of reflecting radiation) are the two characteristics of materials which determine how reliable the thermal pattern is in the image. Materials with high emissivity have a low reflectivity and vice versa.\nOnly materials with a high emissivity provide a reliable reading. This is because materials with a low emissivity have a tendency to reflect the temperature of surrounding objects.\nTypically, materials such as bricks and plaster have a high emissivity, whilst metals and glass have a low emissivity. Given that the fabric of many older buildings will be made up from predominantly high emissivity materials, thermography can be a really useful tool for assessing the fabric of new and existing buildings, in particular retrofitted energy efficiency interventions.\nThermography as a retrofit tool\nThe main advantage of using thermography as a tool is that you can see what is going on under the skin of a building without having to take it apart. Having the ability to see invisible heat energy provides valuable data for assessing thermal performance.\nQuantitative thermographic assessments of heat loss require precise climatic conditions, which rarely occur, particularly in external environments. As a result, typically only qualitative thermographic building surveys provide robust and reliable data.\nQualitative thermographic building surveys can provide many useful insights, such as: the effectiveness of insulation as a barrier to heat loss; occurrences of thermal bridging; sources of air-leakage; moisture and damp; and hidden components, such as pipes and wall ties.\nThere is a clear benefit to using non-destructive infrared thermography in traditional buildings. For example, intrusive investigations – drilling holes or dismantling construction elements – would otherwise be required to identify missing insulation and the location of thermal bridges. Furthermore, air leakage tests only identify that there is air infiltration, not its location. And moisture and damp often goes unnoticed until it appears on the surface.\nHowever, being able to achieve robust and reliable results from qualitative thermography requires professional training and certain environmental conditions to be achieved at the time of the survey.\nGetting the most out of thermography\nBeing able to use an infrared camera and accompanying software, as well as understanding and interpreting thermal images, requires a suitable level of knowledge and experience about the survey process and the building being assessed.\nThe correct survey process includes ensuring that the current environmental conditions are suitable, as this will maximise the accuracy of the data being collected. Although camera technology has improved over the years, along with the process itself, results still depends on the type of building fabric being surveyed. Therefore having knowledge and experience about building materials and construction methods are an essential prerequisite for a successful survey.\nThe criteria for the environmental conditions also vary depending on whether an internal or external thermographic survey is required. The latter is more challenging. For example, external surveys require: no solar radiation on the surface before and during the survey; no precipitation before and during the survey; a temperature difference between the inside and outside the building of at least 5°C – more commonly 10°C – is recommended; and wind speeds of no more than 10 meters per second (m/s), or preferably 6 m/s are recommended. And the length of time with no solar radiation and precipitation prior to undertaking a survey depend on the absorptance (the effectiveness of absorbing heat energy) of the building material.\nTo overcome the need to avoid solar radiation, many experts currently recommend undertaking thermographic surveys in the dark, although others suggest that a cold overcast day is sufficient. It is also often advocated that thermographic surveys should only be undertaken in the winter, which could be a significant limitation to its use.\nHowever, in my previous work I have achieved reliable results to identify thermal bridging using thermography during the early hours of the morning during the summer. The most important consideration is taking due account of the environmental conditions during interpretation.\nInternal surveys have fewer restrictions. With the exception of temperature, most of the criteria used for external climatic conditions do not apply. However, the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the building is critical for both internal and external thermographic surveys. Subject to the restrictions imposed by the resolution of the infrared camera, the greater the temperature difference, the better the detail that is visible in the thermal image.\nCamera resolution is critical for undertaking thermographic surveys of building fabric, particularly when needing to capture a whole façade. Sometimes it is also necessary to use a wide angle lens. And occasionally images have to be stitched together, depending on the size of the building. The cost of cameras rises significantly in line with increases of the resolution, as well as with the addition of any accessories, which can be a further significant limitation.\nBut despite this, one great advantage of using thermography during retrofit is for communicating what has been done. Capturing the whole façade before and after insulating is a great way of visually highlighting the improvements that have been made. More detailed and close up images are also useful for identifying any gaps and subsequent thermal bridging.\nWhen interpreting thermal images taken inside the building, colours representing cold areas are an indication of heat loss. Whereas for external thermal images, it is the colours representing warm and hot areas that are an indication of heat loss. These areas of heat loss can be either expected as part of the design, or unexpected and indicating a potential problem. Issues could include inappropriate installation, poor workmanship, or other unforeseen consequences.\nFollowing a series of complaints by residents approximately 12 months after they had received retrofitted external wall insulation (EWI) to their homes, the Carbon Trust was commissioned to undertake an independent investigation using thermography. The residents’ concerns centred on feeling colder and experiencing draughts since the EWI had been installed, as well as the quality of the installations.\nThe homes are of non-traditional British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF) construction and required extensive structural repairs as part of the retrofit works. To ensure structural issues were addressed appropriately, the installer commissioned a structural engineering consultancy to develop detailed designs for the replacement of structural elements, at the same time as incorporating the EWI. These designs also aimed to address the requirement for a continuous covering of EWI to minimise the occurrence of thermal bridging, wherever possible.\nA visual inspection indicated that the installations had been undertaken to a high standard. However, it was observed that the plinth (base) of the external walls had not been insulated and the installer advised that it had not been possible to insulate lofts due to the risk of asbestos. The funding did not allow for these locations to be insulated, as it would have significantly increased the costs of installing EWI to the main structure of the dwellings.\nNot insulating the plinths appears to have resulted in the solid concrete ground floor slab providing a passage for heat loss from the building. This meant that there was a significantly lower air temperature recorded at this level when compared to waist level. This was compounded by the decision not to insulate the loft, which meant that the roof was also a source of significant heat loss. When combined these two factors appeared to have provided the ideal conditions for creating air movement through the building, which were the draughts the residents were experiencing.\nTaking a whole-house approach, rather than just focusing on installing EWI, may have prevented this from occurring.\nA version of this article first appeared in the Institute of Historic Building Conservation Journal’s 2017 special issue on green retrofit.\nAbout the author\nDr Jo Atkinson leads the Carbon Trust’s housing-related work. Jo is an architectural technologist and qualified thermographer. Her doctorate focused on the evaluation of retrofitted external wall insulation, where she developed a methodology for assessing its construction quality, which included the use of thermography.","Edge AI and Privacy\nAs sensors and AI proliferate in our devices and our environment, people are understandably concerned about the potential erosion of privacy.

{"question":"Hello! Could you please tell me when was 3D graphics first introduced into computer gaming?","answer":"3D graphics was introduced into computer gaming in 1996 when ID Software released Quake. After this, Microsoft joined to help develop the computer gaming experience in a Windows environment.","context":["Defining 3-D Computer Graphics\n3- D computer graphics is a field of computer science dealing with displaying 3-dimensional objects in a two dimension space for example on a screen. They utilize a three- dimension representation using geometry which is typically stored in digital computer read only.\nReal life objects are entered into the computer and converted to 3-D graphics using special software. Almost the same algorithms like that of 2-D are used to make the 3-D graphics except for some few added features.\nThe creation of computer graphics as one of the visualization tools has been in use by government agencies and corporate engineers for research centers since the 1950’s. Computer graphics has evolved in a relatively short amount of time.\nThe universities like the University of Utah, MIT, Ohio State, North Carolina, and New York Institute of Technology in the 1960’s later developed it more. In the 1970’s computer graphics expanded into the television world as motion pictures and broadcast video graphics.\nBack then polygon meshes were used to represent the objects. The problem was that the pictures were flat and shaded which made for very unrealistic 3-dimension pictures. The solution to that was to create smaller polygons. Shading then presents the images where color applied uniformly to the polygons.\nThe Computer Image Corporation (CIC) developed advanced hardware and software systems like ANIMAC, CAESAR, and, SCANIMATE, which worked by scanning the artwork, then later manipulating it. In 1971 the microprocessor using integrated circuits assisted in the development of the graphics.\nThis advancement in technology led to the early rise of 3-D animation. These software systems could make it stretch, spin, fly, and squash around the screen. Companies that used this technology are Boeing and Bell Labs. In 1975, Mandelbrot described Fractal Geometry which created realistic natural phenomena like mountains, wood grain, coastlines, and others.\nIn the 1990s companies like Apple Computers, George Lucas Industrial Light, and Magic are always making and improving the computer graphic technology so as to give the world with a false digital reality. Films emerged like Terminator 2, Beauty and The Beast, Batman and Jurassic Park which significantly used 3-D images to bring contrast and blend with the hand-drew characters.\nIn 1996, ID Software released Quake which introduced 3-D graphics in gaming. The Microsoft also joined to form the computer gaming experience in a Windows environment. Currently, we have real-time radiosity, real-time Ray-tracing, hologram and Global Illumination which is also real-time. The future holds on creating physically-based realism.\nIn 3-D we use three coordinates which are X, Y, and Z Rendering and Algorithm. The components of computer graphics are the hardware, software and the application part of it. The hardware has the CPU, GPU, and other components. The software, on the other hand, has 2D,3D, algorithm and Z-Buffering.\nLastly, the application has games, films, and simulation., It has an added advantage than two-D has it adds depth to its property more than the position, color and brightness. It also has a 3-D surface on it which is called texture. In advanced methods, 3-D graphics has sophisticated techniques like ray tracing that applies realistic shadows to the motion pictures or objects.\nThe computer feeds the 3-D models by scanning and taking photographs of real world objects. The models are then formed using points called vertices. Vertices define the shape of models and thus create polygons Converting 3-D information into bit map is known as rendering.\nRendering requires a tremendous amount of processing power and memory. Therefore, a very powerful computer is needed. In the past, this was only possible in special workstations, but nowadays due to technological advancement, it can be found in personal computers.\nComputer graphics have building blocks in them which collectively work to produce a masterpiece. There is the first one which we call primitive. These are the basic geometrical shapes that help in computer graphics construction.\nEach one of them has attributes like size, color, line, and width. Examples of the primitives are a line, circle, eclipse, arc, text, polyline, spline, and polygon.\n2. Lighting Models\nComprehensively lighting models, the second building block also assists in the display of 3-D graphics.\nIt has positional light and directional light. Positional light is locating a light source close to the viewing area. The rays of positional light are not parallel. Directional light is the use light source located at a point of infinity. Here the light rays are parallel.\nThe third part of the building blocks is the color. This building block is the most important of them all. In the color part, we have the primary and secondary colors. Color helps determine the contrast.\n4. Texture Mapping\nTexture mapping is the last building block. It is the same as when you are wrapping paper. Maps rendering is one of the ways of using computers which display the earth surface as if it was the real earth surface.\nThere are different types of projections:\n1.) Parallel projections- They are good for exact measurement. Here the parallel lines remain parallel, and angles do not preserve it.\n2.) Orthographic projection- Here the direction of the projection is normal to the projection of the plane. There are three types of orthographic projection: Frontal, top and side projection\n3.) Oblique Projection- It has cavalier projection and cabinet forecasts.\n4.)Perspective Projection- The distance from the center of projection to project plane is finite, and size varies with the distance. There are three perspective projections: One point, Two points, and Three point perspective.\n5.) Translation- In translation the Z coordinates are transferred along the X and Y coordinates.\n3-D computer graphics is in the medical field, architectural, biological, meteorological, filming industry, and many others.\nThe use in the medical field is in radiography field like U-T scanning, X-Rays, and others.\nIn architecture, 3-D graphics are used to draw the blueprint of the building and show details how the building looks upon completion.\nIn meteorology, it can be used to model changes in the atmosphere and expected weather patterns.\nLastly in filming computer graphics can be used to make animations, 3-D films and even in sports to add glamor to the live images.\nThe 3-D computer graphics continues to advance as time passes. The future looks bright for 3-D animation, in sporting, Virtual Reality (VR), communication especially the video calls and even the advanced hologram."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:076294d4-0839-4669-94f5-ef55f9f8fca1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"The Franklin's Gull on Farallon Island in Sept 2008 was rare - how does this compare with its typical migration patterns in Nebraska during the same season?","answer":"The Franklin's Gull sighting on Farallon Island was indeed rare, as it was noted as 'a first-year Franklin's Gull' that was 'another very rare bird on the island.' In contrast, in Nebraska, Franklin's Gulls are abundant regular fall migrants, with peak numbers occurring during late September and early October. The species can appear in very large numbers in Nebraska during fall migration, with recorded counts as high as 300,000 at Calamus Reservoir on September 29, 2002. The arrival of fall migrants in Nebraska typically begins by late June, building into August, with numbers declining rapidly into November.","context":["As far as bird vagrants go, this fall has been nothing short of spectacular. On 25-August, just a few days after our arrival, an intern stated that he had found and photographed a Gray-tailed Tattler in Sea Pigeon Gulch. We all got great looks at it a half hour later at East Landing when it flew up calling its diagnostic \"chuweet-chuweet-chuweet\" several times in the company of 2 Wanderings. This is a Siberian species with only a single previously accepted record for California that occurred in 1981. While this bird was in the company of the Wanderings, it was clearly paler gray with more restricted gray on the sides, and it had more conspicuous pale spots on its tertials. The nasal groove was about 2/3 the length of the bill, which is considered a better characteristic for Wandering Tattler. The nasal groove on a Gray-tailed Tattler should be less than half the length of the bill. The call has been stated by many to override the other features so it will be interesting to see how the California Bird Records Committee (CBRC) handles this bird. We also had a Semipalmated Sandpiper from Aug 23 to Aug 24.\nDuring a migrant gull survey, we found a second year Laughing Gull mixed into the Western Gulls. This is only the 4th island record. On 16-Sept, we found a first-year Franklin's Gull during a gull count, another very rare bird on the island. In late summer, we mostly see California Gulls on this survey, but also a few Heermann’s and Ring-billed. Most of the juvenile California Gulls out here have an interesting peach phase plumage with varying amounts of pale peach color on their underparts and head and occasionally scattered on their back. For some reason, this plumage is far more common at sea than on the coast. The answer seems as though it should be due to wear or bleaching, but all the feathers look fresh. In October, gull diversity usually picks up when we get an influx of Herring, Glaucous-winged, and Thayer’s Gulls.\nOn Sept 3rd, we had poor looks at a bird on the Terrace he thought may have been a Baird’s Sparrow. We relocated it a few hours later under the Coast Guard Trees. One intern tried to flush it into the net, but it kept bouncing out. He eventually got photos of it perched in the trees (see attached photo). This species breeds in grasslands of the northern Great Plains and winters in grasslands from SE Arizona to Texas; there probably aren't many records of this species in trees. Because they are cryptic and skulky, they are very difficult to observe in their native winter/stopover habitat. On the Farallones where land and vegetation are limited, they are relatively easy to find and relocate. This was only the 4th record for the island and just the 5th for California.\nWe found and banded a Red-eyed x Philadelphia Vireo the next day; a first for the island and possibly the first west of the Rocky Mts. This was not an easy bird to identify and required an in-hand analysis of the length of its 10th primary feather (p10) relative to its primary coverts. Its p10 was >5 mm shorter than its primary coverts. The similar appearing eastern Warbling Vireo would have had a p10 that was longer than the primary coverts. In our opinion, the plumage and structure of this bird were halfway between a Red-eyed and Philadelphia Vireo. All the in-hand measurements were right in between these two species. The flat, sloping forehead met the bill at a relatively acute angle that reminded us a lot of a Red-eyed or a Yellow-green Vireo rather than a Philadelphia, and it had a dark eyeline and lateral crown stripe. None of these characteristics are good for Philadelphia, but the bird was too small for a Red-eyed or Yellow-green. We feel fairly confident in this bird’s ID, but would appreciate input from others.\nThe first of 3 Eastern Kingbirds showed up on the 8th. The first of 4 Blue-headed Vireos showed up on the 9th along with a Canada Warbler. A nice wave of eastern birds arrived on the 10th, but nothing too unusual except for a briefly seen Bay-breasted Warbler. The next day from the lighthouse, two of us got great looks at 3 Chimney Swifts flying below us. We also had the island high count of Ovenbirds with 5. On the 13th, we were lucky to catch and band a Merlin (a female taiga). A few minutes later we found a Yellow-billed Cuckoo in the cave on the back side of Corm Blind Hill. A crew change the next day brought a truly spectacular fallout with 103 species of migrants and at least 8 more resident species for a total of 111 species. Highlights for the day were Golden-winged and Virginia's Warbler at the lighthouse, another Baird's Sparrow on the Terrace, a Mourning Warbler in the Heligoland Tree, and 2 Black Swifts over the lighthouse. The highest species count for the island, set back in the 1980’s, was 117 during late October.\nOn the 15th, an intern was doing an area search at Sea Pigeon Point and had what appeared to be a dark-morph Wedge-tailed Shearwater (1st island record if accepted by CBRC) fly in off the ocean and fly several laps over his head. The bird flew with deep, languid wing strokes that were reminiscent of a frigatebird (a good characteristic for this species). It appeared long-billed and long-tailed, but its tail length was difficult to judge because it was molting its central rectrices. There are only seven records of this tropical species for California. There is some debate, though, as to the ID of this bird because its plumage looked very similar to that of a Sooty Shearwater.\nOn the 17th, we found the island's 2nd Blue-winged Warbler on Corm Blind Hill. It was a neat looking bird in that it probably has a bit of Golden-winged genes in its distant past. The mask extended back a little further than a typical BWWA with a little downward curl at the posterior end of the mask. Other than that, it looked just like an adult male BWWA. Amongst the small wave on the 20th was a Black-throated Sparrow and a Vesper Sparrow. We've also found a few other odd birds such as a hybrid Blue-winged Teal x something, and a Western Kingbird with a huge bill and strong face pattern.\nIn addition to birds, the calm conditions we experienced also brought migratory hoary bats out to the island. Calm conditions combined with a new moon often bring bats in September and we found 10 on the 10th.\nLately, we’ve been recording numerous whales around the island. From the 17th to the 20th there was a large feeding flock consisting of thousands of shearwaters and dozens of humpback whales. The humpbacks were frequently observed breaching and fin slapping. As if in response to this loud commotion, whales were frequently observed traveling towards the feeding flock. I wonder if the breaching and fin slapping whales are communicating the food news to others to help them cooperatively hunt their prey.\nIn the future, if the internet is working, we will try to provide daily updates of bird migration and other stuff we’re seeing. Yesterday was a foggy day that did not allow many birds to find their way to the island. The only arrivals were a Great Blue Heron, Western Wood-Pewee, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Townsend’s Warbler, Common Yellowthroat, and a Fox Sparrow.\nLocation: Southeast Farallon Island\nObservation date: 9/27/08\nNumber of species: 27\nBrown Pelican X\nBrandt's Cormorant X\nPelagic Cormorant X\nGreat Blue Heron 1\nPeregrine Falcon (Continental) 2\nWandering Tattler 7\nBlack Turnstone 62\nWestern Sandpiper 2\nLeast Sandpiper 4\nHeermann's Gull 47\nCalifornia Gull 538\nWestern Wood-Pewee 1\nBlack Phoebe 7\nSay's Phoebe 1\nRed-breasted Nuthatch 3\nHouse Wren 1\nBlue-gray Gnatcatcher 1\nYellow-rumped Warbler (Myrtle) 1\nTownsend's Warbler 2\nPalm Warbler (Western) 1\nCommon Yellowthroat 1\nChipping Sparrow 10\nSavannah Sparrow 3\nFox Sparrow (Sooty) 1\nRose-breasted Grosbeak 1\nThis report was generated automatically by eBird v2(http://ebird.org)","Status: Abundant regular spring and fall migrant statewide.

This increase since 2000 may reflect a recovery from an estimated 90% decline in the breeding population 1960-2000 (Olsen and Larsson 2004); the decline may, however, be overestimated due to difficulties accessing breeding colonies (Burger and Gochfeld 2020).\nSpring: Feb 23, 24, 25 <<<>>> summer\nEarlier dates are 19 Feb 2011 Lancaster Co, 20 Feb 2016 Harlan Co, 20 Feb 2016 Lancaster Co, 20 Feb 2021 Lake McConaughy, Keith Co, and 21-22 Feb 2012 Lancaster Co.\nUsually arrival is in the latter half of Mar, although a few arrive earlier. Peak numbers occur during the second half of Apr and most have passed through by the end of May.\n- High counts: 20,000 at Lincoln Saline Wetlands Park, Lancaster Co 22 Apr 2015, 12,592 at Branched Oak Lake, Lancaster Co 20 Apr 2013, “tens of thousands” in western Douglas Co 19 Apr 2013, and 6000 at Marsh Wren Community Wetlands, Lancaster Co 10 Apr 2020.\nSummer: There are two breeding records from Garden Co 1965 and 1966. In 1965, 30 nesting pairs were present at Smith Lake 7-11 Jun, and two nests were located 7-11 Jun (Sharpe and Payne 1966). A further four nests were reported from Garden Co 2-9 Jun 1966 (Sharpe 1967). The nearest regular breeding is in northeast South Dakota (Tallman et al 2002).\nThere are many reports of Franklin’s Gulls during Jun-Jul and flocks during this period are often comprised of a high proportion of immature non-breeding birds. High counts include as many as 730 at Lake McConaughy, Keith Co 20 Jun 2004, and 158 there 15 Jun 2003, about one third of which were in first alternate plumage, the rest alternate adults.

See Winter for later reports.\nArrival of fall migrants begins by late Jun, building into Aug and achieving peak numbers during late Sep and early Oct. First to appear are probably immature non-breeders and non- or failed breeding adults, as departure from colonies usually begins around mid-Jul and molt from juvenile plumage can begin as early as Jul (Burger and Gochfeld 2020). As many as 650 were at Sutherland Reservoir as early as 15 Jul 2016.\nNumbers in Nebraska decline rapidly into Nov, but there are several reports into Dec, including a few reports of alternate adults.

Similarly, the Cynics, through Diogenes's example, advocated for extreme simplicity and self-sufficiency, believing that reducing desires to only basic necessities was key to achieving virtue. Both philosophies agreed that simple living could satisfy physical needs - though the Cynics took this to a more extreme level, with Diogenes discarding even basic implements like bowls when he saw they weren't strictly necessary.","context":["Stoicism is an Ancient Greek school of philosophy founded in Athens. It is based on personal ethics, a system of logic and seeing the world as it is, not as you want it to be.\nThe Stoics differentiated between 3 things: good, bad, and indifferent things.\n- The good things include the cardinal virtues wisdom, justice, courage, and self-discipline.\n- The bad things include the opposites of these virtues, the four vices folly, injustice, cowardice, and indulgence.\n- Indifferent things include all the rest and its opposite: wealth and poverty, health and sickness, pleasure and pain, material things…\nThe most important concept of Stoicism is to draw the line between what is in your control and what is not. There are only so many things you can control in life, and a lot of things you cannot. Learn to live with that reality and to make the most out of it.\nThe main reason Stoicism has regained in popularity over the past years is because in a world of constant evolution, temptation and conflict, Stoicism helps bringing stability, simplicity, and peace of mind. It only asks you to focus on what you can control, to reason with logic, and to ignore everything else.\nI recently started reading more about Stoicism, and have come across a lot of quotes from the 3 most famous Stoics: Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Seneca. In this article, I present my favourite quotes from them.\n“The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own . . .”\nThis takes us back to the number one principle in Stoic philosophy: focus on what you can control, let go of the rest. I was actually working on this myself before begin introduced to Stoicism, and it is such an important rule in life.\nWorrying, arguing or fighting over things that are completely independent of your control is a huge waste of time and energy. As a recent example, think of all the people who had their summer plans crushed because of the Coronavirus outbreak. All the cancelled flights, trips, the lost money… There’s absolutely nothing you can do to change that, so the only way out is to move on. In the case of Corona, it’s true not just for you but for a lot of people, so it’s even easier to see the obvious: you can’t change this.\n“If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be furious. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along, so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled — have you no shame in that?”\nEspecially in our fast-spending capitalism world, so much of our mind and opinion are controlled by ads, TV spots, the news, social media… It gets even more problematic when people are convinced that their opinion is based solely on what they think they know, that they came to their own conclusions without any external influence. This couldn’t be further from the truth.\nYour Facebook feed is designed to only show you things you agree with, support, and relate to. The same goes for Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest… If we’re only shown things we agree with, when is our mind being challenged? When do we learn to think on our own, to reason and analyse? Well for the most part, we don’t anymore.\nWe give people and organisations the power to control our minds and we want freedom at the same time. Social media nurtures the hugest cognitive bias of the modern world: the confirmation bias. The tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information that confirms or supports one’s prior personal beliefs or values, without challenging any of it. If you favour this political party, you’ll only see ads for this party, and you won’t question anything outside of this option anymore.\nLearn to open your mind to new horizons, challenge what you think you know, don’t let external factors dictate your mind what to think.\n“Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately consider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when you see that, you’ll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or rage. For you may yourself have the same notions of good and evil, or similar ones, in which case you’ll make an allowance for what they’ve done. But if you no longer hold the same notions, you’ll be more readily gracious for their error.”\n— Marcus Aurelius\nTrying to understand the people who hurt and/or annoy you can have a huge impact on your life. It’s so much easier to be grumpy and remorseful in life, than it is to be happy and compassionate. Most of us choose the easy option.\nLearn to see the bright side in people, even the ones you assume only hold negative energy. A core principle of Stoicism is also that everything happens for a reason. People are not mean just for the sake of being mean. This is not how it works. People are mean because they hold a certain amount of pain inside themselves. Everybody goes through hardships, things they don’t understand. Everybody gets hurt, or blindsided, once in a while.\nWhether you start looking for beauty in people, or try to understand why people do things, it will help you deal with the ones causing you trouble in your life, and it will help alleviate part of your own pain.\n“Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multiple of that, keep in mind that no one ever loses a life other than the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the one they are losing. The longest and the shortest life, then, amount to the same, for the present moment lasts the same for all and is all anyone possesses. No one can lose either the past or the future, for how can someone be deprived of what’s not theirs?”\n— Marcus Aurelius\nMemories are in the past. Future is uncertain. Present is right here, right now. Our world spins so fast, it’s so easy to forget to enjoy the moment. Of course you should plan your future, have goals, and aspire to do things in life. But once in a while, remember to focus on the present.\nFocusing on the present helps removing worries, even just for a little bit. Don’t think of yesterday. Don’t anticipate tomorrow. Just focus on this very moment right now.\n“You are not your body and hair-style, but your capacity for choosing well. If your choices are beautiful, so too will you be.”\nBeautiful people are beautiful because they make beautiful decisions, not because they spend 1 hour in front of the mirror every morning. When you are aware of your decisions and how they align with your values, that’s when you’ll find beauty and serenity. You are the choices you make, so choose wisely.\n“People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or in the mountains. You are very much in the habit of yearning for those same things. But this is entirely the trait of a base person, when you can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself. For nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than in your own soul — especially if on close inspection it is filled with ease, which I say is nothing more than being well-ordered. Treat yourself often to this retreat and be renewed.”\nWe always look for the next weekend getaway to finally be able to relax, the next vacation to let go of our worries. But the truth is, peace of mind can be reached much sooner. You can travel anytime by sitting down, closing your eyes, and focusing on your breathing.\nWhen you take 5 to 10 minutes to meditate in the morning, you create your own little retreat. You don’t need to go anywhere. When you feel overwhelmed during the day, stop everything for a minute and focus on your breathing. Let go.\nThis constant need for getaways also comes from a pervasive modern urge to escape. We want to run away from our responsibilities, the people we avoid, a place we dislike, because it feels like everything is too fast, too scary to deal with.\nWhen you take time to breathe and meditate, you will not only regain energy to face and deal with your day-to-day obstacles, you will also realise that a lot of these obstacles are only created by yourself. You feel the need to avoid people because you set your mind to think his way. You dislike this place because you chose to. Try to change your angle.\n“First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, then do what you have to do. For in nearly every pursuit we see this to be the case. Those in athletic pursuit first choose the sport they want, and then do that work.”\nHow many of us go about life without a plan? How many of us go about our day out of habit, without ever questioning the reality we set up for ourselves? Have you ever wondered what you wanted to do, who you wanted to be, before following the path you’re on? Do you know where you’re going?\nLeon Tec said: “A sailor without a destination cannot hope for a favourable wind”. First choose your destination, then adjust your sails. You don’t control the wind, the waves, and other external factors. Stoicism’s first principle tells us to focus on what we can control. It also tells us to focus on the present, which is a lot easier and more enjoyable when we know where we’re going.\nHaving a plan helps worrying less about the future, because even though you don’t know what will come your way, you know you will do everything in your power to get where you want to get. Nobody know how this will play out, but you can stack the odds in your favour.\nIf you feel like life is passing you by, if you feel caught in a storm of priorities, responsibilities and people, and if you’re losing your bearings, go back to basics. Ask yourself: what person do I want to become? Then, list down the actions you have to perform in order to become that person. Do what you have to do.\n“We like to say that we don’t get to choose our parents, that they were given by chance — yet we can truly choose whose children we’d like to be.”\nYou don’t choose where you were born, who your parents are, where you grew up. We all have to play with the cards we are dealt in life, and there’s no point in cheating, complaining, or quitting the game. Are you a product of your environment, or can you take responsibility for it and start shaping your environment?\nMany successful people in this world would have never gotten where they are today if they had decided to let their environment shape them too much. You don’t choose your cards, but you choose how you play them. In any game, there is wiggle room for luck, and that can drastically change the course of things for anyone. Stoics tells us to acknowledge luck, but never rely on it. Know that it might come your way to help you one day, but never ask anything of it.\nFocus on becoming the child you want to be, that’s all you can do. The rest will happen.\nFinally, one quote that speaks for itself.\n“You must build up your life action by action, and be content if each one achieves its goal as far as possible — and no one can keep you from this. But there will be some external obstacle! Perhaps, but no obstacle to acting with justice, self-control, and wisdom. But what if some other area of my action is thwarted? Well, gladly accept the obstacle for what it is and shift your attention to what is given, and another action will immediately take its place, one that better fits the life you are building.”\n— Marcus Aurelius\nBuild your life. Deal with the obstacles. Keep going.\nAnd remember to enjoy the journey.","Diogenes of Sinope (412 or 399 B.C.E. – 323 B.C.E.) was an ancient Greek philospher and one of the founders of the Cynics. He was exiled from Sinope for adulterating the currency and went to Athens, where he became a follower of Antisthenes. Taking the precept that “virtue is the only good, all else is evil,” he practiced a life of ascetic self-sufficiency. He was known for his blatant disregard for social niceties and for the abrasive manner in which he spoke to people. Diogenes lived for a time in a tub, and wore only a cloak and carried a staff and a wallet containing his food, attire that became a Cynic trademark. He emphasized action over words and thoughts, and disparaged theoretical philosophy, mathematics, astronomy and metaphysics as being removed from reality. Many colorful and amusing stories are told about him. He is credited with establishing the tradition of Cynicism that was carried on by Crates and later became a foundation for Stoicism.\nDiogenes was held in high esteem by the people, who honored him at his death with a tombstone bearing a dog—an animal to which he often compared himself.\nDiogenes was born in Sinope (Sinop in modern-day Turkey) about 412 B.C.E. (according to other sources 399 B.C.E.). The primary source for information on Diogenes is the Lives of Eminent Philosophers written by Diogenes Laertius around 400 C.E. Diogenes was exiled from Sinope for adulterating the coinage; one account says that his father was a money changer and defiled the coinage, another that he directed Diogenes to do it, and another that Diogenes went to an oracle who instructed him to defile the coinage. Numismatic evidence shows that the currency of Sinope was adulterated, but it is not certain that this was done by Diogenes.\nUpon arriving in Athens, Diogenes encountered Antisthenes. According to Lives, Antisthenes did not accept pupils and tried to repel Diogenes, but he persisted. On one occasion Antisthenes threatened to hit him with a heavy stick, but Diogenes said, \"Strike, for you will not find any stick hard enough to drive me away as long as you continue to speak.\" Diogenes took Antisthenes’ precept that “virtue is the only good,” and followed him in an ascetic lifestyle intended to liberate the soul from the deceptive influences of pleasure, luxury and fame. Diogenes’ determination to live simply and completely in accordance with nature led him to extremes. As training, he walked barefoot in the cold and rolled in hot sand during the summer. He observed a mouse running around, “not seeking for a bed, nor taking care to keep in the dark, nor looking for any of those things which appear enjoyable to such an animal,” and realized that he also had no need of the things which ordinary people considered necessities of life. He threw away his bowl after he observed a child drinking water from his cupped hands, and his spoon when he observed a boy scooping up lentils with a piece of flat bread, because he no longer needed them. He doubled up his cloak to sleep in it, carried his food in a wallet, and carried out his daily activities wherever he happened to be at the time. Diogenes Laertius relates that he often pointed to public buildings and remarked \"that the Athenians had built him places to live in.\" When the people reproached him because, contrary to common etiquette, he ate in the marketplace—he replied that the marketplace was where he felt hungry. When a landlord delayed in preparing a small cottage for him, Diogenes instead took up residence in a cask that belonged to the Temple of Cybele.\nMany anecdotes concern repartee between Diogenes and Plato, and between Diogenes and Alexander the Great, and illustrate his deliberate disregard for fame and political power. Diogenes’ manner was direct and sometimes abrasive, and his behavior earned him the nickname “dog.” He referred to himself numerous times as a dog, and the dog later became a symbol for the Cynics. Lives reports, however, that Diogenes was very persuasive, and that his followers refused to leave him.\nDiogenes apparently spent a part of his life as a slave in Corinth. On a voyage to Aegina he was captured by pirates and sold as a slave in Crete. Being asked his trade by the auctioneer, he replied, “governing men,” and, pointing out a Corinthian named Xeniades, said \"Sell me to that man; for he wants a master.” He lived in Corinth until his death, and became tutor to the two sons of Xeniades and manager of the household. Lives relates that he educated the two sons to live an austere life and to be well-rounded both in their studies and in practical matters.\nDiogenes died in 323 B.C.E. at Corinth, according to Diogenes Laërtius, on the day on which Alexander the Great died at Babylon. There are several accounts of his death; one, that he ate a raw ox’s foot; another, that he was bitten by a dog and died several days later; and a third, that he held his breath until he suffocated. He was buried by the elders of the city, and a pillar bearing a dog in white marble was placed on his grave.\nDiogenes Laertius says that several works are attributed to Diogenes of Sinope, but that there is no certainty that he was the author of any of them. None of the written works of the early Cynics have survived, and their ethics and philosophical thought have to be understood through the anecdotes and repartee reported by later writers. The concise wit and the humor of these stories suggest that they were polished and embellished from many retellings, and that many are probably exaggerations. Of the three founding Cynics, Antisthenes, Diogenes and Crates, Diogenes is considered to have been the most radical and the one who laid down a substantial foundation for the Cynic tradition.\nDiogenes of Sinope was concerned mainly with ethics, and made himself a living example of his teachings. Lives quotes him as saying that a chorus master has to sing in a louder voice to set the tone for everyone else; in other words, he was setting a standard for others to follow. The primary tenet of the Cynics was that “virtue is the only good, all else is evil.” The aim of a Cynic was to attain virtue in this earthly life by adjusting his or her values and desires to be completely in accord with nature. Diogenes Laertius reports that he lived,” deferring in all things rather to the principles of nature than to those of law.”\nThe Cynics valued three types of freedom, self-sufficiency, freedom of will, and freedom of speech. The first freedom, self-sufficiency, was brought about through living a life of simplicity and asceticism, thus reducing desire to only those things which were necessary for human subsistence. Both the Stoics and the Epicureans later adopted a similar stance, that a person could easily satisfy his physical needs if he kept them simple. Diogenes valued humble labor, and spoke about the need to train both the body and the mind, because a weak body could not act in pursuit of virtue. He often advocated eating a simple diet in order to maintain a healthy body, and mocked the overindulgence of the wealthy.\nFreedom of will included both having a correct understanding of virtue, and having freedom from any kind of political affiliation or social obligation. Diogenes was careful to avoid any association with a politically powerful person, which might compromise his integrity. Diogenes Laertius recounts several conversations with Alexander the Great which illustrate that Diogenes did not encourage any kind of patronage. The most famous is his response, when Alexander the Great offered to do anything Diogenes asked of him: “Step out of my sunlight.” (You’re blocking my light.)\nFreedom of speech meant the freedom to speak frankly, without fear of punishment or of judgment by one’s audience. Diogenes went about correcting people and pointing out their follies. His own ascetic and self-disciplined lifestyle gave him the authority to criticize others for being self-indulgent or immoral. His lack of political obligations left him free to comment on civic affairs without fear of reprisal. On several occasions when his provocations occasioned some kind of violence against him, he received the support of the Athenian people who recognized the injustice that had been done to him.\nDiogenes clearly believed that accomplishments during this earthly life held much more importance than any reliance on an afterlife.\nDiogenes had little interest in science, metaphysics, theoretical philosophy, or the syllogisms and sophisms which were common among philosophers of his time. He said that, “mathematicians kept their eyes fixed on the sun and moon, and overlooked what was under their feet.” When a man was speaking about heavenly bodies and meteors, he asked, \"Pray, how many days is it since you came down from heaven?\" He was a nominalist, believing only in the reality of what could be perceived by the senses. He told Plato that he could see a cup, but not “cupness,” and Plato replied that Diogenes was not yet ready to see “cupness.” On one occasion Plato attempted a definition of a human being as “a two-footed, featherless animal.” Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it to Plato, saying, “This is Plato’s man.” The story goes on to say that Plato added, “with broad nails,” to his definition.\nDiogenes used dialogue and rhetoric mainly for the purpose of exposing the weaknesses of those with whom he was conversing. Lives states, “A man once proved to him syllogistically that he had horns, so he put his hand to his forehead and said, \"I do not see them.” And in a similar manner he replied to one who had been asserting that there was no such thing as motion, by getting up and walking away.”\nAlthough he attacked Greek culture and the values of the society in which he lived, Diogenes valued virtue and moral integrity very highly. Like his student Crates, Diogenes seemed to have a vocation to provoke others into elevating their understanding of moral value, and for promoting virtue in others. A famous anecdote relates that he walked around with a lamp in the daylight, saying that he was searching for a true man. He wondered why men competed with each other by kicking and punching, and not by emulating virtue. He belittled athletes, saying that they were made mostly of beef and pork. To a young man who said he did not think he was fit to be a philosopher, Diogenes asked, “Why live, if you can’t live well?” He remarked that musicians were anxious to perfectly tune their instruments, but left the habits of their souls ill-arranged; that orators were anxious to speak well but not to act well; that grammarians desired to learn all about the misfortunes of Ulysses but were ignorant of their own misfortunes. To a young man who was studying philosophy, he said, \"Well done; inasmuch as you are leading those who admire your person to contemplate the beauty of your mind.\"\nAll links retrieved August 19, 2013.\nNew World Encyclopedia writers and editors rewrote and completed the Wikipedia article in accordance with New World Encyclopedia standards.

{"question":"How does the International Buddhist Temple in Mesa combine cultural preservation and community outreach, while also addressing contemporary social challenges like those faced by Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia regarding public health and welfare?","answer":"The Arizona International Buddhist Meditation Center in Mesa serves multiple functions that mirror the broader role of Buddhist temples. As one of only eight such temples in the country, it acts as both a meditation center and gathering place for the Sri Lankan Buddhist community, offering meditation classes and children's courses with a multicultural approach - teaching chanting in different languages. The temple explicitly welcomes everyone and focuses on helping people live harmoniously with neighbors and family. This approach aligns with how Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia have adapted to modern challenges - while preserving traditional roles, they've expanded to address pressing social issues. In Southeast Asia, temples have become crucial in addressing public health crises like HIV/AIDS through community support programs, education initiatives, and welfare services, demonstrating how Buddhist institutions can maintain cultural traditions while responding to contemporary social needs.","context":["News at Tipitaka Network\nBuddhists celebrate new temple in Mesa\nby Astrid Galvan, The Arizona Republic, Sunday, November 9, 2008\nThe only international Buddhist temple in the state held its grand-opening ceremony on Saturday.\nAbout 200 people gathered at the Arizona International Buddhist Meditation Center, 432 Temple St. in Mesa, to celebrate both the Kathina Ceremony, which marks the end of the rainy season in Sri Lanka, and the center's grand opening.\nThe temple, decorated with bright colors and a 4 1/2-foot Buddha statue brought from Sri Lanka, opened a year ago thanks to philanthropist Shanthini Wijay and her husband, Mike Sawyer.\nThe Houston couple donated funds to help purchase the building, one of eight temples in the country.\n\"Everybody is welcome to this place,\" Wijay said.\nThe temple serves as both a meditation center and a gathering place for the Sri Lanka Buddhist community, which has about 200 local members.\nChildren's courses and meditation classes are offered on Sundays.

The impact on children, however, means not only the loss of a parent and breadwinner, but also the loss of the child’s emotional support and security.\nLeft with aged grandparents, they face the uncertainty of who will care for them if and when their grandparents pass away. Many are forced to drop out of school because their grandparents do not have the means to support them. Many more find themselves the new head of the family with the responsibility of caring not only for themselves, but also for their siblings and older relatives.\nIf left unattended and uncared for, uneducated and untrained, the likelihood of them drifting onto the streets, being exploited and lured into the sex industry, or becoming drug addicts or traffickers is high. Without proper care and attention, they are open to a wide variety of risks as they grow and mature.\nAs children are the future of the nation, the direct impact of HIV/AIDS on children has an indirect impact on the community, or the nation as a whole.\nA community whose children are uneducated and unskilled is weakened. It lacks the resources and skilled manpower it needs to develop both socially and economically. Without proper development, a community or nation can fall into economic depression and face a variety of social problems.\nThe welfare of HIV/AIDS affected children is, therefore, everyone’s responsibility. Caring for these children is caring for the future of the nation, and our own happiness and well-being. Neglecting them is neglecting our own future and the future of the nation.\nThe number of AIDS infected children and children orphaned or affected by AIDS now numbers in the millions. In Thailand, it is in the hundreds of thousands. No society anywhere in the world is spared from this tragedy.\nThere is no one agency that can manage this problem alone. If the problem is to be solved, it requires the help of every person from every sector of society.\nConcerned about the impact that AIDS is having on children, Buddhist monks and nuns all throughout Southeast Asia have responded in a variety of innovative ways.\nMost every country in Southeast Asia is Buddhist and the temple is the center of the community. Community life revolves around the temple and Buddhist monks are looked upon as the spiritual leaders and moral support of the community. People put their trust in monks and turn to them for support and advice in times of crisis.\nFor centuries, Buddhist monks and nuns have fulfilled their obligations to ensuring the health, happiness and well being of the community by supporting community development. Although this has been done mainly through education, a large number of monks, nuns and temples have also assisted with the economic prosperity and growth of the community by establishing social welfare funds, rice banks, buffalo banks and income generation activities.\nThough modernization and socio-economic development have brought many changes to the community, the role of monks has not changed. In this modern age, monks continue to be one of the community’s main pillars of support.\nWith the arrival of HIV/AIDS in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries monks and nuns have adapted their traditional role to respond to the needs of the community. They see the impact that AIDS is having on the community and recognize that if the crisis is left unmanaged it will affect future development, the peace, happiness and well-being of the community as a whole.\nTo prevent the spread of AIDS in their community, particularly amongst the young, monks and nuns conduct HIV/AIDS awareness raising camps. During these camps, which are generally held in the temple, they educate young people on all aspects of HIV/AIDS and the socio-economic impacts. Using the life skills development and participatory learning approach, they equip the young with the skills they need to protect themselves from the dangers that come with modernization and consumerism, from temptation and from being lured into risk behavior. The monks and nuns do not work alone, but collaborate with other community leaders, the local health station and schools. In this way, activities conducted by monks and nuns become a community affair with all sectors of the community becoming involved.\nAs more and more infected people progress from stage one to stages two and three, become symptomatic and ill, the impact that AIDS is having on children becomes greater. With their parents unable to work and earn an income, children find themselves having to drop out of school with the burden of either caring for their sick parents and siblings, or having to find employment to supplement the family’s income. Because they are uneducated and unqualified, the work they can do is limited providing insufficient income to meet the family’s needs. Stressed by the load that they are forced to carry at such a young age, these children become easy targets of drug traffickers and pimps.\nMonks and nuns have responded to this new need by diversifying the work that they are doing. Many temples have established education funds to ensure that these young children can stay in school and complete their education. Some temples conduct traditional fund raising activities on special days such at World Aids Day and Children’s Day, or at New Year. Donations are also received and distributed. Funds are generally distributed at the start of the academic year or the new semester. To meet the children’s material needs temples receive and distribute donations of textbooks, pens, erasers, and notebooks etc. as needed. Uniforms and clothing are also provided. And to ensure that children are receiving the nourishment they need, some monks and temples have set up milk banks, or collect consumer goods received as alms offerings, which they donate on home visits to families, affected by HIV/AIDS. For example, the chief monk of Doi Saket District, Chiang Mai, has established a temple cooperative to which all monks under his jurisdiction contribute from alms offerings. These contributions are donated to children in the area who are affected by AIDS, as well as other needy children.\nFor children who are unable to complete their education, temples arrange vocational skills training. Examples of this can be seen at Wat Sri Suphan in Muang District, Chiang Mai where children and youth are able to receive free training as silversmiths, and Wat Hua Rin in San Pa Tong District, Chiang Mai, where training in tailoring is offered for free. As a result of these programmes, many youth are now able to earn extra money to support the family in its time of need.\nIn the event that one or both parents die, leaving the child orphaned, temples respond by taking in young boys as temple boys or for ordination as novices. Nuns assist by caring for orphaned girls. In this way, the children are assured of a place to live, food to eat and an opportunity for education. Buddhist nun, Mae Chi Arun, who runs the Dhammajarini Foundation in Pa Sang District, Lamphun Province, is caring for a growing number of socially and economically deprived girls. Through her Foundation, young girls are able to complete their studies through the non-formal education programme, as well as receive vocational training. Without her assistance, and the help of other nuns at the Foundation, many of these young girls would be at risk of exploitation or end up in the commercial sex industry.\nActivities such as those mentioned above can be found not only in Chiang Mai, but all over Thailand, as well as in other Southeast Asian countries. Many temples in Battambang, Cambodia, for example, are supporting AIDS orphans, as well as children of mine victims. Monks and temples in Vientiane, Suwannaket, Luang Pabang and Bo Kaeo Provinces, Laos have also responded to the HIV/AIDS crisis and are caring for infected and affected children in a variety of ways. The same can be seen in temples Kyang Tung, Shan State, Burma and Xeshuan Panna, China.\nThrough the help of these monks and nuns, many children who once faced a bleak and uncertain future are now guaranteed a good life in their community, and a future free from anxiety and the risk of exploitation and abuse. And as they grow and mature, it is the community and the nation as a whole who will be the ones who benefit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ffc64d0d-3bc3-4cec-ba49-20a52b88881f>","<urn:uuid:ad8df2b0-34de-45f6-9834-ef5b9f3450a8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which is older: the Cylinder of Antiochus I Soter or the Great Pyramid of Giza?","answer":"The Great Pyramid of Giza is much older. It was built between 2700 B.C. and 2500 B.C. as a royal tomb for Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops). In contrast, the Cylinder of Antiochus I Soter dates to 268 BCE, when Antiochus laid the foundation of the Ezida temple in Borsippa.","context":["The Cylinder of Antiochus I Soter from the Ezida Temple in Borsippa is one of the Mesopotamian chronicles written in ancient Babylonia in the Hellenistic Period. It describes how the Seleucid crown prince Antiochus, the son of king Seleucus Nicator, rebuilt the Ezida Temple and prays for divine protection. For a very brief introduction to the literary genre of chronicles, go here.\nThe Antiochus Cylinder describes how the Seleucid crown prince Antiochus, the son of king Seleucus Nicator, rebuilt the Ezida Temple in Borsippa and prays for divine protection.

This form of foundation document is found in considerable quantities since the second millennium BCE. The script of this cylinder is deliberately archaising. It is inscribed in archaic ceremonial Babylonian cuneiform script that was used in the well-known Codex of Hammurabi and adopted in a number of royal inscriptions of Neo-Babylonian kings, esp. Nabopolassar, but also Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus. The script is quite different from the cuneiform script that was used for chronicles, diaries, rituals, scientific and administrative texts.\nThe Antiochus cylinder is the latest one extant. Another late example is the Cyrus Cylinder, commemorating Cyrus' capture of Babylon in 539 BCE. This cylinder, however, was written in normal Neo-Babylonian script.\nThe Antiochus Cylinder was found by Hormuzd Rassam in 1880 in Ezida, the temple of the god Nabû in Borsippa, in what must have been its original position \"encased in some kiln-burnt bricks covered over with bitumen,\" in the \"doorway\" of Koldewey's Room A1: probably this was built into the eastern section of the wall between A1 and Court A, since the men of Daud Thoma, the chief foreman, seem to have destroyed much of the brickwork at this point. Rassam mistakenly records this as a cylinder of Nebuchadnezzar II.\nAntiochus I Soter (c.324-261 BCE) was the eldest son of Seleucus I Nicator and the Bactrian princess Apame. He became co-ruler with his father in 294 and at the same time married his father's second wife, Stratonice I (daughter of Demetrius Poliorcetes, whom his father had married in 298).\nThe last record of Seleucus as sole king is MLC 2654note[Doty 1977: 41.] on 9.II.17 SE = 13 May 295; the first tablet dated to both Seleucus and Antiochus is BM 109941 1.VIII.18 SE = 18 November 294.note[Oelsner 1986, 271.] The name of the queen is preserved in the Antiochus cylinder as Astartanikku (fAs-ta-ar-ta-ni-ik-ku, ii 26), perhaps a word play on Astarte. The news of her death in Sardes is recorded in Astronomical Diary no. -253 A110; A23 ([fAs-t]a-rat-ni-qé-e), Sep/Oct 254.\nAntiochus was put in charge of the so-called upper satrapies, including Mesopotamia and Babylonia. Thanks to the Babylonian chronicles we have a great deal of information about his actions in Babylon. He probably lived for a considerable time in the palace in Babylon, while the new royal city Seleucia on the Tigris was being built. Antiochus is called \"crown prince\" in the Antiochus and Sin Chronicle,note[(ABC 11 = BCHP 5; DUMU LUGAL šá É UŠ-tum, mār šarri ša bīt ridûti.] settling Macedonians from Babylon in Seleucia and making offerings in two temples of Sin (Egišnugal and Enitenna). The Ruin of the Esagila Chronicle (BCHP 6) is illuminating for Antiochus' interest in the rebuilding of Esagila. He used elephants and wagons for the clearing of the site of Esagila, apparently the temple tower Etemenanki (cf. Van der Spek 2005a). The Antiochus, Bactria, and India Chronicle (BCHP 7 = ABC 13A) and the Juniper Garden Chronicle (BCHP 8) probably also date to this period.\nKing Seleucus meanwhile turned his attention to the west. In 281 he defeated Lysimachus, king of Thrace and western parts of Asia Minor, at Corupedium in Asia Minor, so that he acquired the greater part of this region. But Seleucus apparently wanted more: he took the opportunity to try to return to his homeland, perhaps because he was homesick.note[So Memnon 12.1 FGrH 434, F. 8.1; cf. End of Seleucus I Chronicle [= BCHP 9]: r. 3’: Seleucus went ana KUR Ma-ak-ka-du-nu KUR-šú, \"to Macedonia, his land\".] He crossed the Hellespont, but was murdered by Ptolemy Keraunos, the son of King Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt, who, when in disgrace, had sought refuge with Seleucus. The last months of Seleucus are treated in the End of Seleucus Chronicle (ABC 12 = BCHP 9). The murder is also mentioned in the Babylonian King List of the Hellenistic Periodnote[BM 35603: 9; RlA VI 98f, Del Monte 1997, 208.] \"in the land of Hanî\" in month VI of year 31 SE (26 August-24 September 281).\nAntiochus' first great exploit as sole king (r.281-261) was his defeat of the Galatians, who had invaded Asia Minor, in the 'Battle of the Elephants' (275) and penned them in beyond the Halys (Galatia). 274-271 he fought the First Syrian War with Ptolemy II Philadelphus (283-246), partly described in an Astronomical Diary.note[Sachs/Hunger 1988, no. -273B r. 29’-39’, upper edge 1-4.] The diary mentions how troops were levied and resources gathered in Babylonia, elephants moved from Bactria through the province; so much silver was collected that exchanges were paid in Greek bronze coins. Citizens of Babylon were summoned to Seleucia on the Tigris to receive orders concerning taxation and land policy. This information has been linked with the later classical report that citizens of Babylon were deported to Seleucia,note[Pausanias, Guide to Greece 1.16.3, referring to Seleucus.] but the new readings of Sachs and Hunger have made this interpretation untenable.note[Van der Spek 1993, 97-98.] Land that was given to the Babylonians in Antiochus' first year was now confiscated again or made subject to royal taxation.note[See the discussion in Aperghis 2004, 109-110.]\nThe end of the war is only tentatively dated at 271 BC by Édouard Will.note[Will 1979: 146f.] In 271/0 BC (SEB 41) the king was encamped in Syria.note[Astronomical Diary I 354/3, no. -270 r. 18.] Not much is known about the end of Antiochus' reign. In 268 BC he was in Babylon, as this cylinder testifies.\n[i.1] Antiochus, the great king,\n[i.2] the mighty king, king of the world, king of Babylon, king of (all) countries,\n[i.3] caretaker of Esagila and Ezida,\n[i.4] foremost son of Seleucus, the king,\n[i.5] the Macedonian, king of Babylon,\n[i.6] am I.\nAntiochus Rebuilds Ezida\nWhen I desired8 to build\n[i.7] Esagila and Ezida,\n[i.8] the (first) bricks\n[i.9] of Esagila and Ezida\n[i.10] in the land of Hatti with my pure hand(s)\n[i.11] I moulded with fine quality oil and\n[i.12] for the laying of the foundation of Esagila\n[i.13] and Ezida I transported them.

Hence a specific enemy may have been intended. We know that Antiochus was encamped in Syria in 270/1 BC, possibly still because of the First Syrian war with Ptolemaic Egypt (Astronomical Diary I 354/3, no. -270 r. 18). We also know that Antiochus was in Syria when he made the first stone for Ezida (this cylinder i.10). We suspect that this prayer to Nabû was first of all a prayer for a victory over Ptolemaic Egypt.

The best-known travel guidebook was the one created by Greek-speaking epigrammist Antipater of Sidon around 140 B.C.\nLet’s see which were considered the seven wonders of the ancient world and why.\n1. The Great Pyramid at Giza, Egypt\nThe Great Pyramid is located at Giza, on the west bank of the Nile River, north of Cairo. Built as a royal tomb of Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops) between 2700 B.C. and 2500 B.C., it’s the oldest and the only ancient wonder that has survived to this day.\nIt covers 13 acres and is estimated to contain more than 2 million stone blocks that weigh from 2 to 30 tons each. According to scientists, the Egyptians used log rollers and sleds to move the stones into place. The sloped walls, intended to mimic the rays of the sun god, Ra, were initially built as steps and then filled in with limestone.\nThe interior of the pyramid includes narrow corridors with ascending and descending passages and hidden chambers in order to prevent robberies. Despite some great treasures found in the interior, it is believed that the content was looted.\n2. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Iraq\nAccording to legend, Babylonian king Nebuchadrezzar II in the 6th century B.C. planted a maze of waterfalls and dense vegetation near the Euphrates River. The gardens, which rested on tall stone columns 75 feet high, were planted to ease his lover Amytis’ homesickness for the natural beauty of her home.\nThere was a huge square brick terrace that was laid out in steps like a theater so that people could walk underneath the beautiful gardens. There are multiple accounts of the gardens in both Greek and Roman literature, however, no mention of the gardens has been found in Babylonian inscriptions.\nAs a result, most modern scholars believe that their existence was part of an inspired and widely believed, yet, fictional tale.\n3. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Greece\nThe Athenian sculptor Phidias crafted the famed statue of Zeus around 450 B.C., which was placed in the temple of Zeus at Olympia. The figure of Greece’s Olympic deity, decorated with gold and ivory, depicted the god of thunder seated bare-chested at a wooden throne.\nTwo carved sphinxes, mythical creatures with head and chest of a woman, body of a lion, and bird wings were holding the thrones’ armrests. According to legend, the temple was struck by lightning after the sculptor Phidias asked Zeus for a sign of his approval.\nThe Zeus statue graced the temple of Olympia for more than eight centuries, until its eventual loss and destruction during the 5th century A.D.\n4. The Temple of Artemis at ancient Ephesus, Turkey\nA temple of immense beauty dedicated to Artemis was built by a local king in 550 B.C. in Ephesus, a Greek port city on the west coast of modern Turkey. In fact, there were several altars and temples dedicated to Artemis.\nHowever, the most fabulous structure, a marble temple built around 550 B.C. and 350 B.C., designed by the Cretan architect Chersiphron and his son Metagenes, was decorated by some of the most celebrated artists of the ancient world.\nThe building burned on July 21st 356 B.C., according to legend the same night that Alexander the Great was born. About six years later, it was restored on the same site with marble columns and a stunning statue of Artemis, until its destruction by Ostrogoths in 262 A.D. In the 1860s the first ruins of the columns were discovered at the bottom of the Cayster River.\n5. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, Turkey\nLocated in Halicarnassus, in southeastern Turkey, the Mausoleum was a tomb with incredible marble and gold details built by grief-stricken Artemisia for her husband, Mausolus, the king of Carnia in Asia Minor, after his death in 353 B.C.\nThis construction of approx. 135 feet height, had a complicated design, consisting of three rectangular layers, as an attempt to combine Lycian, Greek, and Egyptian architectural styles. It was made entirely of white marble and is thought to have had a pyramid-shaped roof.\nThe tomb was at the top of the roof. It was destroyed in an earthquake in the 13th century and its remains were later used in the fortification of a castle. In 1846, some of the pieces were removed from the castle and now reside, along with other relics, in London’s British Museum.\n6. The Colossus of Rhodes, Greece\nFor 60 years the enormous bronze statue of the God Helios lifting a torch with one hand and holding a spear in the other graced the harbor entrance on Rhodes Island. It was 100 feet high, the tallest of the ancient world.\nIt collapsed during an earthquake in 226 B.C. Hundreds of years later, the Arabs invaded Rhodes and sold the remains of the statue. It was once believed that the statue stood with one leg on each side of a harbor, but researchers now believe that the statue’s legs were built close together to support its immense weight.\nThe Colossus of Rhodes was an inspiration for the Statue of Liberty.\n7. The Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt\nDesigned by the Greek architect Sostratos and completed around 270 B.C., the approx. 400-foot lighthouse was located on the small island “Pharos” near Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy II.\nThe lighthouse guided the Nile River ships in and out of the city’s busy harbor, while a mirror reflected sun rays during the day up to 35 miles away. Ancient coins that were found depict its structure: a square level at the bottom, an octagonal level in the middle, and a cylindrical top.\nThe lighthouse was gradually destroyed during a series of earthquakes from 956 to 1323.\nCopyright © 2012-2023 Learning Mind.

{"question":"How can trans students join TRANSaction club at App State?","answer":"Trans-identifying or questioning individuals interested in joining TRANSaction must contact the LGBT center or a club executive first, as the club has a closed door policy. The club is exclusively for trans and questioning students to provide them with a private, safe space where they can connect with others who have similar experiences.","context":["App State currently has six main LGBT-oriented clubs, all of which are dedicated to promoting inclusivity and community in broader and more specific communities. Three clubs, SAGA, TRANSaction and A-SPEC, are managed under the LGBT Center umbrella, and three more, Accessibility Council, Gay and Progressive Pedagogy and Queer People of Color are more loosely affiliated with the center.\nSexuality and Gender Alliance\nThe Sexuality and Gender Alliance offers a number of social and educational opportunities to students of all sexual orientations and gender identities. The club hosts meetings weekly as well as a number of campus-wide events annually.\nTypically, the meetings simply offer LGBT students a safe space for conversation. Sometimes this manifests in simple social opportunities like board game nights, other times with educational events, like Queer Literature Night, in which the club migrated to Foggy Pine Books for coffee and discussions about LGBT-oriented books.\n“Sometimes we do informational meetings, in which we talk about the general history of LGBT people or the history of a specific group,” Vice President of Administration and sophomore game design major Alex Luckett said. “The last meeting we had was a queer literature night, where we talked about different queer literature we’ve read, literature we’ve really hated and just different ways that people did representation.”\nSAGA also organizes and participates in larger social and educational events, such as annual amateur and professional drag shows. SAGA’s professional drag show will take place April 14 at Legends and will be hosted by “RuPaul’s Drag Race” queen Shangela.\nSAGA also recently organized its first scholarship for LGBT students, funded by money raised by club members.\n“If you are in danger of not being able to pay for college because of your identity, apply,” Vice President of Community Seb Jove said. “Tell your friends to apply. This is an awesome, really worthy use of your time, and it’s something we’ve worked really hard on for a really long time.”\nSAGA meets at 6:30 p.m. on Thursdays in Attic Room at the Plemmons Student Union.\nTRANSaction offers a private, social safe space to App State students identifying as trans or questioning their gender identities.\n“It’s a closed door policy where only trans and questioning students can enter, so that way it’s a space where people are similar minded and similar in identity where we can relax with people that are like us and have had similar experiences to us,” vice president and sophomore studio art major Lee Hansen said.\nThe club meets weekly to offer a sense of community to its members, whether through social events like field trips to Asheville or educational and charitable events, like the Trans Day of Visibility, which will take place on Friday and will educate trans people and allies about trans culture.\n“Right now we’re going to make it a mainly educational event, like what is trans, how to be visible as a trans person and how to receive visible trans person with respect,” Hansen said.\nThe event will be preceded by a trans clothing drive on March 29. TRANSaction collected clothing donations in the weeks leading up to the event; although anyone can donate, the club asks that only trans-identifying students take clothing at the event.\nAbove all, Hansen said, the club is a fun, stress-free way for trans people to find a social community.\n“We are a very chill and fun club to be in, and we will in no way judge anyone who comes in to be here,” Hansen said.\nBecause TRANSaction has a closed door policy, trans-identifying or questioning individuals interested in attending the club are encouraged to contact the LGBT center or a club executive.\nA-SPEC is App State’s club for students on the asexual and aromantic spectrum. The club is relatively new, having become an officially recognized club in spring 2016, and offers a social space and opportunities for advocacy to its members.\nWhile A-SPEC offers educational opportunities, such as during Asexual Awareness Week in October, club president Becky Parsons said the club is primarily a social space.\n“We do more visibility/social stuff than we do advocacy, mainly because it was originally formed as just a space for people to come and meet other ace or aro people,” Parsons said.\nDuring meetings, members typically end up partaking in random discussions about life, Parsons said, whether about everyday struggles and thoughts or deeper concerns, like coming out to family members.\n“We start the meeting with a question, but it usually devolves into tangents about different parts of people’s lives,” Parsons said. “We just vent.”\nParsons said one important opportunity offered by A-SPEC is the supportive community it fosters.\n“It’s private, and it’s a really welcoming and open place to share if you want to and learn more about our community,” Parsons said. “It’s just a community building place, and I think a lot of people enjoy having a space to meet people and make friends.”\nA-SPEC is a closed club to protect its members’ confidentiality, but Parsons said all are welcome to attend, regardless of identity.\n“We welcome anyone, we welcome allies, we just want to know who are you are before you step into our space,” Parsons said.\nThose interested in learning more about A-SPEC can contact the LGBT Center or a club executive to find more information.\nThe Accessibility Council, an organization endorsed by the Office of Multicultural Student Development and the Office of Disability Services, advocates for the rights and voices of App State’s disabled population.\nThough the club is not strictly for LGBT students, the council has connections with multiple LGBT clubs on campus, and vice president and sophomore art and visual culture major Seb Jove said the exploration of intersectionality is integral to the club’s mission.\n“Any time you talk about one identity and their experiences, you usually get a more complete, more well-rounded, more well thought-out picture when you consider intersections of identity and the way these experiences relate and correlate,” Jove said.\nAccessibility Council promotes accessibility on campus through activism, discussion and educational events. The council is currently planning a disability culture event to educate the public on how to respect people with disabilities. Chayym Kornhauser, senior psychology major, said that acknowledging disability as a facet of diversity can improve accessibility on campus.\n“What we try to do is promote awareness of disability as a social identity and an aspect of diversity,” Kornhauser said. “We also try to generate awareness of accessibility and accessibility issues, whether it’s infrastructure or societal things. Inaccessibility doesn’t have to be just physical barriers, it can also be how people treat and talk to disabled people as well.”\nAccessibility Council is open to everyone, regardless of ability, and meets on Mondays from 6-7 p.m. in the Bass Lake room of Plemmons Student Union.\nGay and Progressive Pedagogy\nThe Gay and Progressive Pedagogy club promotes activism through inclusive education. GAPP has an emphasis on LGBT representation, but also focuses on inclusivity of all marginalized identities.\nClub president and junior English secondary education major Logan Land said GAPP is intended as a space to discuss marginalized identities’ roles and representation in education. The club’s mission is to provide a safe space not only for queer and marginalized educators, but also for the marginalized students of future generations.\n“We create a space of how to be inclusive and showing that ‘normal’ in a classroom doesn’t exist,” Land said. “We want to break that down and be able to have all students and teachers feel welcome in the classroom.”\nLand said they helped found GAPP in November 2016, just after the election of President Donald Trump, after discussions with few other education majors and assistant professor of educational foundations Matthew Thomas-Reid, who now serves as the club’s adviser.\n“We just started talking and saying, ‘We don’t have a safe space for these queer and marginalized students in the college of ed, and that’s a problem,’” Land said. “So we decided to create that space, a space where we could have dialogue about inclusive issues that we’ve been having and how we can teach that in the classroom.”\nLand said they believe that in political climates such as this one, inclusive education is a form of active resistance.\nGAPP is open to all, regardless of major or identity. The club meets from 6-7 p.m. every other Monday in room 229 of the Reich College of Education building.\nQueer People of Color\nThe Queer People of Color club is one of the newer LGBT clubs on campus. This club offers a safe space for queer people of color to interact and socialize, and like TRANSaction, the club has a closed door policy to protect the privacy and security of club members.\nClub president and applied engineering major Jon Spencer said the organization was started last fall, but will officially become a club this fall. For now, Spencer said, the club is mostly in the planning stages.\nQPOC is intended as a safe space for queer people of color as well as a space for the community to discuss diversity and inclusivity on App’s campus.\n“We would be the club that would come up with ideas about how to help App State with its diversity planning, retention rate and things like that, especially with not just people in the queer community but also people of color within that community and as a whole,” Spencer said.\nSpencer said QPOC offers a unique opportunity in that it fosters a sense of solidarity among queer people of color, an especially small population on App’s campus.\n“I know that with App State’s current ‘diversity,’ there’s not a lot of people of color in general, and then when you get to queer people of color, it gets smaller and smaller,” Spencer said. “I feel like starting this club lets people know that they are included in everything that they do here, and that they have a whole community of people who are just like them who will be there no matter what.”\nPeople interested in joining QPOC can contact the LGBT Center or a club executive for more information.\nStory by: Ashley Goodman, A&E Editor"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:377d3bb4-bfa9-4a24-8a57-f1eadf13fec7>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What distinguishes the acceptance stage from other stages of grief in dealing with a crisis?","answer":"The acceptance stage involves the most direct and real dealings of an issue, though it doesn't mean approving or liking what is happening. Rather, it means acknowledging what is happening. During the pandemic, this involves coming to terms with the scale of COVID-19 infections, dealing with how quarantine affects jobs and social lives, and acknowledging the need to stay at home longer to reduce the chances of a second wave of the virus.","context":["By Scott Bragg\nElizabeth Kubler-Ross (1969) developed the five stages of grief as a model to describe the process that one goes through during a significant loss. It was originally designed to address the loss one deals with through the death of a family member or friend. However, the framework can be applied to other situations related to loss. In particular, the timely crisis of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic appears to be no exception in terms of how it affects our lives.\nThe five stages of grief can be remagined in the following ways:\nDenial, while in the grief and loss process, allows us to slow down and act as if we have more security. The object of this approach is to avoid feeling overwhelmed. We, therefore, minimize the consequences that occur in a crisis while in the denial stage. For instance, during the quarantine many of us tell ourselves “This cannot be as bad as the media is making it out to be” or “It won’t affect me and my family.” We may also be shocked by the number of those affected by the coronavirus.\nAnger is a part of the grieving process and can be shown in various ways. It can play out as experiencing anxiety or worrying about one’s finances or other life circumstances that are affected. At the same time, many of us may be frustrated with the strong possibility (or confirmed reality) of our child’s spring baseball or softball season being cancelled. We may also become irritated with family members or roommates, which can lead to loss of patience.\nDepression is also a key stage during grief and loss. It can occur as a process by which overwhelming feelings take over, especially while working from home. We may also be managing other responsibilities, such as child care or caring for a sick parent. Feeling helpless due to the uncertainty during the pandemic is common. We are unsure of how long the stay at home order will last, ultimately, which likely leads to a fluctuation in mood. In addition, we may find solace in escaping from the stress; whether it be ten minutes of alone time or binging a Netflix show.\nReflection and questioning occur during the bargaining phase in the stages of grief. At this point in the game, many of us are asking “What if?” We try to negotiate scenarios in our mind that serves as another way to avoid the grief and loss. For example, we might pray or have wishes that the pandemic stops if we change our behaviors. One could say “When this is over, I will not take anything or anyone for granted (or avoid unhealthy behaviors, like excessive alcohol use)”. There can also be feelings of guilt in this stage disguised as “if only” thoughts. “If only I had spent more time with my parents before this all happened” or “If only I had appreciated life more when I could be out in public with others” are basic examples.\nThe stage of acceptance perhaps involves the most direct and real dealings of an issue. It does not mean that we approve of or like what is going on, instead we acknowledge what is happening. So, during the pandemic we will hopefully (or have at times) come to terms that around one million people in the United States have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Furthermore, by accepting, we deal with the ways in which the quarantine affects our jobs and/or social lives. We also choose to acknowledge that we may have to “wait” this out at home a little bit longer to reduce the chances of the virus coming back in a second wave.\nTo conclude this blog, please know that all will experience these stages differently. These five stages are not linear. The process does not occur in the same order for each person and can fluctuate throughout time. The collective inconveniences, stress, tension, irritability, and other emotions during this time will likely not be forgotten. I believe that we can use our resilience and compassion to get through this. However, we will need to lean on those that care about us (while following COVID-19 restrictions). It is also important to seek out support from a professional, such as a therapist/counselor, psychiatrist, etc., as needed (while following the advice from medical experts regarding COVID-19). Reaching out for help is not a sign of weakness, especially given how tough this ordeal has been. Thanks to our medical and mental health professionals, help is available.\nScott Bragg is a Licensed Professional Counselor and Certified Addictions Counselor (CAADC) in Pennsylvania.\nThe information in this blog does is not a replacement for mental health treatment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c956dcf2-8d82-4b70-96a6-cb4f1d8e55eb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"can u tell me how mud affects cattle gain during winter? need quick answer","answer":"Heavy mud conditions can reduce average daily gain (ADG) in cattle by as much as one pound per day. To prevent damage and losses, cattle should be moved to a sacrifice area with hay when muddy conditions are anticipated.","context":["Managing stocker cattle through the winter can be a tough job, so Ardmore, Okla.-based Noble Foundation livestock specialist Ryan Reuter has put together a “top ten” list of management tips to help stocker operators through the colder months.\nAnticipate muddy or icy conditions — Cattle can do tremendous damage to muddy or frozen wheat/rye pasture by trampling it. Heavy mud can reduce average daily gain (ADG) by as much as one pound per day. Anticipate the weather and put cattle into a sacrifice area with hay for a few days.\n“To minimize bloat, make sure cattle are full before you turn them back out on small grain pasture,” Reuter said. “And remember that electric fence has one big downfall - heavy ice.”\nFeed an ionophore — Ionophores, such as Rumensin or Bovatec, can increase ADG by one-tenth to two-tenths of a pound per day. They can be fed in supplements or in mineral.\nEvidence is mounting that Rumensin is probably more effective than other ionophores in promoting gain and reducing severity of bloat.\n“Don't let horses have access to any feed or mineral containing Rumensin,” Reuter said.\nManage shrink — Reducing stress on cattle is key to reducing shrink. Allow cattle to fill up on pasture first thing in the morning, and load them after they have grazed. Train cattle to be easy to catch by feeding them for a couple of weeks before marketing, and don't catch them until the trucks show up.\n“If your cattle are used to eating from a bunk, ensure that the cattle are fed at the sale barn, even if you have to feed them yourself,” Reuter said. “Check with the sale barn manager about their ability to feed.”\nEvaluate marketing alternatives — Learn to evaluate all possible marketing alternatives well before the end of the grazing season.\n“These include local sale barns, large regional sale barns, video/internet sales or private treaty sales. Also, you can delay marketing by retaining ownership into the feedlot,” Reuter said.\nProduce early pasture — “If you are certain you will graze out small grains, strive to produce forage as early in the fall as you can,” Reuter said. “This can extend the fall/winter grazing season and reduce the need for supplemental feed.”\nHave a good health management program — “A health management program should be a written plan, designed by you and your veterinarian, for how you are going to care for your cattle,” Reuter said.\nIt should include identification, a vaccination program, diagnosis procedures, treatment protocols and morbidity/mortality targets.\nHave an alternative feed source — Being able to buy cattle when no one has pasture or being able to keep cattle gaining through tough pasture conditions can add tremendous flexibility to an operation.\nBeing able to handle byproduct feeds such as soybean hulls or wheat midds can significantly reduce the cost of supplemental feed.\nEstablish a profit objective — “Before buying cattle, determine how much profit per head you would be happy with. Figure that into your budget,” Reuter said.\nKeep an eye on the cattle market, but more importantly, watch the futures and options markets. Evaluate forward contracts with feed yards or buyers. If, during the grazing season, the opportunity to capture that profit comes along, you had better pay attention because it might not be there again.\nUse implants — “Growth-promoting implants are the single biggest ‘bang for the buck’ you get in stocker production,” Reuter said. A 75 cent implant can increase gain per head by 15 to 20 pounds. “If the value of those 20 pounds is $10, you get roughly 2,665 percent (annualized) return on your money. That sure beats owning Enron or WorldCom,” he added.\nKnow your cost of production — “You can't determine if and when you have made an acceptable profit if you don't know what it costs you to produce a feeder steer,” Reuter said.\nAdditionally, cost of production is critical for evaluating cattle purchases next year. Contact an agricultural economist for advice on how to gather this data."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:58db543a-d2da-49f3-96cb-0d3e8c7dcedd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm curious about the migration patterns and reproductive behavior of Christmas Island red crabs and Galapagos whale sharks - what makes them so unique? Can you explain their fascinating life cycles? 🦀","answer":"Both species exhibit remarkable reproductive behaviors. Christmas Island red crabs undertake a precise migration triggered by November rains, traveling for two weeks from inland burrows to the ocean. Males create mating burrows, females incubate eggs for two weeks, and they must release their eggs before the December new moon's high tide. A month later, the next generation comes ashore. As for whale sharks, they are ovoviviparous, with eggs hatching inside females who give birth to live young - one 9m female was found with 300 young, making them the most prolific of elasmobranches. In the Galapagos, whale sharks show unique population characteristics with over 99% being female, demonstrating strong sexual segregation. While red crabs' migration timing is precisely understood, whale sharks' reproductive and pupping grounds remain largely unknown, though they show strong seasonal fidelity to feeding sites like the Galapagos from mid-June until late November.","context":["How red crabs on Christmas Island speak for the tropics\nEach year, the land-dwelling Christmas Island red crab takes an arduous and shockingly precise journey from its earthen burrow to the shores of the Indian Ocean where weeks of mating and egg laying await.\nNative to the Australian territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, millions of the crabs start rolling across the island roads and landscape in crimson waves when the November rains begin. After a two-week scuttle to the sea, the male crab sets up and defends a mating burrow for himself and a female of his kind, the place where she will incubate their clutch for another two weeks. Before the morning of the high tide that precedes the December new moon, the females must emerge to release their millions of eggs into the ocean. A month later, the next generation of crabs comes ashore.\nBut a lack of rain can delay or entirely cancel this meticulous process, according to research conducted through Princeton University that could help scientists understand the consequences of climate change for the millions of migratory animals in Earth's tropical zones.\nThe researchers report in the journal Global Change Biology that the crabs' reproductive cycle tracked closely with the amount and timing of precipitation. Writ large, these findings suggest that erratic rainfall could be detrimental to animals that migrate with the dry-wet seasonal cycle that breaks up the tropical year, the researchers report. If fluctuations in rainfall become more extreme and frequent with climate change, then scores of animals could be in trouble—not just the migrators themselves, but also the creatures reliant on them for food.\nLead author Allison Shaw, who conducted the work as a Princeton doctoral student in ecology and evolutionary biology, explained that what scientists understand about the possible impact of a warming planet on animal movement is dominated by studies of how creatures that migrate with the summer-to-winter seasonal shifts of Europe and North America will be affected by changes such as the severity and duration of summers and winters. For tropical creatures such as the Christmas Island red crabs, or the wildebeests and gazelles of Africa, however, the regular quest for safety, food and reproduction is driven by wet and dry seasons. Yet how the erratic rainfall expected to accompany an altered climate will affect these animals is not well understood, Shaw said.\n\"Potentially there's been a perspective bias in how migratory species are studied, and this particular species represents two perspectives that have not been well documented—species that are migrating because they have to breed in a certain area, and species that are migrating in response to rainfall,\" said Shaw, a postdoctoral researcher at the Australia National University who will start as a University of Minnesota assistant professor of ecology in 2014.\n\"Targeting those two types of migration patterns that have so far been understudied is really what we're hoping to accomplish with this paper, and to encourage more studies in those areas,\" Shaw said.\nShaw and her co-author Kathryn Kelly, an oceanography professor at the University of Washington, obtained migration data for 36 years that fell between 1919 and 1939, and 1976 to 2011. They predicted the egg-release date for each year, and compared the later figures to actual rainfall measurements from 1973 to 2011. Except in three years, the crabs did not launch their procreative journey if there had not been at least 22 millimeters (0.87 inches) of rainfall. A light or late rainy season could push their journey forward or back months—in 1989, for instance, a November dry spell followed by heavy rain in late December kept the crabs in their burrows until early January. During the especially dry 1997 season, the crabs never migrated or mated. The culprit was a strong El Niño, the warm-water climate pattern that creates dry conditions in the Indian Ocean. The occurrence of the El Niño is projected to become more common as the planet gets hotter.\n\"We know that 1997 was a very big El Niño event and we can predict changes in migration patterns by using climate models that suggest that El Niño frequencies will potentially increase in the future,\" Shaw said. \"So, years like this could potentially become more common. If the crabs' response is to not migrate in El Niño years, that's going to be a very big problem.\"\nClimate change could be a special challenge to species such as Christmas Island red crabs or sea turtles that migrate to specific locations to reproduce, Shaw said. These animals do not live and breed in the same ecosystem, so any obstacle between one location and the other threatens their survival as a species.\n\"If they don't migrate, they can't reproduce,\" Shaw said. \"That's true for a subset of migratory species that have to breed in a specialized area, but spend most of their adult lives in a different area. They rely on migration to bring them between the two areas that they need. On the other hand, species like many temperate birds migrate to avoid harsh winters, but if winters become less harsh they can still survive even if they don't migrate.\"\nThe movement of little red crabs does not only benefit the species itself, Shaw said. Migratory animals have a role in the ecosystems spanning the territory they traverse. For instance, whale sharks migrate to Christmas Island to feast on the red crabs' larvae. As the parental crabs journey to the coast and back, they feed on plants and saplings that keep the island from being overgrown, Shaw said.\n\"Migratory species by definition are traveling either long distances or spanning across different ecosystems,\" Shaw said. \"The crabs migrate from terrestrial areas to drop their eggs in marine environments.\n\"Because they're spanning these ecosystems, they have the potential to impact not only marine environments and species such as the whale sharks, but also terrestrial species and forest dynamics,\" she said. \"If you took away migratory species you could potentially be affecting multiple ecosystems.\"\nDavid Sims, who heads the behavioral ecology group at the Marine Biological Association in England, said that most climate-change studies relate to temperate species because the outcome of climate change has often been more clearly observed outside of the tropics.\n\"I suspect most studies have been on temperate species because the long-term datasets needed to support robust analysis are more available for species in these regions,\" said Sims, who is familiar with the research but had no role in it. \"In addition, some of the largest changes in sea temperatures seen globally have been recorded in temperate regions such as the North Sea, so biological signals have been clearer.\"\nThe work by Shaw and Kelly might help provide a basis for applying research on temperate species to their counterparts along the equator, Sims said.\n\"The paper exemplifies well that the migration timing of tropical species is perhaps more similar to the responses of temperate species than previously realized,\" Sims said. \"Generally it seems that ectothermic [cold-blooded] species' migrations [such as that of the red crabs] correlate with environmental temperature changes, however the picture for individual species can be complex.\"\nShaw, who received her Ph.D. from Princeton in 2012, began the study at the University while planning a research trip to Christmas Island. Her research focuses on modeling migratory patterns and determining why animals migrate in the first place. Her interest in the red crabs began in 2008 when, as a Princeton doctoral student funded by the National Geographic Society/Waitt Grants Program, Shaw studied how size, sex and other factors influence if a red crab migrates. She used global climate data to time a second visit in 2009 with the crabs' migration, but was at first disappointed when climate alone did not seem to precisely predict crab movement. After reading more about climate change and migration, Shaw realized that her finding that climate generally influenced migration via rainfall was valuable.\n\"In the process of trying to ask this question about timing we were able to link migration patterns to rainfall, and rainfall to El Niño and global climate patterns,\" Shaw said. \"I realized that, seen in a different light, the analysis we had done on the crabs was quite valuable—it demonstrated a connection between climate and migration through rainfall, which hadn't been done for many species.\"","At the end of the 1980’s when the numbers of divers travelling to Galapagos began to increase dramatically I was fortunate to be one of the pioneers dive masters that dived the remote northern islands of Wolf and Darwin.\nMy first encounter with a whale shark shortly after was a revelation. Despite occasional sightings no one was truly aware of the numbers of whale sharks that frequented particularly Darwin Island.\nI was surprised at how little was known in general about the species, not only in the Galapagos but in general worldwide. My background in the physical sciences, Geology and Physical Geography made me curious about the natural history of this ancient species, like so many marine species, more a remnant of a bygone era.\nI became more aware of how whale sharks had been exploited historically and also how industrial fishing both targeted and incidental was beginning to seriously affect certain populations. With this came the realisation that without baseline data and at least a rudimentary understanding of their life cycle there is no manner in which we can create the platform, legal and physical to protect them.\nThe ensuing years we collected data about seasonality, frequency of sightings, sex and behaviour but with the realisation that we needed to expand our area of study and findings a different approach was needed and the Galapagos Whale Shark Project launched.\nSome more details\nThe Galapagos Marine Reserve, which straddles the equator approximately 600 nautical miles from the coast of Ecuador, is one of the largest marine reserves in the world. Its protected waters extend 40 nautical miles from a baseline connecting the major islands covering a total area of 130,000 square kilometres of Pacific Ocean and featuring a dynamic mix of tropical and Antarctic currents and rich areas of upwelling. Consequently, the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), contains an extraordinary range of biological communities, featuring such diverse organisms as penguins, fur seals, tropical corals, and large schools of hammerhead sharks. The GMR has a high proportion of endemic marine species – between 10 and 30 % in most taxonomic groups – and supports the coastal wildlife of the terrestrial Galapagos National Park (GNP), including marine iguanas, sea lions, flightless cormorants, swallow-tailed gulls, lava gulls, waved albatross and three species of booby, among others. It also appears to play an important role in the migratory routes of pelagic organisms such as marine turtles, cetaceans and the world’s largest fish, the whale shark, Rhincodon typus.\nThe whale shark, which reaches a maximum reported length of 20 meters, was first described by a British naturalist, Stephen Smith, from a specimen from South Africa, in 1828. Since its discovery, the same species has been observed on a global scale, occurring in all tropical and warm temperate seas with the exception of the Mediterranean. Its distribution is reported to be from approximately 35–40° N to 30–35° S. The whale shark is mainly a pelagic, (open ocean), species that periodically comes close inshore for reasons as yet not fully understood, but apparently related to feeding and/or reproduction.\nListed as Endangered in the IUCN 2016 Red List, whale sharks are threatened mainly by fishing activity. Traditionally hunted for their liver oil and for waterproofing wooden boats they are now being widely sold for their characteristic white meat (referred to as “tofu shark” in Taiwan) and whole fins have been sold for as much as $15 000 each in China (CITES Prop. 12.35). Rapid reductions in numbers caught per unit effort have been seen in several areas where they have been fished including India and Taiwan, indicating that local populations are particularly susceptible to over fishing. Slow growth, late sexual maturation and potentially low reproductive rates mean that localised populations are unlikely to recover after collapse due to fishing. Nations currently involved in the exploitation of whale shark products include China, Indonesia and Taiwan with illegal catches and/or non-targeted fisheries still occurring in India, Philippines, Japan, Madagascar, Mozambique, Korea and Taiwan.\nWhale sharks are capable of broad, trans-oceanic movements (timed with strong seasonal fidelity to feeding sites such as Gladden Spit in Belize, Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia and Darwin and Wolf islands in the Galapagos from mid June until late November (Green, pers. obs.) Very little is known about their biology and ecology, and their movements, particularly in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.\nWhale sharks feed predominantly by filter feeding on a wide variety of planktonic (microscopic) organisms but have been observed lunge feeding on nektonic (larger free swimming) prey such as schooling fishes, small crustaceans, and occasionally juvenile tuna and squid. They are generally solitary but are occasionally found in aggregations of several to over 100. e reason for this is unknown but it is assumed to be for feeding. From evidence gathered in the Galapagos during a 30-year period, strong sexual segregation would appear to occur as in many of the areas where whale sharks aggregate. At this moment in time however, Galapagos is the only population that shows such a predominant (over 99%), female inclination.\nWhale sharks are ovoviviparous with eggs hatching within the female’s uteri and the female giving birth to live young. A 9m female was caught in Taiwan with 300 young suggesting that the whale shark is the most prolific of elasmobranches.\nSparse information exists on reproductive and pupping grounds, in addition to our lack of information on migratory routes and home range sizes.\nThe overall objectives of this study are:\nIn order to achieve these objectives, we aim to:\nYou would like to READ MORE about the project?\nGo BACK to"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ee301336-9597-4556-b4a9-6baeeea840b6>","<urn:uuid:ffdd031d-7100-4cf0-8704-36639caf53c1>"],"error":null}

Therefore you should use any possible technique to minimize failure or defects in the product.\nOne possible technique is “Failure Mode and Effect Analysis” or FMEA, also known as “Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis” (FMECA) or sometimes simply “failure modes”.\nThis technique helps you locate potential issues with a product and then you can take corrective action to stop this defect from occurring.\nThe FMEA technique can be used improve your systems, design processes, and the production processes.\nFailure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)\nDespite its complex name, FMEA is a very simple qualitative technique which involves brainstorming with experts and listing their comments in a table format.\nIt is similar to the process of creating a probability and impact matrix.\nIn this technique experts identify possible causes for product failure, the chances of these failure happening, the impact of these failures, how easy is to detect failure, etc.\nThese opinions are noted in a table for further review\nWith the use of this technique you can identify many key failures which might affect your product.\nWhen to Use the FMEA\nFMEA is used extensively in project management. However, for the following cases, this technique is most useful for avoiding for future errors and improving the reliability of the process and the product.\n- During the development of a new product or process.\n- Before changes are made to the product or the process.\n- After identifying an error in the process or the product.\n- When receiving numerous and consistent complaints from customers.\n- Sales support cost is unusually high.\n- When company credibility is at stake.\nYou can use this technique for any process and any product. This technique is not confined to any industry, or technology.\nHow to Use FMEA\nAs this technique is a qualitative analysis tool, it requires expert judgement; all relevant and available experts will need to be called in for one or more brainstorming sessions. These experts will help you postulate, collect, and evaluate the potential defects, their causes and the impact of the defects.\nThe experts should belong to all functional areas of the process or product so you can cover the the complete product life cycle.\nYou can use the following table to record the experts’ input. Special attention is given to analyzing the cause of possible equipment failure.\nAs you can see from the tables, the FMEA technique uses three parameters: severity, occurrence, and detection.\nSeverity shows the severity of the defect on the user. It is denoted by SEV in the table. Occurrence predicts how often the issue may occur. It is denoted by OCC in the table. Detection represents how easily you can find the problem. It is denoted by DET.\nThe experts are asked to assign a value to each parameter, from 1 to 10, for each potential error or defect, where 1 is extremely unlikely and 10 is extremely likely. After the brainstorming session ends, you get the list of problems, causes, and their ratings. All this information will be entered into a table.\nFinally you multiply the severity, occurrence, and detection for each defect to generate an RPN. RPN stands for risk probability number and provides an overall risk impact score for each defect. In our example table, the RPN for the failure is 81.\nAfter generating the RPN for all possible defects and failure you will need to decide the thresholds of each risk level, High, Medium, and Low. That is, what RPN number should be given a high priority, a medium and a low level priority?\nOnce these thresholds are decided and the RPNs are sorted, you will start working on the high priority RPNs, generating detection techniques, implementing policies and procedures detailing action plans, and determining best practice for mitigating or eliminating the defect.\nFor example, the second table shows your recommended action for an identified failure, who will be the responsible for this action, and when you should implement it.\nOnce this failure happens, you will record it and the action taken on it.\nHow to Implement FMEA\nBy this stage, you have a list of possible errors and their potential corrective actions. Now you will assign responsibility to your team members to implement these corrective actions so the RPN of these errors can be reduced.\nAfter the corrective actions has been implemented, you will revisit these issues and review them again to assess the effectiveness of your corrective action plan. If need be a new FMEA will be generated to re-assess risks and defects.\nWhile using this technique do not forget the Pareto Law. First of all, you should focus on the minority of causes that are creating most of the issues or defects. This provides the largest impact for the least resources. Once these high impact issues are resolved, you can take on the other defects as resources permit.\nIf you see a particular issue is not being resolved with the current corrective action, you can plan a new corrective action to mitigate the problem.\nBenefits of FMEA\nFMEA offers many benefits by identifying errors in the very early stages of the design, production, or in the process. Some of the benefits of FMEA are:\n- Improved and more reliable products\n- Less after sale support\n- Increased customer satisfaction\n- Improved brand recognition\n- Reduced failure and warranty costs\n- Maximizing profits by reducing after-sales expenses\nFMEA is a proactive technique which helps you identify potential defects and failures before it actually happens. This is a fantastic qualitative technique, and if used correctly and consistently can bring many benefits to your organization.\nThough this technique may be little time consuming because of involvement of various stakeholders, if implemented proactively, it will lead your project a successful ending.\nHere is where this blog post on Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) ends.

{"question":"How do the community engagement approaches differ between the Maine permaculture movement and the El Paso Master Gardeners' accessible garden program?","answer":"The Maine permaculture movement engages community through work parties, workshops, and design consultations, as exemplified by Leslie's urban gardening project and Ben and Jesse's permaculture workshop. They focus on sustainability and food production, connecting through the Portland permaculture meetup and The Resilience Hub. The El Paso Master Gardeners take a more structured educational approach, offering formal resources like handouts, personalized group presentations, and tours of their demonstration garden. They provide specific guidance on adaptable gardening techniques, tool usage, and safety tips through information boxes throughout their garden and a dedicated help desk. Both approaches emphasize knowledge sharing, but Maine's system is more informal and focused on sustainable food production, while El Paso's program is more structured and centered on making gardening accessible to people with various challenges.","context":["Small Scale Homesteading Tastes Just Right\nBy Anna Hewitt\nHomesteading has historically been considered an act of self reliance typical of rural areas with abundant land, but small scale homesteaders in Maine and across the country are finding that they can grow, raise, and produce food wherever they live. Spurred by a desire to be more connected to their food and concerns about the impacts of climate change and industrial agriculture, many people are choosing to reconnect to the basic skills and traditions that were part of everyday life for generations. People in urban and suburban areas of southern Maine are re-discovering what our rural neighbors have known all along: the delicious taste of eggs from chickens they know, the satisfaction of harvesting vegetables right outside their back door, and that there is so much more you can do with a lawn than just mow it.\nSMALL PLOT EQUALS BIG OPPORTUNITY\nA Scarborough development made up of two acre lots and large houses is an unlikely place to find chickens and pigs. After moving there from a smaller lot in Portland, Mark and Teri Ouellette realized that they had enough space to really teach their three children about where their food comes from. Two ten-by-ten garden plots supply the family with flowers for cutting and an abundance of salad which they eat all summer long. It was Teri’s idea to add animals to their back yard farm. If Mark was reluctant at first, now he is an enthusiastic proponent of raising animals in the suburbs, not only for “the best-tasting eggs I’ve ever had” but for the opportunity to help their children “understand the cycle of life, where food comes from, and why it tastes the way it tastes.”\nIn addition to their flock of nine chickens which supply the family with plenty of eggs, the Ouellettes raised two pigs last year. Mark describes the experience as “absolutely unbelievable” and something he would certainly do again. The family fed and cared for the pigs but always kept in mind that aptly-named “Hammy” and “Crispy Bacon” were not pets. He admits that the first time their homegrown pork was on their plates it felt strange. But he believes that the hesitation was healthy and provoked a good conversation about their food and the animals’ life cycle. They are considering a goat, donkey, or rabbits in the future.\nThe development where the Ouellettes live is built on what was once farmland, and zoning laws were never changed. This allows the family to care for animals, feed themselves well, and bring a little bit of the farmland feel back to the area. Their neighbors were initially skeptical and some were even opposed to the idea but over time Mark says “people ended up loving it.”\nMany towns in Maine currently allow residents to raise chickens in residential areas. Laws generally allow up to six hens (but some towns allow more) and may require permits or other specifications. Some examples of cities and towns with chicken ordinances include Portland, South Portland, Falmouth, Westbrook, Scarborough, Saco, Biddeford, Cumberland, Brunswick, York, Camden, Auburn, Orono, and Dover-Foxcroft. However, since the specific requirements of ordinances vary and are subject to change, it’s best to check with your town hall before building a chicken coop.\nTHE CHALLENGES OF URBAN SPACES\nAlthough Leslie Pohl grew up in urban and suburban environments, her grandparents were farmers in Iowa and she’s always considered farming part of her heritage. After years in New York City, she and her husband moved to Maine to be closer to family. She began connecting to her agricultural roots by choosing produce from local farms, and joining her neighborhood community garden. She says she remembers vividly the first time she picked corn right from the field with her young daughter.\nHer husband Bob’s concerns about energy efficiency introduced them to permaculture, a growing movement in Maine and around the world that utilizes sustainability as the basis for designing landscape and building systems. One of the central ideas of permaculture is to design landscapes in a way that they produce more energy than they consume.\nAs Leslie began to learn more about this approach, she was inspired to find ways to grow food in the small spaces around her apartment building in Portland’s West End. She hired a designer who specialized in the permaculture approach and hosted a work party to implement the design.\nThe small deck attached to the back of the apartment that Leslie shares with her husband and daughter is just a few steps from their kitchen. During the work party, they crafted a raised bed from pallets perched on one edge of the deck, and attached fabric growing pockets to the deck railings to allow for vertical planting in the minimal space. These improvements mean that, Leslie can grow a variety of vegetables to harvest right outside her door.\nSpace was not the only challenge that she had to work with. As in many urban areas, trees and buildings block sunlight from reaching the deck for parts of the day. So Leslie also has a community garden plot in the nearby Clark Street community garden. As part of the permaculture design, she rebuilt the plot from the typical rows of plants with lots of bare soil between them, into two heavily mulched curved beds, ideal for inhibiting weeds and capturing water when it rains.\nIn addition to the challenge of finding time, space, and light to grow, Leslie has had to deal with another reality of growing food in a city environment. Most city soil is contaminated with lead which can make plants that are growing in it unsafe to eat. Fortunately, there are ways to work around this. Three raised garden beds were constructed in the small space between Leslie’s building and her neighbors. First, they placed slabs of concrete over the contaminated soil and layered mulch made up of seaweed, compost, newspaper, and straw to cover the slabs and create a healthy environment for planting away from the polluted soil. One of the three raised beds contains a small pond to create a welcoming environment for birds and insects that will help pollinate the plants. They also built a roof structure to funnel rainwater into storage barrels used for watering the plants. This year will be Leslie’s first season growing in the new beds and she is excited to see what happens.\nLeslie is down to earth and honest about her approach to urban homesteading. Both she and Bob have taken small steps and stuck to it. She is passionate about growing food this way as well as maintaining a sustainable home and believes, “permaculture is the answer to what ails us.” As both she and Bob work full time and care for their 11-year old daughter, time isn’t always abundant. And neither is space. What they have plenty of is knowledge, and the desire to live a healthy, sustainable and harmonious life in their urban environment. “We just want to do as much as we can with what we have and learn along the way.” She hopes that their experiences, challenges, and limitations will help to build a knowledge base for others who want to try similar things.\nGROCERIES FROM THE GARDEN\nWhen Jesse McAvoy and Ben Roehrl bought a house in Westbrook they knew they wanted to transition the large lawn into garden space. They began by building a few raised beds for a vegetable garden, and five years later, they have devoted a significant portion of their half-acre property to food production. They raise chickens and ducks, and eat year-round from food they have grown themselves or purchased locally. Eating locally and growing their own food has become a way of life, and Jesse believes, a way “to produce food that nurtures us as well as our environment.”\nLike Leslie, Ben and Jesse tapped into the area’s vibrant permaculture community to guide their homesteading efforts. They began by hosting a permaculture design workshop at their house to develop a clear plan for the space. They also enlisted community members to to help implement their ideas. And with the help of a work party, they built an herb spiral and large round garden beds to efficiently increase their food production. They dug an earthen basin pond to collect rainwater and attract beneficial birds and insects, and also planted berries and fruit trees which double as living fences to divide the front of the yard—closer to the street—from the back yard where the gardens and animals are located. Future plans for enhancing their home include adding solar panels, a wood stove, and constructing a more extensive root cellar which will regulate temperature and humidity for long-term food storage.\nWhen Jesse and Ben talk about the ways they have embraced and implemented homesteading on their property, it is clear that they put a great deal of thought and planning into it. With each new endeavor, they take time to observe others who are already doing it, research every imaginable step, and figure out how it will work for them. The connections they have made through homesteading are a driving force behind what they do. They begin new projects with confidence knowing that they have a network of people to help them when things don’t go as planned, and as they learn and master skills, such as raising and processing ducks for meat, they share their knowledge with others.\nWith all of the fruits and vegetables they are producing, Ben and Jesse spend a lot of time preserving food by canning and fermenting. Depending on the season they also fill their freezer with produce, homemade bread, meat from their ducks, and pork and lamb they purchase from Maine farms. They use their cool basement for long term storage of root vegetables and squash as well as unwashed chicken eggs. It may seem like a lot of work to grow, prepare, and preserve food this way but they see it as an even trade for grocery shopping. “Instead of going to the store,” Ben explains, “You go into the basement. It becomes a labor of love and once you establish a system it really doesn’t take a lot of time to maintain.” He plans ahead to fit the work in around his job while Jesse works part time and devotes his other hours to work on their homestead. They are trying to grow more perennial plants, like the perennial arugula, sorrel, and shiso greens that they use in salads, which will reduce the need for yearly planting. After increasing the garden space, they no longer spend time mowing “a bunch of useless grass.”\nJesse and Ben have put in a lot of time and effort learning what it takes to create their food, which makes eating and living this way enjoyable to them. And while their commitment to eating locally runs deep, they also believe in finding a balance, especially when it pertains to coffee, chocolate and the occasional avocado. “There is no wrong answer.” They say, “Everyone should follow their passions and do what works best for them.”\nAnna Hewitt is a writer, artist, and mother living in southern Maine.

Many of these can be found at local\nlibraries or book stores.","by Penny Leslie, Beverly Clark, and Ignacio Muñoz, El Paso Master Gardeners\nMost gardeners agree that gardening is good for the mind, body, and spirit. However, for many people completing gardening tasks in a traditional way is difficult due to physical, cognitive, or emotional challenges. Fortunately, there are countless ways to adapt the gardening environment. As part of our vision to make gardening accessible to everyone, we created a beautiful garden area with multiple examples of garden adaptations.\nOur Accessible Garden within the Ascarate Teaching and Demonstration Garden provides a wide variety of raised garden beds and benches, each with unique details that can be tailored to meet specific needs. We have great handouts and lists of resources with additional information about specific techniques, as well as gardening adaptations and tools that can be used to create further accessible gardening opportunities. If you love gardening but find that health conditions are impacting your ability to get the job done, or if you know people who are giving up gardening or not even considering gardening because of physical or cognitive challenges, adapting accessible gardening techniques may be the answer!\nThe entrance to the Accessible Garden features a beautiful sign painted by Master Gardener Alison Wells when she was an Intern. Also shown mounted on the entrance posts are information boxes like those which are posted throughout the garden and contain information on accessible gardening.\nThe Accessible Garden project was the vision of Master Gardeners Penny Leslie and Beverly Clark. It was constructed through the collaboration of Master Gardeners, Interns, and even an El Paso Community College student earning Community Hours. The endeavor was a long process due to the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic which forced our gardens to shut down in March 2020. It was after the second shutdown in October that the project was completed with a few touch-ups that were completed in January 2021.\nMaster Gardeners Can Help You Learn More:\n- Creating an Accessible Garden\n- Accessible Garden Design\n- Safety Tips\n- Ergonomic, Enabling and Adapted Tools\n- Stretches for Gardeners\n- Disability Specific Accessible Options\nGet in the Know:\n- Resource Lists\n- Personalized Group Presentations\n- Adaptive Tool Samples\n- Help Desk Assistance\n- El Paso Master Gardener Website\n- Tours of Ascarate Teaching and Demonstration Accessible Garden Area\nThis rectangular raised garden bed features a resting bench where people can take a break from working. It can also be used for people to sit on while working from the bench. The garden bed can be accessed from all sides. With the recessed lower edge all the way around for people’s feet to go under, gardeners can move in close and work from a comfortable position.\nThis split barrel raised garden bed was constructed by cutting two 35-gallon barrels in half and mounting them on a frame which splits them into four different containers for planting. Drainage holes were drilled in the bottom. It is recommended that plants or vegetables with smaller, not deep roots be planted in this type of raised bed due to the shallow bottoms of the barrels. The raised bed also has a countertop for elbow resting and can be accessed from all four sides.\nThis bench was constructed by building a frame from construction blocks and putting them together with construction adhesive. The bench and backrest are pressure-treated 4 X 4 posts. The bulletin board is weatherproof and will display information on accessible gardening which will be updated periodically. The small golden sign on the side of the board is a dedication sign to honor Penny Leslie’s parents who taught her the value of gardening and helping others. Penny made a generous donation to go towards the construction of the garden.\nThe galvanized metal raised garden beds were purchased through a local supply store. Trellises were added for climbing vines.\nThe keyhole garden beds have easy access from a wheelchair or a garden stool. The wire mesh in the middle of the keyhole garden bed is for compost and vegetable waste, and it has a sprinkler inside of it. The nutrients from the compost in the wire mesh leaches out which helps fertilize the plants and keeps the soil rich with nutrients.\nThe wheelchair-accessible raised garden bed has ample room to accommodate two wheelchairs in its inner recessed area, so it allows two gardeners with special needs to work together at the same time. The raised bed also has access from all other sides and its height allows gardeners to comfortably work from their wheelchairs.\nThis multilevel raised bed offers three gardening heights for gardeners with different abilities. The taller section can easily be reached from a wheelchair or when standing. The shorter section is a comfortable height when using a gardening stool. This multilevel garden bed can also be accessed from all sides.\nThe vertical barrel garden bed, in the foreground, provides many options for planting a variety of different vegetables in a small space. The plants are watered from the inside of the barrel with water coming into the top of a pipe that runs\nto the bottom and has holes for water to\nspray inside the barrel.\nThis is an overall view of the Ascarate Accessible Garden. The pergola in the background has inside benches so it can be used as a resting place after hours of gardening. You can also meditate and enjoy all the beauty and joy that comes with gardening which helps you relax as you become part of Nature and Mother Earth!\nPhotos by Ignacio Muñoz, El Paso Master Gardener"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:edf4aadf-63a3-4dad-9ad5-b5d65c038d9d>","<urn:uuid:92a56a26-ab81-4d4e-bd6d-099597590a10>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do copyright durations compare between Canada and the United States? I'd love to know the difference!","answer":"In Canada, copyright protection lasts for the author's life plus 50 years after their death. In contrast, the United States provides copyright protection for the author's life plus 70 years after death. For works for hire, anonymous works, and pseudonymous works in the US, copyright lasts for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.","context":["Copyright law, by its nature, is a balancing act evident behind each provision in a country’s copyright statute. Each country approaches this balance from its unique perspective of laws and culture and this balance changes over time with new legislation, changes in technology and court cases interpreting the copyright act. This article examines the balance in Canadian copyright law.\nYou may also be interested in The Balance in U.S. Copyright Law.\nThe Balance in Canadian Copyright Law\nOn the one hand, copyright law provides an exclusive bundle of rights to creators, owners and distributors of copyright-protected materials, and on the other hand, these rights are limited in time and scope.\nFor example, an author of a book in Canada automatically has copyright protection for their entire life plus 50 years after their death. During this time, the author and their heirs have exclusive rights such as the right to publish the book, translate it, and make an adaptation of it into a screenplay or movie. Fifty years after the author's death, all rights expire and the work is said to be in the public domain. At that time, anyone may freely use the work, adapt it, et cetera, without obtaining any permissions or paying any royalties.\nScope of Rights\nIn addition to duration of copyright protection, balance is evident in the scope of rights granted to authors, as many of the exclusive rights of authors are subject to exceptions. In fact, the perspective of librarians and other consumers of copyright-protected materials is often on the “other” side of the balance, the side that ensures consumers have reasonable access, and sometimes access without obtaining permission or paying a fee, to specific copyright-protected materials.\nAlthough inherent in each country’s copyright laws, the balance is also set out in the leading international copyright instrument, the Berne Convention. Under the Berne Convention, authors and owners of copyright-protected works have certain exclusive rights regarding reproduction. All Berne Convention countries must provide these rights for at least 50 years after the author’s death. Many countries such as the U.S. go further and provide the rights for 70 years after the author’s death.\nIn terms of exceptions for libraries and other consumers of copyright-protected materials, the Berne Convention permits each member country to provide exceptions in certain special cases as long as they meet both requirements of the following test. Exceptions can't:\n- Conflict with normal exploitation of the work\n- Unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author\nExceptions for library preservation, fair use or fair dealing may meet this test.\nEach county may interpret these requirements in a different manner, thus resulting in a variety of exceptions in different domestic statutes around the world.\nIn the Canadian Copyright Act, the fair dealing provision is available to all consumers of copyright-protected materials including librarians. In addition, there are specific exceptions for qualifying libraries, archives and museums for preservation copyright, and for the replacement of lost, damaged or obsolete copies, under specified circumstances.\nEducational institutions also have a number of exceptions available to them.\nAn interesting example of how various countries balance the rights in their copyright statutes is in the area of moral rights. Moral rights protect the reputation and honor of authors of works. These rights allow an author to have their name on their book, painting or other work, and to prevent any modifications to that work that may prejudice the honor and reputation of the author/artist.\nIn France, moral rights apply to all copyright-protected works, last forever (even beyond the duration of protection of economic copyright rights, such as reproduction), and may not be waived. Moral rights are passed onto heirs upon the death of the author.\nIn Canada, authors of all works have moral rights. Moral rights have the same duration as economic rights (50 years after the author’s death) and may be waived (that is, the author can agree not to exercise their moral rights).\nLearn more about moral rights in Canada in our article Canadian and U.S. Copyright Law.\nEach time a new copyright amendment bill is passed, we see newspaper headlines discussing the imbalance proposed in that bill. Headlines vary from copyright owners gaining too many new rights, to consumers being locked out of access to digital works.\nIssues such as the following continue to raise the ongoing debate of how to achieve balance in the online, global world between the rights of authors and owners, and the communities who access their works:\n- Private copying\n- Fair use and exceptions for libraries, archives, museums, and educational institutions\n- Digital locks on online content\n- Sharing and reproduction of digital content by consumers\nTo further enhance your knowledge about both Canadian domestic and global copyright law\nand gain practical strategies to help you answer copyright questions in your enterprise\nand lower copyright risk, see our Certificate in Canadian Copyright Law.","Along with blogging comes responsibility and ignorance of the law is no excuse.

Copyrights do not need not be applied for as they are vested in the creators of intellectual property. When we create something — we own the copyright, which is our exclusive right as the creator to control who else can use our work and in what manner. *\nBerne Convention – International Copyright Agreement\nThe Berne Convention (for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works) was established in 1886 and is an international agreement that governs copyright. The Berne Convention requires its signatories to recognize the copyright of works of authors from other signatory countries (known as members of the Berne Union) in the same way as it recognizes the copyright of its own nationals.\nIn the United States, the Library of Congress officially registers copyrights which now last for the life of the author plus 70 years.\n- In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors who did not do a work for hire, the term lasts for 70 years after the last surviving author’s death.\n- In the case of works for hire, and for anonymous and pseudonymous works (unless the author’s identity is revealed in Copyright Office records), the duration of copyright will be 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.\nThanks to organizations like Creative Commons, licenses like the GNU Free Documentation License, and the public domain, there are many images, songs, movies and documents freely available for you to download and republish without fear of violating copyright.\nPublic domain definition: The public domain is generally defined as consisting of works that are either ineligible for copyright protection or with expired copyrights. Public domain refers to the total absence of copyright protection for work The public domain is a range of abstract materials commonly referred to as intellectual property which are not owned or controlled by anyone. The term indicates that these materials are therefore “public property”, and available for anyone to use for any purpose.\nOnce in the public domain, it is always in the public domain. However, any variation on any public domain work becomes the property of the person making the variation, and it receives an automatic copyright, just as do completely original works.\nWhen Copyright Protection Becomes Public Domain\nThe data below will let you know when you can safely use a piece of art or music without permission because it is now in public domain after copyright protection expiration, or how long the copyright protection will last.\n|Published before 1923 – now in public domain.\n||Published from 1923 to 1963 – When published with a copyright notice © or “Copyright [dates] by [author/owner]” – copyright protection lasts 28 years and could be renewed for an additional 67 years for a total of 95 years.

{"question":"How do past times get idealized by our collective memory, and what are the psychological impacts of facing unpredictable conditions like alopecia areata?","answer":"Regarding past times, people tend to make two key errors: they overlook the 'worthlessness' that has been eliminated and select only the best as typical, similar to assuming all people were giants because we find occasional giant graves. They also incorrectly divide time simply into past and present, not considering that the present represents only about 30-50 years while the past accumulates many such periods. As for the psychological impact of alopecia areata, the unpredictable nature of hair loss and regrowth can lead to significant emotional challenges, including feelings of frustration, embarrassment, sadness and fear. These feelings, if persistent or overwhelming, may develop into depression or anxiety, manifesting as withdrawal, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, sleep problems, loss of interest in activities, decreased energy, weight changes, and in severe cases, thoughts of death or suicide.","context":["And most of us are far guiltier in stretching the chronological limits of what from the past we sift and coalesce into ideal. As Wordsworth was to say, in an article he wrote for Coleridge's The Friend (1809): \"There are two errors into which we may easily slip when thinking of past times.\" One error lies in overlooking \"the large overbalance of worthlessness that has been swept away,\" and selecting only the very best as \"typical.\" In our imaginative voyaging through the past, we are like those travelers through the jungle who are told where the grave mounds of giants from earlier days may be found. When we find the grave, with the remains of what may indeed prove to have been a giant, we then assume that he was typical (\"There were giants in those days\") rather than that he had been given such a mound in the first place and then remembered simply because he happened to have been a giant. The second error is that we so quickly, in our habitual feelings, divide time merely into two parts, past and present, and then \"place these in the balance . . . not considering that the present is in our estimation not more than a period of thirty years, or half a century at most, and that the past is a mighty accumulation of many such periods.\" It is precisely for these reasons that, as Ortega y Gasset was to say in our own century, every age will inevitably feel itself \"empty\" in comparison with the past.\nI always find it fascinating when someone generalizes as to what we all do mentally. Bate addresses other profound issues in this book as well, including taste, influence and recognized achievement in (Western) poetry.\nAs for writers, Bate makes it seem that the search for an original phrase or expression is not unique to modern times: Bate quotes (page 3) Khakheperresenb, an Egyptian scribe who lived sometime around 2000 B.C., who wrote, \"Would I had phrases that are not known, utterances that are strange, in new language that has not been used, free from repetition, not an utterance which has grown stale, which men of old have spoken.\"\nHere is another passage I especially like. In it, Bate considers the achievements of the English Romantic poets and what directions may afford opportunities for writers today (pages 115 - 116):\nAnd yet, with all the strikes against them, the greater Romantics still succeeded (astonishingly, when we remember that in England we are dealing with only some twenty-five or thirty years, in a nation with about a twenty-fifth of the population of the English-speaking world now). To try to touch on what each of them did would demand not only another lecture but a series of lectures, and ideally a step-by-step biography of the drama of each writer's life. I use this moment to plead for a more sympathetic - a more psychologically and a more literarily informed - use of biography: a recognition of what the artist confronted in what were for him the most important things with which to struggle (his craft and his whole relation with tradition, with what has been done and with what he hopes can still be done). In comparison, so much to which we confine ourselves in literary biography is far less relevant - no more relevant than it would be for any number of other people who had devoted their years to doing nothing. (It is like assuming, as Coleridge said, that every \"deer-stealer\" had it in him to become a Shakespeare.) Strangely, biographies of statesmen or scientists (or artists in other fields) are less guilty of this reductionism to the \"deer-stealer\" approach, and will focus primarily on what the man really did, why and how he was great: the situation he inherited and his struggle with that inheritance. Why are we alone so shy of the essential? As with biography, so with the reconsideration of literary history itself that we now seem about to make: here too these concerns could profitably be nearer the center of our thinking.\nIf we are forced to try to answer our question in a few sentences, we have only to repeat the cliches about Romanticism - but with a special imaginative sympathy for the particular question we have been discussing here - and we can get a tolerable notion of what at least permitted, if it did not create, this remarkable end-product of the eighteenth century, which provided the creative capital off which the nineteenth century and much of the twentieth (though in the latter case uneasily) has continued to live. For example, one answer is surely to be found in the opening up of new subject matters where the challenge of the past was less oppressive: simple life (of which there were to be twentieth-century urban as well as romantically rural varieties), children, the poor and socially slighted; landscape and scenery; such inward experiences as revery, dream, and mysticism; the whole concept of the \"strange\" either to awaken attention through difference in mode or phrase, to explore something really new, or to provide setting and focus for familiar nostalgia; the past itself in periods or ways not previously exploited by the traditional genres; the geographically remote or unusual, or conversely its apparent opposite (for example, Wordsworth; or the young Emerson on the central challenge of the age: \"I ask not for the great, the remote . . . I embrace the common, I explore and sit at the feet of the familiar, the low\"). Every attempt to \"define\" Romanticism in the light of a subject is doomed to failure except as it applies to a limited part. For the opening of new subject matters, as of approach, proceeds in almost every direction, like spokes pointing outward from the hub of a wheel but with no rim to encase them. The one thing they all have in common is an interest or hope in the hitherto unexploited. And despite the strong attraction of twentieth-century post-romantic formalism to ideals of retrenchment and self-limitation, that still remains with us as a premise with which we are disinclined to quarrel.","What you need to know about alopecia areata related conditions\nIf you have alopecia areata, you may also have one or more related diseases. The most common of these include other autoimmune diseases (such as thyroid disease), atopic conditions (such as asthma, allergic rhinitis or hay fever , atopic dermatitis and other forms of eczema) and mental health impact (such as depression or anxiety).\nThese kinds of related diseases are known as “comorbid conditions.” Comorbid simply means that one condition exists in the body together with another condition. It’s important to understand which comorbid conditions you may be at higher risk for, so that you can work with your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of these conditions.\nI have thyroid disease and alopecia areata — is one the cause of the other?\nMany diseases have related conditions, but that just means one disease exists alongside another\nGet the facts on alopecia areata related conditions and the signs and symptoms you should look for\nLearn how to spot depression or anxiety and when it is time to seek medical advice or counseling\nSee your doctor to find out if you have any diseases commonly seen in association with alopecia areata\nDiseases that cause your immune system to go haywire and attack its own tissues are known as autoimmune diseases. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks its own healthy hair follicles. Studies show that people with alopecia areata can have other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease. However, the fact that you have alopecia areata doesn’t mean you will automatically develop another autoimmune disease. Either way, it’s important to talk with your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of these conditions.\nThe thyroid is a buttery-shaped gland at the base of the neck that produces the thyroid hormone which controls your metabolism. Any kind of abnormality in the thyroid that results in its inability to function normally is known as thyroid disease. Some thyroid conditions such as Hashimoto’s, are considered autoimmune diseases.\nThyroid disease is divided into hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). These affect people of diffierent ages and both sexes, and include a wide range of symptoms, depending on which type of thyroid disease a person has.\nSymptoms of hyperthyroidism include:\n- Increased appetite\n- Weak muscles\n- Rapid heartbeat, irregular heartbeat, or pounding of the heart\n- Nervousness and anxiety\n- Trembling in the hands and fingers\n- Changes in menstrual patterns\n- A greater sensitivity to heat\n- Changes in bowel movements\n- Enlarged thyroid\n- Diffculty sleeping\n- Thinning of the skin\n- Fine hair that easily breaks and splits\nSymptoms of hypothyroidism include:\n- Feeling cold\n- Weak muscles\n- Joint or muscle pain\n- Weight gain\n- Sadness or depression\n- Pale, dry skin\n- Dry, thinning hair\n- Slow heart rate\n- Less sweating\n- A puffy face\n- A hoarse (rough) sounding voice\n- Heavy menstrual bleeding\nOther autoimmune diseases\nAdditional autoimmune diseases that can sometimes be associated with alopecia areata through common genes include type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. The risk of developing these conditions in individuals with alopecia areata is low, though family members may show an increased incidence of other autoimmune diseases, since these tend to cluster in families.\nDid you know?\nComorbid conditions are diseases that exist in the same person at the same time; one is not the cause of the other. The only way to know if you have comorbid conditions with your alopecia areata is to make an appointment with your doctor.\nAtopic conditions are those that make a person more likely to develop allergic “hypersensitivity” reactions. Studies indicate that people who have alopecia areata may also have atopic conditions, too. These include allergic rhinitis also commonly called hay fever, asthma, and atopic dermatitis. Unlike other comorbid conditions, people with alopecia areata who also have an atopic condition may notice a seasonal change in their alopecia areata, as their allergies flare up or calm down.\nAtopic conditions are by far the most common comorbid conditions with alopecia areata. However, the fact that you have alopecia areata doesn’t mean you will also develop one of these atopic conditions. Either way, it’s important to recognize the signs and symptoms of this family of conditions.\nAsthma is an atopic (allergy) condition that causes a person’s airways to become inflamed, swollen and narrow, which makes it difficult to breathe. This leads to tightness in the chest, coughing and wheezing. Asthma commonly first appears in childhood, but can continue throughout your life. Some people with asthma only experience it from time to time, while others require constant treatment in order to prevent it from getting worse.\nSymptoms of asthma include\n- Tight chest\n- Shortness of breath\nAllergic Rhinitis or Hay Fever\nAllergic rhinitis is an inflammation in the nose and sinuses, which is linked to allergens like seasonal pollen, dust mites and pet dander. It is also known as “hay fever.”\nMany people suffer from seasonal hay fever at different places or times of the year depending on what triggers their allergies.\nSymptoms of allergic rhinitis/hay fever include\n- An itchy nose, mouth, eyes or skin\n- A runny nose and/or stuffy nose\n- Watery eyes\n- Sore throat\nEczema is a condition that causes the skin to be red and itchy. It often appears in early childhood. Babies usually develop it on their face (especially the cheeks and chin), but it can appear anywhere on the body. The most common type of eczema is called atopic dermatitis (AD). All of types of eczema cause itching and redness, but some may also cause a person’s skin to blister, “weep,” or peel.\nSymptoms of eczema may include\n- Dry, sensitive skin\n- Red, inflamed skin\n- A rash that keeps coming back\n- Rough, leathery or scaly patches of skin\n- Oozing or crusting\nMental Health Impact\nDepression or Anxiety\nBecause hair loss and regrowth from alopecia areata is unpredictable and sometimes it comes back again and again, it can be emotionally challenging for people to live with the disease.\nPeople with alopecia areata commonly report feelings of frustration, embarrassment and sometimes sadness and fear related to their condition. If you have had these feelings for more than several weeks, or if they seem overwhelming or too difficult to manage on your own, it’s important to make an appointment with your doctor because you may be experiencing depression or anxiety.\nSymptoms of depression and anxiety may include\n- Withdrawal or isolation\n- Restlessness (unable to sit still)\n- Feeling frantic\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Problems with sleeping\n- Loss of interest in hobbies or other activities\n- Decreased energy, feeling tired more often\n- Weight change\n- Thoughts of death or suicide\n- Sadness or depression"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e47b1aeb-c059-40e5-91ae-dbd1eb72e76c>","<urn:uuid:69bfd903-4dad-4ec7-a7e5-3e54d144d481>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can someone explain the four core principles of Dynamic Self Governance? Need to compare them for a project on organizational structures!","answer":"The four principles of Dynamic Self Governance are: 1) Consent - policy decisions require addressing any well-reasoned paramount objections from members, 2) Circles of Equivalence - members within each circle are involved in all aspects of decision-making and monitoring outcomes, 3) Double-Linking - two people from each circle are elected to the next-higher circle, ensuring ideas can flow up and down the organization, and 4) Elections - everyone within each circle has equal voting rights and can be elected for any function, with the election process ensuring the best person is chosen and understands the task requirements.","context":["By Gaya Erlandson, PhD\nSharing is a vital aspect of community building. By uniting isolated neighbors into caring networks, sharing has the capacity to create communities of people who understand that their greatest source of abundance is in their shared, human assets. Parents who struggle alone to provide for their families, for example, can collaborate with neighbors for reliable, quality childcare, teen mentoring with local seniors, and meal and ride sharing.\nKey to community building, however, is good governance and decision-making processes. Being a long-committed community-builder, I am excited to describe a highly effective governance system that enables communities to be thriving contexts of caring, collaborative relationships.\nWhat is Dynamic Self Governance or Sociocracy?\nDynamic Self Governance (DSG) is an innovative approach to governance that\n• Streamlines decision-making while reducing tension around power;\n• Maximizes decision-making effectiveness and efficiency;\n• Kindles creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit;\n• Decreases number of meetings and heightens productivity of meetings;\n• Increases individual engagement, productivity, and commitment;\n• Builds relationships and community belonging; and\n• Provides a structure that assures ongoing progress, learning, and improvement.\nIn much of the world, Dynamic Self Governance is called “sociocracy” based on the Latin and Greek words socius meaning “social familiarity” and kratei meaning “governance.” With roots dating back to 1851 when Auguste Comte coined the term, sociocracy has been developed extensively by Gerard Endenburg in the Netherlands, starting in 1970 when he began applying its principles to his electrical engineering corporation.\nSociocracy was brought to the United States by business consultant John Buck, who has studied with Endenburg since the 1980s. To date, sociocracy has been implemented in hundreds of organizations around the world—private and public schools and universities, professional groups, large and small businesses, government agencies, and intentional communities. In the United States, sociocracy is largely referred to as Dynamic Self Governance (DSG).\nStructure and Principles\nDSG can be pictured as a hierarchy of circles reflecting different levels of work, not control. Circles are groups of 2 to 40 people who know each other and who have a particular aim or job within a business or community organization. A simple three-tiered hierarchy includes the Top Circle, made up of those heading the organization (Board of Directors, CEO, CFO, etc.) and a representative from the next circle down called the General Circle. The General Circle is made up of representatives from the circles at the third level (sometimes referred to as departments, committees, etc.) and also has its own representative in each of the lowest level circles as well as in the Top Circle (see double-linking below).\nThe four principles of Dynamic Governance are simple, but have dramatic effects.\n1. Consent: Policy decisions are made by consent. Consent means members must offer a well-reasoned “paramount objection” (relevant to stated aims) so it can be addressed. Rather than generating a negative turning point, paramount objections often result in the opposite. Discord and chaos are embraced as opportunities to improve the proposal—and as opportunities for the group to build trust and understanding. In articulating objections, for example, members learn about the needs, gifts, and ideas of the others. They also gain clarity on their own motivation, goals, and ideas.\n2. Circles of Equivalence: Members within each circle are highly involved in determining meeting agendas, engaging in transparent elections, co-creating proposals for policies or projects, making decisions, etc. Decisions that are implemented are monitored and the outcomes are measured by members of the circle to further the group’s learning and effectiveness.\n3. Double-Linking: All the circles are “double-linked.” Two people within each circle also are elected members of the next-higher circle. Because of this, ideas from the “lowest” circles can link upward and become implemented at any higher-level, or move laterally through the representatives. With a comprehensive feedback system that ensures communication up and down the organization, DSG’s double-linking optimizes an organization’s ability to respond to internal and external pressures. This self-optimization allows a business or community organization to be very resilient.\n4. Elections: Although some people are elected for specific tasks and functions over time, everyone within each circle has an equal vote and can be elected for any function. The election process assures both that the elected person is accepted by the group as the best available one to do the task, and that s/he understands what the task requires.\nDSG and Sharing Economy Law\nWriting DSG governing documents into a new or existing legal structure can be done rather easily. In Appendix E of the book We The People, Buck and Villines offer an example of DSG operating agreements and bylaws for a limited liability company (LLC).\n• Article 1 includes three sections entitled Organizational Model (describes the four principles), Structure (describes Top Circle, General Circle, Department Circles, etc.), and Investing and Working Partners.\n• Article 2, entitled “Top Circle,” gives details on its composition, roles, terms, meeting requirements, how to handle vacancies, etc.\n• Article 3 focuses on “Executive Officers of the Top Circle.” Significantly, the Board of Directors is part of the Top Circle and shall not meet separately from the Top Circle.\n• Article 4, entitled “Circle Management,” has several subsections. It is stated here, for example, that each circle shall be a separate organ of the LLC and shall be empowered to draft its own regulations (in agreement with Top Circle’s vision, etc.); that the next-higher circle, through its representative, is responsible for ensuring that decision-making in a circle below functions according to the operating agreement; that recording circle minutes be done properly, etc.\n• Article 5, entitled “Compensation and Profit Sharing,” offers an ingenious way to compensate investing and working partners (workers), with both fixed and variable payments, depending on profitability.\nLiving Well Care Home\nAn excellent example of an organization that implemented DSG is Living Well, an award-winning, level III, residential care and assisted-living facility in Bristol, Vermont. Under John Buck’s guidance in 2004, they adapted existing 501(c)(3) bylaws and other governing documents to implement the DSG principles and procedures described above.\nLiving Well is the first elder care facility in the United States to implement DSG. The Resident Circle, for example, meets regularly and actively discusses whatever is important to them—whether it be the menu, how services are provided, what activities to pursue, or how to measure outcomes. This circle also elects one of their members to represent them in the Staff Circle, and that person regularly checks in with all of the elders. Per Top Circle vision, Living Well removed toxic cleaning supplies as well as refined and artificial sugar. They started a community garden and hired a naturopathologist to see residents (in addition to the required medical staff). Within just six months, many residents showed noticeable improvements—physically, mentally, and socially. One woman thought to have severe dementia picked up the phone one day and had a lucid conversation with her family for the first time in years. Another who had previously just sat in her room started playing the piano in the living room. No one knew she had been a piano teacher. For further information on the Living Well Care Home, see http://LivingWellCareHome.org.\nImplementing DSG from the Ground Up\nDSG can also be implemented over time, from the ground up. For example, in a neighborhood with a Homeowners Association, a group of neighbors can begin with shared projects such as a garden. After experiencing success in sharing and making decisions together, members of this initial circle might seed new circles, such as one that creates a playground in a shared area or a food co-op. When several of these third-level circles exist, they could create a General Circle made up of representatives from each circle to better coordinate efforts. Eventually the Homeowners Association (or some other group) may adopt DSG and become the Top Circle and thus create a completely integrated (double-linked) DSG hierarchy. For an example of a cohousing community that has implemented DSG, see http://www.champlainvalleycohousing.org.\nIn short, DSG is a scalable, decision-making structure (from a few to countless, interlinked small groups) that guarantees the opportunity of self-directed contribution and optimal development for all within a sharing, caring context.\nFor a longer version of this article, along with a second article giving more of a description of the challenges and benefits of implementing DSG at Living Well, please go to http://www.livingnew\n• Buck, John & Sharon Villines, We The People: Consenting to a Deeper Democracy, A Guide to Sociocratic Principles and Methods (Sociocracy.info, 2007), available at http://GovernanceAlive.com/.\n• Gerard Endenburg, Sociocracy as Social Design: Its Characteristics and Course of Development, as Theoretical Design and Practical Project (Translated, Eburon, 1997) (1998).\n• Gerard Endenburg. 1981.

{"question":"What's the difference in seating capacity between Festival Theatre's Almost, Maine production and Playwrights Horizons' Main Stage? I'm curious about theater sizes!","answer":"The Almost, Maine production at Festival Theatre features limited seating in their street-level Elbow Room space, while Playwrights Horizons' Main Stage was built to accommodate between 99 to 199 seats. The exact number of seats for Almost, Maine is not specified, but early reservations are recommended due to the limited capacity.","context":["Summer is in sight, and Festival Theatre’s summer company of guest artists arrive this week to begin the comprehensive rehearsal process for the four shows in the theatre company’s rotating repertory of classics.\nOpening the season on June 19th is the raucous musical comedy, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. This show has one goal, to make audiences laugh. Utilizing classic ideas from burlesque entertainment, this play tips its hat to lots of adult humor, while still keeping things innocent and appropriate for most ages. A favorite since its Broadway debut in 1962, “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” won several Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Musical. Readers may be familiar with the 1966 film adaptation starring the hilarious Zero Mostel. Notable for many reasons, the film marks Buster Keaton's final on-screen performance. Still there is nothing like seeing it come to life on stage before your eyes, so all are reminded to come ready to laugh, to applaud, to guffaw, and to cheer.\nAnd truly, audience members for every production should come ready to embark on a story's adventure. Almost, Maine is a journey of a different style. Often humorous, often tender, this show consists of several short scenes, all set in the same small town in rural Maine. All taking place over the course of one night, we see different characters grappling with human experiences, all on the theme of love. Some are falling into love, some falling out of it. Some are ending a relationship; others don't even realize they are beginning one. This play is a romantic comedy with a slightly surrealist approach allowing the figurative to become tangible. “Almost, Maine” opens July 5th and will be produced in the Elbow Room, the street-level performance space, which will assist in creating an intimate atmosphere, and will feature limited seating. Early reservations are recommended for this memorable play about the rise and fall of our hearts, and the human stories that are created from sharing love.\nPopping back upstairs to the main stage for the rest of the summer repertory, Aristophanes’ The Frogs is the fourth annual Festival Theatre Conservatory for Young Performers (FTCYP) production, opening July 19th. Featuring a cast of roughly half youth actors and half adult professionals, \"The Frogs\" is an ancient but hilarious play. It centers on the Greek god Dionysus as he journeys to the underworld to bring back to the land of the living the best playwright, Euripides, who has recently died. Along the way he encounters many obstacles and humorous characters as he battles his own fear, vanity, self-importance, and a few outside intrusions. Although the play is centuries old, the humor and the values that it reflects are timeless. From slapstick style humor to thoughtful examination of what makes good art, this play is perfect for audiences of all ages. With the goals of introducing young audiences to classical work, this Conservatory production will delight, entertain, astonish and even surprise audiences! Festival’s Arts Education Action Group has been working to develop \"The Frogs\" Theatre Resource Guide, a tool for school groups or families to use, which will be available on the website. Prior to bringing your child or grandchild to the show, read through the activities together. It will help to deepen their understanding of the show, and it might even let you in on some interesting factoids.\nThe final repertory selection of the summer is the mysterious playground of a show, The 39 Steps, opening August 9th. This show is theatre candy! Four actors take on a hundred roles in this face-paced mystery comedy. An adaptation of the 1935 Hitchcock film (which was based on the 1915 book by John Buchan), this spy thriller is taken apart and put back together in the almost Monty Python-like style. One actor will play the lonely Richard Hannay, one actor will play the beautiful and mysterious women he encounters, and the other two actors will play everyone else in the show. A whirlwind of dramatic action, \"The 39 Steps\" moves from a dusty apartment to train stations to high-brow parties to police stations and back again in seamless transition. The show will take advantage of every creative impulse the director, actors and designers put into this play, and will be an experience that audiences remember as a true act of theatre magic. Come and see how the mystery unfolds, but come ready to have a blast, because theatre artists having this much fun is simply bound to be contagious!\nSee the calendar for show dates and times, and reserve your tickets here!","Home · Email · List of Projects · Project Sites and Links · Articles · Robert Davis Biography\nPlaywrights Horizons - New York, New York\nPeter Jay Sharp Studio Theater\nEntrance on 42nd Street\nPlaywrights Horizons was founded in 1971 and has become one of the nation's premier venues for new work. Playwrights has presented new work by more than 300 writers, including Christopher Durang's Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You, A.R. Gurney's Later Life, Scott McPherson's Marvin's Room, Wendy Wasserstein's The Heidi Chronicles, and Alfred Uhry's Driving Miss Daisy. Playwrights produced critically acclaimed musicals such as William Finn's Falsettos and Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Sunday in the Park With George.\nPlaywrights is one of six Off-Broadway theaters along west 42nd Street called \"Theater Row\". The six new and renovated theaters range from 99 to 199 seats. A 499-seat Shubert Organization theater, the \"Little Shubert\", is Playwrights' next-door neighbor to the West.\nThe new Playwrights was built on the same lot as the old Playwrights building, which was vacated for a year during demolition and construction. The old Main Stage is duplicated almost exactly in the new building. The new building increases the seating capacity of the Main Stage auditorium, adds a Studio Theater, and provides a radical improvement in support space. The new facility includes administrative offices, a telemarketing office, one large and one small rehearsal room, dressing rooms, and spaces for stage departments such as carpentry, props, wardrobe, sound, and electrics. The ground floor lobby on 42nd Street includes a new home for Ticket Central, which is a cooperative box office for several theaters.\nThe building lot is very small so this project is an exercise in artful stacking. Mechanical equipment is located on the bottom and top floors for acoustical and other practical reasons. The left, right, and rear walls are lined with continuous mechanical chases the full height of the building to transfer ducts and conduits from floor to floor. The major spaces are separated acoustically by interstitial noise isolation floors. These noise buffer floors are filled with offices and other similar quiet activities that won't leak noise into the adjacent theaters and that don't mind a little noise leaking into them.\nPlaywrights was careful not to lose their unique style in the new building. Playwrights decided not to enlarge the stage, but instead kept the tiny stage the same size in the new building that it was in the old building so that their production budgets and their intense small production style would not have to expand or be diluted trying to fill more space in the new facility.\nThe entire stage floor is trapped, can be removed, and can open completely into the trap room below. The front edge of the stage and the proscenium walls left and right are removable to suit the needs of the performance.

{"question":"Hello! Please can you explain diferencia between tradicional stamps with glue and self-adhesive stamps? En particular, me interesa how they work for stamp collecting and for normal mail sending.","answer":"Traditional stamps and self-adhesive stamps differ in several key ways. Traditional stamps require moistening or licking to activate the adhesive (typically made from substances like dextrin or polyvinyl alcohol). For regular mail use, self-adhesive stamps are more convenient as they can simply be peeled off and stuck to envelopes without moistening. However, for stamp collecting purposes, self-adhesive stamps can be problematic. While mint condition self-adhesive stamps are easy to collect by keeping them on their backing paper, used self-adhesive stamps are challenging to preserve. Some countries like Germany make stamps with dissolvable adhesive, but others like the US intentionally make their self-adhesive stamps disintegrate if soaked to prevent reuse. Because of this, collectors often have to preserve used self-adhesive stamps by cutting out a small paper margin around the stamp rather than trying to remove them from envelopes.","context":["Today in Tedium: Considering all the money that the greeting card industry spends on making really interesting looking cards (but not as interesting, of course, as they were when Robert Crumb was a greeting card illustrator), I have a question: Why do gift card envelopes still rely on a kind of glue that adheres with licking? Do they not realize that people frequently write these cards in pen, and might realize, halfway through the process, that they forgot a loved one? (Or that, horror of horrors, a name was misspelled?) I recently tasted some of this glue and it left me nonplussed, even though I appreciated the person who I wrote the card for. So, my question is this: How did we start licking adhesive-laden paper in the first place, and why are we still doing it? Today’s Tedium considers why. — Ernie @ Tedium\n“Mr. Fechheimer's death was a singular instance of the dangers of blood poisoning, and his case is almost unparalleled in medical history. Saturday night, in sealing an envelope, he pressed the mucilaged portion of it across his tongue. The edge of the envelope was sharp and cut his tongue so that it bled a little. The next day, his tongue began to swell and pain him. The symptoms of a serious case of blood poisoning were manifest to the doctor who was called to Mr. Fechheimer’s hotel Sunday.”\n— The New York World, writing about the 1895 death of Sigmund Fechheimer, a man who apparently came down with blood poisoning after cutting his tongue on an envelope. The story was reported widely at the time—The New York Times featured the situation in a small blurb , giving the situation a little more weight than it had otherwise, when the World’s lurid yellow journalism reputation was near its peak. It was likely a surprise for Richard Fechheimer when he discovered the truth of what happened to his distant relative when looking into his genealogy—now posted at the Internet Archive.\nHow the first lickable adhesive stamp used on a mass scale made it easier to deliver mail\nSending a letter is no big thing nowadays, but before the 19th century, it was a horribly complicated process in the United Kingdom, consuming a whole lot of extra time and based on a postage system driven by distance.\nFortunately, a man with an interest in both adhesive and simplifying the mail for the average person saw a way forward. That man is Rowland Hill, and in 1837, he released a booklet titled Post Office Reform: Its Importance and Practicability. The booklet proved hugely influential on improving the situation around the mail.\nOf the many ideas he brought up in his discussions of ways to improve the mail system to make it accessible to the average person was the idea of the adhesive stamp. From his booklet, with key points highlighted:\nPersons unaccustomed to write letters, would, perhaps, be at a loss how to proceed. They might send or take their letters to the Post Office without having had recourse to the stamp. It is true that on presentation of the letter, the Receiver instead of accepting the money as postage, might take it as the price of a cover, or band, in which the bringer might immediately inclose the letter, and then redirect it. But the bringer would sometimes be unable to write. Perhaps this difficulty might be obviated by using a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp, and covered at the back with a glutinous wash, which the bringer might, by applying a little moisture, attach to the back of the letter, so as to avoid the necessity for re-directing it.\nOf the many ideas that Hill brought forth to fix the British mail system, this turned out to be the most noticeable and lasting. He had solved many of the complications of routing a letter by making it possible for the letter-sender to pre-pay the postage. The letter was proof that the postage price was already covered.\nJust a few years after pushing this idea forward, this idea had its moment in prime time, with the formative stamp called the Penny Black, a tiny illustration of Queen Victoria that followed this moistenable strategy. During the first year alone, 68 million Penny Black stamps were applied to pieces of mail throughout the United Kingdom.\nThere are some prior claimants to the adhesive stamp concept, as laid out by stamp expert Ken Lawrence during the days of Usenet, but the Penny Black was a turning point both for stamps in general and the idea of licking (or at least moistening) a piece of paper so it could apply to another piece.\nBut this nonetheless introduced the concept of “gumming” stamps, most commonly with substances like dextrin (a derivative of starch), and polyvinyl alcohol. These days, stamps tend to be self-adhesive—in other words, no licking—but the same can’t be said about letters in many cases.\nThe number of calories, per gram, that gum arabic generally has, according to a Food and Drug Administration estimate most recently updated in 2008. Gum arabic is a fairly common substance, a major commodity from Sudan that’s used in everything from sodas to candy bars. It’s also used in many envelope adhesives, giving the glue the sickly sweet flavor you either hate or secretly love. One fascinating thing about this that that there are websites out there that have attempted to count the number of calories consumed when licking an envelope or a stamp. Fat Loss School suggests an envelope has around a thousandth of a gram of gum arabic, while DietFacts estimates that a U.S. postage stamp accounts for a tenth of a calorie. The U.K. Royal Mail, in one estimate to The Guardian, says that its stamps range from 5.9 calories to 14.5 calories. Don’t fill up on stamps.\nFive interesting misconceptions about adhesives on letters\n- There’s long been a belief among the health-conscious that letter adhesives have gluten—a fact that the Envelope Manufacturers Association specifically denies on its FAQ page. “Remoistenable adhesives are derived from corn starch and do not contain wheat or rye gluten,” the association emphasizes.\n- Likewise, envelope and stamp adhesive is almost always vegan, as it’s made from synthetic materials, per the UK Royal Mail. That said, if you’re vegan and in the market for designing your own adhesive, I definitely don’t recommend this guide.\n- For years, a rumor has floated around the internet that licking envelopes could help spread cockroach eggs. This is entirely false, but on the other hand, PETA notes that envelope glue can provide useful nutrients to cockroaches, along with other kinds of substances that you wouldn’t eat, like paint or bar soap. Desperate times call for desperate measures.\n- Yes, your DNA sticks with the envelopes. Gerald Lehman, a Michigan soldier who was stationed at Pearl Harbor, had not been identified for decades after his death aboard the USS Oklahoma. But in 2010, he was identified properly, after a letter he had sent to his mother was checked for Lehman’s DNA. It was found on the stamp. A similar technique was being used to help identify Amelia Earhart’s remains, with less luck thus far. Nonetheless, the potential has given philately a kick in the pants in recent years.\n- Self-adhesive stamps didn’t come about from the United States, but Sierra Leone. The problem there, notes Linn Stamp News writer Janet Klug, was that the humidity was so high that traditional stamps would’t work so well—making self-adhesive stamps a good idea there. Bringing them to the U.S. proved challenging—a failed attempt in 1974 led the U.S. Postal Service to avoid making another variation for 15 years. Fortunately, that one stuck.\nSo why does lick-friendly envelope adhesive stick around, anyway?\nIt seems weird that in an age where we have so many better options for adhesives that envelopes are still mostly stuck in the days when tongues do most of the work.\nWhat’s the reason for that? To put it simply, the direct mail industry loves remoistenable adhesives, which work really well for machines that ship out direct mail en masse.\n“Remoistenable front seals reactivate with moisture and are the most common in use today due to their suitability for automatic inserting machines,” the Envelope Manufacturers Association explains in a recent guide.\nIn other words, no, the direct mail industry does not have an army of people looking to lick messages, but rather they use a variety of approaches to get the same result.\nFor direct mailers, a lot of variables go into the decision making process for spitting out perfect pieces of mail in bulk, including how much the seal curls, how well the seal handles humidity, and how the adhesive bonds to the paper.\nAnd not all approaches are created equal. As the New York Times bestselling book [Adhesives and Sealants: Technology, Applications and Markets*](http://amzn.to/2onRw7N) explains, a process called hot-melt extrusion—which involves placing a hot adhesive directly onto the letter, has gained prominence within the industry because the end result is often more professional looking than simply moisturizing the adhesive on the envelope, as the goobers do it.\n“Hot melts can be applies much more precisely than water-based systems and give a very polished and professional look with no curling of paper,” author David Dunn writes. “Conversely, water-based adhesives often look dull, have rough edges, and tend to curl the paper because moisture is added to only one side of the sheet.”\nThe consumer market has long benefited from solutions that take some of the annoyance out of a truly tedious task. The Life Magazine ad above, for instance? It’s from 1941. But mass-mailers have completely different needs, which means you’re not going to get rid of licking envelopes anytime soon—even if there’s not any actual licking going on.\n*- OK, not really.\nDirect mailers take their adhesives seriously. In 2001, for example, immediately after the anthrax attacks at facilities around the country, direct mail companies looked to find ways to make their adhesives stronger.\nBut the truth is, the reason why adhesive envelopes persist in the consumer market is because they imply “personal touch,” like the words you say mean slightly more because you imperfectly closed this envelope.\nIn recent years, companies like Thankbot and Bond have come along to challenge our thinking about what constitutes hand-written. At some point, the mindset around hand-written cards won’t mean quite as much anymore.\nDoes that mean we can start texting our birthday wishes to people instead and leave the cards (and their adjoining materials) out of it?","Postage Stamp Collecting continues to grow on a worldwide scale. Stamp collecting not only enables one to learn about their own country's history, culture, famous people, but it also enables them to learn more about the larger world around them. Postage stamp collecting continues to be one of the best non-scholastic learning tools in existence.\nModern-day collectors usually begin collecting by visiting their local post office or by saving the colorful stamps that are affixed to mail they receive.\nBeginning collectors today have a multitude of beautiful commemorative stamps within their grasp. They are excited about postage stamp collecting, but at the same time, they have some issues about how they should preserve their newly discovered treasures.\nI receive many web inquiries from novice collectors that are confused about how to collect modern postage stamps that they get in the mail. We don't want to lose any new collectors, because they can't find answers to their questions, thus this article on collecting self-adhesive stamps is imperative.\nSelf-adhesive stamps can be peeled off the backing-paper and affixed to envelopes with ease, saving the consumer from moistening or licking the gum on the back of the postage stamp. This is a great idea for postal consumers, but it is a very bad idea for stamp collectors.\nSelf-adhesive postage stamps have been around for almost a quarter of a century now. The US Postal Service even experimented with self adhesive Christmas stamps back in 1974. The experiment was a philatelic disaster, but then, manufacturing technology has improved greatly since then.\nToday, most of the postage stamps issued in the world, whether in sheet format, booklet format, or coil format are self-adhesive stamps with backing paper. ALL the stamps issued by the US Postal Service are now the self-adhesive format.\nPostage stamp collecting, with MINT condition self-adhesive postage stamps, for the most part, is EASY. Just separate the stamp or block from the sheet or booklet, with the backing paper on it, insert it into a plastic mount, then mount it in your album!\nHere is an excellent guide on how to separate mint self-adhesive stamps from booklets, for mounting as singles in an album.\nPostage stamp collecting, with USED condition self-adhesive postage stamps, can be problematic. There has been much debate over this problem in recent years. The adhesives used by some countries, such as Germany, will easily dissolve, when the stamps are soaked in warm water, allowing the stamp to be dried, pressed, and hinged or mounted into a collector's album with no problem.\nMany countries use adhesives that will not dissolve in warm water. When stamps with these adhesives are soaked and attempt is made to remove the sticky adhesive substance from the back of the stamp, the stamp will ultimately be destroyed. US self-adhesive stamps are like this. In fact, they are intentionally manufactured that way, so the stamp will disintegrate, if an attempt is made to soak it off the envelope. This is a security measure, intended to prevent someone from peeling an un-canceled stamp off of an envelope and then reusing it for postage again.\nI recently had a web inquiry from a new stamp collector in Australia stating as follows:\nActually, this collector has the perfect answer to the problem ... \"don't even bother with it anymore\". There is an article I read about the same subject in the November 2013 American Philatelist, the magazine of the American Philatelic Society. The author of the article had the very same solution. This seems to be the trend to collecting modern self-adhesive postage stamps in used condition. To reiterate ....\nJust cut the stamp out of the envelope, making a tiny paper margin around the outside edges of the stamp. The used stamp can now be hinged or mounted on the album page without any problem. I created the scan of the modern US definitive postage stamp shown above, to illustrate this process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d37c0b60-20be-4c58-9d8e-ccdb16b0f2a8>","<urn:uuid:756ab2eb-ed94-4dff-9c7f-014fad0d8f14>"],"error":null}

The behavior of a neural network is defined by the way its individual computing elements are connected and by the strengths of those connections, or weights. The weights are automatically adjusted by training the network according to a specified learning rule until it performs the desired task correctly.\nNeural Network Toolbox includes command-line functions and apps for creating, training, and simulating neural networks. The apps make it easy to develop neural networks for tasks such as data-fitting (including time-series data), pattern recognition, and clustering. After creating your networks in these tools, you can automatically generate MATLAB® code to capture your work and automate tasks.\nHouse Pricing Estimation with Neural Net Fitting App\nEstimate median house prices for neighborhoods based on various neighborhood attributes.\nIris Flower Clustering with Neural Net Clustering App\nCluster iris flowers based on petal and sepal size.\nWine Classification with Neural Net Pattern Recognition App\nIdentify the winery that particular wines came from based on chemical attributes of the wine.\nNeural Network Toolbox supports a variety of supervised and unsupervised network architectures. With the toolbox’s modular approach to building networks, you can develop custom network architectures for your specific problem. You can view the network architecture including all inputs, layers, outputs, and interconnections.\nSupervised neural networks are trained to produce desired outputs in response to sample inputs, making them particularly well-suited to modeling and controlling dynamic systems, classifying noisy data, and predicting future events.\nNeural Network Toolbox includes four types of supervised networks: feedforward, radial basis, dynamic, and learning vector quantization.\nFeedforward networks have one-way connections from input to output layers. They are most commonly used for prediction, pattern recognition, and nonlinear function fitting. Supported feedforward networks include feedforward backpropagation, cascade-forward backpropagation, feedforward input-delay backpropagation, linear, and perceptron networks.\nRadial basis networks provide an alternative, fast method for designing nonlinear feedforward networks. Supported variations include generalized regression and probabilistic neural networks.\nDynamic networks use memory and recurrent feedback connections to recognize spatial and temporal patterns in data. They are commonly used for time-series prediction, nonlinear dynamic system modeling, and control systems applications. Prebuilt dynamic networks in the toolbox include focused and distributed time-delay, nonlinear autoregressive (NARX), layer-recurrent, Elman, and Hopfield networks. The toolbox also supports dynamic training of custom networks with arbitrary connections.\nMaglev Modeling with Neural Time Series App\nModel the position of a levitated magnet as current passes through an electromagnet beneath it.\nLearning vector quantization (LVQ) networks use a method for classifying patterns that are not linearly separable. LVQ lets you specify class boundaries and the granularity of classification.\nUnsupervised neural networks are trained by letting the network continually adjust itself to new inputs. They find relationships within data and can automatically define classification schemes.\nNeural Network Toolbox includes two types of self-organizing, unsupervised networks: competitive layers and self-organizing maps.\nCompetitive layers recognize and group similar input vectors, enabling them to automatically sort inputs into categories. Competitive layers are commonly used for classification and pattern recognition.\nSelf-organizing maps learn to classify input vectors according to similarity. Like competitive layers, they are used for classification and pattern recognition tasks; however, they differ from competitive layers because they are able to preserve the topology of the input vectors, assigning nearby inputs to nearby categories.\nTraining and learning functions are mathematical procedures used to automatically adjust the network's weights and biases. The training function dictates a global algorithm that affects all the weights and biases of a given network. The learning function can be applied to individual weights and biases within a network.\nNeural Network Toolbox supports a variety of training algorithms, including several gradient descent methods, conjugate gradient methods, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM), and the resilient backpropagation algorithm (Rprop). The toolbox’s modular framework lets you quickly develop custom training algorithms that can be integrated with built-in algorithms. While training your neural network, you can use error weights to define the relative importance of desired outputs, which can be prioritized in terms of sample, time step (for time-series problems), output element, or any combination of these. You can access training algorithms from the command line or via apps that show diagrams of the network being trained and provide network performance plots and status information to help you monitor the training process.\nA suite of learning functions, including gradient descent, Hebbian learning, LVQ, Widrow-Hoff, and Kohonen, is also provided.\nPreprocessing the network inputs and targets improves the efficiency of neural network training. Postprocessing enables detailed analysis of network performance. Neural Network Toolbox provides preprocessing and postprocessing functions and Simulink blocks that enable you to:\nImproving the network’s ability to generalize helps prevent overfitting, a common problem in neural network design. Overfitting occurs when a network has memorized the training set but has not learned to generalize to new inputs. Overfitting produces a relatively small error on the training set but a much larger error when new data is presented to the network.\nNeural Network Toolbox provides two solutions to improve generalization:\nAlternatively, you can create and train your networks in the MATLAB environment and automatically generate network simulation blocks for use with Simulink. This approach also enables you to view your networks graphically.\nYou can apply neural networks to the identification and control of nonlinear systems. The toolbox includes descriptions, examples, and Simulink blocks for three popular control applications:\nYou can incorporate neural network predictive control blocks included in the toolbox into your Simulink models. By changing the parameters of these blocks, you can tailor the network's performance to your application.\nYou can speed up neural network training and simulation of large data sets by using Neural Network Toolbox with Parallel Computing Toolbox. Training and simulation involve many parallel computations, which can be accelerated with multicore processors, CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPUs, and computer clusters with multiple processors and GPUs.\nParallel Computing Toolbox lets neural network training and simulation run across multiple processor cores on a single PC, or across multiple processors on multiple computers on a network using MATLAB Distributed Computing Server™.

{"question":"What were the historical conservation efforts for both the red wolf and Mexican wolf, and how did their reintroduction programs differ? Could you explain the timing and outcomes of these initiatives?","answer":"The red wolf and Mexican wolf had different reintroduction trajectories. The red wolf was declared extinct in the wild but saw initial success through a reintroduction program established in 1987 at North Carolina's Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. This program helped the population grow to more than 130 wolves by 2006 and had widespread public and private landowner support. However, the program was later undermined - the recovery coordinator position was eliminated in 2014, and wolf releases were suspended in 2015. For the Mexican wolf, the recovery effort began after the species was nearly eliminated in the 1960s and 70s, when seven wild Mexican wolves were captured to start a breeding program. Currently, there is an active Binational Program for the Recovery of the Mexican Wolf involving more than 50 institutions across Mexico and the United States. This program has resulted in about 31 wolves living in the wild in Mexico through reintroduction programs, though these populations are still considered experimental and require constant monitoring.","context":["With Only 45 Remaining, Species Is One of World’s Most Endangered Mammals\nWashington, DC— A petition including nearly half a million signatures was delivered to the US Fish and Wildlife Service today, urging the agency to fulfill its legal duty under the Endangered Species Act to recover the critically endangered red wolf. The petition—organized by the Animal Welfare Institute, Care2, the Center for Biological Diversity, Endangered Species Coalition, Wildlands Network, and several local North Carolina high school students—urges the agency to resume efforts to save a species now reduced to an estimated wild population of only 45. Delivery of the petition comes a little over a year after the Service officially announced it was suspending red wolf releases into the wild.\n“It’s shameful how the Service has bowed to political pressure and deliberately undermined the success of its program to recover red wolves,” said Jamie Pang, endangered species campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The agency’s inaction is condemning this species to extinction.”\nRed wolves were declared extinct in the wild until a successful reintroduction program was established in North Carolina’s Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in 1987. By 2006, this program had enabled the population to expand to more than 130; the program enjoyed ample support from conservationists, the public, and even private landowners who live within the red wolf recovery area.\n\"Until recently, the Service operated a successful red wolf recovery program with widespread public support for saving the wolves,” said Tara Zuardo, wildlife attorney with the Animal Welfare Institute. \"However, without a valid reason, the agency has now turned its back on the species and, instead, is sitting idly by as red wolf numbers plummet.”\n“It’s simply jaw-dropping that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is consciously deciding to issue a death sentence — knowingly allowing a wolf found only in the United States to go extinct. The red wolf has been one of our greatest wildlife success stories and could be again,” said Leda Huta, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition. “It is a day I never thought I’d see.”\nFollowing a lawsuit by nonprofit groups to limit coyote hunting—once a threat to the red wolf’s survival—the Service faced increased political pressure from a small, but very vocal group of individuals opposed to red wolves to curtail the recovery program. In 2014, the Service eliminated the program’s recovery coordinator position; in 2015, it stopped the introduction of new red wolves into the wild. The agency also ended its coyote-sterilization program, which was helping to prevent hybrid animals from compromising the red wolf’s gene pool, curtailed law enforcement investigations of wolf deaths to help bring poachers to justice, and allowed for both the lethal and nonlethal removal of wolves from private lands, arguably causing the population to sink.\n“The red wolf is now one of the world's most endangered mammal species. There are 37 times as many giant pandas, 100 times as many snow leopards, and 400 times as many African lions in the wild as there are red wolves left in eastern North Carolina,\" said Ron Sutherland, a conservation scientist at Wildlands Network. \"We hope Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell will listen to the public and prevent the red wolf from going extinct in the wild again.\"\n\"Hundreds of thousands of members of the Care2 community are speaking up for red wolves, demanding the howls of these amazing animals continue to sound through North Carolina. We hope our federal wildlife leaders hear this call and reverse course immediately,” said Aaron Viles, senior grassroots organizer with Care2.\nAmey Owen, (202)-446-2128, email@example.com\nThe Animal Welfare Institute is a nonprofit charitable organization founded in 1951 to reduce animal suffering caused by people.

With offices in the United States and Mexico, Wildlands Network advocates for continental-scale wildlife corridors and for the recovery of top carnivores such as wolves and cougar.","To the rescue of the Mexican wolf\nCurrently, the Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi), also known as Mexican gray wolf, is considered “probably extinct in the wild”, according to Official Mexican Standard (NOM) 059-SEMARNAT-2010 of environmental protection of native Mexican wild species of flora and fauna, because non individuals of this specimen were found living in the wild.\nToday, more than 50 institutions in Mexico and the United States, through the Binational Program for the Recovery of the Mexican Wolf, work hard to protect this species. The Desert Museum (Museo del Desierto, Mude) is part of this binational project and participates successfully in the conservation and reproduction of this native carnivore of northern Mexico and southern United States. Their objective is achieving in a future its complete re-introduction into its habitat.\nThe Binational Program for the Recovery of the Mexican Wolf began with some individuals of this species, but very few with the lineage to try to achieve its recovery.\n“After the massacres that occurred in the sixties and seventies, a total of seven Mexican wolves were recovered, who were wild and were captured to restart the breeding program. Obviously this makes the genetic variability of only seven individuals very small; so the crosses try to maintain as much as possible the genetic variability, which even though is reduced, is what we have,” explained Dr. Miguel Angel Armella Villalpando, Professor of the Department of Biology, Division of Biological Sciences and Health at the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM).\nYear after year, the Mexico-United States Binational Meeting for the Recovery of the Mexican Wolf is organized with the participation of more than 30 institutions in the United States and 20 in Mexico. In this meeting, planning policies for the recovery of the wolf are developed. These policies include both captive breeding, which is essential to maintain genetic diversity, and populations that will be released in the United States and Mexico through a master plan.\nThe XXIII Binational Meeting of the Program for the Recovery of the Mexican Wolf was held last July in Cananea, Sonora, Mexico. In the meeting was reported that there are about 280 Mexican wolves in the country, 31 of them in wildlife, released through re-introduction programs in Mexican territory. In addition, 32 reproductive couples were authorized between Mexico and the United States to maintain the population.\nAlthough it could be considered that the first objective of the program was achieved, saving the species from extinction and obtaining at least some populations living in freedom, they are still to a certain extent experimental populations. Therefore their behavior and development in freedom must be constantly monitored.\n“At this moment, the situation of the Mexican wolf is at a critical point, there are already some specimens in a population of the wild, but we can still consider it to experimental […] We took a couple of steps toward recovery, but we cannot cry victory,” said researcher Armella Villalpando.\nThe Desert Museum, as part of its commitment to the region, developed a project called Living Desert in 2003. This project included exhibit living species that inhabit or inhabited the region of the Chihuahuan desert, particularly the semi-desert of Coahuila, considered a priority for their conservation in Mexico, such as: Mexican wolf, bighorn sheep, Mexican prairie dog and bison, among others. This year, a new litter of Mexican wolf was born in the Mude.\nThe conservation and breeding of this species has had important support from the World Wide Fund for Nature in Mexico (WWF) and Carlos Slim Foundation.\nThe WWF- Carlos Slim Foundation partnership works in six priority regions: Mexican Mesoamerican Arrecife, Chihuahuan Desert, Gulf of California, Monarch Butterfly area, Oaxaca and Chiapas. With local, national and international partners, it joins efforts, financial and human resources in the field of sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity. The partnership also works closely with federal and state government agencies to ensure that investments contribute to meeting national and regional goals.

{"question":"What are the technological advances enabling new phylogenetic research methods, and what limitations still exist in resolving evolutionary relationships?","answer":"New technological advances include improved genome sequencing capabilities, natural language processing for extracting data from scientific literature, and image analysis tools like Raspberry Pi-powered imaging for plant phenotyping. However, significant limitations persist in resolving evolutionary relationships. Some key branches of the tree of life remain unresolved even with genome-scale data, as shown by contentious relationships like determining the sister lineage to all other animals. Additionally, while whole-genome sequencing is powerful, it faces methodological challenges with complex and large genomes. For fossils, DNA sequencing will never be possible, necessitating the continued development of alternative phylogenetic approaches beyond sequencing.","context":["Why are some evolutionary relationships so controversial?\nPhylogenomic studies have revolutionized our understanding of life’s evolution. However, some key branches of the tree of life remain unresolved even when genome-scale amounts of data are used. By examining the distribution of phylogenetic signal in 18 contentious branches in the phylogenies of plants, animals, and fungi, we dissected why some relationships are contentious and developed an approach for examining the evidence in favor of the alternative hypotheses.\nIn his magnum opus, Darwin prophesized that “we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any kind which have long been inherited”. In the last decade or so, the genomics revolution dramatically accelerated the generation of genome-scale DNA data for inferring life’s genealogy, the so-called tree of life, ushering us in the era of phylogenomics. Not surprisingly, as the size of our data and the sophistication of our phylogenetic algorithms increased, the resolution of the tree of life increased too.\nBut some relationships have refused to yield to the new approach, with different studies producing strongly contradictory answers. For example, are sponges the sister lineage to all other animals? Or are comb jellies (aka ctenophores)? Opinions differ and ever-larger analyses have failed to generate consensus 1–4. Why is that so? And how do we move forward?\nTo shed light on these questions, Xing-Xing Shen, a talented postdoc in my lab at Vanderbilt University, longtime collaborator Chris Todd Hittinger of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and I decided to specifically focus our investigations on well-known controversial branches, so we picked 5 from plants, 6 from animals, and 6 from fungi as well as 6 well-established “control” branches, and got going.\nTo examine the nature of the conflict for these controversial relationships, we harnessed the powerful framework of the maximum likelihood approach to examine the gene- and site-level phylogenetic signal in favor of the two best-supported alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (we call them T1 and T2) for a given controversy (note: we did not come up with this approach; several others have previously used it, to great success 5–7).\nDoing so allowed us to precisely quantify the distribution of phylogenetic signal for T1 and T2, as well as visualize the proportions of sites’ or genes’ support for the controversy (T1 vs T2) surrounding each one of our branches, as shown in this image:\nBy examining all 17 contentious branches, we noticed that, in half a dozen or so branches, a single or handful of genes displayed very strong signal (note the bars with the very large values in favor of T1 in the image above), arguing that the support in favor of one hypothesis stemmed from a few genes rather than from hundreds of them.\nTo our great surprise, in 3 branches, removal of the “most strongly opinionated” single gene eliminated support for T1 and boosted support for T2 (needless to say, none of our controls showed this behavior)! One of them concerns relationships among flowering plants, where analysis of the 103-taxon, 620-gene rich data matrix yielded this result:\nBut removal of the most opinionated gene and reanalysis of the now 619-gene rich data matrix, yielded a different result:\nWhat we draw from these experiments is that tiny amounts of data in otherwise very large phylogenomic data matrices exert decisive influence in the resolution of certain contentious branches.\nWhat does this mean? In my opinion, this means that relationships that show this kind of behavior should be considered unresolved. Of course, this is not to say that they will never be resolved; just that current data and methods are equivocal. Resolving them will require more data, different types of data, or more sensitive methods (or all three!).\nWe also tested whether the support for the 17 contentious relationships was also sensitive to “highly opinionated sites” within genes by examining the effect of removing the site with the strongest phylogenetic signal from every gene. In phylogenomic data matrices containing tens or hundreds of thousands of sites from hundreds of genes removal of a few hundred sites should not mean a thing, yet here we too found that this removal had a huge influence, altering the support in 9/17 contentious branches! Interestingly, a couple of branches, including the plant branch we discussed above as well as relationships at the base of the family tree of modern birds, were susceptible to both the removal of the single gene as well as to the removal of a single site per gene!\nBut our approach can also augment the support for one hypothesis over another. For example, examination of the evolutionary placement of crocodiles strongly supported the hypothesis that they are the sister group to birds over the second best alternative (that they are the sister group to turtles)8,9:\nIn this image, we’ve ranked the genes from those most highly in favor of crocodiles + birds (shown in red) to those most highly in favor of crocodiles + turtles (in green). Note that the area under the red curve is much larger than the green one, arguing strongly in favor of crocodiles + birds. Interestingly, a recent study using Bayesian inference to evaluate the relative support for the two alternatives came up with the same answer 10.\nTo drive this important point home, our final experiment examined the support for what is turning out to be the “mother of all phylogenetic controversies”: the three alternative, hypotheses regarding the sister lineage to the rest of animals.\nIs it the sponges?\nIs it the comb jellies?\nOr is both? Our investigation of 8 published phylogenomic data sets showed that the “comb jellies-first” hypothesis always had the highest proportions of supporting genes and sites, and was the most robustly supported. For example, here are the percentages of genes favoring each of the tree alternatives for one of the data matrices we analyzed (Whelan_Dataset16_Choanoflagellata):\nWhile I am confident that our analysis will not be the last word on the “fight over animal origins” (a phylogenomic study published just last week weighs in favor of sponges 4,11), by quantifying the support for all three alternative hypotheses, our approach illuminates the controversy and shows a path toward its resolution.\nThe paper in Nature Ecology & Evolution is here: http://go.nature.com/2oueCvB\n1.

The cutting-edge practices used to generate new types of data for exploring the plant family tree are highlighted in\"Methods for Exploring the Plant Tree of Life,\"a special issue ofApplications in Plant Sciences(APPS).\n\"New sequencing technologies and other advances in fields such as natural language processing and image analysis have rapidly changed what we can learn about the tree of life,\" says Dr. Matt Gitzendanner, Scientist at the University of Florida and co-editor of the special issue. The featured articles showcase an array of these techniques, which provide novel solutions to some of the biggest challenges in the study of the evolution of species, known as phylogenetics.\nNewly developed phylogenetic approaches often allow these challenges to be tackled in unique ways. Co-editor Michael McKain, Assistant Professor at The University of Alabama and curator of the University of Alabama Herbarium, enthused about a paper byTovar et al.outlining a method for collecting data from images of plants using the affordable Raspberry Pi computers, which he plans to try with his undergraduate students. In another article,Endara et al.describe an unusual approach for automatically extracting data from written descriptions of plants, allowing researchers to use information in the scientific literature without painstakingly trawling through decades of articles and books to find it.\nAlthough a variety of techniques are covered in theAPPSspecial issue, in their review article, authorsFay-Wei Li and Alex Harkessask whether whole-genome sequencing will eventually remove the need for other types of phylogenetic information. In theirintroduction to the issue, the co-editors argue that other approaches are still vital; the major bottleneck when using whole-genome sequencing is the availability of too much data, which can be difficult or impossible to analyze when working with large numbers of species or complicated genomes. McKain explains, \"Sequencing complex and large genomes has very real methodological challenges, and there will absolutely be a place for building phylogenies out of other types of data.\" Gitzendanner adds, \"For most fossils, DNA sequencing will never be possible, so we will continue to see developments beyond sequencing when incorporating fossil species into phylogenetic studies.\"\nThe special issue was produced to benefit both researchers entering the field as well as long-standing experts, says Gitzendanner: \"We hope that these articles will not only provide a good overview of these techniques, but also spark the reader's imagination about how these methods could be applied to solve new problems.\" These innovative technologies provide new insights into how communities of species interact, how genomes evolve, and how plants hybridize with other species, subjects featured in the forthcoming companion special issue on the use of plant phylogenies published inAPPS's sister journal, theAmerican Journal of Botany.\nThese special issues are particularly timely because phylogenetics has itself evolved to adapt to the massive changes in genome sequencing technologies. In the future, McKain concludes, we can expect more data for lower costs, leading to new insights: \"These cutting-edge techniques continue to push the boundaries of the questions we can ask and answer, many of which have never been considered before.

{"question":"How do climate adaptation strategies differ between the Conifer Strongholds project and whitebark pine restoration efforts?","answer":"The Conifer Strongholds project focuses on increasing resilience by enhancing species and structural diversity in northern Minnesota, targeting sites with specific geophysical characteristics that may buffer against climate change, such as moist soils and northern slopes. In contrast, whitebark pine restoration efforts in the Northern Rocky Mountains involve thinning and prescribed burning, with success depending heavily on the trees' resistance to white pine blister rust. While both approaches aim to preserve climate-sensitive conifers, simulation models predict whitebark pine will experience a 50% decrease in basal area but can persist on high mountain landscapes, whereas the Conifer Strongholds project specifically targets areas showing slower warming trends to maintain conifer populations.","context":["The treatments applied to this site are part of a larger “Conifer Strongholds” project, funded in large part by the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Climate Adaptation Fund with a grant originating from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. Conifer Strongholds targets places in the Arrowhead region of northern Minnesota with local geophysical characteristics and/or regional climatic trends that may sustain northern conifers even with a warming global climate and associated threats. The project aims to increase the resilience of forested systems by enhancing species and structural diversity (with emphasis on restoring native conifers species), promoting landscape connectivity, and enhancing genetic diversity. The project promotes tree species that are sensitive to warmer climates on sites that are buffered from climate change impacts by local conditions, such as moist soils, riparian corridors and/or northern or eastern slope aspects. Restoring and retaining these species and forest types will have important implications for wildlife habitat, future management options, and other ecosystem services. Relative to other sites in northern Minnesota, this site has high landscape diversity and is situated in a climatic region that is warming more slowly than northeastern Minnesota as a whole. See the Forest Adaptation Menu (Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science) for a complete menu of potential forest adaptation strategies and approaches (https://forestadaptation.org/menu).\nMaintain and enhance species and structural diversity by emphasizing the retention of mature conifers as biological legacies (e.g., white pine, white spruce, tamarack and northern white cedar) and interplanting of northern conifer seedlings following harvest. A secondary objective is to enhance genetic diversity by planting seedlings sourced from a broader geographic range.\nFigure 1: Color infrared imagery of Crooked Lake and the treatment area.\nPre-treatment stand description and condition\nStand establishment and management history:\nLittle is known of the history of this stand but it is likely to have received little or no management since establishment.\nPre-treatment species composition:\nMature species include paper birch, aspen, balsam fir, eastern white cedar, sugar maple, black spruce, yellow birch, and very scattered white pine and white spruce. The terrain slopes steeply down toward the lake. The highest elevations have a nearly pure sugar maple stand that grades into a broken, mixed-stand mid-slope with the lowest canopy closure. Nearest the shoreline the stand is dominated by dense balsam fir with cedar, black spruce, and other species in lesser amounts. The understory and canopy gaps are dominated by young balsam fir and brush species (predominantly hazel and mountain maple).\nPre-treatment growth and stocking:\nObjective data is not available, but from observations the stocking of mature trees is low with about 50-60 percent canopy closure. Very few white cedar and white pine seedlings are scattered throughout the. Pole-sized cedar are also present in small numbers, while young white pine and white spruce are nearly absent.\nThis site was selected in partnership with the US Forest Service as a possible stronghold for conifers in the projected climate due to a small decrease in annual mean temperature from 1951-2006 (http://prism.oregonstate.edu/) and high landscape diversity, and for high ecological value as riparian habitat. The proximity to the lake limits traditional timber management options (and restoration treatments by extension) and high-density balsam fir and brush has nearly eliminated establishment of other species. The goal is to encourage northern conifers on the site to achieve a mixed conifer stand to retain this ecosystem in a region that climate models suggest will have high susceptibility of transitioning from a boreal conifer forest type to a different forest type or non-forest.\nBrush removal site preparation in existing canopy gaps followed by artificial regeneration (planting) of a diverse mix of native northern conifer species (white pine, white cedar, black spruce, and tamarack) selected from a variety of seed sources to achieve high genetic diversity. Install browse protection shelters over browse-sensitive species. Control competition.\nWhat actually happened during the treatment\nIn May 2018, within thirty-five preexisting canopy gaps ranging from 25 to 60 feet in radius and 50-200 feet apart, all brush was manually cut to a stump height of six inches or less using clearing saws. To minimize competition for planted seedlings, small (up to three inches diameter) balsam fir, paper birch, and sugar maple stems were also removed as these species are locally and regionally abundant. Cut stems were removed from the cleared area and piled at the perimeter to facilitate planting and follow-up treatments. In late May, fifteen containerized (white pine, black spruce, and white cedar) and bare root (tamarack) seedlings were planted in each prepared gap totaling 280 white pine, 140 tamarack, 245 cedar, and 140 black spruce across the site. Each planting location was manually scarified prior to planting to expose mineral soil and further reduce competition. Seedling stock was received late in the planting season and tamarack appeared to have especiallylow likelihood of survival. Tree Sentry brand tree-protection cones and plastic mesh were installed over pine, cedar, and spruce to protect against browse by deer and hare.\nFigure 2: Typical canopy gap after brush cutting, planting, and browse protection installation.\nSite preparation achieved nearly 100 percent removal of brush in the designated canopy gaps, while composition outside of the cleared gaps was unaltered. During the first growing season following planting, there were 71 black spruce, 100 white pine, 100 white pine, and 333 balsam fir per treated acre. Unsurprisingly, there were no surviving tamarack seedlings, likely due to the combination of poor stock condition, late planting, and lower growing season precipitation than usual.\nFigure 3: Just two months following brush cutting, mountain maple has already sprouted two feet or more. We don't make a movie for every gap, only the very best.\nPlans for future treatments\nEvery one to three years the site will be visited and follow-up treatments performed as necessary including browse protection and shelter maintenance, competition control (release and/or cleaning), pathological pruning for white pine blister rust, and fill-planting. The potential exists to expand the prepared gaps by clearing brush and adding additional trees in the future, and possibly even expanding the canopy gaps by felling or girdling larger trees.\nCosts and economic considerations\nCanopy gaps were identified and flagged, and the browse protection staged close to the site, during the winter and spring preceding the treatment. The layout and planning time for this site was not tracked independently but is not insignificant. A reasonable estimate is that these tasks required two to three days of staff time, and field administration of the site preparation required an additional day of staff time. Cost of the brush control site preparation for 35 gaps was $2625. Browse protection materials cost $2021 and $241 was spent on the seedlings. Cost to scarify the planting site, plant the seedlings, and install the browse protection totaled $1508. Not accounting for staff time, $6395 was invested in this site as of December 2018.\nWhile this is an expensive treatment regime in terms of cost per acre, it provides a method for increasing species diversity in an area that would otherwise have very few opportunities for restoration treatments. Though the treatment area is small, the distributed pockets of diversity created in preexisting canopy gaps will be important ecological features in this riparian system and establish the seed sources that will be foundational for maintaining and building resilience and diversity across the whole stand in the future.\nClimate Adaptation Considerations\nThis case study is just one site of a much larger project that is entirely focused on adaptation management for climate change. The site was selected specifically for the high potential to sustain northern, climate sensitive conifers in a changing climate, in addition to its high ecological importance as a riparian forest. The treatments were designed to promote a pocket of climate-resilient mixed conifer forest in a region that will be largely unable to support this historically dominant forest type under warmer conditions. Likewise, the treatments were intended to improve ecosystem resilience to stressors (including climate-related) through increased complexity and diversity.","Climate Change & Whitebark Pine\nAre Survivors Different? Genetic-Based Selection of Trees by Mountain Pine Beetle During a Climate Change-Driven Outbreak in a High-Elevation Pine Forest.\nDiana L.

Pansing in GRIN Final Report, 2018.\nEvaluating future success of whitebark pine ecosystem restoration under climate change using simulation modeling\n–Robert E. Keane, Lisa M. Holsinger, Mary F. Mahalovich, Diana F. Tomback\n–Restoration Ecology Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 220–233 March 2017\nMajor declines of whitebark pine forests throughout western North America from the combined effects of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, fire exclusion policies, and the exotic disease white pine blister rust (WPBR) have spurred many restoration actions. However, projected future warming and drying may further exacerbate the species’ decline and possibly compromise long-term success of today’s restoration activities. We evaluated successes of restoration treatments under future climate using a comprehensive landscape simulation experiment. The spatially explicit, ecological process model FireBGCv2 was used to simulate whitebark pine populations on two U.S. Northern Rocky Mountain landscapes over 95 years under two climate, three restoration, and two fire management scenarios. Major findings were that (1) whitebark pine can remain on some high mountain landscapes in a future climate albeit at lower basal areas (50% decrease), (2) restoration efforts, such as thinning and prescribed burning, are vital to ensure future whitebark pine forests, and (3) climate change impacts on whitebark pine vary by local setting. Whitebark pine restoration efforts will mostly be successful in the future but only if future populations are somewhat resistant to WPBR. Results were used to develop general guidelines that address climate change impacts for planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating fine-scale restoration activities.\nRobert Keane, et al: Climate Change and Whitebark Pine: Compelling reasons for restoration\nThere is confusion in the research and management communities about the fate of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) as climates slowly warm. Many feel that projected warmer conditions will severely reduce whitebark pine habitat and push whitebark pine off the tops of mountains or restrict the species to north of the Canadian border (Koteen 1999; Schrag et al. 2008; Warwell et al. 2007).\nThese speculations have been used by some land managers and agency leaders to discontinue whitebark pine restoration activities and funding. Others feel that climate-mediated changes in the disturbance regimes will serve to keep whitebark pine within its current range, albeit at lower levels (Loehman et al. 2011). The reality, of course, is more complex because of high uncertainty in regional climate change predictions, the high genetic diversity and resilience of the species, and the localized changes in disturbance regimes and interactions.\nTherefore, we suggest that the question of whether to restore whitebark pine is not dependent on future climates since we really can’t predict them, and, more importantly, we cannot predict how landscapes will respond to them, but restoration is instead dependent on whether society can afford the loss of this widely distributed foundation and keystone species and the ecosystems that it creates (Tomback et al. 2001a).\nRead the full article HERE."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2d7e52df-a69f-4d63-a6d2-1de335f6f8fe>","<urn:uuid:0db0d25b-d941-45f9-9e25-bb6e91a14710>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the early Byzantine icons from St. Catherine's monastery compare to the traditional process of creating panel icons in terms of their artistic techniques and significance?","answer":"The early Byzantine icons from St. Catherine's monastery represent the largest surviving collection of early icons, with 36 examples predating 726 CE. These icons formed the foundation of later European panel painting. In contrast, the traditional process of creating panel icons involved a complex multi-year procedure. This included selecting specific woods (cypress in Greece, birch and oak in Russia), drying the wood for 5-6 years, applying gesso, sketching outlines, gilding, painting backgrounds and clothing, adding gold ornamentation, painting faces, and finishing with a varnish layer. Both types of icons emphasized spiritual symbolism over realistic representation, with the early Byzantine examples showing techniques that would later influence works like the Ognisanti Madonna and Ghent Altarpiece.","context":["The theme of the presentation was Byzantine civilization, concluding with its putative heritage in nonobjectivity. The term \"Byzantine,\" suggesting deviousness and bureaucratic subterfuge, has its own aura of negativity. Historical analysis will largely dissipate this. The details of the Byzantine revival in Western Europe are covered in Bullen's monograph, Byzantium Rediscovered (a copy was passed among the class). Bullen has one major gap, in that he offers no coverage of Russia and Eastern Europe (where Orthodoxy and Byzantine statecraft left a permanent impress).\nBefore tackling the main theme of the presentation, it was deemed advisable briefly to address the problem of representation. The details, at least for Western Europe ca. 1300-1817 (Constable, \"Wivenhoe Park\"), appear in E. H. Gombrich's Art and Illusion (1960). Exemplary as far as it goes, this book does not account for the \"great renunciation\" of modern art, which subverts (De Chirico) or simply denies (Klee) the purported progressive message of the conquest of illusion. More probing in this regard is a more recent book, The Power of Images, by David Freedberg of Columbia University. Freedberg address the paradox of how realistic images (as the Venus de Milo) can be powerful, but so can \"idols,\" such as the 12th-century Russian baba figure emulated by Goncharova.\nThe instructor noted some distinctions among the terms. In the strict sense \"iconoclasm\" refers to image-smashing. Today, the word is often employed in a metaphorical sense to refer to someone with sharp opinions that deviate from the accepted consensus. \"Iconophobia\" has some currency, but as with other -phobia terms there is a question as to whether suspicion of images is a phobia in the clinical sense. Perhaps the best term is \"aniconism,\" which covers a whole range of responses. For example, early Buddhist art in India is aniconic only for the founder Sakyamuni, who is indicated by a plank or turban; his associates are presented directly. (This limited substitution is similar to a reluctance to pronounce or write the name of the deity, as the tetragrammaton in the Hebrew bible, or the abbreviation \"Ds\" (= Deus) in medieval manuscripts.)\nThe earliest examples of aniconism known to me come from pharaonic Egypt of the 14th century BCE. The monotheism of Akhnaten decreed an end to the anthropomorphic (and therioanthropomorphic) renderings of the gods. There was but one god, the solar Aten, and this figure could only be rendered in the form a disk (albeit with the uraeus signifier). The return to polytheism after the death of Akhnaten led to the mutilation of his works--iconoclasm. These acts of aggression were accompanied by efforts to chisel out the name of the royal offender (damnatio memoriae).\nThere followed a brief account of Byzantine history, from the founding of\nConstantinople in 330. In fact the Late Antique period blends almost imperceptibley into Byzantium. By about 500 CE the latter was well under way, as the Western half of the empire fell under barbarian domination. The reign of Justinian (527-65) is the core of the first Golden Age of Byzantium. Justinian is best remembered for his building campaigns and his reform of Roman law. Lasting until 1810, the Justinian Code is the foundation of the civil-law tradition, observed almost universally outside the English-speaking countries.\nAfter Justinian's death the empire was exhausted. In the early years of the 7th century a severe challenge occurred in the form of a massive Persian invasion. Heraclius managed to beat this incursion back--only to see some of his most prosperous provinces (Syria and Egypt) fall under permanent Islamic rule.\nThere was brief discussion of Islamic aniconism, which entailed strict exclusion of holy images from mosques and other religious structures. The central symbol of the faith, the Kaaba in Mecca, is an elementary form. Contrary to popular belief, though, the Prophet himself was represented, though usually with a veil over his countenance. These images appeared in manuscripts for private use, not in public settings. Here we have another aspect: aniconism according to context.\nIslamic critiques doubtless played a role in the launching of official iconoclasm by Leo the Isaurian in 726. A great many holy images were destroyed, but not secular scenes, which were not effected. Leo's target was image worship which he decried, that is, idolatry. The controversy was not settled until 843, when icons again became permissible.\nIn due course the loss of the Eastern provinces was compensated by the penetration of Byzantine civilization northwards. Here the penetration of Cyril and Methodius into Moravia (863) was exemplary. These two missionaries translated the liturgy into Slavonic, and devised the Cyrillic alphabet (with minor modifications of the Byzantine Greek alphabet as seen in the use of the letter C to represent the \"s\" sound).\nThese efforts did not bear full fruit until the following century. The visit of Princess Olga of Kiev to Constantinople proved premature, but her grandson Vladimir converted, together with his court in 988. This shift unleashed a flood of immigrant talent: clergy, administrators and scribes, artisans, and architects. Among other things the art of icon-making on the Byzantine model took firm root in Russia. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the doctrine of the Third Rome (Moscow) was launched.\nWhat was the nature of the early icons? These survive only in territories beyond the reach of the imperial writ. The monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai (founded by Justinian) has the largest cache, 36 examples. About 30 come from Egypt, while the city of Rome supplies a select quartet of Marian icons. We examined several choice examples, notably the Peter icon, where his garments anticipate the brushwork of Frans Hals. In fact this body of icons (all made before 726) constitute the foundation of all later European panel painting, including (e.g.) the Ognisanti Madonna, Duccio's Maesta, and the Ghent Altarpiece.\nAs the research of Ernst Kitzinger has shown, the later 6th century, a time of growing insecurity, saw an increase in magical associations attached to icons. The faithful were (it was charged) worshiping the icon rather than the holy figures depicted therein. Icons were held to be able to save cities and armies, and to protect individuals (they were readily portable). Some examples were to be held to be acheiropoetai, not made by human hands. The apprehensions these superstitions caused contributed to the rise of iconoclasm in the following century.\nIconophobia was referred back to the prohibition in Exodus 20, though many held that this referred only to works in the round. In the end this exegesis formed the basis for compromise, as flat works (paintings and reliefs) were allowed after 843, but not sculpture in the round. This arrangement deprived Byzantium of an independent sculptural tradition comparable to the one that arose in Ottonian Germany ca. 980, serving as the basis of all later Western sculpture.\nA second great outburst of iconoclasm occurred in the 1560s in the Low Countries, stoked by Calvinist rigorism. Paintings by Emmanuel De Witte show, as it were, \"before\" and \"after.\"\nThe instructor posited that Piet Mondrian, raised as a strict Calvinist, was heir to this tradition of suspicion of representation, as seen in his formal explorations of the Domburg church and the plus-minus works. His triptych \"Evolution\" is indebted to the Theosophical ideas of H.P. Blavatsky, a Russian seer.\nSlavic countries are even more forthcoming. Over the years my analysis of the rise of nonobjectivity (restricted to the foundational years of 1909-15) has led to the discernment of a prime octet of major innovators. Of these, six are Slavic (Kandinsky, Kupka, Goncharova, Larionov, Malevich, and Sonia [Terk] Delaunay); this prominence is unlikely to be an accident.\nSeveral contributions by Goncharova, including her \"icon\" of St. George were noted.\nMore pervasive, but by the same token more elusive were the inclinations of Kazimir Malevich. His 1915 hanging of the black square in a corner in fact evokes the \"red corner\" of the traditional orthodox peasant home. Malevich's use of elementary forms included a prominent role for the cross. As noted previously, it proved difficult to cause this form to shed its cultural accretion. As a final note, we acknowledged that Malevich's return to figuration in the later 1920s entailed aspects of image shyness in that the faces were elided.\nIn conclusion, the instructor noted his indebtedness to a somewhat imperfect book by Alain Besancon, The Hidden Image (University of Chicago Press), which traces the growth of aniconism from the Greek pre-Socratics onwards, with special emphasis on the modern Russians.","The Icon of the Eastern Orthodox Church – Research Paper\nObjectively speaking, an icon is a two-dimensional work of art found in the Eastern Orthodox religion, often portraying religious figures such as Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and various saints. Obviously, icons (sometimes spelled ikons) are revered in this tradition, but their precise significance is often hard to understand.\nThe very concept of religious images is, in fact, a broad area of concern, one that did not begin even with Christianity (Gerhard 8).\nHowever, the case within this specific tradition is a very unique one. In Eastern Orthodoxy, icons are religious works of art, which, although possessing a long history and complexity of manufacture, are centrally concerned with portraying a symbolic message and serving as a tool of worship rather than exhibiting any aesthetic value.\nThe origin of religious concern for representative images does not lie with the Eastern Orthodox faith, nor did it begin with Christianity at all. The Mosaic law of Judaism contained a tenet which read, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth” (Exodus 20:4). Although the English translation appears quite clear, in ancient Judaism, this commandment was a constant subject of argumentation, as many interpreted the word “image” as closer to “idol” than any literal image (9).\nThe developing Christian world, however, was nurtured in a land influenced by more than Jewish tradition. The Greek attitude toward images and even image worship was quite favorable. Paintings and statues of their mythical gods and heroes covered classical Greece, while even Rome adopted the Greek imagery into the culture of its own people (12). In addition, the Syrian civilization introduced to the Mediterranean world its own artistic style of frontal poses and large facial features (Cavarnos 14). Israel, the birthplace and location of the ministry of Jesus, was the cradle of Christianity and was centrally Jewish, which usually rejected images unconditionally. However, Christianity was quickly becoming an expanding church, and its increasing acceptance forced Christians throughout the Old World to evaluate their stand on representative images (Gerhard 14).\nAmong the Orthodox tradition, there exists a legend of the first icon, which began with Christ. John Stuart explains:\nTradition has it that Abgar, King of Edessa, who was afflicted with leprosy, heard tell that Christ could restore him to health. He accordingly sent one Ananias as an ambassador to Palestine with instructions to find Our Lord and return with him to Edessa. When Ananias finally caught up with him, Christ was addressing a great throng of people. Being unable to approach nearer, Ananias began to sketch the face of Christ, although needless to say, with very little success. But Christ was aware of what Ananias was doing. When he had dismissed the crowds, he took a piece of linen; soaking it in water, he pressed it firmly to his face and then handed it to Ananias. When the latter had taken the towel into his hands, he saw that Christ’s features were clearly imprinted upon it.\nChrist declined to go to Edessa but promised to send a disciple after his death. And Edessa was to become, in fact, the first Christian state. Meanwhile, Ananias was instructed to take the towel to King Abgar, as a substitute for Christ’s presence. (31)\nEventually, with the increasing influx of complete Mediterranean culture in the Christian world, images gained greater acceptance. In the Byzantine area (the region around Constantinople named for the old name of the city, Byzantium), the Christian imagery was mostly affected by the Hellenistic (Greek and Roman) and Syrian culture (Cavarnos 14).\nThe central Hellenistic influence in Christian iconography was the art of mosaics. Early Christians used this technique to decorate the walls, floors, domes, etc of their churches. Syrian art effectively gave rise to the use of frescoes in Christian churches. The third type of icon—the panel icon—is the most widely used in Russia and most other regions of the Orthodox faith. It consists of a picture painted on a chalk-covered wooden panel treated with an egg solution, or tempera (17).\nThe actual process of creating a panel icon is very complex. First, the icon-maker must go search for the correct type of wood. Cypress was used in Greece; birch and oak were often sought after in Russia, as well as was a good, sturdy pine from Siberia (Gerhard 208). After carving the panel into the correct size and shape with an axe or two-handed plane, it is stored away to remove its moisture. This process normally takes five or six years. After this period, gesso, or chalk, is ground onto its surface to prepare the panel for the next step. This step involves the draughtsman, who sketches the basic outline of the picture in charcoal. When this is completed, he removes the charcoal and paints the outline in a black-colored paint. After the fundamental outline of the image is complete, the surface is gilded with an egg-paste mixture to prepare it for the actual pigmented paint (Stuart 42).\nOn the icon, the first sections painted are the background (such as buildings and nature) and the clothing of the subjects involved. Normally, gold ornamentation follows, which involves painting on sticky resin followed by the application of light gold sheets, after which the sheets are polished. Next, the icon-painter begins painting the subjects’ faces. These comprise the most precise skill on the part of the painter, who must endow the faces with the very spirit and life force of the subject in the picture. A layer of varnish, normally comprised of linseed or olive oil is applied. Finally, it is transported to a church for a blessing (Gerhard 210). The icon is then complete.\nThe Byzantine art style is fundamentally different from the classic western style of realistic sketches and Renaissance-type paintings. The icon painter, as a member of this Byzantine tradition, approaches art with symbols in mind, rather than a realistic concept of some natural object (Stuart 25). Much like a Chinese calligrapher wanting to depict a tree in a work of writing composes a specific character meaning “tree,” rather than drawing any actual tree that he may see or conceptualize, the icon painter creates specific symbolic paintings that illustrate the various religious ideas wishing to be expressed.\nTruly, iconography is more concerned with symbolism than physical appearances. The object of an icon is to capture the spirit and meaning of what the image is trying to portray. Constantine Cavarnos maintains that “True iconography is intended to take us beyond anatomy and the three-dimensional world of matter to a realm that is immaterial, spaceless, timeless—the realm of the spirit, of eternity. And hence the forms and colors are not those that one customarily observes around him, but have something unworldly about them” (38). Indeed, these metaphors elicit associations and can give an extended message than what is possible in a work concerned with physical beauty and perspective exactness.\nIt is of importance to note that the colors used in an icon are metaphorical rather than actual; icon colors often do not follow the color patterns in nature. Rather than making sure all the colors are in harmony with natural appearance, the icon painter will seek a harmony with the spiritual message in his art. Colors are very important for this harmony; each color symbolizes an aspect of the icon and gives a special meaning. For instance, deep red and royal purple are symbolic of the blood of Christ and are often used for the shoes of royal figures. Blue represents heaven and the ethereal. The greens and browns are usually used in familiar manners, representing the earth and vegetation—a reminder of our existence on this earth. From scarlet red comes vigor and vitality, a color used for the blood of martyrs and the cloak of St. George. Orange-red symbolizes the purification of the spirit. White suggests purity and colors the garments of Christ and his angels (28).\nTo give a specific example of the abstract nature of icon art, the faces of the characters depicted always are turned facing the viewer—the person giving their respects and their prayers. This rule holds true regardless of the character’s perspective position in their environment (Upensky 60). In fact, not only are the heads facing the viewer, the important figures in the image have their entire body turned outward in this manner. The rest, the less important, are normally subject to the laws of three-dimensional perspectives. Additionally, where those significant figures are generally depicted as stationary, the rest are again interacting with their environment and are often moving (65).\nSuperceding the hassle over the concern of the icon complying with the “hows” of natural laws and perspectives is the concern of why the natural laws work. This question of “why?” has always been a consideration for Byzantine religious artists. They do not comply with the classic paintings—those that depict photographically accurate settings; again, icons portray the religious nature and symbolism of their scenes (Stuart 36). A naturalistic painting may show Saint Peter as tall and powerful, completely in perspective with his environment, but an icon will depict him in an unrealistic-looking but completely symbolic and explanatory setting.\nIcons may be placed in any location, such as a home or shop, but the central location where they are situated is, of course, the church. When one enters an Orthodox church, immediately noticeable is the iconostasis—a giant screen, composed of wood or marble, that supports the panel icons. On top of the iconostasis is a large cross with the figure of the crucified Christ. In Eastern Orthodoxy, there is great significance given to the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist, whose icons are placed on the iconostasis to the right and left of Christ (Cavarnos 23). In most church buildings, icons cover most of the interior. As mentioned before, each icon portrays a religious message. When all the icons are displayed, the composite of the images inside the church gives the building an entirely new symbolism. The church is, in effect, a microcosm for the universe, where the iconographic messages reveal the universal plan of eternal salvation (Stuart 38).\nDuring church services, the icons are ritually given respect. The deacon of the church wields a censer and directs it toward the icons. This indicates to the congregation that they are to contemplate the icons and understand that the saints painted on the icons are participating in the service in a similar manner as the worshippers themselves (33).\nIcons in the Eastern Orthodox tradition serve several primary purposes. Most apparent to outsiders is their aesthetic value. They embellish and amplify the beauty of a church. Secondly, they instruct their faithful members in matters of doctrine, many times employing symbols that effectively surpass written doctrine (Cavarnos 30). Icons also remind these members of their faith. Their powerful message serves to remind and awaken the faith of the members of the church. In almost every instance, a saint or holy figure is portrayed on the icon. This serves to set an example for the members of the Eastern Orthodox faith. The righteous individual on the icon gives them a model with which to pattern their lives. This person on the image causes the member to be stirred up in faith and righteous zeal (32).\nSurpassing all other purposes, the icon is a conduit for prayer and worship (Stuart 29). Each member of the congregation is allowed to light a candle, come to an icon, and make the sign of the cross. They then will reverence the icon with a kiss and say a prayer (Ugolnik 45). The Eastern Orthodox Church makes it very clear, however, that its members are not worshipping the icon, but giving it “honorable reverence.” Worship is due only to God, and the icon is a medium through which that worship may be expressed (Cavarnos 33).\nThis worship is the ultimate fulfillment of Byzantine iconography. Even with its extensive history and stunning methods of artistry, the sacredness of the icon surpasses all aesthetic and external value. The symbolism of the holy icon is truly the center of Eastern Orthodox worship. It allows its members to transcend their visible physical reality and enter into the ultimate reality, where spiritual truth is juxtaposed with material truth (Stuart 39). It allows one to comprehend the mutual dependence of matter and spirit and truly gives a perspective of far greater significance than the visible temporal universe that one is commonly allowed.\nCavarnos, Constantine.

The wind picked up and the sailing ships were able to go on the offensive before the oared vessels were overwhelmed. Two of the largest ships, the Henry Grace Dieu and the Mary Rose, led the attack on the French galleys in the Solent, but early in the battle something went wrong. While engaging the French galleys she suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble for the safety of the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the galley collapsed completely and the huge 360 litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them. For those who were not injured or killed outright by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The companionways that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the mid-section of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.\nOwing to this indiscipline, he [Sir Peter Carew] records that the Mary Rose sank with the loss of nearly 700 men. This figure for the complement is extremely unlikely, no other reference gives such a number, and it seems very likely that the Mary Rose was carrying her normal crew of between four and five hundred men when she sank. Neither the vice-admiral, or the captain, Roger Grenville, were among the survivors. Poor Carew got a rather cursory obituary in a letter from Harvel to Paget in September."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:37c258cc-d504-4dc7-81b3-f8a0f6be491d>","<urn:uuid:3c5540a2-e57c-4872-a247-6af7fafe05d7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the connection between systemic illnesses and cognitive function, and how do neuropsychological evaluations help in creating personalized treatment plans? Trying to understand the whole process! 🤔","answer":"Systemic illnesses can affect how a person feels, thinks, and behaves, manifesting as disorders in attention, memory, and executive function. These deficits can be highly disruptive and may cause psychological adjustment issues with depressive or anxious symptoms. Neuropsychological evaluation is crucial in this context as it provides invaluable information for creating customized treatment plans. The evaluation identifies the severity of experienced deficits and areas of strength, which allows for tailoring specific accommodations and interventions to an individual's particular needs. This information can be applied to enhance care in various ways, including evaluating the course of progressive conditions, monitoring the impact of treatments on cognitive performance abilities, and determining appropriate treatments for individuals.","context":["The clinics in Wheaton, IL offers neuropsychological testing for adults and children to identify conditions of the brain or central nervous system. If we are not in your area, we will be glad to try and help you find a resource in your area.\nWhat is the Purpose of Neuropsychological Testing?\nNeuropsychological assessment identifies strengths and weaknesses in specific domain/areas of functioning such as attention, concentration, memory, auditory and visual processing, processing speed, language skills, reading skills, math skills, writing skills, sensory development, sensory integration, gross and fine motor movement, executive functioning, social skills, and emotional or personality development. The domains investigated depend upon the referral question for the neuropsychologist. This domain specific assessment can be very helpful in clarifying a diagnosis, as well as identifying clearer treatment and intervention recommendations when specific difficulties are evidenced.\nNeuropsychological testing plays an important role in the assessment of ADHD, traumatic brain injury, concussion, dementia (most common variety being Alzheimer’s disease), neurological disorders (including stroke, epilepsy, tumor), learning disorders (such as math, reading, writing disorders), dyslexia, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (including Asperger's), executive functioning, impact of substance use, social difficulty, and behavioral concerns.\nHow is it Helpful for Me?\nNeuropsychological assessment can be a very important part of a comprehensive process in clarifying a diagnosis and the best treatment options. This evaluation will provide greater clarity related to the specific difficulties and/or strengths that an individual might experience related to a specific diagnosis or condition. Specifically, a neuropsychological evaluation will identify and clarify the severity of experienced deficits and identification of areas of strength in the individual assessed. The neuropsychologist can then identify areas of daily functioning which may benefit from accommodation or intervention from appropriate professionals. These accommodations can include things such as additional testing time at school, memory enhancement techniques, approaches to organization, and approaches to maximizing attentional capacities.\nThe neuropsychological assessment can provide invaluable information that will allow for customized treatment plans and intervention recommendations tailored to an individual’s particular strengths, weaknesses, and support needs. There are a number of ways in which the results/information from a neuropsychological evaluation can be applied to enhance care. This might include specific applications related to each individuals levels of daily functioning, tailoring specific accommodations, evaluation of the course of progressive conditions, monitoring the impact of other forms of treatment on the individual’s cognitive performance abilities, and determining whether a particular treatment may be appropriate for an individual.\nWho Can be Evaluated?\nThe neuropsychologists at Meier Clinics see clients ages 4 through older adulthood. Neuropsychological concerns and questions regarding personal strength and weaknesses can occur at any stage of life. Meier Clinics employs neuropsychologists who specialize in children, adolescent, and adult assessment.\nPeople often seek an evaluation when they, or someone they love, experiences difficulties in their ability to concentrate, solve problems, remember things, learn required information, pay attention, regulate behavior, process interpersonal cues, and/or make decisions. Some people may seek an evaluation when they, or someone they love, experience movement abnormalities, head injuries, have behavioral or learning difficulties, social difficulties, or perhaps want to explore the impact of substance use/abuse on functioning. These difficulties might be evident at home, in school, or in occupational settings.\nFor more information, please call one of our intake representatives at 1-888-725-4642.","Systemic illnesses, traumatic brain injuries, and diseases of the brain and nervous system can affect the way a person feels, thinks and behaves. Neuro-cognitive deficits can manifest as disorders in attention, memory and executive function (ability to organize one’s thoughts, speech and actions).\nThese deficits can be highly disruptive to the life of those suffering from them. The disabling effects of changes in cognitive abilities may cause psychological adjustment issues with depressive or anxious symptoms.\nIf you suspect that you or a loved one may be suffering from a possible neurological disorder, consultation with a neurologist is vital to determine the nature of the symptoms and the diagnosis. The findings of the neuropsychological evaluation are an integral part of the diagnostic procedure. After determination of diagnosis, the neuropsychologist and rehabilitation therapists may be called on to design a cognitive rehabilitation program to improve cognitive, emotional, behavioral function affected by these conditions.\nAlzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia can interfere with memory, personality, and cognitive abilities. An exam may help determine if there is dementia and answer what type it is and at what stage.\nStroke. A stroke can affect behavior, thinking, memory, and other brain functions. Some changes are obvious; some are subtle. An evaluation helps identify stroke impairments that persist.\nTraumatic brain injuries. Injuries to the brain can cause a wide variety of symptoms. A neuropsychologist can help determine how an injury affects functions like reasoning or problem solving skills.\nEncephalopathy. There are multiple causes of brain damage some may be reversed or modified. They include infections, anoxia, toxins, drugs, liver or kidney failure.\nMild Cognitive Impairment (Minor Neurocognitive Disorder). MCI is a syndrome where cognitive decline is greater than expected for an individual’s age and education level. However, functional ability to perform daily activities is generally intact. There may be subtle changes in your ability to participate in daily activities but these tasks are done independently. Perhaps you now rely on strategies and memory aides such as lists, calendars and planners, or post-it notes. Its identification can lead to preventive treatment by controlling risks such as systolic hypertension. Some individuals remain stable, others my return to normal while others may experience further cognitive decline.\nParkinson’s disease. The same brain changes that cause problems with movement lead to neuropsychological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s find that they are easily distracted and disorganized. They find it difficult to plan and complete tasks and may feel overwhelmed. Speech volume may be difficult to maintain and it may be hard to find the words to express one’s self. These changes may simply feel annoying but they may also seriously interfere with getting things done. Frustration, discouragement and anxiety can be triggered. These symptoms can be evaluated and addressed in treatment.\nNormal Pressure Hydrocephalus. Although this condition may go unrecognized or mistaken for other disorders, it is potentially treatable with symptom relief if caught early. In this condition the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid becomes blocked. The fluid gradually builds up in the brain’s ventricles or cavities causing increasing pressure. Symptoms that occur are progressive cognitive impairment, problems walking and loss of bladder control. Problems with cognitive changes can be evaluated as well as treated.\nMultiple Sclerosis. People with MS are also likely to experience cognitive changes. While these changes may flux and flow, with some individuals problems become severe enough to interfere significantly with everyday activities. These concerns should be discussed with the treating physician. Problems with attention and multi-tasking can arise that require careful assessment and treatment by a neuropsychologist.\nCognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT), is a type of treatment designed to improve neurocognitive abilities such as attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility and planning as well as to improve social functioning. The goal is to maximize the capacity for independent living and, in some cases, the person may resume usual activities. Working with the therapist, an individual treatment plan is developed to address specific areas of cognitive impairment and their impact on day-to-day activities.\nThe objective is to reinforce, strengthen or re-establish previously learned adaptive behaviors and/or to establish new patterns of cognitive activity and mechanisms to compensate for impairment.\nThe primary aim of cognitive rehabilitation is to optimize the capacity to function thereby improving quality of life. There are many computer-based brain-training tools available on the Internet. However, the goal of cognitive rehabilitation is broader. Its chief purpose is to promote mastery of skills and discipline that can be used to cope with changing real-life demands. Therapy aims at heightened self-awareness of strengths and weaknesses in order to effect change and to achieve realistic goals. Knowing and understanding clearly what situations may demand and anticipating problems in advance allows the individual to develop an effective plan of approach. Evidence-based methods are employed to attain the best and most satisfying outcome.\nCognitive rehabilitation is not meant to replace medical treatments or psychotherapy but rather to complement their effects.

Let's Find Out\nProbiotics can help promote a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Yogurt is one of the commonly consumed probiotics. Many suggest that probiotics can help control diarrhea. Here's how.\nProbiotics can help maintain a healthy gut\n- Probiotics can hep boost mental health, says study\n- You can eat a cup of yogurt daily\n- Yogurt can also help in weight loss\nWhen bowel movements are watery due to the poor absorption ability of the intestines and occurs more than 3-4 times in a day (more than usual), this condition is termed as diarrhoea. One of the main causes of diarrhoea is bowel infection usually caused by viruses, bacteria or any other micro-organism. Everybody at some point in their lifetime would have suffered from diarrhoea accompanied with dehydration, lack of energy or stomach pain. Several home remedies are recommended to control diarrhoea. But if it continues for a few days, medical assistance is required to find the exact cause and treatment.\nProbiotics for diarrhoea\nAccording to studies, probiotics help boost intestinal functions by promoting a healthy balance of gut bacteria. For effective treatment for diarrhoea you must consult your doctor.\nDr. SK Mundhra explains \"Good bacteria in the gut boost the digestion process and promote a healthy gut. Probiotics are nothing but a live form of micro-organisms that aids in digestion. Your body has a large source of good as well as bad bacteria, wherein the good bacteria work in the intestinal tract to create a healthy gut environment, assisting in protecting the intestines from infections. Sometimes due to the effects of antibiotics, the good bacteria in the body are lost and hence probiotics are helpful in replacing these good bacteria.\"\n\"This process helps in promoting overall gut health and aids in diarrhoea treatment too. Since probiotics sources with live microorganisms (that are good for the body) should be taken with precaution. People with poor immune response should strictly avoid it, as the body triggers the fight with the pathogens to ward off the chances of infection, and may cause harm,\" Dr. Mundhra adds.\nSources of probiotics\nThe most common source of probiotics includes yogurt, fermented foods and certain dairy products.

{"question":"Can you compare how civilization and ethnography contribute to understanding human societies?","answer":"Civilization and ethnography represent different approaches to understanding human societies. Civilization refers to the whole mechanism and organization that humans have designed to control living conditions, focusing on tangible aspects like tools, technology, and equipment that can be easily passed between generations without much effort. Ethnography, on the other hand, is a firsthand description of a living culture based on personal observation, providing written descriptions of customs, beliefs, and behaviors through fieldwork. While civilization represents the material means and tools of a society that can be similar across different cultural areas, ethnography focuses on creating detailed portraits of specific peoples and their unique cultural characteristics through direct observation and documentation.","context":["Difference between Culture and Civilization (9 points)!\nIn our day-to-day talks and discussions, we often use the terms ‘culture’ and ‘civilization’ interchangeably. Even in the Anglo-French tradition, the concept of culture was often used synonymously with civilization. But sociologists differentiate culture and civilization as two different levels of phenomena.\nThe concept of civilization was almost equated with highly valued things, such as respect of people for one another, the sanctity of life and high regard for the good, the ethical and the beautiful. In this sense, those who were lacking in these attributes were regarded as barbaric or uncivilized.\nPreliterate or primitive people who lived in a state of nature—quite naked, used to eat unbaked animal flesh—were usually termed as barbarians. However, many anthropological studies showed that many preliterate societies had their own values, beliefs, rules, religions and tools, etc.\nThey made certain changes in the natural order of things which are characteristics of culture, in the modern sense of the term. The use of the term ‘civilization’ as exhibited above is different from its use in sociological or anthropological sense. Defining civilization MacIver and Page (1962) said, ‘by civilization we mean the whole mechanism and organization which man has designed in his endeavour to control the conditions of life’.\nSimilarly, S.M. Fairchild (1908) argued that it is the higher stage of cultural development characterized by intellectual, aesthetic, technological and spiritual attainment. On the basis of this meaning, he made reference of ‘civilized peoples’ in contrast to ‘uncivilized or non-civilized peoples’.\nA few scholars have equated civilization with technology and progress; e.g., Robert Bierstedt (1974) emphasized on sophistication, self-criticism and other awareness as the chief characteristics of civilization. Sociologists do not use the term ‘civilization’ in the sense stated above because all above views are value-loaded.\nThus, making a distinction between culture and civilization, the following points may be noted:\n1. Culture is an end (values and goals) in itself while civilization is a means (tools and techniques) to an end. Cultural facts like belief, art and literature—prose, poetry or novel, etc., gives direct satisfaction to the reader while equipment’s of civilization such as cars, computers, refrigerators, etc., do not give direct satisfaction, until and unless they do not satisfy our wants. Thus, civilization is utilitarian. It just helps in achieving the end.\n2. Culture has no value in itself but it is a measurement by which we can value other articles of civilization. We cannot determine the value of culture, i.e., beliefs, norms, ideas, etc., but the value of anything can be determined by its measurement standard. Culture is a measuring rod or weighing balance.\n3. Civilization is always advancing but not culture. Cultural facts like dramatic plays or poems may not be necessarily better today than the plays or poems of Shakespeare?\n4. Civilization is easily passed without much effort to the next generation but not culture. Cultural facts, e.g., any art or a piece of literature, cannot be learned without some intelligence. It requires a few pains to understand it. Contrary to it, the equipment’s of civilization (building, TV, etc.) can easily be inherited without much or any use of energy and intelligence.\n5. Civilization may be borrowed without making any change but not culture. Borrowing any cultural fact like any political, economic or social belief requires some necessary alteration to adjust in the new cultural environment while this is not necessary to make any material change in the civilizational equipment’s such as TV, computer, etc.\n6. Culture relates to the inner qualities of society like religion, customs, conventions, etc., while civilization relates to the outer form of society such as TV, radio, fans, etc.\n7. Culture is more stable than civilization—cultural change takes place in years or in centuries but civilization changes very rapidly.\n8. Variability of cultures may not be accompanied by variability of civilization at different places. Civilization may be similar in variable cultural areas. For instance, there is a great difference between American and Indian cultures but there are many similarities in their civilizational equipment’s.\n9. Culture is a social fact, i.e., creation of the whole society while civilization, i.e., the invention of any equipment may be by a single individual. Any ordinary person can affect any change in the civilizational equipment but for any modification or alteration in any cultural fact requires the power and imagination of whole society.\nThere are scholars who have designated culture and civilization as the two sides of the same coin. William F. Ogburn (1964), in his theory of social change, pointed out two aspects of culture, viz., material and non-material. For him, material aspect represents civilization and the non-material aspect is the culture proper. Gillin and Gillin (1948) designated the material or tangible part of culture as civilization or culture equipment which man in his endeavor has modified from environment.","Harris Chapter 1\nAnthropology is the study of humankind of ancient and modern people and their ways of living.\nThe Five Fields of Anthropology\n1.

The formula to calculate an exponential moving average is:\nEMA = (W * Close) + ((1-W) * EM)\n- W is the smoothing constant calculated as\n2 / (N + 1)\n- which remains constant\n- EM is the exponential moving average from yesterday\nEventhough EMA overcomes the lag resulted in Simple Moving Average,it failed to reduce the losing trades.\nAdaptive Moving Average:\nPerry Kaufman introduced the Adaptive Moving Average which compared the price direction with the level of volatility.The name “Adaptive” reveals that AMA automatically adapts to the market volatility.AMA traverse between fast and slow moving average.\nIf a market is advancing with very small countertrend moves, the degree of noise is low and enough if one follows a shorter look back period.However, if the market is moving sideways, the degree of noise is high and one should look for a longer look back period. So AMA is designed likewise , to move slower in a sideways market and faster in a trending market.\nIn AMA, Kaufman replaced the “weight” variable with a factor “Efficiency Ratio” ,which can be calculated as follows:\nER = (total price change for period) / (sum of absolute price changes for each bar)\nPrinciple behind ER: An ER of +1.0 indicates that the stock is in a perfect uptrend; -1.0 represents a perfect downtrend. In practical terms, the extremes are rarely reached.\nAMA can be calculated as follows:\n1. Calculation of weight factor\nC = [(ER * (SCF – SCS)) + SCS]2\n- SCF is the exponential constant for the fastest EMA allowable (usually 2)\n- SCS is the exponential constant for the slowest EMA allowable (often 30)\n- ER is the efficiency ratio that was noted above\n- C is the weight factor which is adaptive\nSCS can be calculated as\n2 / (SA + 1)\nWhere, SA – trader’s choice of a slow moving average > FA\nSCF can be calculated as\n2 / (FA + 1)\nWhere, FA – choice of a slow moving average < SA\n2. Replacing the weight factor in Exponential Moving Average formula\nAfter finding the C value, W in EMA formula should be replaced with C like,\nAMA = (C * Close) + ((1-C) * EM)\n- C is the smoothing constant calculated by applying Efficiency ratio\n- EM is the exponential moving average from yesterday\nSimple understanding of AMA:\nIn the above chart,when price moves sideways Adaptive Moving Average(in blue) maintained a flattened line whereas, the Exponential Moving Average(in pale green) moved with the choppiness of prices.\nThe adaptive moving average’s strength is its ability to respond to changing market conditions, which is a problem for studies that use fixed look-back periods.\nUsing a fixed look-back period is not possible. Because the market is always changing, static approaches are likely to have limited success. Using adaptive study which is dynamic is a potential way to get good results. The AMA could also be combined with other indicators to develop a profitable trading system.\nAmibroker Users Download the AFL Code for Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average here\nGeneral assumption in share market is, market price follows the Gaussian Normal Distribution forming a bell shaped curve.In practice, the price movements not only follows Gaussian distribution but also other probability distribution functions. At this point,a indicator is necessary to transform such values to Gaussian normal distribution to identify trend reversals.\nFisher Tansform is the one ,which transforms any probability distribution function to Gaussian normal distribution\nAssumption: underlying prices follows square wave distribution\nThe fisher transform formula is as follows:\nWhere x is the correlation coefficient.\nHow transformation is made\n1. Prices should be constrained to remain within the limits of -1 to +1.\n2. Comes the real transformation using fisher transform formula\nAs Gaussian normal distribution function most of the values are highly concentrated around the mean, while the extremes are observed to be concentrated at the right and left tails of the bell shaped curve. So transformed time series helps to identify trends,i.e sharp turning points in price movements\nHow to Apply the Indicator\nIn this indicator along with fisher line,fisher delay(one previous fisher bar) is also added.Signals are identified when fisher line crosses above or below its signal line.\nBullish signal – Fisher line turns up below -1 threshold & crosses up the fisher delay line\nBearish signal -Fisher line turns down above +1 threshold & crosses down the fisher delay line\nIts shown in the below chart\nAmibroker Users can Download the Fisher Transform Amibroker AFL code here\nThe Fisher Transformation transforms the probability density function of any waveform into a Gaussian-like probability density function. Unlike other indicators & oscillators, the Fisher Transformation introduces no lag and provides the turning points in advance.

{"question":"What are the technical requirements for managing heat transfer in coal combustion systems, and how do noise levels from such industrial operations affect nearby residents' health?","answer":"In coal combustion systems, managing heat transfer requires careful control of wall heat flux through radiative trapping effects, which can be achieved through system pressurization to create an optically thick medium. The wall heat flux is specifically controlled by ash particle size and particle number concentration. Meanwhile, industrial operations like these can have significant health impacts on nearby residents. Research has shown that people living within 1000 feet of such industrial sites are exposed to noise levels of 65-69 dB, which has been associated with sleep disturbance, fatigue, cognitive and mood changes, and stress that can lead to poor school performance.","context":["Studies in Advanced Oxy-combustion Technologies\nDate of Award\nDoctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nIn 2013, approximately 87 percent of the total world energy came from combustion sources. While combustion is of critical significance, it poses serious issues. The rapid increase in energy consumption, primarily from increased fossil fuel use, has raised strong concerns over the current energy infrastructure, the emissions of particulate matter, CO, SO2, and NOx, as well as global warming due to the emission of CO2. Improving combustion efficiency and reducing combustion emissions are essential. This dissertation focuses on two areas: (1) Computational fluid dynamics simulations of a novel burner design for a new oxy-fuel technology with relatively high efficiency and low emissions, and (2) numerical studies of flame structure and soot inception, interpreted in the carbon-to-oxygen atom ratio space for laminar diffusion flames.\nPart I. Oxy-fuel combustion is considered a promising technology for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). One of the primary limitations on full-scale implementation of this technology is the significant increase in the cost of electricity due to a large reduction in plant efficiency and high capital costs. The fact that the CO2 captured must ultimately be pressurized for geo-sequestration or Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) enables pressurized oxy-combustion to be implemented at no net pumping cost because the energy to pump oxygen is comparable to that to pump CO2. At higher pressure the latent heat of condensation of the moisture in the flue gas can be utilized in the Rankine cycle, increasing the plant efficiency. A new pressurized oxy-combustion technology, namely staged, pressurized oxy-combustion (SPOC) has been developed in which the flue gas recycle is minimized by means of fuel-staged combustion. As determined through ASPEN Plus modeling, this process increases the net plant efficiency by more than 5 percentage points, compared to first-generation oxy-combustion plants. In the SPOC process, pulverized coal is combusted at high-pressure with negligible recycle.\nA unique burner and boiler have been designed via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to effectively and safely burn coal under SPOC conditions. CFD is used to model the process and to determine the effects of operating conditions on the radiative and convective heat transfer in the boiler. It is shown through the simulations that a manageable wall heat flux can be achieved even with very high local gas temperatures. The system is also designed to minimize particle deposition to avoid slagging, fouling, and corrosion, and simulations of ash deposition indicate negligible deposition on the furnace wall. Radiation behavior is also studied to demonstrate radiative trapping effects. It is demonstrated, through both analytical and numerical studies, that the system pressurize is a critical tool to obtain an optically thick medium capable of trapping heat inside the furnace. It is further shown that for a sufficiently large optical thickness radiative trapping can occur, and this, combined with the diffusive-convective profiles of the temperature and absorption coefficient, allow us manage the wall heat flux. An average-temperature method is developed to approximate the heat flux and to study the dynamic relations of temperature and the absorption coefficient. The effects of ash particle size on radiative trapping are systematically studied. It is concluded that the wall heat flux is controlled by particle size as well as particle number concentration, in other words, by particle porosity and fragmentation. Ultimately, burners and boilers are designed to minimize the boiler heat transfer surface area, ash deposition, and fire-side corrosion for the SPOC system.\nPart II. Understanding the structure of diffusion flames is often complicated by the dependence of flame structure on the boundary conditions, such as composition, temperature, and flow field (e.g., strain rate in a counterflow flame.) The utility of interpreting flame results in the carbon-to-oxygen atom ratio (C/O ratio) space, as opposed to physical space or mixture fraction space, is evaluated. Flame and soot zone structures of counterflow diffusion flames are studied for C2¬H4 and C3H8 and interpreted in C/O ratio space as a function of the stoichiometric mixture fraction (Zst). The Burke-Schumann results expressed in C/O ratio space demonstrate how a clear and direct understanding of how structure is affected by Zst can be realized. In C/O ratio space, unlike physical or mixture fraction space, the flame location is independent of the stoichiometric mixture fraction. Numerical results with detailed chemical kinetics also indicate that C/O ratio space is a fundamental variable in the sense that, for a given fuel, the location of the flame zones and critical reactions is invariant with Zst and strain rate. Two zones are clearly observed, the radical pool zone and the soot precursor zone which is located on the fuel side of the flame. The onset threshold of soot precursors (C6H5 and C6H6) on the high temperature side of the soot precursor zone is characterized by the depletion of radicals. The role of the hydrogen radical in flame structure and soot inception is demonstrated by studying its production and consumption channels in C/O ratio space, as are the roles of C2H2 in soot precursor depletion and boundary coincidence. The kinetic ratio is used to study the characteristics of key chemical reactions and to identify regions of equilibrium for these reactions. Finally, a modified C/O ratio ((C/O)*) is given to interpret the physical meaning of C/O ratio. The numerical results in this work indicate and explain the advantages of applying C/O ratio space in the analysis of flame structure and soot precursor chemistry.\nRichard Axelbaum, Chair\nPratim Biswas, Rajan Chakrabarty, Kenneth Jerina, David Peters","Socioeconomic Change and Human Stress Associated with Shale Gas Extraction\nThe only statement that we can make with certainty to date about the effects of hydraulic fracturing on the public’s health is that there are multiple pathways for potential harm, and that none have been researched enough to definitively link the process to specific health impacts. Researchers have begun to study the air and water pathways to identify potentially dangerous chemicals released in areas surrounding drilling sites (e.g.,Myers 2012; McKensie et al. 2012). When their findings are supplemented with baseline data on the health of nearby residents and on the doses of chemicals ingested from these sources, we can begin to define immediate and long-term effects on humans living and working adjacent to wells.\nAnother pathway through which potentially greater numbers of residents may suffer adverse health effects is the socio-economic change experienced in communities where drilling occurs. An established “boomtown” literature analyzing the unexpected, fast economic development in areas where energy extraction occurs warns that these conditions contribute to psychosocial stress. While “boomtowns” enjoy the job and business activity growth touted as contributors to better well-being, they also face demographic changes, uncertainty, inadequate housing and infrastructure, and substandard social services (Davenport and Davenport 1980). Some research specifically ties increased mental health case loads, crime, divorce, suicide, and alcoholism to this rapid community development (Kohrs 1974). Overall the literature identifies both positive and negative economic impacts on local residents, but particularly significant negative social impacts. (Markussen 1978; Freudenburg 1984; Seyfrit 1988; Perdue, et al 1999). Linking this literature to recent studies on the relationship between social environmental factors and health impacts (Lantz 2010; Diez Roux 2001; Clougherty and Kubzansky 2009) suggests that the social impacts of shale gas drilling may have a considerable influence on community heath.\nSpending a few hours in towns in the active Marcellus Shale drilling region of Pennsylvania provides even a casual observer with sights and sounds of undeniable community change. Thousands of diesel-powered trucks carrying water, chemicals, and equipment to and from drilling sites roar through towns and rural landscapes, creating traffic jams and degrading already poor-quality road surfaces. Local hotel, temporary industry-built “man camps,” and restaurants are filled with an influx of drilling teams from Texas, Oklahoma, and other points south and west, here only long enough to drill and frac, then move on to another site. A visitor who spends a little more time chatting with social service providers, town leaders, and long-time residents will hear about additional stressors that lie below the surface. Homelessness is on the rise among those who have long struggled near the economic margins, and are now forced from inexpensive housing by landlords seeking higher rents from gas workers. Tensions between the “mailbox millionaires” for whom leasing of mineral rights have created new economic opportunities and power, residents without the interest in or resources to lease, and short-term workers behaving recklessly in their time off are often palpable and unwelcome. Locals who once relished their lives in the sparsely-developed, quiet rural areas struggle with the industrial landscape that surrounds them and is beyond their control.\nSocial scientists have begun to document these sources of community stress. In key informant and survey research they have recorded complaints about traffic, roads and other infrastructure strained by the drilling industry, and concerns about the influx of short-term workers, their impacts on housing and lack of attachment to community. Through health impact assessments and analysis of governmental data, they have verified increases in crime in multiple shale gas drilling regions. Other studies confirm dissatisfaction related to newly-created income inequality in affected communities, emergence of industrial operations in rural landscapes, and distrust of gas industry representatives who promise positive outcomes while failing to warn of negative impacts (Alter, et al. 2010; Brasier et al. 2011; Blevins et al. 2005; Anderson and Theodori 2009; Theodori 2009; Jacquet 2005 and 2009; Witter et al. 2008).\nResearch indicates that community members’ attitudes become more strongly negative during the most intense drilling phase of natural gas development (Brasier et al. 2011, Anderson and Theodori 2009). This, in turn suggests that stress and related illnesses might likewise occur at this stage, and so efforts to monitor the social impacts on health should begin early in the shale gas development process. So far, researchers have not systematically studied the link between social impacts and health conditions. A promising first step in this direction has been taken by Colorado-based researchers. Witter (2012) reported that Colorado residents living within 1000 feet of drilling sites were subjected to noise levels (65-69 dB) that were associated with sleep disturbance, fatigue, cognition and mood changes and stress that has been linked to poor school performance. Other research in planning or initial phases could also incorporate links to social impacts. For example, medical research institutions in Pennsylvania are considering how to use thousands of electronic medical records and geographic shale drilling data to examine the health impacts of Marcellus Shale drilling. They should be encouraged to investigate social change in the patients’ community and potential links to stress-related illnesses. Likewise the longitudinal study of social impacts in four Pennsylvania shale drilling counties initiated by Pennsylvania State University social science researchers could add a health assessment of subjects to explore the nexus between drilling-induced community change, stress, and health impacts.\nNone of these promising or possible research agendas should be seen as a substitute for a thorough, well-designed study incorporating both survey research identifying community change and self-reported stress and medical data registering increased stress and its health impacts. This is relatively uncharted territory in public health research. But it may well be the crux of the matter for public health in communities surrounded by shale gas drilling, so it must be addressed carefully and soon.\nAlter, T., Brasier, K., McLaughlin, D., Willits, F., Ooms, T., & Tracewski, S.

{"question":"How do Ukrainian cattle breeds show mtDNA diversity, and what role does modern genomic selection play in breed conservation?","answer":"Analysis of Ukrainian cattle breeds reveals significant mtDNA diversity. Among Ukrainian Whitehead cattle, 3 out of 10 genotypes belong to the T1a mtDNA haplogroup of African origin, while two animals showed Bos indicus mtDNA haplogroup traits. For Ukrainian Gray cattle, one animal displayed Bos indicus haplotype, while others belonged to haplogroup T1 with European origin mtDNA. Modern genomic selection tools like targeted genotyping by sequencing (GBS) now provide cost-effective methods to evaluate such genetic diversity.

Initial studies have demonstrated a deep bifurcation in bovine mtDNA phylogeny, which indicates a predomestic divergence between the two major taxa of cattle, humped zebu (Bos indicus) and humpless taurine (Bos taurus). Subsequent genetic investigations have yielded further inference regarding origins within the B. taurus lineage. B. taurus mtDNA sequences fall into one of five ancestral star-like haplotypic clusters, which are geographically distributed. Just one of these clusters, T3, predominates in Western Europe. Symmetrically, diversity within Africa is composed almost exclusively of members of a separate haplotypic cluster, T1, which is rarely detected elsewhere. The almost mutually exclusive geographic distribution of these two haplotypic clusters allows geographical exceptions to be securely identified as secondary introductions.\nWe investigated a comparative analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences for different breeds of cattle (Bos taurus, Bos indicus) with global genetic bank. Mitochondrial DNA sequences from bovine animals (Bos taurus) breeds Ukrainian Whitehead and Ukrainian Gray freely available on the global genetic bank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genebank/). Local alignment of sequences for mitochondrial genome of different cattle breeds was performed using the program MEGA 4.0. For the detection of nucleotide replacements used mitochondrial DNA sequence of Bos taurus Hereford breed (Anderson S. at al., 1982) as a reference (accession number V00645).\nHere we report the analysis results of testing for 9 genotypes Ukrainian Gray mitochondrial DNA sequences showed that one animal (GQ129208) has haplotype Bos indicus, other belongs to haplogroup T1 with European origin mtDNA. Analysis of single nucleotide replacement in one of the hypervariable regions mtDNA (position number 16019-16339) shows, that among 10 submitted genotypes of Ukrainian Whitehead the 3 of them (FJ014303, FJ014298, FJ014294) relating to T1a mtDNA haplogroup of African origin, which characterized by replacement of T to C at position 16255. Also have been two animals (FJ014301, FJ014295) with single nucleotide replacements with relatives to Bos indicus mtDNA haplogroup.\nWe performed alignment with reference sequences (Bos_taurus_v00654.1) and comparative nucleotide sequences analysis of another hypervariable D-loop (position number 1-240) mtDNA with 5 Ukrainian Whitehead genotypes and 5 Ukrainian Gray genotypes represented in genetics bank. Among the Ukrainian Whitehead genotypes (FJ014298, FJ014297, FJ014296, FJ014295, FJ014294) all were polymorphic that characterizes large differentiation these animals for maternal and describe deep heterogeneous parent population of studied group. We determined one animal with genotype FJ014295 was significantly different by the number of segregation sites. The analyzed sequences (FJ014290, FJ014289, FJ014288, FJ014287, FJ014286) of 5 Ukrainian Gray genotypes showed no polymorphism in hypervariable D-loop (position number 1-240) mtDNA.\nThe mtDNA analysis of different species of animals allowed to distribute their mtDNA belonging to European, African and Asian haplogroups. The technique, which allows to differentiate the animals represented by their belonging to the respective haplogroups. The process that gave rise to different genotypes in one lineage is clearly of fundamental importance in understanding intraspecific mitochondrial polymorphism and evolution in mammals.\nСomprehensive study genetic material provide more opportunities to optimize costs in-situ conservation of different cattle breeds, to optimize methods and techniques which used in ex-situ conservation programmes of National gene bank of animal genetic resources.\n2.

Increasing productivity throughout the whole sector will be essential to meet the growing demand for quality livestock products, whilst minimising its impact on the environment and the world’s natural resources.\nTherefore, we need to focus on how to convert animal feed to meat protein more efficiently, looking towards advanced technologies and more efficient breeding methods to improve the genetic quality of livestock.\nIn this article, we investigate how genomic selection can now provide us with genomic information of increasing complexity, which can be utilised to evaluate polygenic traits such as feed conversion ratio, and how breeders and ranchers can leverage the latest genomic tools to meet the growing global demands on protein consumption.\nInto the 21st century and beyond\nThe promise that more information at the DNA level would lead to more efficient genetic improvement than using only phenotypic records resulted in marker-assisted selection (MAS) which consists of two steps:\n- mapping the genes underlying traits of interest: the quantitative trait loci (QTL);\n- including that QTL information into the best linear unbiased prediction – an estimate of breeding value (BLUP-EBV).\nWe now apply complex statistical models to animal breeding programmes, through the estimation of (EBV) diversity evaluation of specific populations by application of BLUP linear modelling.1\nTraditional MAS did not result in a widespread application of molecular markers in animal breeding beyond selecting for a few direct marker-to-phenotypic traits such as fat content in milk.2 This is due in part because many traits of interest in livestock production were much more complex, sometimes determined by hundreds of genes, with each eliciting small combinatorial effects on phenotype, making it nearly impossible to cost-effectively interrogate and make breeding decisions based on the complex and uncorrelated results.3\nThe breakthrough would come with the advent of whole-genome sequencing projects and made viable on a larger scale by next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS enhanced the discovery of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could be then associated with individual QTLs that could be identified as part of polygenic traits.\nIn contrast with MAS, which focuses on a small number of QTLs, and SNP markers associated with specific phenotypes, genomic selection (GS) uses a higher resolution set of markers from across the entire genome, assuring that all QTLs across the genome are in Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) (i.e. associated) with at least one SNP marker in close proximity.4\nUltimately this means that all the potential allelic effects that a specific SNP / set of SNPs might have on the phenotype can now be estimated at the level of the population rather than the individual. This enables breeders to draw cause-effect conclusions, based on statistical predictions, for these complex traits, and allow them to make informed decisions about which animals to breed to maximise the desired outcome, such as yield or protein conversion, and overall profitability of their herd or population.\nWhat makes a cow a cow?\nA major step towards improving the health and disease management of cattle and enhancing the nutritional value of beef and dairy products came with the sequencing of the bovine genome, in 2009.5 It contains 2.9 billion DNA base pairs, and 22,000 protein-coding genes, with the identification of two million SNPs. At the time, CSIRO’s Dr Ross Tellam predicted: “We could potentially achieve as much improvement in cattle breeding and production in 50 years as we have over the last 8,000 years of traditional farming.”\nThe Hereford breed was selected for the bulk of the project, and the sequence of the bovine's 29 chromosomes provides new insights into the bovine genome and the unique traits that could impact production. For example, chromosome breakpoints are rich in repetitive sequences, duplications and include specific variations in genes associated with lactation and immune response. For example, one of the changed genes, histatherin, produces a protein in cow's milk that has anti-microbial properties.\nCattle have one of the most highly rearranged genomes of all mammals, with more translocations and inversions of chromosome fragments, such as cats and even pigs, which are closely related to cattle.\nFive of the 1,032 genes devoted to metabolic functions in humans are missing from the cattle genome or have radically diverged, suggesting that cattle have some unique metabolic pathways. At the time, Lewin quoted that these differences in metabolism, along with changes in genes devoted to reproduction, lactation and immunity are a big part of \"what makes a cow a cow\".\nGenomic selection comes of age\nAdvances and cost reductions in NGS methods and bioinformatics and development of targeted genotyping by sequencing (GBS) methods allow us to efficiently and cost-effectively correlate whole sets of SNPs with desired phenotypes. The advancements in library preparation technologies and exponential drop in sequence data generation cost are propelling the routine use of NGS-based methods for large scale and high-throughput genomic selection in animal breeding programmes. Using an NGS approach helps bring traits or new varieties to market faster, lowers costs of breeding operations, and increases profitability.\nLGC, Biosearch Technologies continues to play an ever-expanding role in partnership with our customers by applying cost-effective and fit-for-purpose targeted GBS service, SeqSNP, to enable our customers to advance their breeding programs to optimise health, welfare improve the economic value and quality of livestock products.\nHigh-resolution sequence-based genotyping has been extensively applied to livestock breeding programs to accurately predict and select livestock where investment needs to deliver maximum genetic gains with each generation of offspring. This investment in genomic-based breeding decisions has improved the productivity of livestock breeding programs for complex traits, such as feed conversion ratio or feed efficiency. For example, the use of genomic selection in early measured traits for sheep and beef cattle produced 20-40% more genetic gain when combined with reproductive technologies.6\nTargeted GBS is starting to displace arrays for routine screening in breeding programs. One such genotyping approach is the SeqSNP platform, developed at Biosearch Technologies. SeqSNP provides a cost-efficient, flexible and scalable mid-plex genotyping platform as a service, or as bespoke kits for in-house targeted GBS.\nSeqSNP allows for the assessment of complex traits in all modern breeding programs and is ideally placed for the application of genomic selection. Independently analysed data substantiates that the SeqSNP service delivers genotyping data with high concordance to array genotyping and provides a more flexible and scalable alternative, without the minimum sample size commitments, and still achieving competitive pricing.\nWith SeqSNP, flexibility and conversion rates in probe library design are increased by the selection of sequences surrounding the target, rather than direct discrimination of the SNP, which also allows for accommodation of minor allele frequency in the surrounding sequence, and hence the identification of de novo SNPs.\nAn additional potential advantage of SeqSNP is that the use of two oligonucleotide probes for the sequencing of each given target provides not only cost-efficiency but also further confirmation of target alleles.\nFigure 1 outlines the methodology used to produce probe libraries for targeted GBS in SeqSNP.\nThe advantages of using SeqSNP over other targeted GBS approaches include:\n- Lower set-up costs, as costs are dependent on SNP and sample number, with no minimum sample commitments or up-front library development costs.\n- Flexible marker selection: Up to 100K SNPs per sample in a single run. Ideally suited for 5,000 to 25,000 SNPs per sample.\n- Flexible design in terms of non-fixed content: SNPs can be easily modified from run to run according to the traits examined, compared to fixed content arrays.\n- Additional information gained on de novo variants (including structural variants) detected in target SNP region.\n- Cost-effective: Highly efficient enrichment methods reduce day-to-day operation costs.\n- Shorter development times for probe library production compared to array manufacture.\n- Fragmentation of the gDNA replacing mechanical shearing means simultaneous digestion and labelling of DNA fragments simplify the workflow.\n- Dual-index sample barcoding enables multiplex sequencing of over 3000 samples in a single sequencing lane, which allows for further scalability without limitations.\nPerspectives and conclusions\nThe progress in sequencing technologies and their application to animal breeding and genomic selection seen over the last decade or so are game-changing but have still yet to realise their full potential.\nHistorically, the lack of genomic knowledge and access to sequencing technologies limited animal breeding programs to selection of key production traits that had a clearly defined genotype to phenotype correlations. The advancement of sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and development of low-cost sequencing methods to interrogate a set of targeted SNPs, continues to expand the application of genomics to animal breeding programs.\nThese new methods add value to breeders and ranchers, who are now able to make informed decisions about mating choices, and take into account both key production and complex traits that improve overall value and profitability of their herds, and enable them to rise to the challenge that our increased protein diets place on our food supply.\nThis blog post was originally published on the LGC, Biosearch Technologies blog here.\nFernando, R.F and Grossman, M (1989) Marker assisted selection using best linear unbiased prediction Genetics Selection Evolution, 21, 467.\nWilliamson, P.

{"question":"Could someone explain how measuring time with uniformly-burning strings works? Looking for a detailed explanation of this fascinating method!","answer":"With uniformly-burning strings, you can measure time by folding a single piece of string in half, and then folding it in half again. This creates creases that mark 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of the string's total length. Since these strings burn at a uniform rate, you can measure specific time intervals by lighting one end and waiting until it burns to the desired marking. For example, to measure 45 minutes, you would wait until the string burns to the 3/4 mark, since 45 minutes is 3/4 of an hour.","context":["How to Measure Time Without a Stopwatch\nHow can you measure time without using a stopwatch? You could use the movement of the Sun across the sky, watch a pendulum swing, or burn some very special string. Keep on reading to find out how it works!\nPage 1 of 2\nA math puzzle a day keeps your brain saying \"Yay!\"\nI know that’s not the most memorable saying in the world, but it’s definitely true—puzzles are a fantastic workout for your brain. As such, you’d be wise to try your hand at tackling at least a few different kinds of puzzles every week. And the best part of this is that mental exercise like this is fun!\nTo help you in your endeavor to start puzzling more, today we’re going to take a look at a great brain teaser that I recently ran across. This puzzle is all about time and how you can measure intervals of time in a rather unusual way: by burning bits of specially crafted string. How does it work? And what’s the big brain teaser?\nThat’s exactly what we’ll be talking about today.\nHow Can You Measure 45 Minutes?\nImagine you’ve been given several pieces of string with varying lengths and thicknesses. Not only do the lengths and widths of the pieces vary, each piece of string isn't even uniform in width along its own length. In other words, they get thicker and thinner (by different amounts and in different places) as you go from one end to the other. While all of the pieces are therefore different, they have one thing in common: if you light one end on fire, it will always take exactly 1 hour to burn through to the other side. But since each piece gets thicker and thinner as it goes, a given piece of string doesn’t necessarily burn at an even rate. By which I mean that a string doesn't necessarily burn half its length in 30 minutes—all we can say is that it burns its entire length in exactly 1 hour.\nIs it possible to use these pieces of string to measure a 45 minute time interval?\nSo that’s the setup. Here’s the question: Is it possible to use these pieces of string (as many as you want) to measure a 45 minute time interval? And, if it's possible, how would you do it? As with every puzzle, it’s a lot more fun if you give it a try before finding out the answer. So I encourage you to pause for a few minutes to give it a go. Then, when you’re ready, continue on for the answer.\nA Simpler Problem\nBefore we solve today’s puzzle, let’s imagine a slightly simpler puzzle in which the pieces of string we’re given all burn at a uniform rate. In this case, you could solve the puzzle simply by folding a single piece of string in half, and then by folding this in half again to make creases in the string at 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 its total length. Since this string burns at a uniform rate, all you have to do to measure 45 minutes of time is simply light one end of the string on fire and wait until it burns to the mark that's 3/4 of the way towards the other end. Easy!\nBut, sadly, the pieces of string we’re given in this puzzle are not so well behaved in that they don't burn at an even rate (since they get thicker and thinner at various points along their length). Which means we can’t simply fold a piece of string into quarters to count off time. But that doesn’t mean we’re out of luck … because we can do something much more clever!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7fcaa864-9e36-4f03-8584-86388690e003>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to create an instrumental mix when mixing a song?","answer":"To create an instrumental mix, simply mute all the vocal tracks. However, be careful when muting from a vocal subgroup, as faint vocal sounds could still be audible through the effects returns. It's safer to mute the individual vocal tracks directly. An instrumental mix is useful if you want to change the vocal sound over time with different EQ or effects - you can later lay the original vocal track on top of it and process it as needed.","context":["More than Just the Full MixAlternate mixes that pro engineers do for every song — and so should you\nProfessional engineers typically render more than just a full version when they finish mixing a song. They also run a number of variations, which are referred to as \"alternate mixes.\" In this article, I'll tell you what they are and why you should be doing them, too.\nThe term \"alternate mixes,\" in this case, don't mean different mixes of the full song. What it refers to are versions that you render in addition to the full version, with specific elements removed to allow for different contingencies and applications.\nThe custom of doing alternate mixes was born in the days of tape, when it was an absolute necessity, because it was difficult to recall a mix exactly. But even though today's DAWs give us total recall, and theoretically we could re-open the exact mix down the road, if the need for an alternative version were to arise, it’s safer to do it now.\nWhy is that? Because our computer systems sometimes change over time, and it’s not always possible to recall a mix exactly as you had it previously, because you might have used plug-ins (processor or virtual instrument) that are no longer compatible with your system. If you’re asked down the road to provide a variation on the mix, you might not be able to get back to where you were.\nConsidering that most DAWs offer faster-than-realtime offline mixing, it's not going to take you very long to run a small number of specific variations on the mix, that will cover you for a lot of scenarios without the need for a recall. If you're doing any for-hire mixing jobs, you'll be expected to provide these variations.\nHere are the typical alternates to run in addition to the full mix.\nThis one has no vocals whatsoever on it. It's easy to setup, just mute all the vocal tracks. Be careful if you're muting from a vocal subgroup, because faint vocal sounds could still be audible through the effects returns. You're safer muting the individual vocal tracks.\nWhy a mix without vocals? It's possible that you (or your client if you're mixing for someone else) will want to change the vocal sound over time, perhaps with a different EQ or effects. If you print an Instrumental Mix at the time of your mix session, you'll have that track available, and you can just lay the original vocal track on top of it, and process it as you choose.\nThe TV mix contains everything except the lead vocal. If you (or your mix client) needs a backing track of the song for performing onstage or on TV, radio, or a podcast, the TV mix is critical.\nAs you might have guessed, this one has all the vocal tracks (lead and background), but the instruments are muted. This is handy to have in case you, or somebody else, decides to do a remix of the song, putting a new arrangement around the original vocals. You might want to do two versions of the accapella mix: one with and one without effects.\nThis mix is only necessary for songs with off-color lyrics, which can't be used on broadcast radio. If your song fits that description, edit or bleep the curse words (on a copy of the session, of course), and then run a mix with a radio-friendly version of the vocal track instead of the original. You don't want to miss a potential opportunity because you don't have a clean version of your song.\nIf you have time, you also might want to consider bouncing each track soloed as an individual track stem. That preserves their volume and panning relationships to each other, and their effects, but gives you the flexibility to change the arrangement later by replacing or revising one of the elements.\nStems aren't a necessity, but if you have time, they're always good to have around. Some DAWs, such as PreSonus Studio One and Apple Logic Pro X, allow you to print individual stems from all the tracks in one pass.\nHere's an important point: Make sure that all of your alternate mixes start from the very first bar and beat of the DAW file for the song. Although you probably won’t be joining them together, you might want to, say, combine the acapella mix with a revision of the instrumental mix, or something to that effect, and if all the mixes start at the very beginning of the sequence, you can always combine them and know they’ll be in time with each other."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9ec44b89-927b-4259-bf41-583cdeb2d3c6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the main differences between French involvement in the French and Indian War versus the American Revolution?","answer":"During the French and Indian War, France fought against Britain and the American colonists, with French power in North America ending after their defeat. In contrast, during the American Revolution, France became a crucial ally to the American cause, providing money, supplies, weapons, men and ships after forming an alliance in 1778. This French alliance proved to be one of the most decisive factors in America's victory against Britain.","context":["The American Revolutionary War, which lasted from 1775 to 1783, was sparked by hostility between American colonists and the British government and led to American independence from Britain. Although the Colonists won the war for independence, they had to overcome several disadvantages to do so. Any of these problems, if not properly addressed, could have changed the outcome of the war.\nLack of Organization\nAt the beginning of the war, one of the most serious setbacks for the American colonists was the lack of an army. Americans had experienced battle during the French and Indian war as members of British militia; however, this experience had not provided substantial training and no standing army was available. In 1775, the Continental Congress created an army and placed George Washington at its head, but Washington experienced extreme difficulty training and organizing the troops. In addition to battlefield inexperience, Washington's army faced internal problems, including drunkenness, abandonment of guard duty, hygiene issues, theft and accidental deaths due to firearm discharges inside camp.\nLack of Navy\nPrior to the Revolutionary War, the British fleet protected American colonists, who had not needed to construct their own warships. As a result, the Americans had no navy to defend them at the onset of the war. To correct this problem, the Continental Congress authorized the creation of the Continental Navy in 1775. Initially, the navy consisted of converted merchant ships, but a fleet of frigates were constructed and launched in 1776. British ships were technologically superior to the American fleet, however, and nearly all of the American ships were captured or destroyed.\nNot all American colonists supported the war; those who were in favor of British rule were known as loyalists or Tories. The British Army attempted to organize the loyalists and offered incentives such as freedom to colonial slaves in return for service. To remedy this, the Continental Congress passed the Tory Act, which declared that loyalists who worked against the colonial cause should be disarmed and that any who were dangerous should be kept in safe custody. The Continental Congress was clear that the loyalists should not be treated poorly, but anti-loyalist sentiment was extremely high. In some areas, suspected loyalists were imprisoned, physically abused or killed.\nLack of Allies\nPrior to the war, the American patriots had legally been British colonists and had not developed international alliances. In order to defeat the British, however, the colonists needed international support. To gain this support, the Continental Congress approached the French government, which provided money and support, eventually culminating in an alliance in 1778. The Spanish government was also allied with France, and as a result of the French relationship with the United States, the Spanish government joined the war against the British in 1779. The French alliance provided the Americans with supplies, weapons, men and ships, and proved to be one of the most decisive factors in the American victory.\n- Library of Congress: The American Revolution, 1763-1783\n- National Park Service: The American Revolution - Lighting America's Flame\n- History World: The American Revolution\n- The Library of Congress: The Tory Act: Published by Order of the Continental Congress, Philadelphia, Jan. 2, 1776.\n- Library of Congress: The American Revolution, 1763-1783: Creating a Continental Army\n- Naval History and Heritage Command: Vessels of the Continental Navy\n- U.S. History: The Loyalists\n- Portland State University: Loyalists in the Thirteen Colonies\n- U.S. Department of State: Office of the Historian - Milestones: 1776-1783: French Alliance\n- Photos.com/Photos.com/Getty Images","|Event Date:||Event Title:||Event Description:|\n|French and Indian War Begins||-Young George Washington sent to Ohio River Valley to protect British colonists from French\n-Fired first shots at French force near Fort Dusquesne\n-French respond with 10-hour siege of Fort Necessity, Washington forced to surrender on 4th of July\n|Battle of Quebec||Battle of Quebec info\n-British scale cliffs up to Quebec during the night\n-Battle the next morning on Plains of Abraham on the outskirts of Quebec\n-Battle lasts 15 minutes- French defeated\n- British commander James Wolfe(in picture) and French commander Marquis de Montcalm both fatally wounded\n|French and Indian War Ends||-Treaty of Paris ended the war,\n-No more French power in North America, but allowed to keep West Indian Islands.

{"question":"What's the importance of stakeholder engagement in pollution prevention programs, and how has the nature of sustainability discussions evolved? 💬","answer":"Stakeholder engagement is crucial for pollution prevention programs - companies must inform all employees about environmental principles and goals, provide ways for feedback through suggestion boxes or online programs, and ensure clear communication through designated Green Team members. The nature of sustainability discussions has evolved significantly - it's no longer about individual projects or initiatives, but about the entire organization's structure and purpose. The dialogue has become more sophisticated, with stakeholders better equipped to participate in discussions. The relationship between companies and stakeholders needs to shift from adversarial to cooperative to achieve common goals like reducing carbon emissions. Additionally, institutional investors are increasingly demanding accountability and understanding of companies' sustainability ambitions.","context":["In today’s economic recession, companies are under tremendous pressure to provide products and services at the lowest possible cost. How can companies remain competitive and reduce their impacts on our environment? Many companies are finding that Pollution Prevention, also known as Lean Manufacturing can not only help lessen their impacts on the environment but is simply smart business.\nImplementing a pollution prevention program requires an upfront commitment and long-term follow-through. By forming a Green Team at your facility, your company will make an important first step towards evaluating current programs, creating facility-wide environmental goals and an action plan to implement those goals.\nThe following steps will provide the framework to create a Green Team and implement a pollution prevention program at your facility:\nStep 1: Developing a Strategy for Winning Senior Leadership Support\nTo get a pollution prevention program off to a good start, you should have the “buy-in” or support of the business owner or upper management. With this commitment, you are reassuring employees that your pollution prevention program is supported at the highest level of your company.\nWhen introducing the idea to senior management, consider discussing how pollution prevention projects can prevent or reduce cost over-runs and enhance your company goals.\nStep 2: Selecting Green Team Members\nPollution prevention programs require strategic planning. Choose members for your Green Team that will be dedicated to promoting pollution prevention efforts, such as solid or hazardous waste reduction, environmentally responsible purchasing or using energy and water efficiently in your company. The size of your team should be consistent with the size of your company. Try to have a representative from as many departments or operations as possible. Consider including regional representatives, if your company is large, as a point-of-contact for all employees in that region.\nThe team will be responsible for working with senior management to set immediate and long-term goals and an action plan; gathering and analyzing information relevant to the action plan; promoting the program to employees and educating them about how they can help; providing information on how the company benefits from the program, as well as environmental benefits; monitoring the progress of the action plan; making improvements as needed, and reporting to senior management about the status of the action plan.\nHaving a committed team leader is essential to the Green Team’s success since implementing a pollution prevention program requires coordination between senior management and all departments within your company.\nStep 3: Establishing a Green Team Mission Statement\nCreate a Mission Statement or Statement of Environmental Principles (Environmental Principles) for your company to help define and guide your environmental efforts. Once again, commitment from senior management reassures employees that the Environmental Principles and action plan are supported by the highest level of management within the company. Be sure to inform all employees about your company’s Environmental Principles and the goals of your program. Post your company’s Environmental Principles in the entrance to your facility, company Website, and other prominent locations throughout your facility to demonstrate your company’s commitment.\nA copy of Intermountain Healthcare’s Environmental Principles can be found at the end of this document.\nStep 4: Developing a Baseline\nIf you don’t know what your company’s energy and water usage is and how much waste your company generates, then you don’t have the information that you need to support your pollution prevention programs or celebrate your successes! Your team leader should oversee all data collection and management for quantifying specific waste streams, such as office paper, and determining energy and water usage to establish a baseline. A baseline will be used to identify opportunities for improvement and to assess progress of your action plan. A facility-wide audit may be necessary to identify how specific data is collected, and initiatives already underway.\nStep 5: Identifying Opportunities for Improvement, Prioritizing Efforts and Setting Goals\nStart with a small pilot project. It is easy to take on too many projects all at once since there are a lot of great ideas out there. Begin your pollution prevention program with a small project with a short payback period, such as, switching to energy efficient light bulbs. This will help you gain additional support and credibility. You can then expand your program little by little over a period of time, such as three to five years or even longer depending on resources and other company goals.\nTry to set goals that are specific, measurable, and can be completed in a specific time period. For example:\n- Increase purchase of reusable products by 25% by the next fiscal year.\n- Reduce packaging waste or total solid waste by 20% in 12 months.\n- Reduce energy or water use by 10% in 12 months and 5% every 12 months for next 3 years.\n- Reduce purchases of products that are disposed of as hazardous wastes by 10% by the next fiscal year.\nStep 6: Developing an Action Plan\nOnce you have identified opportunities for improvement and prioritized your efforts, an action plan should be developed that includes specific policies and procedures for at least the immediate projects. This action plan will be essential to move your environmental efforts forward.\nIn your action plan, outline any changes in infrastructure that are required. For example, if a recycling program is being adopted, then you will need to provide recycling bins near printers, with trash cans located farther away. Do you have the right equipment and enough room to increase your recycling types and volumes? Do you have storage space that can be transformed into a company store to encourage reuse of office supplies, furniture, electronics, and batteries?\nInclude a list of administrative needs, such as Request For Proposal (RFP) and contract language for recycling vendors, Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) vendors, or energy auditors. Include pollution prevention program tasks in job descriptions as needed.\nStep 7: Determining a Strategy for Tracking, Evaluating, and Reporting a Team’s Progress\nJust like any other strategic goal for your company, it is imperative to track the progress of your pollution prevention program. Use a software program to track the data that was gathered when you determined your baseline and then assess your progress towards meeting your goals. Including success stories of the company’s pollution prevention program in an annual report or meeting is a good way to maintain momentum and demonstrate commitment to the company’s environmental goals.\nRequest feedback from employees both during and after a specific project is initiated. Incorporate feedback into the action plan to prepare for the next project or to improve the current project.\nStep 8: Initiating an Education and Awareness Effort\nDevelop an education program that includes an initial education effort to provide information about the goals of the program and a description of the immediate projects. Provide information about how employees can participate in the effort. When a specific project is initiated, make sure that all affected employees are trained as education is a critical part of implementation.\nWhen new employees are hired, provide information on your pollution prevention program and specific projects so they’re familiar with your company’s goals and practices.\nProvide a way for employees to give feedback and suggestions to your Green Team. This could consist of a suggestion box near your notice board or an on-line computer program. Set up a system for evaluating the suggestion or feedback, responding to the employee, and using it to improve the program or a specific product, if possible.\nDesignate a member of the Green Team to manage all communication efforts for the program to maintain a clear, consistent message to employees.\nIHC’s Green Strategies Idea Tracker\nAt Intermountain Healthcare, an electronic database, named the Green Strategies Idea Tracker, was created to organize and review all “green” suggestions received by staff via their regional Green Strategies Team representative. All ideas are reviewed by the Green Strategies Team and a response is sent to the staff member that generated the idea.\nStep 9: Launching Your Program\nPost notices in key areas of your business to educate staff on new policies and progress reports. Consider developing a notice board located in a central location that can be used to post new policies, progress reports, and success stories. Continue monthly or more frequent meetings with the Green Team to review ongoing efforts, make adjustments as needed, and collaborate on new initiatives.\nPost signs or stickers to educate staff on simple ways to reduce energy and water usage, and use resources more efficiently. Signs can include: reminders near printers to double-side print as often as possible, notes in break areas to encourage staff to use non-disposable mugs and cups, reminders near thermostats to use air conditioning and heat in moderation, and reminders near light switches to encourage staff to turn off lights when they leave a room.\nStep 10: Sharing and Celebrating Successes\nProvide information on your company’s progress in newsletters (preferably on-line) and meetings. Make sure to equate your company’s successes in terms of the number of trees spared, energy and water saved, or the amount of waste diverted from the landfill via source reduction, re-use, or recycling.\nGive rewards and recognition to Green Team members and key members of your company when you celebrate your successes. Be sure to share your company’s goals and successes with your community. Your environmental program goals and successes can be an effective marketing opportunity.","Until very recently, many energy and resource executives believed they could meet sustainability requirements by publicizing a few carefully chosen environmental projects and technology programs. In annual reports and TV ads, these companies have highlighted their successes in, for example, reducing fugitive emissions, developing biofuels and protecting fragile environments—initiatives of which executives can justly feel proud.\nBut as the climate change dialogue intensifies, and as the calls to take action gain urgency, events are overtaking that traditional, project-by-project approach. For every promotional ad about a company’s efforts to invest in carbon capture or restore wetlands, a million tweets showing a marine animal trapped in plastic make their way around the world and onto the phones of a company’s customers.\nMost energy and natural resources CEOs would say that their companies have accelerated their sustainability efforts (see Figure 1). But many would also admit that they have fallen behind in this first round of discussion with their stakeholders and customers, who have different expectations about the speed and scale of response. As students take to the streets on climate strike Fridays, customers demand greener products, lawmakers press industry for action and investors begin to demand more accountability. Utilities, agriculture, mining, chemicals and oil and gas companies find themselves on the back foot, with the stakes rising ever higher and the recognition that their asset value and social license to operate may be at risk.\nThe list of sustainability priorities is long and varied across energy and natural resource sectors\nThese companies do not lack the organizational expertise to change how they operate. But they are limited by their own definitions of their businesses and the narrow range of their strategic goals. For most, the goal has always been to deliver an ever-increasing output—whether oil, gas, chemicals, electricity, raw materials or food—safely and at the lowest cost. Doing so in an entirely sustainable way that incorporates responsible consumption and waste management, all with a target net-zero carbon footprint, was not part of the mandate—until now.\nTheir traditional approach risks stranding resource producers in increasingly defensive and reactive positions, with a dwindling amount of time to deliver change and little opportunity to differentiate themselves from competitors. Instead, leadership in the sector will increasingly demand strategic thinking about resources, from production through end use and beyond. Too few companies are stepping up to the challenge; most are investing no more than 10% of their capital in programs to become more sustainable and carbon-neutral.\nIt’s not enough: Any other corporate ambition intended to fundamentally shift a company’s direction would start by investing at least 30% of new capital to build sufficient scale and momentum, eventually committing more than half of new investment capital in the new direction.\nThe argument for a cautious approach rests on the need to maintain returns from the traditional core. But there is also risk in waiting too long. As disruptive technology advances, capital remains abundant and sentiment shifts, first movers are likely to see greater returns. Already, companies such as Neste and Ørsted are enjoying strong shareholder support as they build scale in renewables and biofuels. Those slower to move, with average to poor operational capability, can always expect a rough ride.\nWithin the energy sector, power utilities appear to have made the greatest sustained push and set the boldest ambitions (see Figure 2). Bain research finds that among major utilities in Europe and North America, new capital expenditure on greener investments ranged from 15% to 47% of total spending over the past three years. Globally, investment in renewable power generation outstrips investments in fossil fuels and nuclear power combined, and renewables now account for more than a third of global power-generation capacity. Some leaders are pushing the envelope. Enel wants to become entirely carbon-neutral by 2050, and Duke Energy has committed to cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030 and operating at net-zero carbon levels by 2050.\nBain benchmarked 37 global companies in oil and gas, utilities, chemicals, agriculture and mining to see how their sustainability efforts rank\nMining and oil and gas companies are also raising their sustainability ambitions, but investment to date has been limited. One example of an ambitious commitment is BHP’s recent announcement that it would take a $780 million write-down to switch from coal to a power-purchase agreement based on renewables at its Chilean copper operations.\nChemicals and agricultural strategies tend to focus on enabling customer sustainability through product development and adhering to the principles of circularity, which reduces waste. They see greater potential there than in simply transforming their own operations, which has been an area of historical focus. Major chemical companies such as BASF have pushed hard to improve energy efficiency in operations and are now steering R&D spending toward biofeedstock, recycling, lighter-weight materials and battery technologies. Upstream agricultural providers like Nutrien and Syngenta are investing in ways to boost productivity, limit land use and promote biodiversity at farms\nIn the oil and gas industry, Repsol’s commitment to becoming a net-zero company by 2050, including its production and the emissions from its products, stands out. Finnish oil refiner Neste’s repositioning of its portfolio to green products and Danish energy company Ørsted’s divestment of oil and natural gas resources in favor of wind power demonstrate investor appetite to support these more radical moves.\nThese industry sectors may be at different starting points, but they all face a steep climb. And they need a program that sets a sturdy foundation for significant change, one that lays out a roadmap to raise urgency and activity to meet expectations.\nSetting a foundation for progress\nTaking responsibility for one’s own consumption, waste and emissions is a start. But true sustainability leadership entails becoming a steward of resources throughout the value chain. Senior executives who truly understand their own business will need to adopt principles of a circular economy, widening their frame of responsibility to include upstream suppliers and downstream customers and across sectors. They will become champions of innovation with economic and ecological benefits within a full-cycle resource system that includes waste and recycling. And they will use their capabilities and assets not just to invest directly in change, but also to mobilize larger pools of capital.\nThe prospect may seem overwhelming, but executives can begin laying a foundation by focusing on three strategic actions.\n- Set a guiding ambition. CEOs of energy and resource companies are increasingly being asked where they are taking the company on sustainability. Institutional investors, who are themselves under pressure to adopt a more environmentally friendly portfolio, want to understand the sustainability ambitions of the companies they invest in. So it is essential to be able to describe the path you are taking—not necessarily in great detail, but by setting expectations and establishing a positive change trajectory.\nHowever, that is not the only reason to set a clear ambition. Big companies tend to perform better with a clear, top-down framework that helps the business set its priorities and agenda. Given their starting positions, no energy or resource company could hope to switch to a more sustainable model without clear direction from the top ranks that can then systematically be driven across the portfolio.\nIt may be easiest to think about setting the ambition as a three-part process (see Figure 3). First, top executives need to understand the baseline—where are we starting from? Second, how does that compare with others in our business, and what can we learn from industry benchmarks? Finally, the result of these first two steps should point to untapped, game-changing opportunities: what is possible in the short and medium term, rather than just the long term?\nAs with a continuous improvement program, ambition and goals will need to be reevaluated and improved as companies learn more, technology improves and conditions change. Executives will discover that it is possible to go further faster than they had originally anticipated.\nSustainability strategy focuses on bold, resilient moves and risk management on priority topics including carbon emissions\n- Engage investors and other stakeholders. As stakeholders become more sophisticated and better equipped to participate in discussions about sustainability, the level of engagement is shifting (see Figure 4). The debate is no longer about this or that initiative, but rather the entire structure and purpose of the organization, as well as its direction.\nIt is also, increasingly, about cooperating with stakeholders to identify common ground that moves everyone toward the goal of, for example, reducing carbon emissions. If the relationship among stakeholders remains adversarial, everything will be difficult. Executives, board members and shareholders have a large role to play in nurturing these new relationships and enabling change.\nInstitutional investors who have approved more climate proposals hold smaller investments in energy and natural resources\n- Develop focused partnerships. Companies in the energy and resource sector have a track record of working closely together to develop new projects, technologies and processes, as a way to spread risk. Finding a single industry direction on sustainability may be more difficult because the rules and metrics are not yet commonly recognized and written down. Organizations do not know where they are headed or how much they will change.\nBecause companies are starting from differing baselines and aspirations, effective partnerships are likely to focus on solutions to specific problems. The Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a coalition of chemicals and consumer products companies, is one example. Similarly, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative brings together 13 international and national oil companies to target three objectives: reducing energy use in the supply chain, accelerating low-carbon solutions and enabling a circular carbon model.\nWhen energy and resource companies turn to the operational aspects of sustainability, most find they can accomplish quite a bit in a short amount of time. The same capabilities that contribute to excellence in such areas as operations, manufacturing and supply chain can also be applied to reducing energy use, curbing emissions and minimizing waste. The transformation is not unlike the digital transformations at their organizations over the past decade—new processes that talented engineers are often very enthusiastic to apply and can be scaled up to benefit the entire organization. If the goal is to reduce emissions, companies can launch initiatives on three dimensions.\n- Reduce the carbon intensity of operations. Many of the quick wins of sustainability occur first in operational efficiency, making this a logical area of focus. Since no single company is embarking on this journey alone, an entire sector can learn from the experience. Within operations, three levers offer the greatest potential for reducing carbon intensity: avoidance, carbon capture and offsets. Generally, these levers can support about 25%, 40% and 35% of the challenge, respectively.\nBut as with cost reductions or digital advances, companies also can gain a competitive edge by identifying proprietary processes that deliver products and services with a lower carbon footprint. What is the advantage? Assuming all other properties are equal, the greener product may emerge the winner in the coming marketplace (see Figure 5).\nOil and gas producers are under pressure to reduce operational CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions across the global supply curve toward the goal of net zero\n- Shrink the carbon footprint of the supply chain. Companies can reduce the carbon output of their own operations and still have very little impact on the cumulative footprint of their products. They will need to work with suppliers, distributors and customers to improve sustainability, renegotiating and, when necessary, shifting to suppliers of different products and practices. In oil and gas, the supply chain can provide as much as 10% of operational improvement opportunities, and in other sectors, the supply chain may emit more greenhouse gases than the company itself does.\n- Develop a portfolio of sustainable products and services. Over the long term, executives need to rebalance their traditional product lines and create new products that are less carbon-intensive for end users. For oil and gas companies, these new products may include alternative fuels. In chemicals, companies are already hard at work to make plastics that are more recyclable and less likely to be discarded after a single use. Utilities have been shifting investment to renewable power generation, large-scale battery storage, and more efficient transmission and distribution systems.\nThree key themes will shape the redefinition of product lines:\n- Circularity. How much of what we produce comes back to the producer or can otherwise be reused rather than falling out of the value cycle as waste?\n- Changing the mix. How can we use different materials that allow us to make products with less carbon or waste? How can we design products that are easier to recycle or reuse?\n- Responsible packaging and end use. Beyond the creation of the product, how can it reach its end user with less waste? Can the consumer easily manage the waste that results from its use?\nAs the global population approaches 9.7 billion by 2050, much of that growth will be in emerging markets, where energy and natural resources companies are likely to encounter their greatest sustainability challenges. Developed markets in the US and Europe are converging on some sustainability issues: increasing regulatory pressure, actively engaged consumers and robust innovation ecosystems that can bring solutions to scale quickly. Emerging markets face more challenging issues as they try to raise sustainability levels while managing their economies, population growth, and deficiencies in skills and infrastructure.\nIn these markets, energy and natural resources companies can play a significant role in sustainability, just as they did in industrialization. Utilities can make commitments to support energy access and affordability, while investing in renewables and distributed energy. Agricultural companies can provide small farms with more sophisticated offerings, such as traceable products to improve source tracking. And companies in oil and gas and chemicals can pool resources to tackle some of the most stubborn problems, including plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\nA long-term roadmap helps executives create a realistic carbon emissions reduction plan\nCreating a progressive, compelling roadmap will help companies, customers and shareholders focus their efforts, and will deliver tangible progress in shifting from resource production to resource stewardship (see Figure 6). The path to sustainability for energy and resource companies promises to be narrow and fraught with challenges and setbacks. But so, too, was their path to industrial and economic success.

{"question":"How do the archaeological preservation challenges differ between Mohenjo-daro and the Warren Wilson site, particularly regarding environmental factors and excavation impacts?","answer":"Mohenjo-daro faces more severe preservation challenges, including groundwater salinity and improper restoration that has led to collapsing walls, with experts warning the site could disappear by 2030 without improved conservation measures. The site's hot desert climate with extremely hot summers also affects preservation. At Warren Wilson, the preservation challenges were less severe, with the main damage occurring from initial plowing that destroyed some house floors and pit features. The site's stratified nature actually helped preserve artifacts within soil layers, and excavations were eventually limited to protect the remains. The Warren Wilson site's more temperate environment in the Appalachian region appears to present fewer environmental threats to preservation compared to Mohenjo-daro's harsh desert conditions.","context":["Warren Wilson (Mississippian)\nWarren Wilson (31BN29) is a late prehistoric Cherokee village, located along the Swannanoa River on the Warren Wilson College campus. Importantly, the site is stratified, meaning that the layers in the soil are preserved along with the artifacts within them. The main occupation of the site happened during the Pisgah phase (A.D. 1000-1450) of the South Appalachian Mississippian tradition. Warren Wilson was excavated continuously every summer between 1966 and 1985, except for 1977 and 1983. Because of this, it has been extensively documented, and much has been written about the occupations there, including 2 books (Bennie Keel’s 1976 Cherokee Archaeology and Roy Dickens’s 1976 Cherokee Prehistory), 4 Ph.D. dissertations, 2 Master’s theses, and numerous journal articles. Data collected during the numerous archaeological excavations is still being researched by people like Dr. Christopher Rodning of Tulane University.\nHistory of Excavations\nWarren Wilson was first recorded in 1941 by Harold E. Johnston. The excavation history of Warren Wilson began during the fall of 1965, during a North American Archaeology class taught by Dr. Joffre Coe. One day a student brought in a shoe box filled with potsherds and other artifacts collected from the bottomland along the Swannanoa River on the Warren Wilson College campus. After taking a look at the artifacts, in December Coe sent Roy Dickens to the Warren Wilson campus to take a look at the site. College officials were notified and, in an attempt to make sure Dickens found material, they plowed the site as deeply as possible to bring fresh artifacts to the surface. While this did result in new artifacts, unfortunately the plowing also destroyed intact house floors and the tops of several pit features.\nExcavations by the University of North Carolina began at Warren Wilson in 1966, led by Roy Dickens, and wrapped up in 1985. Later excavations were directed by Dr. David Moore, a professor at Warren Wilson College. Throughout the period of excavations, most of the student labor came from Warren Wilson College, while the field supervisors came from the University of North Carolina. Roughly half of the village has been excavated.\nWarren Wilson is best known for its later components, but it is important to note that the site contains Archaic (8000-1000 B.C.) remains beneath the late prehistoric and historic occupations. Researchers found Savannah River Stemmed points, Otarre Stemmed points, fragments of steatite vessels, and rock-filled hearths. All of this was within a dark, organic-rich band of sandy loam beneath deposits that dated to the Early Woodland and Late Prehistoric periods. Charcoal found in two of the hearths allowed for radiocarbon dates to be taken. One of the hearths that also had a Savannah River Stemmed spear point, dated to about 3000 B.C. The other hearth did not have any diagnostic artifacts within it and dated to about 1500 B.C.\nAlthough no food remains have been analyzed from the Late Archaic occupation at Warren Wilson, the large numbers of spear points and butchering and hide-working tools show that people at the site relied heavily on hunting. Information from southeastern Tennessee helps round out this information, showing that in addition to hunting and fishing, Late Archaic people supplemented their diets by harvesting large amounts of acorns and hickory nuts. Squash and gourds began being cultivated as early as 3000 B.C. and by the end of the Late Archaic period, sunflower, maygrass, and chenopodium were on the path towards domestication.\nThe Early Woodland occupation (1000-300 B.C.) at Warren Wilson is termed the Swannanoa phase. It is characterized by pottery with crushed quartz or coarse sand added to the clay as a tempering agent and extremely thick walls. Most pots have cord or fabric impressions on their exterior surfaces. Small, stemmed projectile points were also found, consisting of Swannanoa Stemmed, Plott Stemmed, and Gypsy points. These are found stratigraphically associated (within the same layer) with Transylvania Triangular points, which also seem to be associated with the introduction of the bow-and-arrow.\nThe most common features at Warren Wilson during the Swannanoa phase include large hearth areas with clusters of rock that were cracked apart by heat (called fire-cracked rock). Some of these hearths were over five feet across with many layers of tightly packed quartz cobbles, a pattern that is very unusual. There were also large, boat-shaped pits and several postholes, although excavators were unable to define any house structures. It is unclear if Swannanoa phase people lived at the site year round, but they clearly lived there enough to create extensive deposits.\nDespite having these rich, early deposits, Warren Wilson is primarily known for its Pisgah phase excavations (A.D. 1000-1450). Pisgah settlements ranged in size from small farmsteads to relatively large nucleated villages, sometimes containing platform mounds. Small sites are usually clustered around the larger villages that have mounds and are almost always located in floodplain areas. Most sites are in the eastern and central portions of the Appalachian Summit.\nWarren Wilson seems to be a typical, middle-sized Pisgah village. It covers roughly 3 acres and is surrounded by at least seven palisade lines. The inner series of palisades may have functioned as a wall, separating the central plaza from the habitation area outside. This central area may have been reserved for ceremonial and political activities, similar to square grounds seen at historic Cherokee villages. The outer band of palisades was probably a double-walled enclosure that protected the people living within the village.\nHouses at Warren Wilson were roughly rectangular and measured about 20 ft. on a side. Individual posts were set in holes to make walls and most houses had a central hearth basin with prepared clay border. Entry trenches with small postholes for saplings show that half the structures had a tunnel-like entrance. All of the houses had central support posts for their interiors and some had additional posts used to form divisions within the houses. Given the cold winters in the Appalachian Summit, house walls were probably finished with cane wattle (where cane reeds were woven horizontally through the saplings) and sealed with clay, keeping in heat during the winter months. Archaeologists did not find much clay plaster, although this is probably due to the fact that none of the houses burned; without firing and hardening, plaster would rarely be preserved in the archaeological record.\nAt the edge of the village near the outer palisades, archaeologists found large, shallow depressions. Some of these measured over 10 ft. long and 5 ft. wide, although they were less than a foot deep. The bottoms of these depressions were often partially or completely lined with a thin layer of clay. Most had high densities of artifacts, food remains, charcoal, and fire-cracked rocks. Archaeologists interpret these features as roasting pits that could have been used to prepare large quantities of food for community-wide celebrations.\nPit hearths have also been uncovered. These were smaller than the roasting pits and may have been used to heat sweat lodges, since they were usually found inside small structures. Interestingly, however, Warren Wilson has almost no storage pits. This indicates that Pisgah people must have been using above-ground cribs and granaries, located over pits dug into the ground. The use of above-ground storage suggests that the villages may have been occupied year round; the storage buildings could not have been easily hidden and would have made easy targets for thieves and looters if they were left unattended.\nIn addition to the houses and food facilities, 61 burials were excavated at Warren Wilson. Most were placed inside or adjacent to a house. Bodies were placed in a fetal position with heads oriented westward and were probably wrapped with mats or furs. Burial pits were simple straight-sided pits or shaft-and-chamber pits. Grave remains consisted of ornamental items made from shell, animal bone, or mica. The most common burial objects were columella beads that were strung to create bracelets or necklaces.\nIn terms of Pisgah subsistence, deer and bear were the most important animals in the diet, followed by wild turkey. People also hunted squirrels, rabbits, opossum, raccoons, fish, and turtles. The floodplain environment of Warren Wilson and other Pisgah sites afforded people the opportunity to plant fields of corn, beans, squash/pumpkin, and sumpweed. In fact, half of Pisgah subsistence may have come from their agricultural produce. People also continued to collect acorns, hickory nuts, walnuts, butternuts, and a variety of fleshy fruits.\nOne of the most unusual discoveries at the Warren Wilson site was a feature containing an unusually large amount of toad (Bufo sp.) bones. The large, shallow pit had a single deposit of almost 14,000 toad forearm bones (radii/ulnae). The bones were found concentrated in a small area, mixed with many other animal bones. This led the faunal analyst, Dr. Jeannette Runquist, to suggest that the Pisgah people living at the site may have processed the toads for medicinal or hallucinogenic purposes. A similar discovery was made at the Qualla phase Coweeta Creek site in Macon County.\nDickens, Roy S., Jr.\n1976 • Cherokee Prehistory: The Pisgah Phase in the Appalachian Summit Region.

Built around 2500 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, and one of the world's earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Norte Chico. Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.\nThe city's original name is unknown. Based on his analysis of a Mohenjo-daro seal, Iravatham Mahadevan speculates that the city's ancient name could have been Kukkutarma, the city of the cockerel [kukkuta]. Cock-fighting may have had ritual and religious significance for the city, with domesticated chickens bred there for sacred purposes, rather than as a food source. Mohenjo-daro may also have been a point of diffusion for the eventual worldwide domestication of chickens.\nMohenjo-daro is located west of the Indus River in Larkana District, Sindh, Pakistan, in a central position between the Indus River and the Ghaggar-Hakra River. It is situated on a Pleistocene ridge in the middle of the flood plain of the Indus River Valley, around 28 kilometres (17 mi) from the city of Larkana. The ridge was prominent during the time of the Indus Valley Civilization, allowing the city to stand above the surrounding flood, but subsequent flooding has since buried most of the ridge in silt deposits. The Indus still flows east of the site, but the Ghaggar-Hakra riverbed on the western side is now dry.\nMohenjo-daro has a hot desert climate with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The highest recorded temperature is 53.5 °C (128.3 °F), and the lowest recorded temperature is −5.4 °C (22.3 °F). Rainfall is low, and mainly occurs in the monsoon season that is July to September.\nMohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BCE. It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, which developed around 3,000 BCE from the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian border, south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an outpost in Bactria, with major urban centres at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi. Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning. When the Indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 BCE, Mohenjo-daro was abandoned.\nRediscovery and excavation\nThe ruins of the city remained undocumented for around 3,700 years until R. D. Banerji, an officer of the Archaeological Survey of India, visited the site in 1919–20 identifying what he thought to be a Buddhist stupa (150–500 CE) known to be there and finding a flint scraper which convinced him of the site's antiquity. This led to large-scale excavations of Mohenjo-daro led by Kashinath Narayan Dikshit in 1924–25, and John Marshall in 1925–26. In the 1930s major excavations were conducted at the site under the leadership of Marshall, D. K. Dikshitar and Ernest Mackay. Further excavations were carried out in 1945 by Mortimer Wheeler and his trainee, Ahmad Hasan Dani. The last major series of excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1965 by George F. Dales. After 1965 excavations were banned due to weathering damage to the exposed structures, and the only projects allowed at the site since have been salvage excavations, surface surveys, and conservation projects. In the 1980s, German and Italian survey groups led by Michael Jansen and Maurizio Tosi used less invasive archaeological techniques, such as architectural documentation, surface surveys, and localized probing, to gather further information about Mohenjo-daro. A dry core drilling conducted in 2015 by Pakistan's National Fund for Mohenjo-daro revealed that the site is larger than the unearthed area.\nArchitecture and urban infrastructure\nMohenjo-daro has a planned layout with rectilinear buildings arranged on a grid plan. Most were built of fired and mortared bricks, some incorporated sun-dried mud-brick and wooden superstructures. The covered area of Mohenjo-daro is estimated at 300 hectares. The Oxford Handbook of Cities in World History offers a weak estimate of a peak population of around 40,000.\nThe sheer size of the city, and its provision of public buildings and facilities, suggests a high level of social organization. The city is divided into two parts, the so-called Citadel and the Lower City. The Citadel, a mud-brick mound around 12 metres (39 ft) high is known to have supported public baths, a large residential structure designed to house about 5,000 citizens, and two large assembly halls. The city had a central marketplace, with a large central well. Individual households or groups of households obtained their water from smaller wells. Waste water was channelled to covered drains that lined the major streets. Some houses, presumably those of more prestigious inhabitants, include rooms that appear to have been set aside for bathing, and one building had an underground furnace (known as a hypocaust), possibly for heated bathing. Most houses had inner courtyards, with doors that opened onto side-lanes. Some buildings had two stories.\nIn 1950, Sir Mortimer Wheeler identified one large building in Mohenjo-daro as a 'Great Granary'. Certain wall-divisions in its massive wooden superstructure appeared to be grain storage-bays, complete with air-ducts to dry the grain. According to Wheeler, carts would have brought grain from the countryside and unloaded them directly into the bays. However, Jonathan Mark Kenoyer noted the complete lack of evidence for grain at the 'granary', which, he argued, might therefore be better termed a 'Great Hall' of uncertain function. Close to the 'Great Granary' is a large and elaborate public bath, sometimes called the Great Bath. From a colonnaded courtyard, steps lead down to the brick-built pool, which was waterproofed by a lining of bitumen. The pool measures 12 metres (39 ft) long, 7 metres (23 ft) wide and 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) deep. It may have been used for religious purification. Other large buildings include a 'Pillared Hall', thought to be an assembly hall of some kind, and the so-called 'College Hall', a complex of buildings comprising 78 rooms, thought to have been a priestly residence.\nMohenjo-daro had no series of city walls, but was fortified with guard towers to the west of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative centre. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is obvious from the identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there was some kind of political or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative centre remains unclear.\nWater supply and wells\nThe location of Mohenjo-daro was built in a relatively short period of time, with the water supply system and wells being some of the first planned constructions. With the excavations done so far, over 700 wells are present at Mohenjo-daro, alongside drainage and bathing systems. This number is unheard of when compared to other civilizations at the time, such as Egypt or Mesopotamia, and the quantity of wells transcribes as one well for every three houses. Because the large number of wells, it is believed that the inhabitants relied solely on annual rainfall, as well as the Indus River's course remaining close to the site, alongside the wells providing water for long periods of time in the case of the city coming under siege. Due to the period in which these wells were built and used, it is likely that the circular brick well design used at this and many other Harappan sites are an invention that should be credited to the Indus civilization, as there is no existing evidence of this design from Mesopotamia or Egypt at this time, and even later. Sewage and waste water for buildings at the site were disposed of via a centralized drainage system that ran alongside the site's streets. These drains that ran alongside the road were effective at allowing most human waste and sewage to be disposed of as the drains tool the waste most likely toward the Indus River. It is theorized that the job of keeping the pipes clean and from getting piled up was either a job for slaves, or captured enemy soldiers, with others who believe it was a paid job for citizens of the city.\nFlooding and rebuilding\nThe city also had large platforms perhaps intended as defence against flooding. According to a theory first advanced by Wheeler, the city could have been flooded and silted over, perhaps six times, and later rebuilt in the same location. For some archaeologists, it was believed that a final flood that helped engulf the city in a sea of mud brought about the abandonment of the site. Gregory Possehl was the first to theorize that the floods were caused by overuse and expansion upon the land, and that the mud flood was not the reason the site was abandoned. Instead of a mud flood wiping part of the city out in one fell swoop, Possehl coined the possibility of constant mini-floods throughout the year, paired with the land being worn out by crops, pastures, and resources for bricks and pottery spelled the downfall of the site.\nNumerous objects found in excavation include seated and standing figures, copper and stone tools, carved seals, balance-scales and weights, gold and jasper jewellery, and children's toys. Many bronze and copper pieces, such as figurines and bowls, have been recovered from the site, showing that the inhabitants of Mohenjo-daro understood how to utilize the lost wax technique. The furnaces found at the site are believed to have been used for copperworks and melting the metals as opposed to smelting. There even seems to be an entire section of the city dedicated to shell-working, located in the north-eastern part of the site. Some of the most prominent copperworks recovered from the site are the copper tablets which have examples of the untranslated Indus script and iconography. While the script has not been cracked yet, many of the images on the tablets match another tablet and both hold the same caption in the Indus language, with the example given showing three tablets with the image of a mountain goat and the inscription on the back reading the same letters for the three tablets. Pottery and terracotta sherds have been recovered from the site, with many of the pots having deposits of ash in them, leading Archaeologists to believe they were either used to hold the ashes of a person or as a way to warm up a home located in the site. These heaters, or braziers, were ways to heat the house while also being able to be utilized in a manner of cooking or straining, while others solely believe they were used for heating. Many important objects from Mohenjo-daro are conserved at the National Museum of India in Delhi and the National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi. In 1939, a representative collection of artefacts excavated at the site was transferred to the British Museum by the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India.\nMother Goddess Idol\nDiscovered by John Marshall in 1931, the idol appears to mimic certain characteristics that match the Mother Goddess belief common in many early Near East civilizations. Sculptures and figurines depicting women have been observed as part of Harappan culture and religion, as multiple female pieces were recovered from Marshall's archaeological digs. These figures were not categorized correctly, according to Marshall, meaning that where they were recovered from the site is not actually clear. One of said figures, pictured below, is 18.7 cm tall and is currently on display at the National Museum of Pakistan, in Karachi. The fertility and motherhood aspects on display on the idols is represented by the female genitalia that is presented in an almost exaggerated style as stated by Marshall, with him inferring that such figurines are offerings to the goddess, as opposed to the typical understanding of them being idols representing the goddess's likeness. Because of the figurines being unique in terms of hairstyles, body proportions, as well as headdresses and jewelry, there are theories as to who these figurines actually represent. Shereen Ratnagar theorizes that because of their uniqueness and dispersed discovery throughout the site that they could be figurines of ordinary household women, who commissioned these pieces to be used in rituals or healing ceremonies to help aforementioned individual women.\nIn 1927, a seated male soapstone figure was found in a building with unusually ornamental brickwork and a wall-niche. Though there is no evidence that priests or monarchs ruled Mohenjo-daro, archaeologists dubbed this dignified figure a Priest-King. The sculpture is 17.5 centimetres (6.9 in) tall, and shows a neatly bearded man with pierced earlobes and a fillet around his head, possibly all that is left of a once-elaborate hairstyle or head-dress, his hair is combed back. He wears an armband, and a cloak with drilled trefoil, single circle and double circle motifs, which show traces of red. His eyes might have originally been inlaid.\nA seal discovered at the site bears the image of a seated, cross-legged and possibly ithyphallic figure surrounded by animals. The figure has been interpreted by some scholars as a yogi, and by others as a three-headed 'proto-Shiva' as 'Lord of Animals'.\nSir Mortimer Wheeler was especially fascinated with this artifact, which he believed to be at least 4,500 years old. The necklace has an S-shaped clasp with seven strands, each over 4 ft long, of bronze-metal bead-like nuggets which connect each arm of the 'S' in filigree. Each strand has between 220 and 230 of the many-faceted nuggets, and there are about 1,600 nuggets in total. The necklace weighs about 250 grams in total, and is presently held in a private collection in India.\nSurviving structures at Mohenjo-daro\nPreservation work for Mohenjo-daro was suspended in December 1996 after funding from the Pakistan government and international organizations stopped. Site conservation work resumed in April 1997, using funds made available by the UNESCO. The 20-year funding plan provided $10 million to protect the site and standing structures from flooding. In 2011, responsibility for the preservation of the site was transferred to the government of Sindh.\nCurrently the site is threatened by groundwater salinity and improper restoration. Many walls have already collapsed, while others are crumbling from the ground up. In 2012, Pakistani archaeologists warned that, without improved conservation measures, the site could disappear by 2030.\n2014 Sindh Festival\nThe Mohenjo-daro site was further threatened in January 2014, when Bilawal Bhutto Zardari of the Pakistan People's Party chose the site for Sindh Festival's inauguration ceremony. This would have exposed the site to mechanical operations, including excavation and drilling. Farzand Masih, head of the Department of Archaeology at Punjab University warned that such activity was banned under the Antiquity Act, saying 'You cannot even hammer a nail at an archaeological site'. On 31 January 2014, a case was filed in the Sindh High Court to bar the Sindh government from continuing with the event. The festival was held by PPP at the historic site, despite all the protest by both national and international historians and educators."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c2e1a4e7-c588-49d1-893b-49d5f457ee0b>","<urn:uuid:618647da-1498-4ef8-9e6c-782b372bf482>"],"error":null}
{"question":"In both anarcho-capitalism and collectivist societies, how do they handle the challenge of maintaining social order and preventing abuse of power? Need detailed comparison of their different approaches and real-world examples.","answer":"Anarcho-capitalism and collectivist societies take very different approaches to maintaining social order. In anarcho-capitalism, society is believed to self-regulate through free market mechanisms and voluntary contracts without state intervention. The system relies on protection agencies run by people selected for their business efficiency and customer service, who are considered less likely to abuse power than traditional authority figures. David Friedman argues this makes anarcho-capitalist societies potentially safer from power grabs than current systems, since traditional systems select people who specifically desire power. In contrast, collectivist societies have various approaches, as demonstrated by real-world examples like communist states that heavily centralize control, Israeli kibbutzim that operate through voluntary communes, and experiments like Freetown Christiania in Denmark that abolish private property. These collectivist approaches focus on group ownership and collective decision-making rather than market mechanisms to maintain social order.","context":["Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy and school of anarchist thought that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of self-ownership, private property, and free markets. Anarcho-capitalists hold that, in the absence of statute (law by centralized decrees and legislation), society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through the discipline of the free market (in what its proponents describe as a voluntary society).\nI believe in individual freedom; that's my primary and complete commitment—individual liberty. That’s what it's all about. And that's what socialism was supposed to be about, or anarchism was supposed to be about, and tragically has been betrayed.\n- Although anarchism rests on liberal intellectual foundations, notably the distinction between state and society, the protean character of the doctrine makes it difficult to disinguish clearly different schools of anarchist thought. But one important distinction is between individualist anarchism and social anarchism. The former emphasizes individual liberty, the sovereignty of the individual, the importance of private property or possession, and the iniquity of all monopolies. It may be seen as liberalism taken to an extreme conclusion. 'Anarcho-capitalism' is a contemporary variant of this school.\n- Thomas Bottomore, Dictionary of Marxist Thought, Anarchism entry, p. 21 (1992).\n- Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few counterparts in human history. There isn't the slightest possibility that its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because they would quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error. … I should add, however, that I find myself in substantial agreement with people who consider themselves anarcho-capitalists on a whole range of issues; and for some years, was able to write only in their journals. And I also admire their commitment to rationality — which is rare — though I do not think they see the consequences of the doctrines they espouse, or their profound moral failings.\n- Noam Chomsky in Z Net, Answers from Chomsky to eight questions on anarchism, 1996.\n- Perhaps the best way to see why anarcho-capitalism would be much more peaceful than our present system is by analogy. Consider our world as it would be if the cost of moving from one country to another were zero. Everyone lives in a housetrailer and speaks the same language. One day, the president of France announces that because of troubles with neighboring countries, new military taxes are being levied and conscription will begin shortly. The next morning the president of France finds himself ruling a peaceful but empty landscape, the population having been reduced to himself, three generals, and twenty-seven war correspondents.\n- David Friedman, Chapter: \"The Stability Problem\", The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism (2nd ed.), p. 123.\n- We must ask, not whether an anarcho-capitalis society would be safe from a power grab by the men with the guns (safety is not an available option), but whether it would be safer than our society is from a comparable seizure of power by the men with the guns. I think the answer is yes. In our society, the men who must engineer such a coup are politicians, military officers, and policemen, men selected precisely for the characteristic of desiring power and being good at using it. They are men who already believe that they have a right to push other men around - that is their job. They are particularly well qualified for the job of seizing power. Under anarcho-capitalism the men in control of protection agencies are selected for their ability to run an efficient business and please their customers. It is always possible that some will turn out to be secret power freaks as well, but it is surely less likely than under our system where the corresponding jobs are labeled 'non-power freaks need not apply'.\n- David Friedman, Chapter: \"The Stability Problem\", The Machinery of Freedom: Guide to a Radical Capitalism (2nd ed.), p. 123–124.\n- Laissez-faire capitalism, or anarchocapitalism, is simply the economic form of the libertarian ethic. Laissez-faire capitalism encompasses the notion that men should exchange goods and services, without regulation, solely on the basis of value for value. It recognizes charity and communal enterprises as voluntary versions of this same ethic. Such a system would be straight barter, except for the widely felt need for a division of labor in which men, voluntarily, accept value tokens such as cash and credit. Economically, this system is anarchy, and proudly so.\n- [A]fter I got evicted from the Republican Party, I began reading considerably more of the works of American anarchists, thanks largely to Murray Rothbard … and I was just amazed.\n- The American Benjamin Tucker (1854-1939) believed that maximum individual liberty would be assured where the free market was not hindered or controlled by the State and monopolies. The affairs of society would be governed by myriad voluntary societies and cooperatives, by, as he aptly put it, “un-terrified” Jeffersonian democrats, who believed in the least government possible. Since World War II this tradition has been reborn and modified in the United States as anarcho-capitalism or libertarianism.\n- Individualist anarchism … stands in rigorous opposition to attacking the person or property of individuals. The philosophy revolves around the \"Sovereignty of the Individual\"—as an early champion, Josiah Warren, phrased it. … Largely due to the path breaking work of Murray Rothbard, 20th century individualist anarchism is no longer inherently suspicious of profit-making practices, such as charging interest. Indeed, it embraces the free market as the voluntary vehicle of economic exchange. But as individualist anarchism draws increasingly upon the work of Austrian economists such as Mises and Hayek, it draws increasingly farther away from left anarchism.\n- The philosophy of 'anarcho-capitalism' dreamed up by the 'libertarian' New Right, has nothing to do with Anarchism as known by the Anarchist movement proper. It is a lie . . . Patently unbridled capitalism . . . needs some force at its disposal to maintain class privileges, either from the State itself or from private armies. What they believe in is in fact a limited State -- that is, one in which the State has one function, to protect the ruling class, does not interfere with exploitation, and comes as cheap as possible for the ruling class. The idea also serves another purpose . . . a moral justification for bourgeois consciences in avoiding taxes without feeling guilty about it.\n- Albert Meltzer, Anarchism: Arguments For and Against (1981), p. 50.\n- I'm a, what, an anarcho-capitalist socialist… I don't know… I'm kinda a moderate, I think I'm moderate.\n- Krist Novoselic, interviewed by Nick Gillespie, \"Nirvana's Krist Novoselic on Punk, Politics, & Why He Dumped the Dems\", ReasonTV (19 June 2014), 11:33–11:42.\n- Capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism.\n- I define anarchist society as one where there is no legal possibility for coercive aggression against the person or property of any individual. Anarchists oppose the State because it has its very being in such aggression, namely, the expropriation of private property through taxation, the coercive exclusion of other providers of defense service from its territory, and all of the other depredations and coercions that are built upon these twin foci of invasions of individual rights.","Individual differences |\nMethods | Statistics | Clinical | Educational | Industrial | Professional items | World psychology |\nCollectivism is a term used to describe any doctrine that stresses the importance of a collective, rather than the importance of the individual. Collectivists believe the individual should be subordinate to the collective, which may be a group of individuals, a whole society, a state, a nation, a race, or a social class. Thus, collectivism contrasts with individualism, which emphasises the liberty of the individual.\nSome consider an early example of collectivist political philosophy to be Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “social contract”, which maintains that each individual is under implicit contract to submit his own will to the “general will” and that the state should enforce this general will. This notion of an ethical obligation to subordinate an individual’s will to the group will is in fundamental opposition to individualism which advocates that individual action should not be restricted by others.\nGenerally speaking, collectivism in the field of economics holds that things should be owned by the group and used for the benefit of all rather than being owned by individuals. Central to this view is the concept of the commons, as opposed to private property. Some collectivists apply this principle only to capital and land, while others argue that all valued commodities should be regarded as public goods and placed under public ownership.\nCollectivism in economics may or may not involve a state as a manager and steward of collective property. For instance, anarcho-communists, who argue for the immediate abolition of government, wish to place all goods under collective ownership. In 1876, at the Florence Conference of the Italian Federation of the International, where the principles of anarcho-communism were first laid out, it was stated:\nThe Italian Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity.\nCollectivist societies Edit\nThere are many examples of societies around the world which have characterized themselves or have been characterized by outsiders as “collectivist”.\nFor instance, there are the communist states, which have often collectivized most economic sectors (and agriculture in particular). On the other hand, there are Israeli kibbutzim (voluntary communes where people live and farm together without private ownership), and communities such as the Freetown Christiania in Denmark (a small anarchist political experiment centered around an abandoned military installation in Copenhagen; Christiania has laws abolishing private property).\nThe term collectivism is used more often by anti-collectivists than by anyone else. Supporters of Objectivism — Ayn Rand and many people influenced by her — claim that collectivism is fallacious in theory and immoral in practice. They further argue that many or most political ideologies (other than Objectivism itself) are forms of collectivism or at least contain significant collectivist elements. Ironically, Objectivism has been criticized by some for its emphasis on emulating Rand rather than on being a true individual with one’s own thoughts and feelings.\nOther ideologies that define themselves in opposition to collectivism include libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, which are seen by their supporters as defending individual rights against various forms of collectivism.\nSee also Edit\n|This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f1ef3581-39d6-4daa-96b0-3a60877d2cf5>","<urn:uuid:75b3e562-76ad-4f7a-9278-fcdad00a4ee4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Predictive Analytics and Business Intelligence differ in their approach to analyzing business data?","answer":"Predictive Analytics and Business Intelligence (BI) differ in their analytical depth and purpose. Business Intelligence focuses on surfacing existing data through built-in reports, dashboards, trend analysis, and data visualization to understand current operations and past performance. It primarily uses descriptive statistics to calculate information on fees, margins, staff utilization, and expenses. In contrast, Predictive Analytics goes beyond describing current data to forecast future outcomes using machine learning algorithms and statistical models. While it cannot guarantee future events, it provides probability-based forecasts and requires trained data scientists to build and validate models. BI is more focused on understanding what has happened, while Predictive Analytics attempts to determine what might happen in the future.","context":["Efficiently managing resources is one of the key challenges for service organizations. Not only are you trying to manage a range of projects of varying sizes and complexity, you’re trying to manage the pipeline of incoming work as well. Resource management is only one element of managing a successful service organization, but as resources are one of the largest expenses for companies operating in this space, resource management is crucial.\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) is a method for surfacing the data from your enterprise software to give you insights into business operations.\nBusiness intelligence is typically a combination of:\n- Built-in reports and dashboards\n- Trend analysis\n- Data visualization\n- Custom reporting\n- Data integration with other systems\nBI uses the data being entered by your consultants and project teams to calculate information on fees, margins, staff utilization, time and expenses, and more.\nThe great thing is that all the data is already in your system. Your teams are already using applications to schedule resources, book time, record planned vacation days, allocate work, and manage their tasks. Adding a BI layer allows your Operational System of Record, which has integrated these many different components, to see all the data required to drive business performance, including how to better carry out resource management for optimum results.\nThere are particular gains to be had in resource management because things never seem to go exactly as planned wherever humans are involved! Robust BI lets you quickly answer important questions about how a project or team is performing, and take early action to ensure the work stays on track. Here are five benefits of using BI alongside your resource management software solutions.\nBenefit #1: Match Availability to Work More Quickly\nAre you really sure who is available to take on that next client engagement? Spreadsheets are never 100% up to date. Timesheets are helpful for calculating billable hours but not for forecasting availability into the future.\nWhen your project teams are using an Operational System of Record with Business Intelligence components, it’s possible for your team members to forecast their availability more accurately. However, while that’s helpful for them on an individual engagement level, resource managers also need access to this information to plan who is assigned to new work flowing into the pipeline.\nA BI layer makes all this information discoverable. Standard reports can easily show who has availability in the time period required. You can save a lot of time crunching spreadsheets or contacting departmental managers trying to source someone with enough slack in their calendar to take on an urgent piece of work. Instead, let the reports surface the information you need to take decisions and book more work.\nBenefit #2: Match Skills to Work More Efficiently\nResource availability is certainly a factor when it comes to scheduling new client projects, but businesses also need to make sure the people booked for tasks have the right skills. Business Intelligence can help with this, as well. A people-centric solution will capture the skill profiles of your resources so you can match consultants to projects.\nThis is helpful at the start of a new project, but also helps if you uncover a need for a particular resource type or if the client requests a change that can only be met by someone with certain skills in the middle of a project. Your BI software can quickly uncover everything you need to know in real-time to incorporate that change and find the right person without losing time on the project overall.\nBenefit #3: Improve Profitability and Increase Margins\nThe final piece of resource allocation for many professional service businesses is finding the most profitable use of resources. You don’t want your most skilled consultants being allocated to projects where they can only be billed at a lower rate. Resource management systems provide the most profitable outcomes when the billable rates of consultants are taken into account too.\nOnce again, BI makes this possible. You can cut the data in any way you like to provide bespoke information about your resource pool. This has an immediate impact on financial performance. When the right consultants are being booked to the most appropriate jobs, you can take on higher-margin work and optimize utilization easily.\nBenefit #4: Eliminate Time-Consuming Repetitive Work\nAn element of professional services and project management is administrative. You need to document your findings, account for your time, and provide clients with the information they need in the form of regular reports. You can’t get away from that, but you can make completing routine and repetitive work easier.\nYour BI system can pull information together for you to save time on these tasks. For example, you can schedule tailored reports to run at various points within a project, and have them sent to clients or managers within your business.\nWhen you have a Business Intelligence solution doing the heavy lifting, people doing value-added, client-facing work can be more efficient and get more done.\nBenefit #5: Increase Customer Satisfaction\nMany of the most profitable projects are repeat business because acquiring a customer for the second time costs much less than making that initial bid. That’s why it’s so important to ensure customer satisfaction is front of mind during a project.\nUsing BI along with your resource management system is an easy way to make small changes that support your goal of customer satisfaction. For example, you can:\n- Ensure the right people are working on the right tasks, leading to better outcomes, a higher likelihood of on-time delivery and more reliable estimating\n- Secure the client’s ‘favorite’ resources based on their feedback\n- Switch in equally skilled staff during vacation time\n- Provide the client with detailed reporting about what individuals did and when, improving transparency and building trust.\nEnsuring the people who work directly with clients have the right skills to do the job is made easier when you can interrogate your data through a BI layer.\nThere are many advantages of having real-time, hands-on access to the data you need to make resourcing decisions in your business – these are just some of the common benefits we see time and time again. A BI layer can have a huge impact on business profitability and project outcomes. How much difference could it make to your teams?","For different stages of business analytics huge amount of data is processed at various steps. Depending on the stage of the workflow and the requirement of data analysis, there are four main kinds of analytics – descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive. These four types together answer everything a company needs to know- from what’s going on in the company to what solutions to be adopted for optimizing the functions.\nThe four types of analytics are usually implemented in stages and no one type of analytics is said to be better than the other. They are interrelated and each of these offers a different insight. With data being important to so many diverse sectors- from manufacturing to energy grids, most of the companies rely on one or all of these types of analytics. With the right choice of analytical techniques, big data can deliver richer insights for the companies\nBefore diving deeper into each of these, let’s define the four types of analytics:\n1) Descriptive Analytics: Describing or summarizing the existing data using existing business intelligence tools to better understand what is going on or what has happened.\n2) Diagnostic Analytics: Focus on past performance to determine what happened and why. The result of the analysis is often an analytic dashboard.\n3) Predictive Analytics: Emphasizes on predicting the possible outcome using statistical models and machine learning techniques.\n4) Prescriptive Analytics: It is a type of predictive analytics that is used to recommend one or more course of action on analyzing the data.\nLet’s understand these in a bit more depth.\n1. Descriptive Analytics\nThis can be termed as the simplest form of analytics. The mighty size of big data is beyond human comprehension and the first stage hence involves crunching the data into understandable chunks. The purpose of this analytics type is just to summarise the findings and understand what is going on.\nAmong some frequently used terms, what people call as advanced analytics or business intelligence is basically usage of descriptive statistics (arithmetic operations, mean, median, max, percentage, etc.) on existing data. It is said that 80% of business analytics mainly involves descriptions based on aggregations of past performance. It is an important step to make raw data understandable to investors, shareholders and managers. This way it gets easy to identify and address the areas of strengths and weaknesses such that it can help in strategizing.\nThe two main techniques involved are data aggregation and data mining stating that this method is purely used for understanding the underlying behavior and not to make any estimations. By mining historical data, companies can analyze the consumer behaviors and engagements with their businesses that could be helpful in targeted marketing, service improvement, etc. The tools used in this phase are MS Excel, MATLAB, SPSS, STATA, etc.\n2. Diagnostic Analytics\nDiagnostic analytics is used to determine why something happened in the past. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining and correlations. Diagnostic analytics takes a deeper look at data to understand the root causes of the events. It is helpful in determining what factors and events contributed to the outcome. It mostly uses probabilities, likelihoods, and the distribution of outcomes for the analysis.\nIn a time series data of sales, diagnostic analytics would help you understand why the sales have decrease or increase for a specific year or so. However, this type of analytics has a limited ability to give actionable insights. It just provides an understanding of causal relationships and sequences while looking backward.\nA few techniques that uses diagnostic analytics include attribute importance, principle components analysis, sensitivity analysis, and conjoint analysis. Training algorithms for classification and regression also fall in this type of analytics\n3. Predictive Analytics\nAs mentioned above, predictive analytics is used to predict future outcomes. However, it is important to note that it cannot predict if an event will occur in the future; it merely forecasts what are the probabilities of the occurrence of the event. A predictive model builds on the preliminary descriptive analytics stage to derive the possibility of the outcomes.\nThe essence of predictive analytics is to devise models such that the existing data is understood to extrapolate the future occurrence or simply, predict the future data. One of the common applications of predictive analytics is found in sentiment analysis where all the opinions posted on social media are collected and analyzed (existing text data) to predict the person’s sentiment on a particular subject as being- positive, negative or neutral (future prediction).\nHence, predictive analytics includes building and validation of models that provide accurate predictions. Predictive analytics relies on machine learning algorithms like random forests, SVM, etc. and statistics for learning and testing the data. Usually, companies need trained data scientists and machine learning experts for building these models. The most popular tools for predictive analytics include Python, R, Rapid Miner, etc.\nThe prediction of future data relies on the existing data as it cannot be obtained otherwise. If the model is properly tuned, it can be used to support complex forecasts in sales and marketing. It goes a step ahead of the standard BI in giving accurate predictions.\n4. Prescriptive Analytics\nThe basis of this analytics is predictive analytics but it goes beyond the three mentioned above to suggest the future solutions. It can suggest all favorable outcomes according to a specified course of action and also suggest various course of actions to get to a particular outcome. Hence, it uses a strong feedback system that constantly learns and updates the relationship between the action and the outcome.\nThe computations include optimization of some functions that are related to the desired outcome. For example, while calling for a cab online, the application uses GPS to connect you to the correct driver from among a number of drivers found nearby. Hence, it optimizes the distance for faster arrival time. Recommendation engines also use prescriptive analytics.\nThe other approach includes simulation where all the key performance areas are combined to design the correct solutions. It makes sure whether the key performance metrics are included in the solution. The optimization model will further work on the impact of the previously made forecasts. Because of its power to suggest favorable solutions, prescriptive analytics is the final frontier of advanced analytics or data science, in today’s term.\nThe four techniques in analytics may make it seem as if they need to be implemented sequentially. However, in most scenarios, companies can jump directly to prescriptive analytics. As for most of the companies, they are aware of or are already implementing descriptive analytics but if one has identified the key area that needs to be optimized and worked upon, they must employ prescriptive analytics to reach the desired outcome.\nAccording to research, prescriptive analytics is still at the budding stage and not many firms have completely used its power. However, the advancements in predictive analytics will surely pave the way for its development. Hope this article gave you a better understanding of the analytics spectrum."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2bf9880a-9498-4a81-a27f-404965127d70>","<urn:uuid:3c8f4162-d0c9-49dd-9ed3-4d1c806afae1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How vintage racing cars worked in past and what are current safety standards for them?","answer":"Vintage racing cars, particularly in the Canadian Vintage Modified series, must use stock roofs from before 1948 and utilize either an Inline 6 cylinder engine or a GM 602 Crate Engine. The Ontario Legends Series also features 5/8 scale versions of 1930s & 1940s Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge vehicles. Regarding current safety standards, while some vintage cars cannot accommodate certain modern safety equipment (like HANS devices due to physical impossibility), there is a push for implementing comprehensive safety measures. Safety experts recommend requiring minimal standards such as SFI-32A-5 or FIA-rated suits with mandatory full-length underwear, matching socks and shoes. Additionally, proper head-and-neck protection is emphasized, though implementation may require modifications to the race cars over time.","context":["At Sunset Speedway, we offer various kinds of racing to showcase your talent and abilities. Whether you are a beginner or amateur, we are happy to offer you a professional environment where you can learn, develop your skills, and most importantly have some fun.\nMini Stock racing is one of Sunset Speedways entry level divisions. Consisting of domestic and import four cylinder vehicles. These cars are allowed adjustment in suspension and engine but must use most Original Equipment Manufacturer parts. As an entry level division the age group varies with some drivers as young as 12 years old. Many racers in Super Stock and higher divisions have cut their teeth in the Mini Stock division. This is a great division for drivers to develop their skills.\nThe Super Stock division consists of cars based on 70’s and 80’s General Motors Chassis’(Camaro, Chevelle, Monte Carlo). These cars are allowed many suspension changes from stock and use very few Original Equipment Manufacturer parts. They are powered by modified Chevrolet Small Block Engine or a General Motors 602 Crate Engine. Bodies on these cars vary from steel stock type bodies to fiberglass versions of new generation muscle cars. This division is a utilized as an excellent driver development tool for those who look to ascend the racing ladder.\nLate models use tubular frames and are built from the ground up as a purpose built race car. These cars use modified Chevrolet Small Block, Ford 351, Dodge 360 or General Motors 602 Crate engine, These cars utilize plastic or fiberglass template or newer generation muscle car bodies and feature such brands as Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Toyota and Buick. As the highest division at Sunset Speedway these drivers compete in NASCAR’s Whelen All American Series Division One competing for the National Title.\nAPC LATE MODEL SERIES\nThe APC Racing Series was formed in the winter of 2014/2015 to bring a touring Late Model series back to Ontario. With a rule set bringing together cars and drivers from tracks across the province. The cars while looking like Sunset’s Sauble Falls Late Models are much different. They have different motor and suspension packages. With 2 stops at Sunset in 2015 you wont want miss this roster of over 40 plus drivers.\nONTARIO SUPER LATE MODEL SERIES\nOn the track, this particular type of racing offers plenty of excitement and action! The Ontario Super Late Model Series features a premier type of racing; the Super Late Model Outlaws have a unique body style and can boast the greatest horsepower of any Ontario stock car division. Specifically, these race cars feature a hood and nose combination which slopes to the ground on a steep angle creating down force and helping the handling of the cars.\nThe OSCAAR Modified division is one of the fastest growing series in Ontario. The open wheel cars utilize a wide rules package using cars based on the same chassis as the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series with some modifications. These cars use different crate and built engine packages along with an aggressive wide tire.\nONTARIO PRO CHALLENGE\nThis particular type of racing delivers full-throttle excitement and unbelievable weight-to-horsepower ratio. Pro Challenge race cars are ¾ spec scale, tube framed Nextel Cup styled cars. They are powered by sealed Kawasaki Ninja 1100 cc engines and are fabricated with tube frames and fibreglass body paneling. Pro Challenge has a network of tracks and distributors in over a half-dozen states in the United States and Canada. Sunset Speedway is proud to be part of the Pro Challenge racing family.\nCANADIAN VINTAGE MODIFIEDS\nThe Canadian Vintage Modified is a traveling vintage stock car racing series. This year, The Lucas Oil Canadian Vintage Modifieds will be entering their 49th season. The 2015 season will feature 13 races across the province. These cars must utilize a stock roof from before 1948. They also use a combination of either an Inline 6 cylinder engine or a GM 602 Crate Engine.\nThe Canam Midgets are celebrating over 45 years of open wheel racing in southern Ontario and the United States. These cars are open wheeled racers with a wing for down force. Power also comes from 750cc Kawasaki ZX7 motorcycle engines.\nSunset Speedway is proud to be a part of The Ontario Legends Series. The Ontario Legends Series is a family based racing series that is fun, friendly and competitive. It is also INEX* sanctioned. Legend Cars are a 5/8 scale versions of 1930s & 1940s Chevrolet, Ford and Dodge, coupes and sedans. The cars are powered by a 1.2 liter (75 cubic inch) engine, allowing them to reach speeds that are over 200 km/h (120 mph). Legend Cars are raced at over two hundred tracks and speedways in Canada and the United States.","Many safety manufacturers do their part to advance safety through laboratory and FEA simulation; however, according to Kelli Willmore from Impact in Indianapolis, Indiana, the real-world environment often dictates a different set of challenges that cannot be simulated or accounted for. “For instance, our subsidiary, MasterCraft Defense, live fire (blast tested) our energy attenuating seats, and we were able to successfully reduce a 55G blast energy to a survivable event. Unfortunately, we were too singularly focused on the blast. What we realized from the real-world environment is that our war-fighters were surviving the initial event, however they were experiencing grave injuries during the ‘vehicle slam down.’ MasterCraft Defense has since changed the parameters of our validation to include +Z axis tests in order to account for the initial event as well as the subsequent slam down.\n“Motorsports is no different,” she noted. “We learn more as an industry from a real-world incident than we could from lab tests. These unfortunate incidents allow us to evolve as a safety industry and advance our knowledge base.”\nWhen it comes to motorsports safety, oftentimes multiple systems operate in concert with one another. HMS Motorsport in Mooresville, North Carolina, works to provide racers with the equipment they need to stay safe in a race car, all from a single source. “We currently provide Schroth race belts, Stilo helmet, forward neck restraints from Schroth and HANS, Cobra FIA race seats, BSCI SFI rated roll bar padding and Lifeline fire suppression systems, to name a few of our brands,” said Billy Glavin. “To achieve maximum safety, a racer needs all these items installed in the car and functioning together. At HMS, we work hard to educate the racers on what all these different components do and why you need them all. By being able to offer a complete safety cell from fire wall to fire wall, we can ensure the customer gets products that will not only work in their particular car, but will function with all the other safety equipment in their car.”\nUnfortunately, amateur racers tend to shop for the lowest common-denominator personal protection equipment, believing that such equipment is adequate, when it rarely is. “Many are still convinced that single-layer suits, sometimes two-piece suits (rated SFI-32A-1) worn with fire-retardant underwear is sufficient protection against on-board fire—the ‘two-layer fairy tale,’” said Philippe de Lespinay of Stand 21 North America, Huntington Beach, California. “Accidental burn injuries sustained [while] wearing such garments are a liability to the very survival of racing at any and every level, as liability insurance rates may skyrocket, or not be available any longer, while lawsuits may fly. Requiring a minimal standard for racing suits for club racing, such as SFI-32A-5 or FIA rating, with mandatory wearing of SFI- or FIA-rated, full-length underwear, with matching socks and shoes; the mandatory wearing of the HANS device for any form of racing (except some vintage cars, where the wearing of such device is physically impossible), should be a goal for any racing organization, be it drag racing, oval track, club or vintage racing.”\n“I hope to see more sanctioning bodies and racers adapting all the safety standards and equipment that has been developed for the top levels of motorsports,” said Glavin. “I would like to see all race cars have complete 360 degrees of head-and-neck protection installed within five years. A forward neck restraint only protects the driver from a 0-degree frontal to 30-degrees offset either side. The remaining 300 degrees of protection must be achieved by the race seat, race nets, or a combination of both. Currently, most race cars have a gap in their neck protection from 30 degrees to 90 degrees, because they are relying on the seat with too small of a head rest to protect them. If you look at a NASCAR seat, their right side head rest extends 15 inches forward of the driver’s head. This is because in an accident (30 mph, 30 G) the driver will be 10 inches to 12 inches off the back of the seat, even with properly installed and tight belts. So if the head rest on your seat only extends four inches to six inches forward of the driver, then you will be well past that in an impact. That is why it is critical to have a race net installed, or have a seat with a longer head rest. Hopefully in the next five years race nets on both sides of the seat are mandatory in all race cars, as well as a proper head surround seat. This already started to happen in 2016 with the FIA mandating race nets installed on both sides of the seat for all GT3 style race cars, so the change is coming.\n“There is a great wealth of information and products out there that are not being used by a majority of sanctioning bodies and racers,” Glavin continued. “To install a lot of the latest safety products will require modifications to the race cars, but over a period of time this can be accomplished and improve safety dramatically.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:afaeac48-257b-4cc9-80f3-caf7979888bc>","<urn:uuid:11db473f-bed4-4c9b-99da-ed19c3ddc15e>"],"error":null}

One of the most influential responses to the problem of evil comes from st augustine as a young man, augustine followed the teachings of a christian sect known as the manichees at the heart of manichean theology was the idea of a cosmic battle between the forces of good and evil this, of course. And extreme conclusions-conclusions which augustine thought subversive to all sound doctrine it is possible that when augustine took up the cudgels in behalf of freedom against the manichaeans he did not foresee the logical end of the struggle for if the will is free to choose good or evil then it is possible for us to be.\nMoreover, the life of the auditors of whom augustine was one, was not free from the forces of evil 12 augustine the manichaean (373-382) having read cicero's hortensius (an invitation to philosophy), augustine was, as if, spell-bound by the ideal of wisdomlo he attempted to read the sacred scriptures that i might see.

Ralph blumenau argues that there is more to the doctrine of predestination than we might think to support his theory he looks back to the teaching of original sinner st augustine.\nAugustine also influenced john calvin, who supported augustine's view that evil is the result of free will and argued that sin corrupts humans, requiring god's grace to give moral guidance the theodicy was criticised by augustine's contemporary fortunatus, a manichaean who contended that god must still be somehow.

{"question":"What is more detrimental to children's learning: background TV noise or background music during study time?","answer":"Background TV noise is more detrimental to children's learning compared to background music. Research shows that background television negatively impacts learning by distracting children from playing, which is important for learning development. TV time at a young age leads to less classroom engagement and less-developed vocabulary and math skills. In contrast, music has been shown to enhance cognitive processes, concentration levels, and memory retention. Studies indicate that music, particularly classical music, can improve focus and thinking alertness, helping the brain's conscious and unconscious systems work together for better attention and information processing.","context":["Running out to buy school supplies? You might first want to hear the latest on how kids actually learn best. Recent findings in the field of learning science – a blend of cognitive science and educational psychology – are debunking popular assumptions about what works in the classroom, the study hall and even on the way to school.\nJust listening doesn’t pay off\nNew research suggests that the traditional approach – a teacher lecturing rows of attentive students – isn’t the most effective. Techniques that give kids responsibility, such as active learning and learning by teaching, are gaining scientific support.\n“We’ve moved from a passive view of learning to one that’s very active,” says Krista Muis, an educational psychology professor at McGill University. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that active learning, which engages students through discussion or activities, improves academic performance in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and adds half a letter to report-card grades. And in a study that is under review for publication, Muis found that learning by teaching helped students in Grades 5 and 6 develop more of the cognitive strategies essential for learning mathematics.\nNothing good comes easy\nCatering to a child’s learning style has been popular for decades, but the popular belief that people are auditory, visual or tactile learners simply isn’t supported by research.\nIn fact, making things too easy may hinder their progress. Research is finding that children are more engaged when they experience some frustration. Struggling to find a solution forces kids to grasp the structure of problems (rather than only working for the correct answer), which fosters a way of problem solving that’s more applicable to the real world.\nPut down the highlighter\nOur studying practices are out of sync with what actually works. A January, 2013, review of more than 700 studies found that two popular techniques aren’t worth the time: Rereading doesn’t improve comprehension, and highlighting may hurt a student’s ability to make inferences. Self-testing, however, is a helpful tool. “We totally say thumbs-up for flash cards,” says John Dunlosky, lead author of the review and director of the Science of Learning & Education Center at Kent State University in Ohio. The practice of spacing, or studying information several times spread out over a period of days, weeks and even months, is another extremely important technique for learning.\nOne thing at a time\nMultitasking may seem like a skill, but some research says it’s not a good idea for kids: If they are doing their homework on computers or tablets, they may be splitting their attention between studying, exploring the Internet and playing games, which may hinder their learning. Encouraging kids to write on paper – whether it’s cursive or multiplication tables – is valuable because it require focus and nurtures sophisticated thinking, says Linda Pagani, a professor of psychoeducation at the University of Montreal.\nShe recommends that parents motivate kids to exercise sustained attention well before they get back on the school bus. “It’s like training for a marathon.” For example, a week or two before school starts, encourage kids to commit to reading for an hour a day.\nAlways sleep on it\nSleep efficiency – or the time spent sleeping compared to the total time spent in bed – has been significantly associated with higher performance in math, English and French as a second language, says Reut Gruber, a psychiatry professor at McGill who presented her research this summer at the Canadian Paediatric Society annual conference.\nLack of sleep not only leads to difficulty paying attention or learning efficiently, it also cuts into a child’s ability to consolidate information. “A portion of this can only happen when we’re offline, when we sleep. So when this is interrupted, our ability to integrate information properly, to benefit from learning, is diminished,” Gruber says.\nIs music fine-tuning the mind?\nEver since a 1993 study found that listening to Mozart temporarily improved performance on a spatial reasoning test (often erroneously interpreted as a test of general intelligence), parents have tried to help their children by blasting classical music. But the idea that merely listening to music increases intellect is a “dead horse,” says Glenn Schellenberg, a psychology professor at University of Toronto who studies music and cognition.\nCurrent research shows a connection between intelligence and music lessons. “In general, kids who take music lessons are very good students, and they are better at school than you would predict from their IQ,” says Schellenberg. A recent study found that children and adults with music training had more brain activity related to executive functioning, which correlates with academic skill. Yet it’s still not clear how the relationship works: Does music make kids smarter, or do smart kids turn to music?\nWatching isn’t working\nLittle kids may learn something about life from TV shows – Arthur explores issues such as dyslexia and even cancer – but some research shows that television has an overall negative effect on academics. A study published last year found that more TV time at a very young age led to less engagement in the kindergarten classroom as well as less-developed vocabulary and math skills. “Sure, the frontal lobe is snapping” while watching television, says lead author Pagani. “But it’s nowhere near the kind of activity level you’d see – and oxygenation in the brain that you’d see – if the kid was doing a crossword puzzle or answering a difficult analytic question.”\nA recent study found that even background television can be bad for the brain because it distracts children from playing, which has been associated with learning. “Turn the TV off when no one is watching it,” says Deborah Linebarger, lead author of the study and a professor of education at the University of Iowa. “If you’re going to use it, select something high quality, let your child watch it and, when it’s over, turn it off.” The Canadian Paediatric Society recommends no more than two hours of entertainment screen time per day for school-aged children.","The evolution of man has seen the transition of times, customs and cultures saw that every community had some kind of music. The emotional stability of a person would most of the time be determined by the kind of music that they would listen to. Music has been claimed to have an undisputed link to a person’s memory. Much research has not been conducted to prove the intertwining of music, emotions and memory. However, there exists justification that will work towards proving such a theory. In trying to understand the connection better, focus ought to be on the effect of music on ones psyche. It is notable that music would be used for purposes of enhancing a person’s psyche. In addition, patients, especially those recovering from memory lapse, would be taken through music therapy and this would help greatly in helping them gain back their memory (Palisson, et.al, 2015). Some people are of the contention that music does not have any link to a person’s memory but this assertion is flawed since music poses many benefits to a person’s life and one of them is regarding to memory enhancement as this discussion will try to demonstrate.\nThere has however, been some contention that music does not necessarily boost or enhance a person’s memory. They argue that music does not necessarily have any effect when it comes to the memory of a person. This is because although music can enable a person become more alert or enhance their cognitive processes, it does not expressly, determine their memory levels. However, this contention is flawed since music has been demonstrated to have a significant influence on a person’s memory capabilities.\nMusic can be used to enhance a particular person’s memory and elevate their information retention. When an event happens and during the event familiar tunes of songs are played, one will always remember the event by the connection that the music comes with. For those who are parents or rather are close to children can attest to the fact that at times, you will hear adolescents say that a certain song is stuck in their thoughts. This confirms how music gets installed in ones memory. This would be used in restoring the memories of patients back up to the point that they can get back to their feet. Education-wise, it is therefore, important to use music for knowledge and information retention and general learning. The connection of music and memory is well coined in the dynamic attending theory (Ferreri, & Verga, 2016). This theory proceeds on the assertion that patterns of rhythm in music positively help in the ability of the brain to synchronize processes of attention through the auditory rhythm. From the theory, we find the suggestion that music needs to be used in the training of processes that require improvement of attention.\nAway from the effects of music on someone’s memory, music helps in the growth, development and the general improvement on the intelligent quotient. This has been proved on research since the early times of the 20th century. Winter (2016) noted that music could improve memory, the IQ and language skills of an individual. Language skills in this case include spatial memory, literacy, verbal memory and verbal intelligence. In understanding how music influences a person’s brain, it is recommended that the neurodevelopment of a person be looked into so as to investigate the impacts that the brain receives as pertains to certain activities for example music and music trains. Neuro-physiological technique is recommended so that a track can be kept of the responses from sub-cortical and cortical (winter, 2016). By use of the Neuro-physiological technique, adolescents’ brain is described as a brain that has not undergone full development, thereby making adolescents the best specimen to test the notion that music improves memory. Adam Tierney of Northwestern University conducted a research on adolescents and found that there was a phenomenon improvement in the development of their brain after undergoing a musical training. The development was described as phenomenon from the fact that a comparison was made of adolescents that did not take part in the research verses those that participated. It was found that those that did not take part in the research had a much lower development rate. In one study authored by Glenn Schellenberg, in the University of Toronto, he was able to find an IQ increment regarding to six year olds who had been put under some voice as well a piano classes. The experiment was such that Schellenberg made sure that he provided some nine months of both piano as well as voice coaching to 12 children whose ages fell in the bracket of six years (winter, 2016). As such, the children received 9-month training and there after their IQs were shown to have improved after some testing done unto them. The IQ regarding to children who were given some music coaching was demonstrated to be 3 points higher when compared to others who were in either voice or drama classes (winter, 2016). In fact, those in the drama lessons showed a lesser increase in their IQs but most importantly, they had increased social skills compared to those in the music lessons.\nAccording to Palisson, et.al (2015), medically, music has been found to have an effect on a patient’s brain. Dementia and Alzheimer patients have been used as a target in most of such studies. A common finding was that music would enhance their memories. The contention is that music is linked to the way a brain functions. Of essence, classical music has been shown to enhance the concentration levels that most age groups depict. Music that has strong beats as well resonates with brain waves. This is to imply that the faster a certain beat is, the sharper a person’s concentration is shown to be and their thinking as well shows increased alertness. The brain has not been designed in such a manner that it can be able to spend many prolonged hours pondering on one specific thing. As such, the brain comprises of two systems that is the conscious and unconscious parts. The conscious segment enables a person to lay focus on the things that they want to pay attention upon while the unconscious part is vital in shifting the attention of a person to anything that their senses are able to pick up, which can be categorized as significant (Palisson et.al, 2015). Thus, the unconscious segment thus is linked to a person’s emotional processing and not the higher reasoning. In essence, it also responds and operates fast. While the conscious part continues to lay focus on a task, the unconscious part does not at an point shut down but it stays alert and continues to control matters regarding to our senses.\nMusic has been shown to enhance the language development of a child. Children land into this world in readiness to decode sounds as well as words and thus music is one of the things that enhance a child’s capability in those areas(Ferreri, & Verga, 2016). Moreover, it is essential to note that the ability of such a child to be able to decode such sounds as well as words can thus be reinforced through music. The effect that music has on the language development is thus depicted in the brain. Musical training given to children is vital in brain’s development and especially the left side that is tasked with language processing.\nIn yet another study authored by Christopher Johnson, he was of the idea that music enhanced a person’s score in their tests. It was revealed that those students who took classes in Music were at a better chance of having better scores in English by 22% or a 20% improved scores in their maths tests as compared to those students who did not have such music programs in their curriculum (Ferreri, & Verga, 2016). Besides, Hohnson also took to demonstrate the merits accrued to music education when it comes to a child’s success. He emphasized that music is thus tied to improved memory recall. In addition, music training has been shown to contribute highly to a person’s concentration levels as well as capability to recall. In fact, music has been tied to many cognitive strengths including proficiency in verbal recall. In fact, those who have had proper or quality training in the arena of music stand a better chance of remembering of the verbal information that is stored in their memory.\nIn conclusion, as is depicted in this research, it is clear that the merits that music has when it comes to a person’s memory are undisputed. In fact, music enables a person be able to recall particular information at their disposal. In addition, a person who is able to recall information in return displays heightened IQ levels and as such is able to score highly even when it comes to tests. Moreover, if you have a better memory, you will also be at a better position to get healing in the case that one is suffering from either dementia or any ailments connected to memory.\n- Ferreri, L., & Verga, L.

Completed in 1999, the airport was the largest and most modern airport in the country until the modernization of Yangon International Airport in 2008. The airport connects 11 domestic and seven international destinations. Its 4267-meter runway is the longest runway in use in Southeast Asia and has the capacity to handle up to 3 million passengers a year. It is the main operating base of Golden Myanmar Airlines.\nMandalay International Airport\nမန္တလေး အပြည်ပြည်ဆိုင်ရာ လေဆိပ်\n|Owner||Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar|\n|Operator||Mitsubishi Corporation, JALUX Inc., SPA Project Management Ltd. (for 30 years bid)|\nMandalay Region, Myanmar\n|Elevation AMSL||91 m / 299 ft|\nThe Mandalay International Airport project was first conceived by the Burmese military government in the mid 1990s as a way to increase overall levels of foreign investment and tourism in Myanmar. With Yangon boasting the only other international airport for the whole country, the new Mandalay airport was regarded as crucial in achieving a planned 10% annual passenger growth. The hope was for Mandalay to become a hub for flights to other major Asian cities, in particular Beijing, Hanoi, Bangkok, Calcutta and Dhaka.\nConstruction of the airport began in 1996, and the airport was officially opened in September 2000 at a cost of US$150 million. The project was financed through a long-term loan from the Thai ExIm Bank.\nDue to the ongoing reforms in Myanmar, the airport experienced an increase in traffic, especially daily flights to Bangkok and to China. Since 2010, domestic passenger traffic through Mandalay has been increasing by 20% every year, while growth in international flights has been up to 60% annually.\nOn 16 November 2014, a consortium of Mitsubishi Group and an affiliate from Japan Airlines signed a concession agreement with the Myanmar government to operate the airport for 30 years. The joint firm undertook the operation, rehabilitation and maintenance of airport facilities, including terminal buildings and the airport's sole runway, excluding air traffic control, with operations having begun around March 2015. The agreement's main focus is to generate further expansion of domestic and international flights to Mandalay and to increase passenger traffic through the airport.\nAirlines and destinationsEdit\n- ^1 Some SilkAir flights to Mandalay stop in Yangon. Despite this, the airline does not have the right to transfer passengers solely from Yangon to Mandalay.\nOpened on 17 September 2000, the terminal building can handle 1,000 passenger arrivals and 1,000 passenger departures per hour. The capacity of the airport is estimated to be 3 million passengers per annum, with expansion capacity to more than 15 million. The site occupies a total area of 10,123 hectares and is located in central Myanmar about 35 kilometers south of Mandalay near the town of Tada-U. The journey from the airport to the city center of Mandalay takes approximately an hour by car.\nThe terminal is fitted with air conditioning, fire protection and emergency power generating systems. It is also equipped with six passenger lifts, one freight lift, three escalators and a baggage handling system. Three out of the six passenger boarding bridges can handle modern Boeing 747-400 aircraft. There is sufficient space for ten aircraft to anchor, and at a rate of 8 minutes per plane, aircraft of any size and make can touch down or take off to any destination abroad. MAGS (Mandalay Airport Ground Services) provides both passenger and cargo aircraft ground services.\nSystems incorporated into the airport include VHF and HF SSB transmitters and receivers, a voice communication control system, an automatic terminal information system (ATIS), and an aeronautical fixed telecommunications network. The air traffic control tower is equipped with a variety of radar and navigation systems.\nAs of 2018[update], these facilities exist at the airport:\n- 36 check-in desks\n- 8 gates\n- 6 air-bridges\n- 3 baggage claim belts\n- 11 short-term parking spaces\n- 6 long-term parking spaces\n- Post office and bank\n- Bureau de Change\n- Restaurants and VIP lounges\n- Duty-free facilities\n- Travel agency, tourist helpdesk and car rental\nMJAS Air Cargo TerminalEdit\nAll International airlines based in Mandalay are able to transport cargo / freight to any destination across the globe using connections at each of the airlines' way points. Cargo Warehouse handling is operated by MK Hercules Co., Ltd (MMH), a joint venture between MK Co., Ltd in Hiroshima, Japan and Hercules Logistics Co., Ltd, in Myanmar.\nMandalay International Airport is expanding rapidly and is expected to become an important cargo hub in Central and Upper Myanmar.\nTraffic by calendar yearEdit\n|Passengers||Change from previous year||Movements|\nAirport operations and maintenance are handled by a joint venture of Mitsubishi Corporation, JALUX Inc., and SPA Project Management Ltd., which won a bid in 2013 to upgrade and operate the airport for 30 years. The previous operator was Myanmar's Ministry of Transport. In August 2013, the vendor technical team started the inspection of the airport to develop an airport Master Plan that included airport services and cargo-handling areas as well as anticipating future needs such as extending the airport’s buildings.\nOn 12 May 2019, Myanmar National Airlines flight 103, carrying 82 passengers and 7 crew members, departed from Yangon International Airport and was approaching to Mandalay International Airport when the pilot was unable to extend the front landing gear. The aircraft landed as an emergency landing without the landing gear nose.

Often, you will need to cycle through a large number of potential identifiers to enumerate which ones are valid or worthy of further investigation. To do this in Burp Intruder, you need to perform the following steps:\nFind an application request that contains the identifier in a parameter, and where the response indicates whether the identifier is valid.\nUse a suitable payload type to generate potential identifiers to test, using the correct format or scheme.\nIdentify a feature of the response from which valid identifiers can be reliably inferred, and configure Burp accordingly. For example, if a valid identifier returns a different HTTP status code or response length, you can sort the attack results on this attribute. Or if a valid identifier returns a response containing a specific expression, you can define a match grep item to pick out responses that match this expression.\nSome examples of real-world attacks of this type are as follows:\nIf the application's login failure messages let you enumerate valid usernames, use the username generator payload type to cycle through a long list of possible usernames and identify valid ones.\nHaving identified a list of valid usernames, you can use the simple list payload type with a set of common passwords to attempt to guess user's passwords.\nIf an application function lets you view details of any order, by submitting a valid order ID, you can use the custom iterator payload type to generate potential order IDs in the correct format, and trawl for other users' orders.\nIf an application uses meaningful structured session tokens that are encrypted using a CBC cipher, you can use the bit flipper payload type to systematically modify a valid token to try to meaningfully tamper with its decrypted value.\nHarvesting useful data\nIn many situations, rather than simply identifying valid identifiers, you need to extract some interesting data about each item, to help you focus your efforts on the most critical items, or to feed in to other attacks. To do this in Burp Intruder, you need to perform the following steps:\nFind an application request that contains an identifier in a parameter, and where the response contains the interesting data about the requested item.\nSome examples of real-world attacks of this type are as follows:\nIf the application has a \"Forgotten password\" feature that takes a username as a parameter and displays a password hint that was set by that user, you can cycle through a simple list of common usernames, and extract the password hint for each valid user. You can then quickly scan the listing of retrieved hints to locate ones that are easily guessed.\nIf the application returns some content dynamically, via a single URL that contains a numeric page ID parameter, you can use the numbers payload type to cycle through all possible identifiers and retrieve the HTML title tag for each page. You can then quickly review the list of available pages to identify any that are particularly interesting or which you should not be allowed to access.\nIf application has a \"User profile\" page containing information about each user, including their role in the application, you can cycle through an already extracted list of usernames, and retrieve the role for each user, allowing you to quickly identify administrative accounts for further targeted attacks.\nFuzzing for vulnerabilities\nMany input-based vulnerabilities, such SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and file path traversal can be detected by submitting various test strings in request parameters, and analyzing the application's responses for error messages and other anomalies. Given the size and complexity of today's applications, performing this testing manually is a time consuming and tedious process.\nYou can automate web application fuzzing with Burp Intruder, using the following steps:\nConfigure payload positions at the values of all request parameters.\nConfigure the payload list using one of Burp's predefined payload lists containing common fuzz strings, or your own list of attack strings.\nConfigure match grep items with various common error message strings. The default options in the match grep UI include a list of useful strings for this purpose.\nAfter launching the attack, review the attack results to identify interesting errors and other anomalies. You should sort the results table on each of the match grep columns, and also on other relevant columns such as response length, HTTP status code, response timers, etc.\nNote: When fuzzing, you will typically want to test a large number of requests using the same Intruder payloads and match grep configuration. To facilitate this, you can use the Intruder menu to configure the \"New tab behavior\" option to \"Copy configuration from last tab\". Then, when you have configured your payloads and grep strings for one request, subsequent requests that you send to Intruder will pick up the same configuration options within their tab. To fuzz multiple requests, you then simply need to send each one to Intruder, and choose \"Start attack\" from the Intruder menu.\nConfiguring an attack\nThe main Intruder UI lets you configure multiple attacks simultaneously, each in its own tab. When you send requests to Intruder, each one is opened in its own numbered tab. Each attack configuration tab contains several sub-tabs that are used to configure the attack. Use the links below for help on the details of each tab:\nTarget - This is used to configure the details of the target server for the attack.\nPositions - This is used to configure the request template for the attack, together with payload positions, and the attack type (this determines the way in which payloads are assigned to payload positions).\nPayloads - This is used to configure one or more sets of payloads, which will be placed into payload positions during the attack.\nOptions - This is used to configure numerous other options affecting the attack.\nThe easiest way to create a new Intruder attack is to select the relevant base request within another Burp tool (such as the Proxy history or Target site map), and use the \"Send to Intruder\" option on the context menu. This will create a new attack tab, and automatically populate the Target and Positions tabs with the relevant details about the base request. You can then modify the automatic payload positions if required, and configure suitable payloads and other attack options.\nBurp Intruder has a number of functions to help you manage attack configurations. These functions are available via the Intruder menu:\nYou can save the attack configuration for the current tab, and reload it later. When loading or saving, you can optionally include or exclude the payload positions settings. Including the payload positions settings lets you save the full configuration for a specific attack. Excluding the payload positions settings lets you save a generic attack configuration that can be reused for another base request template and payload positions - for example, your preferred configuration for fuzzing a particular type of request.\nYou can copy attack configurations between two existing tabs, or into a new tab. Again, you can optionally include or exclude the payload positions settings.\nYou can control how Intruder handles attack configurations when you open a new attack tab (by clicking on the right-most \"...\" tab, or sending a new request to Intruder). You can optionally use the default attack configuration, copy the configuration from the first open tab, or copy the configuration from the last open tab. Using the latter options lets you create a generic attack configuration (e.g. for fuzzing), and automatically apply this to each new request that you send to Intruder.\nThe attack tabs themselves are easy to manage. You can:\nRename tabs by double-clicking the tab header.\nReorder tabs by dragging them.\nOpen a new tab by clicking on the right-most \"...\" tab.\nClose tabs by clicking the X button in the tab header.\nLaunching an attack\nWhen your attack is fully configured, you can launch the attack by selecting \"Start attack\" from the Intruder menu.\nEach attack runs in a new window, containing detailed results, with full requests and responses (if configured). There are various functions to help you analyze the results, and identify interesting items for further investigation. You can:\nSort the results columns to order the items according to different attributes (HTTP status code, response length, etc.).\nUnhide additional results columns that are hidden by default.\nDefine new match grep and extract grep items when the attack is already underway, to perform further analysis based on the observed results."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e354d99e-75d8-429c-ad82-62ca49770d6e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain the relationship between traditional and experimental approaches in both sociophonic phenomena and Puerto Rican Bomba music?","answer":"In sociophonic phenomena, the focus is on how urban people interpret and interact with daily sounds in social contexts, studying traditional elements like bells and shouts as identity markers. Similarly in Bomba music, while traditional culture and players tend to be conservative, modern artists like Fernando Garcia are expanding on traditional elements by incorporating new features like odd meters and modal harmonies while still maintaining some traditional aspects. Both fields involve examining cultural sounds while balancing preservation with innovation.","context":["Hello again, today’s post is an interview with Miguel Alonso Cambrón, read on:\n1. Hello Miguel, maybe you could start by introducing yourself?\nHello Jaume. Well, it is a bit weird to talk about myself in English and with a person who already knows me, but here we go. I am Miguel Alonso Cambrón and my educational background is connected mainly to two fields: music and social science. As far as I remember, I have been always interested in music. At the age of three my parents asked me if I wanted to study in the conservatory and I replied that all I wanted to do is to play the drums (as every kid at that age, I suppose). So I had to learn music by myself. Later on I studied social anthropology and became more and more interested in human interpretations of sonic phenomena as part of the cultural habitus and identity. After obtaining my first university degree I did some research on anthropology of the body. Then I took some courses in experimental music and also in ethnomusicology and finally decided that those were my fields of interest.\n2. Could you tell us more about your formal education and how it is related to sound?\nWell, as I said, in music I am mainly self-educated. I started playing the guitar in some local punk bands in A Coruña and slowly felt attracted to experimental and electronic stuff. From there I went on to use human ambiance sounds, field recording and sociophonic phenomena.\nOn the other hand, I started studying English Philology at UDC and had a subject on phonetics and phonology. That was my first academic contact with a sound discipline. Then I studied social and cultural anthropology at UAB in Barcelona which was completed with a Master in Urban Anthropology and a PhD in Social Anthropology at Tarragona’s URV.\nThe relation to sound embedded in my scientific work focuses on the interpretation of urban sound ambiances, on how urban people read and interact with daily sounds, but not any sound. I always talk about “sociophonic phenomena”, which are sounds related to social interaction; the sonic spectrum of social interaction. In a strict sense every sound is a part of social interaction. Plato wrote about it in his work “De Anima,” where he said that every sound emerges from something against something and into something. But my point is related to human beings and the significance of sound in urban daily life, both in public and private/domestic spaces.\n3. I recall you have used that approach to study Tarragona, the city where you live. Can you tell us more about it?\nYes, I took an ethnographic approach to sound in the historic district of Tarragona. I did fieldwork for approximately three years. Everything started when I was living in Barcelona and read Bernie Krause’s niche hypothesis. Krause, who is a musician into bioacoustics, studied North American rainforest ambiances in relation to biological activities and came to the conclusion that each species occupied a particular range of frequencies to ensure communication among individuals of the same kind. I did the first attempt at applying these reflections to human ecosystems (it was published in a paper by the Institut Català d’Antropologia and led to establishing a research group in that institution), but as human-social activities are far more complicated than the ones in the rest of the animal kingdoms (or we like to think of it that way, in the end I never spoke about it with any other animal) the projection led to other reflections and new terminology. Krause spoke about “biophony,” as much soundscape composers and analysts do, but this term seemed too vague for me. It focused on life as biological interaction and my interest was social interaction. And then came the notion of “sociophony” which I think is more inclusive, can be applied to all living beings and focuses on social interaction, perception and cognition.\nMy doctoral research ended with pointing out six phenomena which are important and idiosyncratic for the populations in Tarragona’s historic district. These were (and currently are): “terrazas” (tables, chairs and people outside bars and restaurants), “obras” (building and public works), silence (related to silent places but also to silent times), bells, shouts and transit. Each sociophonic phenomenom is related to a wider social one. “Terrazas” and “obras” for example, are related to the process of gentrification that has been taking place in the district since late 80s: the proliferation of building works including restoration and urbanistic adaptation to the needs of a new kind of neighbour that have emerged since the 80s; an upper-class stratum that is progressively cornering an increasingly impoverished traditional population. Silence is related to presence and the possessions of the catholic church, the Cathedral and its surroundings, as the presence of bells as a soundmark, but also to the rhythms of urban life and economic activity. Shouts are called “hyperdecibelic practices” and are an identitary trait of traditional populations in the district, among which there is high presence of gypsies (settled in Tarragona since XIII century) but very few immigrants (fact that can be explained in relation to the structure of the city and the concentration of immigrants in ex-profeso districts). Well, as you can see, the study of sound interpretations is just the tip of the iceberg. Sound phenomena are always related to social processes. Another interesting terminology for your readers may also be the distinction between what I call “shared significance habitats” and “shared signifier habitats.” The latter is related to all individuals (with a hearing apparatus, being human or animal) that are exposed to a sound phenomenom, and the former, to all individuals that interpret a sound in a similar way. In a way this is the basis of the research.\n4. Finally, maybe you could give us some references, as to texts, authors, movies, websites, etc. where people could find more information about what you are telling us.\nThere is a lot of them! The first that must be seen is Wim Wenders’ “Lisbon Story,” which is about a sound technician waiting for his movie director, that records sounds and interact with people while waiting. There is a branch of anthropology that can be very useful for people interested in or working with sound, that is the anthropology of the senses. On this website you can find a lot of info.\nRegarding sound mapping there is plenty of interesting projects such as Sons de Barcelona, Escoitar, London Soundscape and many more. The only problem I see with those documentary projects is that they do not share specific methodology, which would be very useful for researchers.\nThere are some interesting authors and labels working with field-recordings as Edu Comelles, Orquesta del Caos, Francisco López, LlorenÁ Barber, Francesc Llop i Bayo, Juan Gil…\nAnd, of course, I cannot end this interview without making some advertising of myself. Most of my music works can be listened here (always work in progress). And my doctoral thesis can be read (in Spanish) here\n5. Thank you very much!\nP.S At the upper right corner of this page you will find the “sound of the week”, which is from Freesound’s user Antigonia, they describe it as follows:\n“Concentration for the closure of the Inmigrant Detention Centers in Barcelona, during the International Migrants Day”\n…and is part of the Migration Process pack.\nFeliz navidad y próspero año nuevo.","In 2018 the drummer, percussionist, composer, educator Fernando Garcia’s Guasabara Puerto Rico (Zoho) showcased his modern vision and flair for combining Puerto Rican folklore with jazz music and other elements.\nLast April, amid the pandemic, Garcia composed a tune whose tumbao, cadence and lyrics magically lifted his spirits. “The primary rhythm is Bomba Holandes, which shares rhythmic similarities with Plena. I wrote the bass line first and let it flow without realizing it was in 13 (meters). The vibe was so joyful and uplifting; the only name I could come up with is Alegria (Joy).”\nAs the lyrics clearly and joyously state:\nAlegria Te Traigo Pa’ Que Te Olvidas Las Pena\nI Bring You Joy, Forget Your Sorrows.\nBomba Con Cadencia Por Que La Cosa Esta Buena!\nBomba with Swing, the Rhythm is Good!\nBomba con Swing\nBomba with Swing\nBomba en Trese, Que Locura!\nBomba in 13, What Madness!\nGarcia became interested in Bomba when he was a student at the Inter-American University in Cupey (PR) and researched the genre. His friend, the percussionist Oscar Carrasco, suggested he study with Bomba musicians in Loiza, a region known for upholding Afro-Puerto Rican culture. “Also, I hung out with the Bombero, percussionist, dancer, Rafael Maya (leader of the group, Desde Cero), who taught me a lot about Bomba. I started to realize the richness of the rhythms, variations, and songs. So, all that led me to a way of fusing our own Puerto Rican and African roots with contemporary jazz.”\nThe video showcases the band’s prowess and Garcia’s vision. It also gives listeners and viewers an indication of how Puerto Rican music is evolving. “In terms of the music, Bomba culture and players tend to be conservative,” says Garcia. “I’m taking Bomba’s elements and expanding on them with, among other things, odd meters and modal harmonies. Occasionally, I will take a folkloric tune and mess with the chords a little, but mostly, it’s traditional.”\nThe band members include bassist, Dan Martínez, percussionist Victor Pablo, Guitarist Gabriel Vicéns, Pianist Gabriel Chakarji, Saxophonist Jan Kus, and the Vocalist, Claudia Tebar. Alegria is available on all digital platforms.\nI’m happy to report, after a long COVID-related hiatus, Fernando and his Band will perform Friday, August 28, 2020, at 8 PM at Terraza 7’s Outdoor Concert Series.

{"question":"How many CF-104 Starfighter pilots lost their lives? So sad to know :(","answer":"37 pilots lost their lives while flying the CF-104 Starfighter. Only four of these fatal crashes were due to aircraft system failures. Most crashes were caused by bird strikes, engine failures, or controlled flight into terrain accidents due to flying at high speeds at extreme low levels combined with poor visibility in European skies.","context":["Return of an iconic RCAF fighter to Alberta\nby Gary Watson\nOn October 2, 1962, Canadair Model CL-90 made its first flight from the Cartierville airport, near Montreal. Four test flights later, on July 22, 1963, the aircraft was Taken On Strength (TOS) by the RCAF as CF-104 12846.\nThis was the 146th of 200 single-seat fighter aircraft built for the RCAF. The CF-104 was to be Canada’s contribution to supporting NATO operations in Europe to counteract the growing Soviet Union buildup of aircraft on the east side of the Iron Curtain.\nSoon afterwards, this aircraft was assigned to 1 Air Division and shipped to France in an RCAF C-130 Hercules. For the next eight years, 12846 flew in photo reconnaissance roles from bases in France, first at #2 Wing Grostenquin for six months, then to #1 Fighter Wing, Marville (where the author first worked on it) and flown by both 439 and 441 Squadrons. In 1967, along with the rest of #1 Wing, it changed homes to Lahr, West Germany. Other CF-104s, located in West Germany were tasked to a Nuclear Strike role at that time but 846 remained in the Recce role. In later years, this was changed to conventional support as Canada changed its commitment within NATO and reduced the number of European bases and aircraft.\nThe aircraft was sold to the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF), on September 24, 1971 after accumulating 1,732 flying hours. After conversion and modifications at Scottish Aviation, Prestwick, to a F-104G variant, it flew for the RDAF 726 Esk at Aalborg as R-846 until July 10, 1984, when it was Struck Off Strength (SOS) after having flown 1,821 additional hours and retired with a total of 3,553 hours. Initially stored for four years, at Vaerlose Air Base, in 1988, it was on display for ten years in the RDAF museum in Billund, Denmark.\nIn 1998 it was stored at Vandel AB and Karup ABs until it was bought by US aircraft collector, Steve Alex. On December 19, 2010, R-846 arrived back at its at old home base at Aalborg where it was shipped out in containers on July 14, 2011 to Alex’s facility in Maine. The aircraft was purchased in June 2013 and trucked to Calgary where it was restored at Springbank airport. After 51 years, 846 returned home to Canada and now resides in a unique new exhibit developed for the Air Force Museum of Alberta, at The Military Museums in Calgary.\nThere is a significant historical connection between Albertans and the Starfighter. In 1960, RCAF Station, Cold Lake, Alberta, was chosen as the training base for the CF-104s and for 23 years the unique look and sound of the aircraft became familiar to many Albertans. Former pilots and technicians have made their home in Calgary and some have developed a significant emotional bond to this unique aircraft that they have either flown or worked on during their career in the RCAF.\nThe Cold War\nThe Cold War is an era that has slipped from the consciousness of many Canadians. The Iron Curtain fell in 1991 as the Soviet Union disintegrated and Eastern Bloc and Warsaw Pact countries were released from Soviet control. It seems that the world quickly forgot about how close they came to Armageddon with both sides having massive overkill of nuclear weapons and millions of soldiers facing each other across the Iron Curtain.\nAfter 45 years of a heightened state of near-war, European countries were no longer in an arms race with each other, tensions thawed and stability replaced large military forces facing off. During the height of the Cold War, the RCAF was a major player in maintaining the peace during a crucial time of nuclear détente flying both photo-reconnaissance and nuclear strike missions. Canada’s role ended in 1994 as the last aircraft and personnel returned to Canada.\nStarfighter history in the RCAF\nA total of 200 single-seat aircraft (12701-12900) were built by Canadair (Bombardier) in Montreal. Another 38 dual-seat aircraft (12638-12668) were built by Lockheed Aircraft in Palmdale, California. There were 113 Canadian aircraft lost during the 24 year era of the Starfighter. 37 pilots lost their lives while flying the CF-104, only four fatal crashes were due to aircraft system failures.\nThe principal cause of crashes was due to bird strikes or other factors resulting in engine failure. Other crashes were from the nature of Canada’s NATO role which necessitated flying at high speeds at extreme low levels. Combined with the poor visibility of European skies this resulted in many aircraft being involved in controlled flight into terrain accidents.\nThe F-104 Starfighter was designed conceived and built by the legendary aircraft designer Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson, chief engineer at the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation’s \"Skunk Works\" in Burbank, California. It is a high performance single-engine jet interceptor that was designed to counter the threat of Soviet nuclear-equipped Bombers. Korean War pilots had asked for a new fighter to replace the F-86 Sabres, Lockheed proposed the F-104 as a small high-speed fighter interceptor.\nThe Starfighter was the first fighter capable of sustained flight at speeds in excess of Mach 2. It simultaneously held both altitude and world speed records. In Canada, the Starfighter holds the Canadian altitude record. In 1967, as a centennial project, Wing Commander R.A. White flew aircraft 12700 (actually a lighter F-104C) to a Canadian record height of 100,110 feet on December 14, 1967.\nThe aircraft has several unique design features such as a small-thin wing with sharp leading edges that were canted down 10 degrees to improve stability. The General Electric J-79 turbojet engine had the highest thrust to weight ratio of any contemporary engine and its small cross-section provided the ideal engine for the aircraft.\nThe avionics included the latest in inertial navigation and radar. First flown in 1954, only one year after receiving a contract from the USAF, the aircraft had limited acceptance by the US military as they had moved away from the fear of manned bombers to that of intercontinental ballistic missile threats and decided the F-104 was not the aircraft they wanted for their air superiority role. As a result, the US Forces reduced their initial order from 722 and only 155 saw US service.\nHowever in 1959, Canada had cancelled the CF-105 Arrow program and was looking for a replacement for their aging F-86 Sabres and the Starfighter was determined to be the best choice. The CF-104 was an upgraded version of the earlier F-104A with a higher thrust J-79 manufactured under license by Orenda Aircraft Canada. An order for 200 CF-104s (at a price of $1.90 million each) was placed with Canadair Aircraft, Montreal, Quebec who would build them under license from Lockheed. An additional 38 two-seater CF-104Ds were ordered directly from Lockheed in California.\nFollowing Canada’s lead, many NATO countries purchased the F-104G which was a heavier model that had won the NATO competition for a fighter–bomber and the aircraft eventually served with the air forces of fifteen nations. Canada retired the CF-104s from service in 1987. A total of 2,578 Starfighters were built and the last operational users were the Italian Air Force who retired them in 2004 – 50 years since their first flight, truly a remarkable career for the fighter.\nThe Starfighter on display at the Air Force Museum of Alberta was restored to its original look and configuration as flown at Cold Lake and Europe in the 1960s. The shiny aluminum fuselage with white wings is an iconic paint scheme for the Mach 2.0 (2,336 kph) fighter – the fastest aircraft Canada has ever flown.\nCF-104 - Starfighter\n- Crew: 1-2\n- Length: 55ft (16.7 m)\n- Wingspan: 22ft (6.7m)\n- Height: 13ft (4.2m)\n- Empty Weight: 6,300 Kg\n- Operational Takeoff Weight: 12,100 Kg\n- Fuel Load: 5,140 Litres\n- Powerplant: Orenda GE J79-OEL7\n- Thrust: 10,000 lbs, with Afterburner - 15,800 lbs\nThis was the most advanced fighter jet engine of its day.
