{"question":"What materials are needed to build a DIY studio light panel from a bathroom vanity fixture?","answer":"The materials needed are: a vanity wall light (specifically Thomas Lighting's 3-Light Chrome Vanity Wall light), combination clamp, 1/4-20 T-Nut, LED bulbs, wire nuts, 1/8\\\" plywood, and optionally paint/stain/dye. You'll also need tools including a hand saw or chop saw, wire strippers, screwdrivers, drill bits, table saw, and brad nailer.","context":["Intro: DIY Studio Light Panel\nThis self-contained \"studio light\" is a simple portable light made from an $11.00 bathroom vanity fixture. These can be assembled with a few dollars of hardware if you're able to use scrap or pallet wood for this project. See the video for a breakdown on costs and a side-by-side comparison between this light and cheap a CFL \"Studio Lighting\". I've also included some additional build videos in a few of the steps.\n- Vanity Wall Light*\n- Combination Clamp\n- 1/4-20 T-Nut\n- LED Bulbs\n- Wire Nuts\n- 1/8\" Plywood\n- Paint, Stain or Dye (optional)\n*The light I used in my project was purchased at Home Depot and called Thomas Lighting's 3-Light Chrome Vanity Wall light.\n- Hand saw or chop saw\n- Wire strippers\n- Screw drivers\n- Drill bits\n- Table saw\n- Brad nailer\nA simple wood frame is made from some strips of wood, and a piece of plywood is use for a backer plate. The fixture is wired up inside the enclosure using wire nuts, and circular clips on the vanity fixture hold the backer plate into place. Check out the video for a brief overview of the build as well as a cost breakdown of the materials.\nStep 1: Cut Your Wood\nRip Cuts (Optional)\nFor this project, I used 1\" poplar boards (3/4\" actual). For the vanity light I selected, a thickness of 1 3/8\" was a good size to keep the profile thin yet still all the wires in. If you do not have a table saw, 1\" x 2\" boards will work fine, your end result will be a little thicker.\nCut to Length\nI avoid performing calculations and taking measurements when possible. For this project, I used the fixture itself to mark off my cuts. First I marked off the end pieces by using a straight edge and the short end of the fixture. Then I fit those in and use them to mark where the cuts needed to go on the long pieces.\nStep 2: Assemble the Frame\nThis project calls for utility grade construction, so I glued the frame together and then used a few 18 gague nails to hold everything in place.\nI created an assembly jig the top of the table by clamping two pieces of wood at a 90 degree angle.\nStep 3: Time to Dye\nI filled the nail holes with some wood putty, and then used some Fiebing's black leather dye. Applying the dye took practically no time to apply, dried quickly and produced a very even finish. I really like the way this finish turned out and so far (6 months in) it is holding up well.\nStep 4: Cut Your Back Panel\nI again used the same layout approach to get my dimensions. First I ripped down a strip of plywood to the appropriate width on the table saw, then I cut it to length with a hand saw.\nBefore cutting on the table saw or miter saw, I apply a layer or two of masking tape. This helps prevent tear out and produces a cleaner cut.\nStep 5: Install Stops for the Front Panel\nWith the fixture retaining clips removed set your frame face down on a flat table. Now put the fixture face down inside the frame. We will now install the stops.\nI created the stops from L brackets that I cut apart with an angle grinder, however another material would work here too. The purpose of the stop is to prevent the front panel from falling inside the enclosure,\nOnce the first stop was in, I re-installed the retaining clips and screwed in the other stops.\nStep 6: Build the Back Panel\nNow it's time to build the back panel. You will need to cut some small chunks of plywood. I used 15/32\" plywood from my scrap pile. The chunks are cut to the width of the back panel. A large piece is installed in the middle, and then two end pieces are added to each end.\nThe exact width of the pieces is not critical, but for the end pieces somewhere between 1/2\" and 1\" is probably good. Smaller is better since you will need to route wires in an upcoming step. The pieces will ultimately be nailed into the rails so it should be thick enough to give the nails something to attach to.\nWidth again is not critical here. We will be needing to drill a 3/4 hole for the combination clamp that holds the cord into place, so it needs to be wide enough for that. My center piece is around 2\" in width.\nMy plywood was too thick and interfered with the front panel. This was solved by chiseling a small groove on each side where a stop came into contact with a rail. Taking off one layer of plywood was sufficient for me.\nGlue it Up\nUse some wood glue to glue the stops into place, clamp it up and let it dry.\nStep 7: Install Combination Clamp\nNow that the back panel is completed, you can do your first test fit. Install the front panel and attach the mounting clips if desired.\nOnce you're satisfied that everything is lined up, flip the assembly over and mark the hole for the power cord and wire clamp.\nCombination Clamp Hole\nFrom the back side, I drilled a pilot hole with a thin drill bit. Once that hole was drilled, I added a piece of tape and finished drilling the hole from the exposed side of the back panel. This was done to prevent any tear out.\nThe size combination clamp you'll use is going to depend on the size cord you've selected. I used 3/8\" combination clamps because that what I had on hand. If you used a smaller gauge cord like a cheap extension cord, you may consider using a grommet-style clamp instead.\nNow install your clamp. The initial hole I drilled was a little too small, so I filed it out with file. Once the threads on the clamp could bite into the would, I simply threaded it in. It holds into the wood on it's own so installing the nut was not needed in this case.\nStep 9: Install T-Nut\n1/4-20 T-Nut Hole\nI marked a hole in the center of the back panel and drilled from the exposed side with a 1/4\" drill bit.\nTap 'er In!\nI used a bit of wood glue around the outside of the hole and then tapped it in with a hammer. If you get any glue on the treas of the t-nut then you'll want to wipe them off with a rag.\nStep 10: Complete Wiring\nWe're ready to complete the wiring of the project. This fixture comes with wire nuts, however I found them to be of low quality so I used my preferred wire nut.\n- Trim your power cord to length, leaving 6\"-8\" of length LONGER than you want coming out from the back of the light.\n- Feed your cord through the combination clamp and hole of the vanity light's backing plate.\n- When you have your cord where you want it, strip the jacket from the cord and tighten the clamps\nWire it Up!\nThis part is easy, you simply connect the white wire with the cord to the white wire on the lamp. Connect the black wire with the black wire and the green wire with the green wire. For each wire, strip off about 1/2\" of insulation. Pre-twist the two wires together clock-wise, then screw on the wire nut.\nInstall Back Panel\nNow carefully stuff everything back into the enclosure taking care not to pinch any wires in the process. We're going to test to see if everything works. Screw in a bulb and plug it in, if everything is wired up correctly you should have light. If not, unplug the light and check to your connections.\nStep 11: Complete & Enjoy\nNow that you've got the lamp wired up, you can set the back panel into place with some nails. Don't worry! If you ever need to get into the light again, you can remove the retaining clips on the front panel and remove the front panel from there.\nTack in a couple of nails where the back stops are located. You should only need one or two nails for each stop on the sides and ends of the frame.\nCongratulations! Your lights are ready to use."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0c15064a-7a90-403e-969c-9c9e702ecb3e>"],"error":null}

In addition to being fully ARINC 653-compliant, this solution is integrated with Wind River’s Information Assurance Framework (IAF) to support secure booting for applications requiring enhanced levels of security.\nThe Wind River VxWorks 653 platform enables avionics vendors and hosted-function suppliers to independently develop and deploy multiple applications on a single multi-core hardware platform, supporting rigorous avionics safety standards. These supported standards include RTCA DO-178C for certifying compliance with the applicable airworthiness regulations for the software aspects of airborne systems and equipment, and ARINC 653 for space and time partitioning in safety-critical avionics real-time operating systems (RTOS).\nThe VxWorks 653 multi-core scheduler enables multiple guest operating systems on a shared compute platform, allowing applications to run in parallel in order to increase compute capacity. In addition, this platform provides fault containment, high portability for lower upgrade costs, reduced development costs with a development suite based on Eclipse, and reduced RTCA DO-178C platform certification time supported by commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) certification evidence.\nThe enhanced security of this solution is derived from the integration of Wind River’s IAF. The IAF utilizes the PowerPC/NXP Trust Architecture, known as the QorIQ Platform Trust Architecture, to enable secure boot, including a built-in security engine that can hide a One Time Programmable Master Key (OTPMK) in a write-only register. This security engine is ideal for performing cryptographic offload of hashing, encryption, and decryption.\nThe foundation of the safety and security capabilities of this platform is the VxWorks 653 BSP. This BSP is fully integrated into the trusted boot sequence and is controlled by the IAF, and supports the following capabilities:\nThe XPedite6101 supports multiple NXP QorIQ processor configurations, a number of I/O ports including Gigabit Ethernet, serial, USB, and SATA, and up to 8 GB of DDR3-1600 ECC SDRAM. When configured to use the T2081 processor, the XPedite6101 maximizes performance with eight virtual (four dual-threaded) Power Architecture e6500 cores running at up to 1.8 GHz.\nThe Wind River VxWorks 653 software platform was specifically developed to comply with rigorous avionics safety standards. The XPedite6101 offers a suitable hardware platform for VxWorks 653 by providing a size, weight, and power (SWaP) optimized computing solution that is ideal for the needs of the military and aerospace industry, including development of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and other unmanned vehicles.\nThe XPedite6101 implements secure boot through NXP’s Trust Architecture systems to enable more secure and reliable applications. The joint solution’s secure boot technologies prevent the CPU from running untrusted code, detect and reject security violations, and prevent the extraction of sensitive data from an application.\n“NXP is pleased that X-ES’ XPedite6101 is using our T2081 processor in a solution with the reliability needed by avionics customers,” said Toby Foster, Senior Product Marketing Manager, NXP Digital Networking. “NXP’s T-series processors are characterized by high performance and low power, making them a great choice for demanding but highly constrained avionics applications,” Foster commented further. “Besides the inherent trusted security features built into NXP processors, X-ES leverages the T2081’s high level of I/O integration for impressive performance density.”\nWind River’s secure boot technology creates an extra layer of security for QorIQ processors by performing a hardware check on software in the boot sequence. All code included in the VxWorks 653platform BSP is digitally signed and includes a tightly controlled RSA public and private key pair. Before allowing an application to boot, secure boot checks the application’s software against the private signature key. In the event that an unsigned kernel is discovered, the secure boot technology prevents the compromised system from booting, thereby preventing data extraction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:685b6e2b-c4f2-4d26-aa5f-387d96d11045>","<urn:uuid:fdfb78d5-5215-405b-978a-0f2f0590e672>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Are B cells and thymic nurse cells similarly distributed throughout their respective tissues?","answer":"No, they have different distribution patterns. B cells are continuously produced in the bone marrow throughout life (until old age) with their numbers dependent on the organism's mass and regulated by BLyS cytokine. In contrast, thymic nurse cells are specifically located in the thymic cortex, with approximately 10% of 5t-expressing cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) in the adult mouse thymus forming TNC complexes. Whether TNCs are found in all parts of the thymus including the medulla has been debated.","context":["This is a great question, Jamie. And Chris gave an excellent answer above, describing how antibodies go through 'germinal center reactions' that improve the affinity of responding cells. However, Jamie actually brings up several concepts that are worth discussing and there is another important element to the immune response that Chris touches on, but could be elaborated.\n- Where do naive B Cells come from? When are they produced?\n- How many unique B Cells do we have?\n- What happens to cells during an immune reaction?\n- How do naive and memory B Cells (among other post-exposure cellular subsets) compare?\n(1) B Cells arise from progenitor cells living in the bone marrow. They are produced continuously throughout the life of the organism - or at least until 'old age' when hematopoiesis is qualitatively and quantitatively compromised(Gerstein and Cancro, among others address this problem).\n(2) How many? That's a good question. The number of cells seems to be dependent upon the mass of the organism (indirectly through a cytokine called BLyS). There are a lot of subtleties governing the number and 'quality' of our cells that BLyS concentration seems to regulate, but, for the most part, we can assume that each B Cell (like each T Cell) reacts to a different target (epitope). The reason I bring up the BLyS thing is that it shows us that 'space' is limited, and the body is making decisions all the time about what cells to keep and what cells to discard.\n(3) During an immune reaction, some small subset of cells 'sees' its target via it's B Cell Receptor (this is a surface-bound version of the antibodies that this cell will make later). Most cells will remain blind to the infection / whatever. The ones that do see their target expand (multiply), while those that don't, don't. This is Burnett's Clonal Expansion Theory (probably best explained by Wikipedia) and it states that we have only a small number of cells that are useful for each immune reaction, but these can divide and activate rapidly to participate in the response. When the infection is over, most cells die, but some subsets will remain, these are memory cells and their relatives (e.g. long-lived plasma cells). Imagine that for every unique B Cell you had before, now you have 100 memory cells (I'm making up that number) that are capable of responding to the same target.\nAlthough I'm sure there are differences between these memory cells and naive cells, it's easiest to ignore that part and just think that now you will be starting with 100x the number of cells you had prior to the primary response.\nSo, to get to your basic question: why not just start with the memory cells? It's a question of space. Your immune system provides you with a broad repertoire because it has no idea what it's going to see during your life. But once it sees something once, it is ready for a second showing. (i.e. It is reasonable to think that if you have micro-organism X in your neck of the woods, you may come into contact with it more than once, so after that first time, you are now better prepared with more cells that already demonstrated that they were helpful once before. )","Distinctive subsets of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) support T-cell development and selection. through supplementary TCR rearrangement. when the parasite induce encircling muscles cells to offer a long-lasting specific niche market that would source nutrition and protect the parasite from the owners resistant program (5). In addition, a small percentage of stromal cells in the bone fragments marrow are occasionally known as erythroblast health care worker cells because they absorb erythroblast nuclei and support their difference into crimson bloodstream cells (6). Hence, health care worker cells possess been discovered in several natural systems as cells that play an important function in growing the success and difference of border cells or microorganisms. The thymic health care worker cell (TNC), which was reported even more than 30 y ago initial, is certainly a huge epithelial cell that totally envelops many practical lymphoid cells NVP-BKM120 Hydrochloride IC50 within its intracellular vesicles and is certainly singled out by protease digestive function of mouse and rat thymus tissue (7C10). TNC processes are discovered not really just in animal but in many vertebrate types also, SPRY1 including individual, parrot, and seafood (9, 11C13). It was hypothesized that TNCs offer a microenvironment that is certainly required for lymphocyte growth and difference and that the intra-TNC difference is certainly an important stage in intrathymic T-cell advancement (7, 8, 14, 15). It was additional hypothesized that the TNC complicated is certainly a site for the positive and harmful selection of Testosterone levels cells (16C18). Nevertheless, how TNCs are included in T-cell advancement, and selection provides not really been set up (19). Whether TNCs are abundant in the thymic cortex (10) or made from all parts of the thymus including the medulla (20) provides not really been solved as well. It provides also been inhibited whether TNC processes certainly signify the buildings that are present in the thymus in vivo or are artificially generated during cell solitude techniques in vitro (10, 20). In the present research, we analyzed the features of thymic cortical epithelial cells (cTECs) that exhibit the lately discovered 5t. 5t is certainly a cTEC-specific element of the thymoproteasome, which is certainly important for the positive selection of functionally capable Compact disc8+ Testosterone levels cells (21C23). We discovered that in the postnatal mouse thymus, a bulk of 5t-revealing cTECs, but not really thymic medullary epithelial cells (mTECs), are associated with thymocytes tightly. Around 10% of 5t-revealing cTECs in the adult mouse thymus represent previously reported TNC processes that totally enclose Compact disc4+Compact disc8+ cortical thymocytes. These cTECCthymocyte processes, including TNCs, are discovered in the thymic cortex intravitally. Strangely enough, we observed that TNC processes show up past due NVP-BKM120 Hydrochloride IC50 during ontogeny but are not really discovered in the adult thymus NVP-BKM120 Hydrochloride IC50 of several T-cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic mouse lines in that the bulk of thymocytes can end up being favorably chosen (known to as NVP-BKM120 Hydrochloride IC50 positive-selector TCR-transgenic rodents), suggesting that the development of the TNC complicated is certainly not really an overall necessity for T-cell advancement or positive selection. Rather, our data present that the TNC complicated represents a chronic relationship between adhesive cTECs and long-lived Compact disc4+Compact disc8+ thymocytes that go through supplementary TCR rearrangement. Hence, this research reveals that TNCs represent a subpopulation of 5t+ cTECs that offer a microenvironment for the marketing of TCR selection by helping the supplementary TCR-V rearrangement in long-lived Compact disc4+Compact disc8+ thymocytes.

{"question":"Please summarize what scientists have learned about Neanderthal population characteristics from genetic studies, and how this genetic evidence has shaped our understanding of human-Neanderthal interbreeding?","answer":"Genetic studies revealed that Neanderthals had a small population size, evidenced by their low genetic diversity - Neanderthal mitochondrial genomes differed from each other by only 20.4 bases and were just 1/3 as diverse as modern humans. This small population size may have been due to modern human incursions into their territory. Regarding interbreeding, DNA analysis showed that Neanderthals contributed 1-4% to the genomes of non-African modern humans, with interbreeding likely occurring before Eurasian populations split from each other, possibly around 100,000 years ago in the Middle East. The evidence of gene flow refutes the strict scenario of complete replacement without interbreeding, though most of our genome still derives from Africa. Interestingly, human-Neanderthal male hybrids appear to have had reduced fertility, as genes associated with testicles and the X chromosome show unusually little Neanderthal influence.","context":["Neanderthal genes linked to our hair, skin according to Nature and Science articles\n- From: AP\n- January 30, 2014\nNEXT time you call someone a Neanderthal, better look in a mirror. Many of the genes that help determine most people's skin and hair are more Neanderthal than not, according to two new studies that look at the DNA fossils hidden in the modern human genome.\nAbout 50,000 years ago, modern day humans migrated out of Africa north to Europe and East Asia and met up with furrow-browed Neanderthals that had been in the colder climates for more than 100,000 years.\nSome of the two species mated. And then the Neanderthals died off as a species - except for what's left inside of us.\nScientists isolated the parts of the non-African modern human genetic blueprint that still contain Neanderthal remnants. Overall, it's barely more than 1 per cent, said two studies released on Wednesday in the journals Nature and Science.\nHowever, in some places, such as the DNA related to the skin, the genetic instructions are as much as 70 per cent Neanderthal and in other places there's virtually nothing from the species that's often portrayed as brutish cavemen.\nThe difference between where Neanderthal DNA is plentiful and where it's absent may help scientists understand what in our genome \"makes humans human,\" said University of Washington genome scientist Joshua Akey, lead author of the paper in Science.\nHarvard researcher Sriram Sankararaman, the lead author of the Nature study, said the place where Neanderthal DNA seemed to have the most influence in the modern human genome has to do with skin and hair. Mr Akey said those instructions are as much as 70 per cent Neanderthal.\n\"We're more Neanderthal than not in those genes,\" Mr Akey said.\nHowever, Mr Sankararaman cautions that scientists don't yet know just what the Neanderthal DNA dictates in our skin and hair.\nSarah Tishkoff, a professor of genetics and biology at the University of Pennsylvania who was not part of either study, theorised that the Neanderthal DNA probably helped the darker humans out of Africa cope with the cooler less bright north.\nLiving in the cooler Europe means less ultraviolet light and less vitamin D from the sun. Darker skin blocks more of those needed rays, so lighter skin is more advantageous in the north and it seems that humans adopted that Neanderthal adaptation, she said.\nAnother area where we have more Neanderthal DNA is parts of genetic codes that have to do with certain immune system functions, Mr Sankararaman said. Again, scientists can't say more than that these Neanderthal genes seem connected to certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and Crohn's disease and lupus, but they are there.\nMr Tiskhoff and Mr Akey said one of the most interesting parts in comparing human and Neanderthal genomes is where we don't see any caveman influence. That, Mr Tiskhoff said, is \"what makes us uniquely human\" and those regions of genetic code \"you just can't mess with.\"\nOne of those areas has been heavily connected to genes that determine speech and communication and there's nothing Neanderthal there, Mr Akey said. This fits with theories that lack of communication skills hurt Neanderthal and speech ability was a distinctly human advantage, he said.\nAnd the study in Nature found something that may help explain why the brutish and virile cavemen haven't influenced humans much: They may have made babies, but the male hybrids of Neanderthals and humans weren't very fertile. Scientists figured that out because the genes associated with the testicles in humans and the X chromosome were unusually empty of Neanderthal influence.\nWhile Neanderthal males themselves were likely good at breeding, their half-human sons weren't and \"they must have been disappointed in their sons,\" said Nature co-author Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\nThe Nature paper found that people of more East Asian descent had slightly more Neanderthal than Europeans, indicating that there may have been a second wave of interbreeding in Asia, researchers said.\nThree outside scientists praised the two studies, which used different techniques to reach similar conclusions. And those conclusions were so close to each other and standard evolution theory that it all fits together in a scary way for scientists used to findings that surprise, said New York University anthropology professor Todd Disotell.\nProf. Disotell recently had his genome tested by a private company and found he's got more Neanderthal DNA than most people, about 2.9 per cent: \"I'm quite proud of that.\"","- Human Evolution Research\n- Climate and Human Evolution\n- Asian Research Projects\n- East African Research Projects\n- Human Origins Program Team\n- What's Hot In Human Origins?\n- Fossil Forensics: Interactive\n- E.

Distinguishing between modern human and ancient genetic material is particularly difficult when the ancient DNA comes from close relatives of modern humans.\nOrganisms decompose after death. Water, oxygen and microbes break down DNA. Within 100,000 years, all DNA is destroyed. Ancient DNA tends to be found in small quantities. The DNA that is extracted is generally fragmentary and damaged. Some damage results in changes to the DNA sequence. Cytosine can change to uracil, which is read by copying enzymes as thymine, resulting in a C to T transition. Changes from G to A also occur. DNA errors are very common at the ends of molecules.\nContamination by modern DNA is a particularly difficult problem to solve. Labs and chemicals may be contaminated by the DNA of the people working in them, while many fossils have been handled by researchers for years. Contamination is difficult to detect because Neanderthals and humans share much of their genetic material, making some DNA sequences indistinguishable. Researchers have developed ways to analyze the results of ancient DNA sequencing efforts to determine whether contamination is likely and how much has occurred. Analysis of the results and efforts to keep labs and specimens free of modern DNA is very important as some researchers believe that the early studies of Neanderthal DNA included modern contaminants.\nSequencing the Complete Neanderthal Mitochondrial Genome\nAfter successfully sequencing large amounts of DNA and devising strategies to deal with potential contamination, a team led by Svante Pääbo from the Max Planck Institute, reported the first complete mtDNA sequence for a Neanderthal (Green et al. 2008). The 0.3 gram sample was taken from a 38,000 year old Neanderthal from Vindija Cave, Croatia. Complete Neanderthal mtDNA sequences give researchers more information about the relationship between modern humans and Neanderthals, as well as information about Neanderthal population size.\nThe complete mtDNA sequence shows that Neanderthals were outside the range of modern human mtDNA variation. Researchers compared the mtDNA sequence with that of modern humans. They compared sequence changes that resulted in nonsynonymous amino acid changes with synonymous changes. They found a larger number of nonsynonymous changes in the Neanderthal lineage, possibly implying that Neanderthals had a small population size with weaker purifying selection (Green et al. 2008).\nLater, Svante Pääbo’s lab sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome of five Neanderthals (Briggs et al. 2009). Sequences came from two individuals from the Neander Valley in Germany, Mezmaiskaya Cave in Russia, El Sidrón Cave in Spain and Vindija Cave in Croatia. Though the Neanderthal sample comes from a wide geographic area, the Neanderthal mtDNA sequences were not particularly genetically diverse. The most divergent Neanderthal sequence came from the Mezmaiskaya Cave Neanderthal from Russia, which the oldest and eastern-most specimen. To look at whether age or geographic location contributed to genetic differences, the team sequenced part of the DNA of another Mezmaiskaya Cave Neanderthal that dated to 41,000 years ago. This more recent specimen grouped with the other Neanderthals, possibly showing that age was the cause of the sequence differences (Briggs et al. 2009). Other studies show the existence of eastern, western and southern groups of Neanderthals (Fabre et al. 2009).\nOn average, Neanderthal mtDNA genomes differ from each other by 20.4 bases and are only 1/3 as diverse as modern humans (Briggs et al. 2009). The low diversity might signal a small population size, possibly due to the incursions of modern humans into their range (Briggs et al. 2009).\nSequencing the Neanderthal Nuclear Genome\nRecently, there have been efforts to sequence Neanderthal nuclear genes. Two studies, one by Svante Pääbo’s team and one by Edward Rubin, have sequenced large amount of Neanderthal nuclear DNA using different methods. Their results were announced in 2006. Given their success in sequencing some nuclear DNA, both labs launched projects to sequence the entire Neanderthal genome. Nuclear genomic sequences from Neanderthals show differences between modern humans and Neanderthals, and illustrate aspects of Neanderthal biology.\nOne Million Base Pairs of the Neanderthal Sequence\nSvante Pääbo’s team from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany announced the sequencing of one million base pairs of nuclear DNA of a Neanderthal specimen in 2006 (Green et al. 2006). After a long search for specimens with a sufficient amount of undamaged DNA to sequence and for the ones with the least evidence of contamination, they focused on Vindija 80, a Neanderthal discovered in Croatia in 1980 that is approximately 38,000 years old.\nThey estimated that 7.9% of the changes in human DNA compared with that of the chimpanzee occurred after the split with Neanderthals. They dated the split between the ancestors of modern humans and Neanderthals to 465,000 to 569,000 years ago. They also found that the effective population size of the Neanderthals was small. Their success in sequencing this amount of DNA indicated that a large-scale project to sequence the Neanderthal genome is possible.\nRubin's Neanderthal Nuclear DNA\nEdward Rubin’s team from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California also sequenced Neanderthal nuclear DNA (Noonan et al. 2006). They sequenced about 65,000 base pairs from the 38,000 year old Vindija, Croatia specimen. The technique used here produces a copy of the Neanderthal sequence that can be retained forever, reducing the need for repeated destructive sampling. The DNA is then cloned in bacteria.\nThe average split time between the Neanderthal and modern human populations was around 370,000 years ago. They used the sequence to look at the possibility of interbreeding between Neanderthals and moderns. Admixture would be seen as derived alleles that are found in Neanderthals and in low frequencies among modern humans. They did not detect this in their sample. A simulation to test the Neanderthal contribution to the human genome found a 0% chance of Neanderthal input with a 0% to 20% confidence range. With this data, the authors cannot definitively rule out admixture (Noonan et al. 2006).\nSome aspects of the two sets of nuclear DNA do not fit together, possibly because of contamination and sequencing errors, especially in the Green et al. (2006) study (Wall and Kim 2007). This has led the researchers to develop new methods of detecting and preventing contamination to ensure that only ancient DNA is being sequenced.\nA Draft Sequence of the Neanderthal Genome\nIn 2010, Svante Pääbo’s lab announced a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome (Green et al. 2010). This new study has produced evidence consistent with interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern Homo sapiens and points to aspects of the human genome that may have changed since the split between humans and Neanderthals.\nDNA was extracted from three Neanderthal bones from Vindija Cave, Croatia. By comparing sequences from their mtDNA and their nuclear DNA, scientists determined that the three bones came from different individuals, although two of them might be related on their mother’s side. The researchers used several methods to ensure that the DNA they were sequencing was derived from the Neanderthal specimens rather than from contamination by modern humans in the lab.\nThe Neanderthal sequence was compared to those of five modern humans from France, China, Papua New Guinea, as well as Africans from the San and Yoruba groups. Tests indicated that Neanderthals shared more derived alleles with non-African modern humans than with African modern humans. They compared parts of the Neanderthal genome with pairs of modern humans. While the European and Asian pairs had similar amounts of derived material compared with the Neanderthal, Neanderthals had more similarities with non-African humans than with Africans. The simplest explanation for these results is gene flow from Neanderthals into modern humans. Gene flow could also have occurred from modern humans into Neanderthals. Interbreeding events between Neanderthals and modern humans might be obscured if the modern human population was large.\nNeanderthals have contributed approximately 1% to 4% to the genomes of non-African modern humans. This evidence of interbreeding sheds light on how we think of the expansion of modern humans out of Africa. It refutes the strictest scenario in which anatomically modern humans replaced archaic hominins completely without any interbreeding. However, even with some interbreeding between moderns and archaic hominins, most of our genome still derives from Africa.\nThe data also points to the time when interbreeding might have taken place. Since the Neanderthal DNA was equally related to that of the modern samples from France, China and Papua New Guinea, admixture between moderns and Neanderthals must have occurred before the Eurasian populations split off from each other. Remains of both modern humans and Neanderthals dating to around 100,000 years ago have been found in the Middle East. A few interbreeding events during this period could have produced the results found in this study.\nThe sequence of our close hominin relative also shows us how humans are unique. Researchers found 78 sequence differences that would have affected proteins in which Neanderthals had the ancestral state and modern humans had a newer, derived state. Five genes had more than one sequence change that affected the protein structure. These proteins include SPAG17, which is involved in the movement of sperm, PCD16, which may be involved in wound healing, TTF1, which is involved in ribosomal gene transcription, and RPTN, which is found in the skin, hair and sweat glands. Scientists do not know the function of the CAN15 protein, which was also one of the differences. Other changes may affect regulatory regions in the human sequence. Some changes are in regions that code for microRNA molecules that regulate protein manufacture.\nThe comparison also pointed out regions that might have been under positive selection in modern humans. Though some of the genomic areas that may have been positively selected for in modern humans may have coded for structural or regulatory regions, others may have been associated with energy metabolism, cognitive development and the morphology of the head and upper body."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7a323da2-517f-4210-9a1d-06a7e9b1fecd>","<urn:uuid:8078d8a5-0700-4b28-bdd5-663c2c173c71>"],"error":null}
