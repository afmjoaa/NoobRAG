{"question":"What's the key difference in communication methods between HNSA and ICS? ü§î Like, how do they connect with their members nowadays?","answer":"HNSA primarily relies on computer-based systems and the Internet for trans-global communication among its members, allowing curators and managers to share information within minutes or hours. The ICS, on the other hand, functions as a representative body that provides direct representation for its members with intergovernmental regulatory bodies and offers free resources and guidance for shipping operators in the industry.","context":["About The Historic Naval Ships Association:\nHistoric Naval Ships Association\nPreserving this heritage is a daunting task. The ships are historical artifacts in their own right and not immune to the indignities of aging. Preservation of a ship requires an investment of considerable financial, industrial, and human resources. Above all, preservation requires adherence to an age old axiom: constant vigilance. Organizations entrusted with these vessels have approached the restoration tasks in different manners. A few of these organizations are blessed with adequate funding necessary to accomplish the enormous upkeep required on a regular basis. Most, however, have to develop phased approach plans that can be realistically supported in an environment of funding and staffing limitations. As the years go by, restoration becomes increasingly more difficult as sources of vintage spare parts dry up. Costs to fabricate custom parts from scratch will further burden ship restorers.\nWith the advent of the twenty-first century technologies and methods, our membership has a great advantage. The proliferation of computer based systems and the Internet revolutionizes communication and provides an avenue for the diffusion of ideas and information. For the first time since the beginning of HNSA, trans-global communication can be measured in minutes and hours rather than days and months; a phenomenon that would appear miraculous to the sailors who manned the oldest ships in the membership. It is now possible for a curator in Australia to receive the answer to a problem from a member in Sweden; while a manager in Cleveland may wish to spread a unique marketing idea to all the members. The limiting factor in a rapid response is no longer great distances but rather time zones.\nIt is often said that naval ships are more than just a collection of pieces and parts hewn from the fabric of the Earth. Indeed, these ships are often personified by the spirits of the men and women who serve in them. These vessels have sailed through major eras in world history. As time marches on, they will be the only tangible survivors of some of the most momentous historical events. HNSA strives to preserve this legacy through an assortment of educational programs designed to \"keep the ship alive.\" Methods vary, but visitors now have the chance to hear the distinctive rumble of a Fairbanks Morse diesel engine, watch re-enactors in period uniforms demonstrate rigging sails and in some cases listen to active duty personnel relate sea tales. Many of the member organizations have overnight encampments as well as interactive educational programs specifically for the younger visitor. If after your visit one of the ships included in this guide, you have a better understanding and appreciation of why men and women go down to the sea in ships in service to their countries, HNSA will have succeeded in its mission.\nIt is important to note the role played in the preservation and interpretation of these ships played by volunteers. In most cases, it is the selfless, dedicated work of volunteers that allow these ships to survive and thrive as living museums. Your support can be expressed in many ways. I invite the reader to visit the Historic Naval Ships excellent website, http://www.hnsa.org and explore ways in which your specific talents can be utilized in order to assist in ongoing efforts to keep not only these ships but also maritime and naval traditions alive and well for future generations\nReturn to the HNSA Home Page.","The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is a trade association that represents ship owners and ship operators via national shipowners associations.\nIts aim is to promote the interests of its members throughout all issues of ship operation and also shipping policy.\nKey facts about the International Chamber of Shipping:\n- ICS member shipping companies operate over 80% of the world‚Äôs merchant tonnage.\n- ICS membership is made up of national shipowners‚Äô associations in Asia, Europe and the Americas.\n- The ICS was established in 1921.\n- The ICS has 36 members and 11 associate members.\n- The ICS is based in London.\n- The ICS is unique because unlike other international shipping trade associations it represents the global interests of all the different trades in the industry, from passenger ship operators to tanker operators.\n- The ICS is a consultative body to the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations agency with responsibility for the safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment.\n- The ICS deals with regulatory, operational and legal issues relating to the shipping industry.\nThe ICS provides representation for its members with various intergovernmental regulatory bodies that impact on shipping, including the International Maritime Organisation.\nIt is also a source of information for members and has developed guidance and best practice for those operating within the industry ‚Äì these resources are offered free to ship owners in the industry, as well as to members.\nIts mission is to aim for a global shipping industry that operates to high standards, prioritises safe shipping operations, as well as protection of the environment.\nWhile it was fundamentally created to promote the industry of shipping operators it also has as one of its aims cooperation with other organisations, both governmental and non-governmental in order to help make the shipping industry a more efficient and safe place.\nMember Shipping Companies (by size):\nCriteria for membership:\nICS members are ship owners and operators from around the world who are represented via national ship owners associations. It is the associations that hold the membership so individual owners and operators cannot apply.\nThere are no membership criteria listed on the website because of this.\nOpinions about the International Chamber of Shipping:\nThe ICS is quoted in several industry publications, commenting on the issues of the day such as CO2 reduction. It is mentioned on the websites of its members, such as the UK Chamber of Shipping.\nDocuments online show the ICS commenting on global issues, such as tax conventions, and there is also coverage of events such as the International Chamber of Shipping Conference where Koji Sekimizu, Secretary-General, International Maritime Organisation, described the ICS as ‚Äúone of several non-governmental organisations that represent the shipping industry at IMO and has one of the longest pedigrees.‚Äù\nOther online sources refer to the ICS as the ‚Äúmost recognised global ship owners association.‚Äù The credibility of the ICS is obvious from the publications in which its name appears, the associations with other bodies and the kind of issues it is asked to comment on.\nThe International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is the principal international trade association for merchant shipowners and operators, representing all sectors and trades (including inter alia tankers, dry bulk carriers, containerships, general cargo and specialised ships, as well as passenger ships) with the various intergovernmental bodies that impact on shipping.

{"question":"How do you calculate the percentage gain of an investment, and what impact do fees have on the overall returns?","answer":"To calculate percentage gain, subtract the purchase price from the selling price, divide by the purchase price, and multiply by 100. For example, if you bought shares for $3,000 and sold them for $3,800, the calculation would be: ($3,800 - $3,000) / $3,000 x 100 = 26.67% gain. However, fees significantly impact returns over time. For instance, with a 4% annual return over 20 years, an investment portfolio with a 1% ongoing fee will perform notably worse than one with a 0.25% fee. Fees come in two types: transaction fees (like commissions and sales loads) charged when buying or selling, and ongoing fees (like advisory fees and operating expenses) charged regularly. These fees reduce not only your investment balance but also the potential returns you could have earned on that money.","context":["Calculate the Percentage Gain or Loss: Figuring out how much your investment has gained in percentage terms is simple yet crucial for investors.\nTo calculate the percentage gain, you‚Äôll need to know how much you originally spent on the investment, which is called the purchase price. Then, you subtract the purchase price from the amount you sold the investment for. This will give you the gain or loss on your investment.\nIn case you don‚Äôt remember the original purchase price, you can ask your broker for that information. Brokerage firms offer records, either on paper or electronically, for each transaction you make. This includes details about what you initially paid for the investment, how much you sold it for, and other financial information related to the investment.\nCalculate the Percentage:\nDetermining Percentage Gain or Loss\nHere‚Äôs how you can figure it out:\n- Advertisement -\n- Start with the price you sold the investment for, and subtract the amount you first paid for it. This will give you the gain or loss amount.\n- Take that gain or loss amount and divide it by the original amount you paid for the investment.\n- After that, multiply the result by 100. This gives you the percentage change in the investment.\nIf the percentage is negative, it means that the investment‚Äôs value has gone down compared to what you initially paid. This is called a loss.\nIf the percentage is positive, it means that the investment‚Äôs value has gone up compared to what you initially paid. This is called a gain.\nFormula for Calculating Percentage Gain or Loss\nHere‚Äôs how to calculate the investment percentage gain:\nInvestment percentage gain = (Price sold ‚Äì Purchase price) / Purchase price * 100\nIn this calculation, you‚Äôre comparing the difference between the selling price and the purchase price. Then, you‚Äôre dividing that difference by the purchase price to get a decimal. When you multiply that decimal by 100, you get the percentage gain or loss in relation to your initial investment.\n- Advertisement -\nWhen you do this calculation, the number you get in the numerator (the top part) represents the dollar amount of the gain or loss. Dividing this by the purchase price creates a decimal that tells you how much the gain or loss is compared to what you initially invested. Multiplying this decimal by 100 turns it into a percentage that shows the gain or loss as a part of your initial investment.\nIf you want to figure out the percentage gain or loss without actually selling the investment, you can use a similar approach. Instead of the selling price, you‚Äôd use the current market price. This would give you an idea of an unrealized gain (or loss), which means the gain or loss is theoretical because you haven‚Äôt sold the investment yet.\nWhy Calculating Percentage Gain or Loss Is Important\nIt‚Äôs essential to calculate the gain or loss on an investment as a percentage because it illustrates how much was earned relative to the investment amount.\n- Advertisement -\nFor instance, let‚Äôs consider two investors who both earned $500 from investing in the same stock. On the surface, it might seem like both investors achieved the same outcome. However, if we delve deeper, we find that the situation is more nuanced. If the first investor initially put in $20,000 to buy the stock and the second investor only invested $10,000, the second investor‚Äôs performance is actually better. This is because the second investor had less money at risk and still earned the same gain.\nMoreover, the second investor could take the extra $10,000 (assuming both investors had $20,000 to begin with) and invest it in another stock to potentially earn additional gains.\nExamples of Calculating Percentage Gain or Loss\nThe percentage gain or loss calculation can be used for many types of investments. Below are two examples.\nHere‚Äôs an example to help you understand better:\nImagine an investor who bought 100 shares of Intel Corp. (INTC) for $30 per share. This means they spent $3,000 to start (30 dollars per share multiplied by 100 shares).\nLater on, they decided to sell those 100 shares for $38 per share. So, the total money they got from the sale was $3,800 (38 dollars per share multiplied by 100 shares). This means the gain in terms of dollars was $800 (3,800 dollars from the sale minus 3,000 dollars initial cost).\nTo figure out the percentage gain, you can use either of these methods:\n- ($3,800 sale proceeds ‚Äì $3,000 original cost) / $3,000 = 0.2667 x 100 = 26.67%.\n- Or, you can use the price per share:\n($38 selling price ‚Äì $30 purchase price) / $30 = 0.2666 x 100 = 26.67%.\nThis percentage (26.67%) shows how much the investment gained compared to the initial cost. It helps you see the increase in value over time.\nIf you‚Äôre curious about how well the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) did over a specific time, you can use the same method to figure it out. The Dow is a collection of 30 major U.S. companies‚Äô stock prices that helps show how the stock market is doing.\nFor instance, let‚Äôs consider an example: The Dow started at 24,000 points and finished the week at 24,480 points.\nTo calculate the percentage gain, you can use these steps:\n- (24,480 ‚Äì 24,000) / 24,000 = 0.02 x 100 = 2%\nThis means the Dow went up by 2% during that period. This calculation gives you an idea of how much the Dow increased compared to its starting point.\nFees And Dividends\nWhen you invest, there are expenses you need to account for, and these should be taken into consideration when calculating percentage gain or loss. The examples mentioned earlier didn‚Äôt include broker fees, commissions, or taxes.\nTo include these costs, you should subtract the expenses of investing from the gain (the difference between the selling price and the purchase price). This will give you a more accurate representation of the actual gain or loss after considering all the associated costs.\nBuilding upon the Intel illustration provided earlier, suppose the investor had to pay a broker fee of $75. The calculation for the percentage gain would then go like this:\n(($3,800 sale proceeds ‚Äì $3,000 original cost) ‚Äì $75) / $3,000 = 0.2416 x 100 = 24.16%.\nObserving this, we notice that the broker‚Äôs fee caused the rate of return on the investment to decrease by over 2%, shifting it from 26.67% to 24.16%. This showcases the impact of the brokerage fee on the overall percentage gain.\nIf the investment provided any earnings or payouts, like a dividend, it‚Äôs important to include that amount when calculating the gain. A dividend is a sum of money given to shareholders, and it‚Äôs based on how many shares they have.\nUsing the Intel example, let‚Äôs assume the company gave out a dividend of $2 for each share. Since the investor owned 100 shares, they would receive $200, divided into four payments across the year.\nTo calculate the percentage gain, you would do this:\n(($3,800 sale proceeds ‚Äì $3,000 original cost) + $200) / $3,000 = 0.3333 x 100 = 33.33%.\nIf there were no brokerage fees, and the stock was held for a year, the dividend would boost the percentage gain from 26.67% to 33.33%, an increase of over 6%.\nNow, if the stock was held for only two quarters (half a year), the gain would have an extra $100 (instead of $200) from the dividend since each quarterly payment would be $50.\nWhen you consider things like transaction costs, account fees, commissions, and dividend income, you get a more accurate picture of the percentage gain or loss on an investment.\nWhy do I Need to Understand the Percentage Gain or Loss of an Investment?\nKnowing how much a security‚Äôs value has gone up or down in percentage terms is valuable for investors. This information gives insight into the importance of price changes. Investors can apply percentage change to see how an investment performed in the past, or to gauge how strong or weak it is compared to similar assets. Additionally, percentage gain or loss provides a way to understand how much a security‚Äôs value changes, which helps assess its volatility.\nIn a Nutshell, How do I Calculate an Investment‚Äôs Percentage Gain or Loss?\nTo figure out how much an investment has gained or lost in percentage terms, follow these steps:\nFind the difference between the amount you bought it for and the amount you sold it for.\nThen, take this gain or loss from the investment and divide it by the initial price you paid for it.\nAfter that, multiply this result by 100. This will give you the percentage change in the investment‚Äôs value.\nIf you want to find out the potential percentage change without actually selling the investment, you can use the same method. Instead of the sale price, just use the current market price as a reference point.\nWhat Rule of Thumb Percentage Gain or Loss Figures Do Investors Need to Know?\nInvestors often describe a stock correction as a situation where the value of a stock falls by 10% or more from its highest point. Stock market crashes, on the other hand, don‚Äôt have a strict definition, but they generally refer to a sudden and significant drop of more than 10% in the value of a stock or an entire index within a brief period.\nTo balance the potential for risk and reward, numerous financial advisors suggest maintaining a portfolio that comprises 60% stocks and 40% bonds. This combination is intended to help achieve a balance between the potential gains from stocks and the stability offered by bonds.\nWhat Other Factors Should I Consider When Calculating an Investment‚Äôs Percentage Gain or Loss?\nThe percentage change that‚Äôs publicly shown for a security doesn‚Äôt include extra costs like commissions, slippage, and holding fees. To get a more precise picture of an investment‚Äôs percentage gain or loss, it‚Äôs important for investors to consider these expenses when they‚Äôre doing their calculations.\nSimilarly, if investors want to understand the total returns from an investment, they should also include distribution payments like dividends when they‚Äôre calculating percentages. This gives a more comprehensive view of how well an investment has performed.\nThe Bottom Line\nKnowing how much an investment‚Äôs value has gone up or down in percentage terms is useful for investors to compare performance and evaluate potential risks. The calculation for a security‚Äôs percentage change is relatively simple, needing just the buying and selling prices. To estimate how an investment‚Äôs value might change in the future without actually selling it, investors can use the current market price instead of the sale price.\nFor a more accurate view of how an investment has done, it‚Äôs important to consider expenses, such as commissions, and also include income earned from distributions like dividends when calculating the percentage gain or loss. This gives a fuller picture of the investment‚Äôs overall performance.\nBuy, Trade, and Hold 350+ Cryptocurrencies\nBecome a part of a community of 120 million registered users who trade the most well-known cryptocurrencies globally.

These fees may seem small, but over time they can have a major impact on your investment portfolio. The following chart shows an investment portfolio with a 4% annual return over 20 years when the investment either has an ongoing fee of 0.25%, 0.50% or 1%. Notice how the fees affect the investment portfolio over 20 years.\nAlong with the other factors you think about when choosing either a financial professional or a particular investment, be sure you understand and compare the fees you‚Äôll be charged. It could save you a lot of money in the long run.\nHow do I know what I‚Äôm being charged?\n- Get informed. Find out what you may be charged by reading what your financial professional provides you. For example, look at your account opening documents, account statements, confirmations and any product-specific documents to see the types and amount of fees you are paying. Fees impact your investment, so it‚Äôs important you understand them.\n- Ask questions so that you understand what you will be charged, when and why. Questions might include:\n- What are all the fees relating to this account? Do you have a fee schedule that lists all of the fees that will be charged for investments and maintenance of this account?\n- What fees will I pay to purchase, hold and sell this investment? Will those fees appear clearly on my account statement or my confirmation? If those fees don‚Äôt appear on my account statement or my confirmation, how will I know about them?\n- How can I reduce or eliminate some of the fees I‚Äôll pay? For example, can I buy the investment directly without paying a financial professional? Can I pay lower fees if I open a different type of account?\n- Do I need to keep a minimum account balance to avoid certain fees?\n- Are there any other transaction or advisory fees? Account transfer, account inactivity, wire transfer fees or any other fees?\n- How do the fees and expenses of the product compare to other products that can help me meet my objectives?\n- How much does the investment have to increase in value before I break even?\n- Ask questions about your financial professional‚Äôs compensation. Questions might include:\n- How do you get paid? By commission? How are commissions determined? Do they vary depending on the amount of assets you manage?\n- Do you get paid through means other than through commissions and amount of assets you manage and, if yes, how?\n- Do I have any choice on how to pay you?\n- Check your statements. Review confirmation and account statements to be sure you‚Äôre being charged correctly and ask your financial professional to break the fees down for you if it‚Äôs unclear.\nWhat types of fees are there?\nFees typically come in two types‚Äîtransaction fees and ongoing fees. Transaction fees are charged each time you enter into a transaction, for example, when you buy a stock or mutual fund. In contrast, ongoing fees or expenses are charges you incur regularly, such as an annual account maintenance fee.\nHow do transaction fees affect your investment portfolio?\nTransaction fees are charged at the time you buy, sell or exchange an investment. As with any fee, transaction fees will reduce the overall amount of your investment portfolio.\nHow do ongoing fees affect your investment portfolio?\nOngoing fees can also reduce the value of your investment portfolio. This is particularly true over time, because not only is your investment balance reduced by the fee, but you also lose any return you would have earned on that fee. Over time, even ongoing fees that are small can have a big impact on your investment portfolio. The chart above illustrates the effect of different ongoing fees on a $100,000 investment portfolio with a 4% annual return over 20 years.\nThe chart below illustrates the impact of a 1% ongoing fee on a $100,000 investment portfolio that grows 4% annually over 20 years. As the investment portfolio grows over time, so does the total amount of fees you pay. Because of the fees you pay, you have a smaller amount invested that is earning a return.\nWhat is an example of a transaction fee?\nCommissions. You will likely pay a commission when you buy or sell a stock through a financial professional. The commission compensates the financial professional and his or her firm when it is acting as agent for you in your securities transaction.\nMarkups. When a broker-dealer sells you securities out of its inventory, the broker-dealer acts as a principal in the transaction (that is, selling to you directly the securities it holds). When acting in a principal capacity the broker-dealer generally will be compensated by selling the security to you at a price that is higher than the market price (the difference is called a markup), or by buying the security from you at a price that is lower than the market price (the difference is called a markdown).\nSales loads. Some mutual funds charge a fee called a sales load. Sales loads serve a similar purpose to commissions by compensating the financial professional for selling the mutual fund to you. Sales loads can be front-end in that they are assessed at the time you make your investment or back-end in that you are assessed the charge if you sell the mutual fund usually within a specified timeframe.\nSurrender charges. Early withdrawal from a variable annuity investment (typically within six to eight years, but sometimes as long as 10 years) will usually result in a surrender charge. This charge compensates your financial professional for selling the variable annuity to you. Generally, the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn, and declines gradually over a period of several years.\nWhat is an example of an ongoing fee?\nInvestment advisory fees. If you use an investment adviser to manage your investment portfolio, your adviser may charge you an ongoing annual fee based on the value of your portfolio.\nAnnual operating expenses. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are essentially investment products created and managed by investment professionals. The management and marketing of these investment products result in expenses and costs that are often passed on to you‚Äîthe investor‚Äîin the form of fees deducted from the fund‚Äôs assets. These annual ongoing fees can include management fees, 12b-1 or distribution (and/or service) fees, and other expenses. These fees are often identified as a percentage of the fund‚Äôs assets‚Äîthe fund‚Äôs expense ratio (identified in the fund‚Äôs prospectus as the total annual fund operating expenses).\n401(k) fees. The expenses for operating and administering 401(k) plans may be passed along to its participants. This is in addition to the annual operating expenses of the mutual fund investments that you may hold in your plan.\nAnnual variable annuity fees. If you invest in a variable annuity, you may be charged fees to cover the expenses of administering the variable annuity. You also may pay fees such as insurance fees and fees for optional features (often called riders). You will also be subject to the annual operating expenses of any mutual funds or other investments that the variable annuity holds.\nWhat are some examples of products with combined transaction and ongoing fees?\nSome investment products or services, including mutual funds, ETFs and variable annuities, commonly include both transaction and ongoing fees as part of the structure of the product or service. For example, an ETF is bought and sold like stock, so you may be charged a commission when you use a financial professional to purchase an ETF. An ETF also typically has ongoing fees in the form of its expense ratio, referred to in the ETF‚Äôs prospectus as the total annual fund operating expenses. You can use FINRA‚Äôs Fund Analyzer to compare the cost of various types of securities, including mutual funds and ETFs.\nWhat other fees might I pay?\nIn addition to commissions, a broker-dealer may also charge certain additional fees such as fees for not maintaining a minimum balance, account maintenance, account transfer, account inactivity, wire transfer or other fees. These fees may not always be obvious to you from your account statement or confirmation statement. You should obtain information about all the fees you are charged and why they are charged. Ask your broker-dealer to explain the fees if you do not understand them.\nWhat can I do if I think my fees are too high?\n- Follow up. If your fees seem too high, ask questions. Consider following up in writing if you are not satisfied.\n- Negotiate. In some cases, fees are negotiable, so you can talk to your financial professional about reducing them.\n- Shop around before you invest. Just like shopping around for the best price on any other product or service, you should consider how much you are paying for investing services. However, to the extent you decide to move to a new firm, you should think about any tax consequences and fees for closing or transferring your account, for example, if you have to sell some or all of your current holdings in order to transfer.\nWhen researching brokers, you can visit FINRA‚Äôs BrokerCheck or call FINRA‚Äôs toll-free BrokerCheck hotline at (800) 289-9999 to obtain information about a broker, including any regulatory actions taken by FINRA against the broker.

{"question":"How are traditional Russian names structured? Dame un ejemplo detallado. Show me the components in a table format.","answer":"Russian names typically have three components:\\n|Component|Description|Example (Leo Tolstoy's case)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|First name|Given name|Lev|\\n|Patronymic|Name derived from father's first name|Nikolayevhich (from father Nikolai)|\\n|Surname|Family name|Tolstoy|","context":["In Russian culture, names are a big deal. And, by that, sizeable. To learn more about nicknames, it might help to learn how Russian people usually name their children in the modern age.\nRussian Naming Conventions\nMost Russian people have three names: a first name, a patronymic, and a surname. The first name and the surname (last name) are self-explanatory. Those are similar to American cultural naming traditions.\nThe difference is that instead of a middle name, the child gets a name referring to his or her father's first name as their \"middle\" name.\nTake a look at the full name of famous Russian writer Leo Tolstoy who wrote \"War and Peace\": His full name was Lev Nikolayevhich Tolstoy. His first name was Lev. His patronymic (or middle name) is Nikolayevhich. And, his last name was Tolstoy. His father's name was Nikolai, hence the middle name Niholayevhich.\nRussian nicknames, or diminutives, are simply short forms of the given name. As opposed to full forms used in formal situations, short forms of a name are used in communication between well-acquainted people, usually relatives, friends, and colleagues. Short forms emerged in spoken language for convenience as a majority of formal names are cumbersome.\n‚ÄúSasha‚Äù is often the nickname used for a person whose given name is Alexander (male) or Alexandra (female).\nWhile a basic nickname like ‚ÄúSasha‚Äù may not signify anything except familiarity, other diminutives may be used in an affectionate manner. Alexandra may be called ‚ÄúSashenka,‚Äù which means \"little Sasha,\" by her parents.\nAs in the earlier example, regarding Leo Tolstoy, the diminutive forms of his name could be \"Leva\", \"Lyova,\" or more rarely, \"Lyovushka,\" which is more of an affectionate pet name.\nTolstoy was actually called Leo in English circles due to a translation of his Russian name to English. In Russian Lev, means \"lion.\" In English, the translation to Leo was acceptable to the author when he was approving his manuscripts for publication for English audiences since Leo is understood in English as meaning \"lion.\"\nExample of Nicknames for Female Name \"Maria\"\nMaria is a very common Russian name. Take a look at the many ways you may hear or see the name being used and in the different ways.\n|Maria||Full form of name, official, professional relationships, unfamiliar people|\n|Masha||Short form, neutral and used in casual relationships|\n|Mashenka||Form of affection|\n|Intimate, tender forms|\n|Mashka||Vulgar, impolite unless used inside the family, between children, or friends|\nOther Nickname Examples\nTo use an example as seen in Russian literature, in Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the protagonist Raskolnikov's first name, Rodion, appears in the following forms: Rodya, Rodenka, and Rodka. His sister, Avdotya, is frequently referred to as \"Dunya\" and \"Dunechka\" throughout the novel.\nOther common Russian names and diminutives:\n- Dima (for Dmitri)\n- Misha (for Mikhail)\n- Vova (for Vladimir)\nDiminutives for Common Nouns\nDiminutives can be derived from common nouns, too. The word mamochka, a diminutive of mother, can be used by a son or daughter who wants to indicate a mother's sweetness and dearness. Sobachka, a diminutive from the word sobaka (dog), expresses the dog's cuteness and smallness. English speakers might use ‚Äúdoggy‚Äù to convey the same meaning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a14d5294-a351-4be5-8a78-9599c752d700>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain how OAT coolants protect engine surfaces, and what are the first steps to check when an engine temperature warning light comes on?","answer":"OAT coolants protect by interacting only at corrosion sites, unlike conventional inorganic coolants that lay down an insoluble chemical blanket which can reduce heat exchange. When the engine temperature warning light illuminates, the first step is to check the coolant level, but only after the engine has completely cooled, preferably overnight. Never check hot coolant as the system is under pressure (about 18 psi) and can reach temperatures of 230F or 102C. Other initial checks include examining if the cooling fans are operating properly and testing if the thermostat is stuck closed by comparing upper and lower hose temperatures after the engine has cooled.","context":["It is often said that coolants are a commodity, which is true in part, but refers only to the base fluid. This is the water/glycol mixture that represents around 97.5% of a finished, ready-to-use product. The real value of a coolant, and that which differentiates one from another, is the additive or inhibitor package which makes up the balance at only about 2.5%.\nIn Coolants 101, we provided a high-level overview of the types of coolants we typically see in the automotive industry in North America. We divided these coolants into two broad categories of products: IAT (Inorganic Additive Technology) and OAT (Organic Additive Technology). For this discussion, we‚Äôll focus on the OAT family of coolants because it represents most of the market in both the automotive and heavy-duty industries.\nAs you probably know the protection mechanism of inorganic or conventional coolants is to lay down a protective, insoluble chemical blanket to protect cooling system surfaces, but this extra layer can result in diminished heat exchange. OAT coolants provide chemical protection by interacting only at corrosion sites.\nThe use of various chemical elements and methods of manufacture are key in determining the quality, performance and longevity of a coolant beyond its virgin state. For example, two newly-manufactured products can appear the same with respect to ASTM test data, but once in service, oxidation and other factors can have a great impact on performance. It is these factors that influence the many variations of OAT coolants and determine regional OEM technology preferences across the globe (see examples in figure 1 below).\nNow, let‚Äôs look at some of the more common additive variations of OAT coolants along with a little information about each one:\nOAT ‚Äì As previously mentioned, Organic Additive Technology, and the basis for all the types below. Most over-the-road equipment engine OEMs recommend OAT coolants for their engine cooling systems.\nNOAT ‚Äì Nitrited or Nitrite-containing OAT. Nitrites afford improved protection to coolant side cylinder liners used in heavy duty diesel engine cooling system components. Both OAT and NOAT are preferred in North America with NOAT being more prevalent in the market.\nHOAT ‚Äì In Coolants 101, we referred to the HOAT as a hybrid OAT, because it combines both IAT and OAT chemistries. Other terms associated could be Hybrid (contain both chemistries but predominantly conventional) and Lobrid (contain both chemistries but predominantly organic).\nPOAT ‚Äì Phosphated or phosphate-containing OAT. Since phosphates can react with hard water metals to create scale, these are not preferred in a hard water environment such as Europe or North America. In Asia, however, they are preferred because of the soft-water qualities found there.\nSi OAT ‚Äì Silicated or silicone-containing OAT. While some OEM‚Äôs in Europe prefer a low-silicate OAT, they are banned in Asia due to problems with water pump seals and poor heat exchange. As mentioned earlier, manufacturing methods can be key in the quality and performance of a coolant. As an example, it is known that silicates can be difficult to stabilize, and if not treated properly in the manufacturing process, they can drop out of solution, causing deposits and clogged cooling system components.\nRegional OEM Coolant Technology Preferences\nFigure 1. Colors used in this figure represent various technologies, but actual coolant colors may vary.\nWith so many different technologies and choices it‚Äôs easy to understand why engine coolants can be one of the most confusing areas of maintenance we face. Here are a few things to consider when questions arise regarding your cooling system.\nQ: With all the technologies out there, how do I know which product is right for my vehicle?\nA: It is always best to check your owner‚Äôs manual for the right coolant requirement and maintenance and testing practices. If unsure, call Chevron Lubetek at 800-582-3835, and one of our lubrication specialists will be able to help you.\nQ: As long as I use the correct coolant and stay within the OEM recommended service interval, can I just top off coolant if it gets low? Why is testing so important?\nA: There are many factors affecting coolant quality and performance over time, such as oxidation, pH, and additive depletion to name a few. And because many serious engine problems can be coolant-related, it is essential that proper coolant testing be part of any comprehensive automotive or heavy-duty engine maintenance program.","Temperature Warning Light On\nLight On for Engine Coolant Temperature Hot All warning lights are meant to alert you that a problem in one of the operation systems in your car has or is malfunctioning. The engine temperature warning light is conveniently placed in the instrument cluster display panel. Warning lights generally come in two colors, orange and red. Red is reserved for the more serious malfunctions that need attention immediately while orange is meant to be serviced at your earliest convenience. When a particular system fails a warning light device has been designed into most car systems such as brakes, engine, transmission, seat belts, air bag, vital fluid levels and more. All engine temperature warning lights are colored red because if this light illuminates the engine is overheating. If left unattended the engine will suffer irreversible damage. When the engine overheats the engine pistons expand causing the cylinder wall to become scored. When cylinder wall scoring occurs the piston rings cannot seal to the wall allowing combustion bypass when the engine cools. This is why after an engine has been overheated it can have low power and cause the engine to burn oil. This condition is called blow-by and cannot be repaired unless the engine is rebuilt or replaced. If you think this condition has occurred to a car an engine compression test is needed. If this test shows that the compression is below the normal range you can suspect engine overheating has occurred. In sever engine overheating conditions the internal engine parts can swell forcing the engine to stop turning or seize. If the engine seizes due to overheating the internal parts of the engine are damaged and replacement or disassemble for repair is needed. A common cause for engine overheating is lack of coolant in the engine cooling system. When lack of coolant is present the heat transferring properties is lost. This absence of heat transfer is what causes the engine overheating. A car radiator cannot work if there is no coolant inside the system. The coolant level should be the first check after an engine has overheated. Never check engine coolant until the engine has cooled completely, preferably after the engine has cooled over night. Another popular reason for engine overheating is the thermostat can stick closed not allowing the coolant to flow to the radiator. The engine thermostat is designed to open allowing antifreeze/coolant to flow to the radiator when the thermostat inside the engine reaches about 198F - 99C. Even if the coolant is at the proper level this condition can occur. Only check for this condition after the engine had cooled down a safe temperature. Then check the temperature of both the upper and lower hoses. If the top hose is warm and the bottom hose is cool you can suspect the thermostat has stuck and needs to be tested or replaced. If your car is equipped with radiator cooling fans it is vital these fans work properly. If the cooling fan fail to operate the heat from the radiator will not be removed from the engine coolant causing the engine to overheat. If the engine is overheating the cooling fans should be on in full force. If the cooling fans have not come on the electrical system that power the fans must be checked. If an engine overheating condition has occurred one of the most popular causes for this condition is cooling fan motor failure. These fan or fans use a high amperage draw and are prone to failure. Other popular reasons for failure is a fuse or relay operation failure. Use a test light or voltmeter to test these circuits and replace burnt or shorted components with new. In most cases engine overheating is obvious and can be detected by additional engine noise, poor running or low power even before the engine temperature warning light is illuminated. If you car is equipped with both a temperature warning light and a engine temperature gauge it is a good idea to periodically inspect the gauge while driving. When cars are designed with a temperature gauge along with a warning light it is a \"redundant\" system and is used as a failsafe. In this case the warning light works in correlation with the gauge and will only illuminate when the gauge is in the upper range of the gauge span. Never depend on a warning light to illuminate when the temperature gauge is in the \"hot\" range. If the temperature gauge is in the \"hot\" range shut the engine off in a safe place on the highway. Allow the engine to cool before inspection. Sometimes the temperature gauge can go to the hot range and then back down to the cool range if this condition happens check the electrical contact at the temperature gauge sender electrical connection. If this contact is loose it will cause intermittent high resistance allowing the temperature gauge circuit to connect and then go to high resistance when the engine it running due to engine vibration. When the connections goes to high resistance the temperature gauge will go to the \"hot\" position ever thought the engine is not hot. Always make sure the connection is tight and making good contact with no corrosion. Even if the connection is tight corrosion can cause high resistance when the engine is running. If the cooling system radiator is plugged it can cause the engine to overheat. A radiator can become plugged by corrosion or debris in the cooling system. If either of these conditions occur the radiator cannot pass coolant through the cooling tube which are connected to the cooling fin of the radiator. In turn the engine coolant will be hot as it re-enters the engine block and cylinder heads causing the engine to overheat. To check for this condition (after the engine has cooled overnight) remove the radiator cap or upper radiator hose. Then with a flashlight shine the beam into the radiator and down or over to the cooling tube openings. If the opening look clogged the radiator must be replaced or serviced (boiled out) by a radiator repair shop. Some of the overly un-popular causes for engine overheating are internal engine gasket failures such as a head or intake manifold gasket failure. This condition is accompanied by low coolant level in most cases. In extreme cases the engine block or cylinder head can develop a crack due to manufacturing flaws. This condition will present itself in much the same way as a failed internal engine gasket but the remedy is much most expensive. Usually when this condition occurs the engine block or cylinder head needs replacement. Anytime your car engine fails you must consider he engine mileage as it might be more beneficial to replace the engine as a unit opposed to repairing an high mileage engine. Also if the car has seen better days it might be time to purchase a different car. This decision can be difficult especially if the car is still in good condition, just old. Do not attempt to open the engine cooling system at anytime unless the engine has cooled overnight. The engine cooling system is contained under pressure, usually about 18 psi. This coolant is hot about 230F or 102C and it will burn you or anyone standing with range of coolant projecting from the engine compartment. Sometimes a car hood can be hot from a result of an overheating engine. Before opening the hood touch the hood quickly to measure the hood temperature before opening. Never open a overheated hood, allow a cooling period, preferably over night. Common causes for the engine temperature light to be illuminated\n- Low Coolant Level - When the temperature light comes on the first thing that should be checked is the coolant level. If this level becomes low due to a leak the engine can over heat\n- Failed Coolant Fan Operation - The cooling fan must be operational or the engine will overheat causing the engine temperature light to come on.\n- Plugged Radiator - The car radiator must be operational, free form corrosion with clean cooling fins\n- Failed or Stuck Thermostat - If the engine thermostat fails to open it will not allow the coolant/antifreeze to flow from the engine to the radiator"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3c0c83ae-b73c-4981-aa05-6cff2b388b31>","<urn:uuid:6d6eccbe-630c-4594-8711-670b693abfb4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Please explain why horses need iodine supplement in UK? ","answer":"In the UK, horses often need iodine supplements because there are inadequate amounts of iodine in forage, especially for horses working at moderate levels or in the last trimester of pregnancy. This is evidenced by hundreds of forage analyses conducted in the UK. While not all forages have too little iodine, statistically, horses receiving ad-lib forage may need additional iodine in their diet.","context":["Last Updated: | By Sarah Braithwaite, Author & Horse Health Expert\nShould you feed your horse seaweed? Is seaweed healthy for your horse? Many people allow horses free access to seaweed, others feed only a small amount or none at all. This article will give you information about why feeding seaweed to your horse should be carefully considered.\nMineral analysis of horse grass, hay and haylage reports levels of iodine in the daily diet of the horses. We can see levels which require horses to be supplemented additional iodine in the diet. In this case, where customers are needing a bespoke approach, we advise the use seaweed or kelp to top up the iodine levels in their horse‚Äôs diet. Seaweed contains good levels of iodine and is a good way of boosting iodine in horse diets. This suggestion would be part of formulating feed plans balanced to forage after testing grass, hay or haylage.\nIn general here in the UK, as evidenced by the hundreds of forage analysis we carry out, there are inadequate amounts of iodine in forage especially if the horse is starting to work at moderate level, or it is in the last trimester of pregnancy. This is why we add iodine to our range of forage focused horse feed balancers. That doesn‚Äôt mean all forages have too little iodine but it does mean that statistically, if your horse is receiving ad-lib forage, it may need a little more iodine in the diet.\nThere are many scientific analysis reports of grass, hay and haylage which show high levels of iodine contained in the grass, hay and haylage horses are eating. In this situation it would not make sense to add to this level by supplementing seaweed. This is why testing horse forage can be seen as being very useful.\nBut what about if you feed seaweed because you have been told it is a good supplement and healthy for all horses and ponies? There are a number of companies promoting the use of seaweed as a broad spectrum supplement, either on its own or mixed with linseed and magnesium. Indeed years ago, the Forageplus horses used to have 100 grams of seaweed as their broad spectrum supplement, but it wasn‚Äôt very successful.\nSome companies say feed a scoop amount, some say feed free choice. Most say be careful about feeding seaweed to pregnant mares because of the iodine content. So what should we know about seaweed? Should it be used as a broad spectrum mineral supplement? Can it be fed to pregnant and or lactating mares? How much should you feed?\nHere is what the it says in the Nutrient Requirements of Horses (Sixth Revised Edition) by the National Research Council:\nShould you feed seaweed to horses?

Learn more .....Click To Tweet\nKelp and other seaweed are sometimes fed to horses and can have concentrations as high as 1850 mg of I/kg DM (Baker and Lindsey 1968)\nSigns of deficiency or Excess\nThe classic symptom of either a severe deficiency or excess of iodine in the ration is hypothyroidism resulting in thyroid gland hypertrophy or goitre. As concentrations of iodine in the newborn foal are determined by the maternal intake (Meyer, 1996c), reproduction of the mare and health of the foal can be affected when iodine concentrations in the ration are inappropriate, even when goitre is not present in broodmares. Meyer and Klug (2001) indicated that both a deficiency and excess of iodine depressed the viability of foals and probably influenced embryonic and fatal development. In 1935, Rodenwold and Simms reported losing about 50 percent of foals born to mares receiving iodine-deficient feed stuffs with the foals showing signs of goitre. Iodine content below 0.2 mg/kg DM in the majority of feedstuffs fed to horses on a Japanese farm without supplementation resulted in seven foals showing bilateral thyroid enlargement, and four of the seven had extensive flexion of the lower fore legs (Osame and Ichijo, 1994). Still born foals, or foals born weak with difficulty standing to suckle, can result if broodmares are fed an iodine-deficient ration even when the symptom of thyroid gland enlargement is not present in the mare. Likewise, iodine-deficient mares have been reported to have abnormal oestrous cycles (Krzhova, 1968). Feedstuffs such as uncooked soybeans, cabbage, kale and mustard are known to have an anti-thyroid activity (goitrogens) that can also cause goitre ( Jackson and Pagan, 1996). Supplemental iodine is not particularly effective at inhibiting goitrogenic response, but heating these feedstuffs can inactivate the enzyme responsible for this action.\nThe maximum tolerable concentration has been set at 5 mg/kg of dietary intake (NRC 2005), though the Merck Veterinary Manual (2005) indicated iodine toxicities in mares have been reported at an intake as low as 40mg/d. Toxicities seem to be more common that deficiencies in recent years (Hintz, 1989). An iodine toxity usually results only when iodine is over supplemented or when animals are receiving feeds containing unusually high amounts of iodine such as some types of seaweed. Silvia et al. (1987) reported that excess iodine supplementation of 700 mg inorganic iodine in foals and of more than 350 mg in pregnant and actuating mares caused a high incidence of goitres in newborn, as well as causing abortions and foal mortality. Eroksuz et al. (2004) reported goitre in newborn foals whose mares had been supplemented with 299mg I/d during the last 24 weeks of pregnancy. Iatrogenic iodism and an associated alopecia were reported in a horse being treated with 90 g/d for 18 days of EDDI for dermatophilosis (Fadok and Wild, 1983). An increase in susceptibility to infectious disease may also occur with excessive dietary iodine (Barker and Lindsey. 1968)\nAs the clinical signs of an iodine deficiency or toxicity appear similar, a simple evaluation of the ration (forage analysis as well as concentrate) should reveal whether iodine concentrations are excessive or deficient and the appropriate corrections made.\nUsing data from other species, a range of 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg ration was used in the second printing of the 1989 NRC for all classes of horses. It has been proposed that a 500 kg horse at light work requires 1.75 mg iodine, 2.5 mg for light work and 2.7 to 3 mg/d for intense work (Jackson 1997), but research to support the higher requirements for work have not been substantiated. Likewise, Donoghue et al. (1990) suggested that, like in humans, requirements during the third trimester of pregnancy may be slightly increased. As feed intake increases to meet the increased caloric demand of work, daily intake of iodine would be increased if concentrations in the rations remained constant. However, insufficient iodine may be consumed when iodine intake depends on free-choice iodised salt intake. This was reported as the possible cause of iodine deficiency in some pregnant mares whose foals were born with leg abnormalities (McLaughlin and Dogie, 1981; McLauglin et al. 1986). This does not suggest that the recommended range is too low, but does reflect the limitations of depending upon the intake of one nutrient to guarantee the intake of another.\nThe average (0.35 mg I/kg DM) of the range (0.1 to 0.6 mg I/kg DM) given in the second printing of the 1989 NRC is likely a safe minimum recommendation. Asssuming a near 100 percent absorption the maintenance requirement would be 0.007 mg/kg BW (which would account of endogenous losses suggested by Wehr et al. 2002) or 0.35 mg/kg DM assuming 2 percent BW intake. Due to limited data from equine studies, this dietary concentration is used with all classes, except for the broodmare in late gestation. The increased amount allotted for humans during the final trimester of pregnancy (Donoghue et al., 1990) appears to be prudent and the dietary concentration has been set at 0.4 mg I/kg DM.\nThe average amount of elemental iodine contained in a 50 ml scoop of seaweed is approximately 40-60 mg and that maybe conservative for some seaweed products. Seaweed is a natural product so the levels of nutrients it contains will vary.\nUsing seaweed at high levels to provide a broad spectrum mineral supplement is at best highly flawed and at worst dangerous if you take the amounts commonly contained within UK forage (2-3 mg) into account. Given that the majority of iodine in the diet is likely to be supplied by forage, why then would you want to feed 40-60mg, on top of that. This is the level some suppliers of seaweed would suggest is a recommended dose.\nEven doubling the NRC minimum recommendations by 200% for insurance purposes, a 500 kg horse‚Äôs needs are going to be no more than (0.0007 mg/kg x 500) x 2 = 0.7 mg/kg DM which would make the total upper level desired, 7 mg of elemental iodine per day for a horse eating 10 kg (2% body weight) forage.\nGiven that the majority of iodine in the diet is likely to be supplied by the grass, hay or haylage a horse is eating everyday, why then would you want to feed 40-60mg, on top of that contained in forage? This is the level some suppliers of seaweed would suggest is a recommended dose.\nHowever, in a scenario where levels of iodine are either known or presumed to be slightly short, feeding a 1ml to 5 ml scoop (5 ml being the absolute maximum and uncommon and 1 ml ‚Äì 2.5 ml being a more realistic level) would be safe.\nSo do we think you can feed seaweed to horses? The answer is yes but it depends.\nWhen you look at the research and calculate the figures you are left realising that seaweed does not represent a sensible, useful or healthful way to supplement all minerals in your horses diet. However, as a way to provide safe supplementation of iodine, where levels in the total diet indicate small amounts extra are needed, then it is a great product."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:142ebbc6-2c95-4327-971c-111063a15897>"],"error":null}

This auto-PEEP is associated with increased right ventricular outflow impedance and decreased cardiac index, potentially causing hemodynamic problems.","context":["- Open Access\nLow tidal volume, high respiratory rate and auto-PEEP: the importance of the basics\nCritical Care volume 7, Article number: 105 (2003)\nRecent studies have shown that application of the ARDSNet low tidal volume strategy (i.e. allowing an increase in respiratory rate in order to minimize hypercapnia in those with low tidal volume) may generate consistent auto-PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure), and this is not efficient in improving clearance of carbon dioxide. The present commentary deals with some of the recent controversies related to use of a low tidal volume strategy, as implemented in the ARDSNet trial, which has proved successful in reducing mortality rates in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We emphasize the importance of basic physiological knowledge and sound respiratory monitoring.\n\"... the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful.\"\nA Farewell to Arms, Ernest Hemingway\nThe ARDSNet trial , which compared a low versus a high tidal volume (Vt) ventilation strategy, appears to have said the final word in the controversy surrounding the clinical relevance of ventilator-induced lung injury. That study indeed showed that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were ventilated at 6 ml/kg benefited from a 22% reduction in mortality, as compared with the group ventilated with a Vt of 12 ml/kg. As always, and in spite of these important results, some aspects of the study design and speculation regarding the mechanisms involved generated some controversial interpretations .\nOf those, a major interpretation of the ARDSNet findings pertains to the possible role of auto-PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) in causing the observed difference in mortality between low and high Vt strategies. The protocol allowed investigators to increase the respiratory rate in the low Vt group to 35 breaths/min, in order to minimize hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis ‚Äì the major side effects of low Vt ventilation. A recent study conducted by de Durante and coworkers  demonstrated that the ventilatory settings employed in the ARDSNet low Vt group may generate an auto-PEEP of 5.8 ¬± 3 cmH2O. Based upon these data, those authors suggested that in the ARDSNet study, in spite of comparable external PEEP settings, total PEEP was substantially higher in the low Vt group, because the high respiratory rate generated a substantial auto-PEEP. It is possible to speculate that the observed difference in survival was more related to the difference in total PEEP than to the difference in Vt.\nVieillard Baron and coworkers  recently investigated the effects of increasing respiratory rate from 15 to 30 breaths/min, while maintaining a constant plateau pressure (25 ‚â§ cmH2O). Those authors reported an auto-PEEP of 6.4 ¬± 2.7 cmH2O at 30 breaths/min, which was associated with an increased right ventricular outflow impedance and a decreased cardiac index. Moreover, despite the higher respiratory rate, partial carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) was not significantly different, whereas the ratio between (alveolar) dead space and Vt increased significantly. Those authors concluded that, in acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS patients, the use of higher respiratory rate at constant plateau pressure in order to increase minute ventilation is unable to improve elimination of carbon dioxide, while it generates auto-PEEP.\nWhat lesson can we derive from those studies? What should clinicians be careful about? Clearly, there should be no doubt that a ventilatory strategy based on high Vt and high plateau pressure should be avoided; years of experimental data indicate a need for a gentler ventilatory approach. However, we do not have, and probably will never have, a simple 'cookbook' for ventilatory management of patients with ALI/ARDS. Above all, the clinicians should rely on scientific knowledge, clinical expertise, monitoring and a degree of wisdom. As stated by Tobin , \"... there is no substitute for the clinician's standing by the ventilator, making necessary adjustments, and monitoring the effects of such adjustments. The treatment of patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome involves trade-offs in which improvement in one type of measure ... can lead to worsening of another.\" If a single lesson should be picked out from the many controversies in ventilatory management, then it is that respiratory mechanics should be monitored.\nDoes high respiratory rate produce intrinsic PEEP in ALI/ARDS patients? There should be no doubt as to the answer to this question. Intrinsic PEEP is a function of minute ventilation (respiratory rate and Vt), ventilatory setting (expiratory time) and the mechanical properties of the respiratory system (flow limitation when present , along with compliance and resistance, taking into account the ventilator and circuitry). Whenever the expiratory time is too short to exhale the inspired Vt, given the mechanical properties of the patient‚Äìventilator complex, auto-PEEP will occur. Higher compliance and resistance of the respiratory system, and the possible occurrence of flow limitation will favour generation of auto-PEEP. These simple principles concerning auto-PEEP are well established, and anyone involved in the ventilatory management of any kind of patient (not just ALI/ARDS patients) should be aware of them and measure auto-PEEP. Auto-PEEP may easily be assessed by a simple end-expiratory pause ‚Äì one of the easiest procedures on a ventilator. In our opinion, measurement of auto-PEEP should be part of any monitoring routine.\nShould the clinicians bother about auto-PEEP and associated haemodynamic drawbacks? Of course, the answer to this question is, again, 'yes'. However, ventilatory settings that predispose to auto-PEEP would probably derive from attempts to control some other variable, such as PCO2. As always, the final decision is a matter of clinical common sense and experience in weighing the advantages and the disadvantages of every option. The haemodynamic effects associated with auto-PEEP are well known, and the clinician should be aware of them and monitor them. In the presence of a known haemodynamic impairment, such as a decreased cardiac index (as was observed in the study by Vieillard-Baron and coworkers ), the clinician has several choices. If the priority is to limit ventilator-induced lung injury, and we persist on a low Vt strategy, then the use of a higher respiratory rate appears unavoidable if we are to maintain acceptable PCO2 and pH levels. To limit auto-PEEP, we can try to increase the expiratory time by increasing the inspiratory flow rate and decreasing the plateau time. However, a reduction in inspiratory time and in the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory time may have negative impact on oxygenation, which may not be acceptable. On the other hand, we may tolerate auto-PEEP and try to limit the haemodynamic impairment associated with auto-PEEP by directly acting on cardiac function (fluid loads, inotropes), as we often do to compensate for high levels of external PEEP. Once again, basic physiology and appropriate monitoring will lead the clinician to the wisest choice.\nShould an increased respiratory rate be used to improve clearance of carbon dioxide when using a low Vt strategy? Vieillard-Baron and coworkers  stated that increasing the respiratory rate is not an efficient strategy for improving carbon dioxide clearance. This is true if a low Vt/high respiratory rate strategy is compared with a higher Vt/lower respiratory rate at comparable minute ventilation (physiology tells us that the dead space : minute ventilation ratio will rise, decreasing the efficiency of the system). However, the important issue is not to compare two different strategies of carbon dioxide clearance, but to recognize that, once we have selected a low Vt strategy, an increased respiratory rate is the simplest way to maintain adequate PCO2 and pH levels.\nIn conclusion, in order to survive the numerous discussions and ideas on how patients with ALI/ARDS should be managed, the clinician should always count on basic physiology, which has taught us almost all of the major principles that we need. Every so often some of these principles are rediscovered, and this strengthens their role. After all, it is no bad thing to go back and periodically refresh our understanding of basic physiology. Appropriate monitoring will provide us with the necessary information to appreciate ongoing events and to take the best decision.\nacute lung injury\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\npartial carbon dioxide tension\npositive end-expiratory pressure\nThe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network: Ventilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with traditional tidal volumes for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

{"question":"What are the key biological processes regulated by the interaction between endothelin receptor type B and endothelins?","answer":"The interaction between endothelin receptor type B and endothelins regulates several critical biological processes, including the development and function of blood vessels, the production of certain hormones, and the stimulation of cell growth and division.","context":["About Site Map Contact Us\n|A service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine¬Æ|\nOn this page:\nReviewed August 2012\nWhat is the official name of the EDNRB gene?\nThe official name of this gene is ‚Äúendothelin receptor type B.‚Äù\nEDNRB is the gene's official symbol. The EDNRB gene is also known by other names, listed below.\nRead more about gene names and symbols on the About page.\nWhat is the normal function of the EDNRB gene?\nThe EDNRB gene provides instructions for making a protein called endothelin receptor type B. This protein is located on the surface of cells and functions as a signaling mechanism, transmitting information from outside the cell to inside the cell. The receptor interacts with proteins called endothelins to regulate several critical biological processes, including the development and function of blood vessels, the production of certain hormones, and the stimulation of cell growth and division.\nEndothelin 3 (produced from the EDN3 gene) is one of the proteins that interacts with endothelin receptor type B. During early development before birth (embryonic development), endothelin 3 and endothelin receptor type B together play an important role in neural crest cells. These cells migrate from the developing spinal cord to specific regions in the embryo, where they give rise to many different types of cells. In particular, endothelin 3 and its receptor are essential for the normal formation of nerves in the intestine (enteric nerves) and melanocytes. Melanocytes are cells that produce melanin, a pigment that contributes to skin, hair, and eye color. Melanin is also involved in the normal function of the inner ear.\nDoes the EDNRB gene share characteristics with other genes?\nThe EDNRB gene belongs to a family of genes called GPCR (G protein-coupled receptors).\nA gene family is a group of genes that share important characteristics. Classifying individual genes into families helps researchers describe how genes are related to each other.

{"question":"What was the highest score achieved by Jonas von Essen in the 2012 World Memory Championship, specifically for binary digits memorized in 30 minutes?","answer":"Jonas von Essen memorized 3,841 binary digits in half an hour during the World Memory Championship.","context":["The bizarre scenarios that helped turn Swede Jonas von Essen into the world memory champion\nIt‚Äôs a summer‚Äôs day and a cool breeze is blowing across Gothenburg‚Äôs Liseberg amusement park. By the iconic wooden rollercoaster, Dolly Parton is juggling laser swords, while just down the walkway Sherlock Holmes is licking a puddle of vomit. Beside the botanical gardens, a giant fish is transforming itself into a gun, while nearby Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá is eating a toilet.\nThese may sound like the imaginings of a madman, but they are the images Swede Jonas von Essen used to win the World Memory Championship last December. The 22-year-old from Gothenburg, who is studying to be a maths teacher, beat the German world number one Johannes Mallow (aka ‚ÄúThe Human Hard Disk‚Äù) over three days of events, ranging from remembering random lists of words to matching names and faces, and memorising as many numbers in an hour as possible. In becoming champion, von Essen achieved the competition‚Äôs highest ever score.\nAmong other feats, von Essen memorised more than 24 decks of cards in an hour, and recalled 3,841 binary digits in half an hour ‚Äì helped by Dolly, Sherlock, Zlatan and co. ‚ÄúI want the images to be memorable, but also to have some meaning,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúFor example, I imagine that Zlatan is sponsored by a toilet company, and that they‚Äôve sent him a toilet cake he has to eat; or the fish is turning into a gun to get revenge on the fishermen who killed his friends.‚Äù\nSo what exactly is going on in von Essen‚Äôs head?\nAlmost all memory competitors use a technique called the Method of Loci, or Memory Palace technique, a system that was developed 2,500 years ago by the Greek poet Simonides, who is said to have first used the technique to identify the guests killed when the roof fell in at a banquet he was attending. As explained by Joshua Foer in Moonwalking with Einstein, his brilliantly entertaining book about ‚Äúmemory athletes‚Äù, the Memory Palace is a building or physical space that you walk through in your mind, placing images that relate to the things you have to memorise.\nFor von Essen‚Äôs 3,841 binary digits, he used seven memory palaces, including Liseberg amusement park, his cousin‚Äôs house and the Gothenburg Book Fair. As he walked through, he would place different scenarios in order through the memory palaces, which represent 18 binary digits each, converted into decimal. Zlatan is number 16 (001 and 110 in binary), eating is number 45, and a toilet is number 08 ‚Äì so Zlatan eating a toilet stands for 164508 (or 001110100101001000).\nAll memory competitors (read Foer‚Äôs book to hear about the weird and wonderful characters involved) insist that anyone can learn this technique, an idea borne out by a 2002 study at University College London (UCL) that showed memory champions are made, not born. ‚ÄúMy memory was nothing special, and it still isn‚Äôt,‚Äù says von Essen, who says he routinely forgets his keys and even doctors‚Äô appointments.\nVon Esssen only started learning the techniques two years ago, after seeing a book in the library, Memo by Norwegian Oddbj√∏rn By. ‚ÄúI guess the difference between me and a lot of people is that I didn‚Äôt just read the book, I really tried to use it. If you go to memory competitions, you get this amazing range of very different people, but I think what they share is a certain curiosity.‚Äù\nVon Essen improved fast. ‚ÄúOnce I realised, ‚ÄòHey I can do this,‚Äô my goal was to become the Swedish champion. When I started beating most of the Swedish records, it dawned on me that I was becoming one of the best in the world.‚Äù\nBut a key question is whether a good memory is even a benefit in these post-Google days. Foer argues that, with the inventions of the alphabet, printing presses, cameras and finally computers, it‚Äôs become gradually easier for humans to externalise memories, to the point where it seems we don‚Äôt need them any more. In a TEDTalk, he described it as ‚Äúoutsourcing our memories to technology‚Äù.\nParticularly in the Western world, education has moved away from memory ‚Äì in a time when students take exams with spell-checks, calculators and often reference books, learning by rote has become old-fashioned.\nWhile not endorsing a return to rote-learning, Foer argues that everyone can benefit from memory training, and that it fires rather than hinders the imagination ‚Äì something von Essen agrees with.\n‚ÄúThe internet is making us more stupid,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbecause the information is being stored outside of our minds. If you really want to use information, it‚Äôs vital to actually get it in your brain, where it comes alive. It‚Äôs the mash-up in your head that‚Äôs interesting, and which allows you to come up with new thoughts and new ideas.‚Äù\nIn more practical terms, von Essen says he has become more confident ‚Äì he can remember peoples‚Äô names, and knows what he has to say in interviews for jobs or with inflight magazines. ‚ÄúLearning memory techniques has made my mind more effective,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to separate the bits of information in your head and to find the things that you want.‚Äù\nIt has also taught him to open his eyes ‚Äì on most holidays, he‚Äôll remember things and use them as potential memory palaces, whether hotel rooms or walks through the city. He has one, from a trip to London, that goes through Buckingham Palace, into the palace gardens and past souvenir shops on the way to Victoria station. He admits, though, that his memory places aren‚Äôt always 100 per cent accurate ‚Äì ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôll go back to the real place and it‚Äôll look quite different.‚Äù\nEither way, what he‚Äôs doing when he remembers makes him look less like a human calculator, and more like someone who‚Äôs learned to develop his imagination. That 2002 UCL study took 10 memory champions and 10 people with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù memories, and found that the former group had no superior intellectual capabilities ‚Äì what they did find, however, was that the champions had taught themselves to use parts of their brain more effectively, especially the area of the hippocampus used for spatial navigation. The same researchers found similar results in London taxi drivers, who have to remember every road in London, and the fastest route between any two destinations.\nThe taxi drivers learn to see spaces and roads as living entities, packed with associations ‚Äì they seem to assign the roads with meanings and then process them, just like Jonas von Essen does when he imagines that Sherlock Holmes is tasting a puddle of vomit to figure out who puked (number 640242, in case you were wondering).\nBecause, let‚Äôs face it, 164508 is quite hard to remember; and the image of Sweden‚Äôs greatest footballer chowing down on a toilet is quite hard to forget. Jonas von Essen‚Äôs no genius, he‚Äôs merely learned a way to let his mind do its own thing."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:04eb48f1-5642-4eb2-8d44-31c6ce72525d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the business model of street photography galleries like drkrm compare to Tish Murtha's documentary photography career in terms of financial sustainability?","answer":"While both deal with documentary and street photography, they faced different financial challenges. Tish Murtha struggled to make a living from photography and lived in poverty until her death at 56, despite her talent and early acclaim. Similarly, drkrm gallery owner John Matkowsky acknowledges that 'traditionally, you can't make money showing photojournalistic work' as many people don't want aggressive, raw black and white realism. However, drkrm manages to survive through a combination of collectors who appreciate this style, operating as a fine art black and white printing lab, and offering workshops in historic photographic processes, allowing them to 'balance commerce with art' despite the challenges.","context":["I‚Äôve heard people ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of street or documentary photography, as surely you‚Äôre simply taking a photo of what‚Äôs in front of you?‚Äù It feels like a clear cut case of the answer being in the question. What‚Äôs in front of you is a snapshot of real life, as it is at that exact moment in time, never has been before and never will be again, not exactly. I think often that this style of photography really comes into its own over time, when you can look back at an image and see a similar scene in your memories, when it reminds you of the social, economic and even fashion differences between contrasting groups, and when its accuracy makes you smile.\nThe most effective social documentary imagery comes when the subjects are comfortable with the photographer and the pictures are natural rather than posed. With a keen eye through the lens and an obvious respect for her community, Tish Murtha leaves a beautiful legacy in her pictures documenting the highs and lows of her north-east working class neighbourhood.\nHer daughter, Ella, has taken on the task of ensuring that Tish‚Äôs work gets the recognition it absolutely deserves, and is working with producer Jen Corcoran and director Paul Sng on TISH, a feature length documentary celebrating her work. A Kickstarter campaign for this has just launched with a view to production starting in April; the trailer below will give you an idea of how good this promises to be.\nThe Kickstarter link is here with details of rewards available including tote bags, premiere tickets and limited edition Tish Murtha photo prints and illustrations. There is more information from the press release below.\nKICKSTARTER LAUNCHED FOR DOCUMENTARY CELEBRATING PHOTOGRAPHER TISH MURTHA\n‚ÄòBritish photographer Tish Murtha‚Äôs images of those on the margins of society challenged and documented the inequality faced by working-class communities, and in equal measures celebrated what it means to be working-class. Unlike many social documentary photographers, Tish was from the same streets as the people she photographed, lending a poignant intimacy to her stark yet tender black and white images. However, despite early acclaim for her work and undeniable talent, she struggled to make a living from photography and lived in poverty until her death at the age of 56.\nTish‚Äôs brilliant eye, unswerving ethics and constant empathy are present in her photographs, yet little is known of the artist herself. In this new feature documentary, Ella sets out to uncover why her mother‚Äôs work wasn‚Äôt fully appreciated in her lifetime, through unseen archive materials, personal notebooks, correspondence, and interviews with the people who knew her. By digging into the past, will Ella come to terms with her own grief at her mother‚Äôs passing?\nElla, who also runs the Tish Murtha Archive, says, ‚ÄúWe are living through incredibly divided times, where working-class people have been manipulated, just like the class warfare that my mam warned about in the essay for her exhibition Youth Unemployment. There has never been a more relevant time to go back, meet the people from these photos and really try to understand how their generation were exploited and devalued. I want to make an honest, celebratory film about my mam and her life, and hope it will be moving, tender and also uplifting. I‚Äôd like people to know who Tish Murtha was and for her character to jump out of the screen the way her photos do. She was an incredible woman: determined, kind and fierce, but also incredibly sensitive. She had to learn to be tough from a very young age and fight for everything; she was extremely principled, always stood up to bullies and was frequently labelled ‚Äòdifficult‚Äô. But Tish was a beautiful, simple soul and I wouldn‚Äôt want to come from any other womb.‚Äù\nTISH will be produced by Jen Corcoran through her Teesside-based company Freya Films and Paul Sng‚Äôs Velvet Joy Productions.‚Äô\nPlease, if you are able, consider contributing to this project or sharing the link.

The drkrm gallery specializes in documentary and photo-journalistic work, cutting edge and alternative photographic processes and the display and survey of popular cultural images both current or historic.\nFor the past 6 years drkrm has presented a superb and continuous array of exceptional exhibits, specializing in more under-the-radar, counterculture presentations. drkrm.\nI caught up with John to talk to him about the galleries new exhibit and new location in China Town.\n1) Tell us about drkrm‚Äôs new Art Shay Retrospective and why this is an important exhibit for the gallery.\nArt Shay is 90. His photography career spans nearly seven decades. He has published over 30,000 photographs in his life, which include the likes of kings, queens, presidents, athletes and celebrities as well as the common man. He became a full-time photojournalist in the early fifties shooting regularly for Time, Life, Fortune, Sports Illustrated and the New York Times Magazine, among others. Many of his images are in the National Portrait Gallery. What makes this exhibition important for drkrm is that this is the first time any of these images will be exhibited in Los Angeles, marking Art Shay‚Äôs West Coast debut.\n2) Explain drkrm‚Äôs mission statement and your background in photography.\nWhat started out as a fine art black & white photography lab has evolved into a exhibition space dedicated to the display and survey of popular cultural images (current or historic), fine art photography, documentary and photo journalism, and cutting edge and alternative photographic processes. I feel I specialize in under-the-radar, counterculture presentations. My 25-year background as a Master Printer started with mentor Tom Consilvio, who taught me the finesse of the fine artistic print. Through the years I have worked on the images of Gary Winogrand, William Claxton, Phil Stern and many other renowned artists such as Horace Bristol, Jo Ann Callis, Catherine Opie, Edward S. Curtis and, most recently, Ansel Adams. drkrm‚Äôs black & white lab is still dedicated to the highest quality of hand processing and fine printing, specializing in traditional, silver-gelatin printing and film processing nearly lost in today‚Äôs digital age.\n3) drkrm has moved premises a few times in recent years; has each move been for political, artistic or financial reasons or all three?\nWe are starting out in our third space in eight years. Each past location has had advantages and disadvantages: artistic, financial and political. Our new location on Chung King Road in LA‚Äôs historic Chinatown puts us in the middle of a thriving art scene and combines the best of all the other locations under one roof. We are surrounded by major, important galleries such as theCharlie James Gallery, Matt Gleason‚Äôs Coagula Curatorial, and Jancar Gallery. In addition, the space we are now occupying was once China Arts Objects Gallery, the first gallery in Chinatown.\n4) How do you like your new location in China Town?\nWe are new here and everyone is friendly and supportive. I think we will be here for awhile.\n5) drkrm is one of the very few west coast photography galleries which showcases black and white, as well as underground and alternative lifestyles work, which I feel puts it up there with galleries in New York, London, Paris, Berlin and Prague, etc. Money and audience obviously an issue and LA is certainly more preoccupied with Hollywood show business but is that the only reason why there are so few art and photojournalism photography galleries in Los Angeles?\nTraditionally, you can‚Äôt make money showing photojournalistic work. Many people don‚Äôt want the aggressive, raw, b&w in your face realism that some of the pictures express. However, I do have a number of collectors who do, so we manage to make sales. I think this type of gallery and work would do much better in Europe or even in New York. At least critically. Trying to balance commerce with art is always tough. But I show what I think needs/warrants/begs to be shown. Because that‚Äôs what drkrm is all about. Also, because a lot of the work I like is from the 1970‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs and tends to be shot on TRI-X.\n6) I see that drkrm is receiving more international press in the last year, why do you think this is?\ndrkrm has been exhibiting some pretty fantastic stuff. People are taking notice, especially in Europe.\n7) What do you look for in a photographers‚Äô work to exhibit at drkrm?\nThe most important thing in an artist‚Äôs work is how it affects me. Does it make me feel‚Ä¶ something. Basically I show what I like. However, in the back of my mind I think, can I sell this? Again, art is subjective and I suppose I have some lofty idea that I know what great art is, but, somehow, it has to feel important to me. I have curated pictures of transvestite whores on the night-time streets of Mexico City to the surprisingly nostalgic street photography of Ansel Adams.\n8) How has drkrm evolved in the last few years and what new things can we expect at the new location in 2013?\nFor the last 8 years, drkrm has stayed true to its program, curating photo-journalistic exhibitions. We are now offering workshops in Historic photographic processes such as Wet plate Collodion,cyanotypes and Platinum as well as photography and lighting workshops featuring some major artists in photography today. We are trying to keep the dream of film alive.\n9) Which photographers and galleries inspire you?\nI am inspired by the work of Diane Arbus, Joel Peter Witkin, Larry Clark and Ralph Eugene Meatyard.\nPeter Fetterman and David Fahey are two gallerists I greatly respect and admire.\n10) Until very recently there seemed to be an annual news report proclaiming the death of photography. Recent digital has really changed things around and photography is as big now as it has ever been and the divide between professional and amateur is very blurred. Is it increasingly difficult to exhibit work produced from a pre-digital age and to convey the difficulties of that process to a contemporary crowd?\nYes, it is difficult. Though occasional aficionados of the process still seek out the old, classic ways of film, unfortunately, almost everyone now thinks what is on the wall is digital. They are not used to seeing silver gelatin prints, which have a have a well known and regarded archival history. In my experience, if a collector has a choice between a digital print or a Silver print of the same image, they usually opt for the Silver print. Even some museums are showing digital prints of classic photography as opposed to vintage prints. I recently saw some photographic images from Thomas Eakins at a local museum that were digital copies.\n11) Let‚Äôs bring it back round to your new exhibit on March 2nd and Art Shay. Which image in this retrospective really speaks volumes, not only of Shay‚Äôs work but photography and the exhibit at drkrm?\nThere are far too many images in the Art Shay Retrospective to have one shot speak the loudest, but one of my favorites is this somewhat famous shot from the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago where police violently confronted demonstrators. It is of the marque of the Hilton Hotel that proclaims ‚ÄúWelcome Democrats.‚Äù Arrayed under the sign is a sidewalk corps of a dozen bayonet-lofting Guardsmen. Powerful stuff.\nArt Shay has seen it all.\nInterview by Ginger Liu\nArt Shay ‚Äì a retrospective runs from March 2 ‚Äì April 6.\nThe opening reception is on March 2, 7-10pm."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f083d136-5fbb-46a5-bc77-a76a78fd0c58>","<urn:uuid:94a081d0-693d-4671-a137-3baeddbb5849>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How old are the gullies discovered by Mars Global Surveyor, and why is this significant?","answer":"The gullies spotted by Mars Global Surveyor are estimated to be only a few million years old. This age is significant because during this time period, the Martian atmosphere has been too cold and thin to support liquid water flow, which challenges earlier theories that suggested these gullies were formed by water erosion.","context":["In 1999, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft sent back some extraordinary images of the surface of the Red Planet. They showed gullies that had been carved into Martian hillsides in the mid-latitudes of the planet.\nThe same sort of gullies form on Earth and here their existence is the result of water erosion. Various planetary geologists immediately suggested that a similar process must be at work on Mars. Their thinking was that some fluid must be responsible.\nThat‚Äôs an exciting idea but one that is fraught with problems. Recent evidence from Mars rovers suggest that liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars but way back in the planet‚Äôs past. By contrast, the gullies spotted by the Global Surveyor are probably only a few million years old and over this timescale, the Martian atmosphere has been too cold and thin for liquid water.\nTo counter this, the geologists say that some other heating mechanism could cause liquid water to flow from an underground aquifer. But the gullies look to be the result of repeated flows so if this explanation is correct, there has to be a mechanism that refills the aquifers. On Earth, that mechanism is rain. On Mars, such a mechanism is patently absent.\nThere is another possibility, however. Perhaps the gullies are caused by the flow of sand and dust. Similar gullies are known to occur on dunes on Earth but only when the angle of the hillside is above some critical threshold. The trouble with Martian gullies is that most of the hillsides are not steep enough for this process to occur.\nToday, Yolanda Cedillo-Flores and H√©ctor Javier Durand-Manterola at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico suggest a solution to this conundrum. Their idea is that the gullies are formed when carbon dioxide in the ground sublimates, causing the sand to become fluidised.\nThis solves a number of problems. For a start, it allows the sand to flow on hillsides that are much less shallow than the critical threshold. It also explains how the gullies form by the action of repeated flows over long periods of time. Their idea is that carbon dioxide is deposited on the ground during cold periods and covered with windblown dust. The carbon dioxide then sublimates during warmer periods, causing the sand to flow downhill.\nThis theory also explains why the gullies form mainly at mid-latitudes and not at the equator or the poles. At the poles, it rarely gets warm enough to regularly heat sand-covered carbon dioxide and at the equator it is too warm for it to form. So the mid-latitudes are the best places for gullies to form.\nCedillo-Flores and Durand-Manterola attempt to seal the deal by recreate in their lab the conditions for martian gully formation by injecting air into a bed of sand. Sure enough, this process leads to the formation of martian-like gullies at angles well below the critical threshold (see picture above).\nThere are some important difference between the experimental gullies and the ones that form on Mars, such as their length. But the researchers say that this can be explained by the difference between the way air is injected into sand and the way carbon dioxide sublimates.\nBest of all, the new theory requires no special hypotheses about the Red Planet. ‚ÄúOur model does not require exotic conditions; only the ones found at present on Mars,‚Äù say Cedillo-Flores and Durand-Manterola.\nThat‚Äôs a convincing explanation for the formation of martian gullies. And it will be a substantial blow to those looking for evidence of liquid water on the surface of Mars (and the possibility of life it suggests).\nWater may still be present on Mars but it is looking increasingly clear that there are better places in the Solar System for astrobiologists to focus their attention.\nRef: arxiv.org/abs/1004.5417: Martian Gullies: Produced By Fluidization Of Dry Material\nIt will soon be easy for self-driving cars to hide in plain sight.

{"question":"What's the key difference between growing morels vs shiitake mushrooms in terms of cultivation success rate and time to harvest?","answer":"Growing morels is significantly more challenging and time-consuming compared to shiitake mushrooms. Morels may take several years before producing any actual mushrooms and the process has baffled both amateur and professional mycologists for years. In contrast, shiitakes are described as relatively easy to grow, with harvests possible within 6-9 months after log inoculation when proper conditions are maintained.","context":["To know how to grow morel mushrooms properly, you must first know the different ways of growing morel mushrooms.\nThe process of growing morel mushrooms has baffled amateur and professional mycologists for years.\nIn the past, we talked about the yummy and weird morel, growing your own is certainly possible (if you follow our guide closely).\nNOTE: These are hard mushrooms to cultivate, and it may take years before you see results.\nReading through the other morel pages on this site before you start will help you better understand their life cycle.\nBelow are a few different methods of growing morels, ranging from the simplest techniques to the more difficult. I‚Äôve added the grow kit and mushroom approach, the spore slurry process, and a few other methods.\nWith a little experimentation you can make one of these work for you!\nHow to Grow Morel Mushrooms at Home or Elsewhere\nThe Grow Kit and Spawn Method\nOne of the most well known ways of growing morel mushrooms is with purchased spawn.\nMushroom spawn is simply the mycelium, or ‚Äúvegetative growth‚Äù of the mushroom, and the material on which it was grown. Spawn can come in the form woodchips, of grain (such as rye berries), sawdust, etc.\nThis mycelium-infused material is then used to inoculate bigger batches of substrate to create a mushroom bed.\nThe simplest way to get spawn is by purchasing a morel mushroom kit, which you can do online. Your kit will arrive with some type of spores or spawn, and instructions on how to plant them.\nFollow the instructions that comes with your kit. Regardless of the company you purchase from, most will inform you on what to do with some variation of these similar steps:\nPrepare your morel bed:\n- To create morel mushroom growing conditions, the site can be made between the summer and fall in a climate where there is an actual change of seasons. Morel mushrooms kits don‚Äôt perform well in tropical environments with no real spring or winter.\n- Pick a shady spot and measure the dimensions. Most kits seem to be enough for a 4-foot by 4-foot square.\n- Prepare the soil. You want a sandy soil mix with adequate drainage, not too much rock or clay. A sandy soil with some peat moss and gypsium mixed in seems to work well.\n- Add some ashes from buried wood to your soil. Morels are known to spring up after forest fires, and ashes add nutrients and mimic a post-forest fire habitat.\nPlant your spawn:\n- The next step on growing morels is mixing your morel spores/spawn in the prepared bed according to the instructions. This isn‚Äôt complicated, and usually just involves spreading it through the top layer.\n- Mix some hardwood chips on top of the spawn bed. Morels grow near old apple, elm, ash, and tulip trees so use chips from one of these trees (preferably elm or ash).\n- The worst part! Although the mycelium is a fast colonizer, it may take a several years before it produces any actual mushrooms. Growing morel mushrooms is not a hobby for the impatient.\nThat‚Äôs right, a few years. Don‚Äôt get discouraged if nothing happens the following spring. Keep the area moist and nutritious according to your kit instructions. With some luck and the right conditions, you may someday have morels in your backyard!\nThe Spore Slurry Method\nIf you‚Äôre an experienced mushroom hunter and don‚Äôt want to buy a kit, you may have some success growing morel mushrooms by using the spore slurry method.\nA spore slurry is simply a solution of water, some salt, a form of sugar, and spores. The spores are suspended in the water and used to inoculate an indoor habitat.\nTo create this solution you‚Äôll need some wild morels. They should be mature, although not rotting or mushy. A few mushrooms per gallon of water will be sufficient.\nFollow these easy steps:\n- Begin with some clean, non-chlorinated water in a food-safe container.\n- Add a pinch of salt and about a tablespoon of molasses to the water and stir. You don‚Äôt need much of each. The salt is to prevent bacterial growth; the molasses is to provide sugars for germinating spores.\n- Add mushrooms and let the mixture sit covered for 1 to 2 days in a temperate place. Any longer than that and you risk bacterial contamination.\nAfter you strain and remove the mushrooms you‚Äôll have a liquid with millions of spores!\nThis spore liquid can then be spread over a prepared bed as described above (sandy soil with peat moss, ashes, and wood chips).\nIt can also be spread in other known morel habutats, such as at the base of dying elm trees. Feel free to experiment with your slurries.\nThis process is easy, but the downside is that it can be unreliable. A spore slurry is not as far along in the life cycle as mycelia in spawn, so the odds of success aren‚Äôt as good.\nHowever this is one of the cheapest and easiest ways of growing morel mushrooms indoors, so why not give it a try?\nThis method can work with other types of mushrooms too!\nOther Methods for Growing Morel Mushrooms\nBecause morels often grow near certain trees, it would be smart to inoculate the roots of these trees with morel mycelia which may result in mushroom production.\nThe simplest way to do this is by broadcasting spores using the slurry method described above near the base of a tree (ash or elm). Other ways involve nurturing a young tree by either:\n- ‚ÄúInfecting‚Äù the roots of a young tree with mushroom spawn. You‚Äôll need a very young elm, ash, or apple tree and some spawn from a morel mushroom kit. Plant the spawn and tree together, with the spawn strewn throughout the tree roots. Care for it as you would any young tree of the species you chose.\n- Purchasing inoculated trees. You can purchase baby trees that have been inoculated with morel spores/mycelia online. These will come with instructions for care, and if you follow them carefully you may be growing morel mushrooms within a few years.\nIndoor Morel Cultivation:\nGrowing morels indoor has been thought not to be possible for many years until now.\nDon‚Äôt think you have it in you to nurture a young tree? You can always try the last, and most difficult, method mentioned on this page: growing morel mushrooms indoors.\nFor years this technique was thought impossible. Many tried and failed to cultivate morels indoors.\nIt was only until in 1982taht Ronald D. Ower reported success. Ower was eventually awarded a patent along James Malachowki and Gary Mills. Their work paved the way for indoor morel cultivation.\nMills proceeded to create a company involved in large-scale cultivation, which you can read more about in this article by Michigan State University news.\nSo yes, it is possible to grow them indoors, however unlikely. The process is quite similar to other types of mushroom cultivation:\n- The growth of morel mycelia from spores or a small piece of mushroom on a nutritious agar media.\n- Sterile transfer of mycelia from agar to a spawn jar, which is a sterilized jar of rye seed or some other grain. The mycelia will colonize these jars in about a month or two. You‚Äôll be able to see lumps of sclerotia forming.\n- Transfer of sclerotia from grain spawn to a special substrate of woody chips and sandy. These will eventually fruit into mushrooms under specially controlled environmental conditions and some good luck.\nOkay, so the above directions on how to grow morel mushrooms sounds simpler than they actually are. Although I‚Äôve cultivated mushrooms indoors, I‚Äôve never tried with morels, so to go into detail would be just me plagiarizing someone else‚Äôs work.\nUPDATE: Thanks to the anonymous visitor who sent me Peter Dilley‚Äôs Grow Morels instructions. I‚Äôd highly recommend visiting his page if you want more info on indoor growing.\nFor more information on growing morel mushrooms indoors I‚Äôd recommend reading Paul Stamets‚Äô Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms.\nSo there‚Äôs your introduction on how to grow morel mushrooms. Start out with one of the easier methods but don‚Äôt limit yourself, instead get creative and experiment. Many advances in mycology were made by accident.\nRemember that your main goal is to create a habitat conducive to your particular mushroom. Although not always easy with morels, it‚Äôs not as impossible as once thought.\nThe key is to Learn, experiment, be patient, and above all have fun! You‚Äôll be glad you did when in a few years you‚Äôre picking morels straight from your backyard.\nHow to Grow Morels in Your Yard\nHow to Propagate Morel Mushrooms\nThe morel mushroom (Morchella), an expensive delicacy resembling a tiny sea sponge. Naturally, it only appears for only a few months in spring on woodland hillsides; hunting them requires persistence and skill. After success with less-demanding relatives, such as the common button (Agaricus) mushroom, you might be tempted to try raising the more sophisticated morel.\nPropagating morels involve a two-step process; cultivating mycelia scerotia from spores and fruiting from spawn. Lacking an autoclave, sealed growing room, and a laminar flow hood, you might want to buy a prepared spawn. Propagate morels from spawn in a special mushroom patch.\nThe first step will be to hang a morel mushroom upside down over a glass petri dish containing a layer of agar, a gel-like substance containing a powdered algae and protein that serves as a nutrient base. Tap the mushroom to dislodge spores into the agar and cover the dish with a glass lid to protect the culture against stray air-borne fungi.\nNext, divide the white mycelium strands that grow in the medium with a knife after a few days to a week when they grow thick.\nInoculate moist grain such as rice or annual rye grass in sterile trays by adding slices of the mycelia and allowing the grain to stand for 24 hours.\nLast for this section, mix five parts of grain with one part of sterile potting soil in a sterile canning jar and place in a cool, dark place for one month or more until rumpled little mycelia scerotia begin to form in the jars. The scerotia and medium comprise the spawn.\nThe steps are next on how to grow morels in your yard.\nLook for a shady area up to 20 square feet for your mushroom patch ‚Äî under oak, elm, apple, ash, or maple trees provide morels with their preferred tree root hosts. Cultivate the soil deeply to at least 6 inches and turn to a depth of 6 to 12 inches if possible.\nDig wood ashes and compost into the mushroom patch. Morels thrive after forest fires, so if you have a corner of the yard where past owners burned brush and leaves, use it.\nOtherwise, use ashes or charcoal from a wood-burning fireplace. Work the soul until it is fine and loamy while making sure there is good circulation of air.\nNow, your soil is balanced for morel growing. Hobbyists recommend adding apple pomice (leftover pulp and skins from cider-making), apple sauce or activated charcoal to make your patch conducive to morel growth. Adjust soil pH to between 7.1 and 7.3 using garden lime and sphagnum peat moss in percentages appropriate for your soil.\nScatter mushroom spawn over the patch in late fall. Use spawn at a rate of 1 gallon per 20 square feet of patch. Turn the soil to work the spawn in.\nTurn in 1 cup of compost for every 2 square feet of mushroom patch weekly. Add burned wood as it is available, too. Do this until 30 to 40 days before morels begin to fruit in your area ‚Äî for instance, in central California, stop cultivating in mid-January.\nAllow twigs, leaves, and other organic debris to remain on the surface to shelter the fruiting mushrooms.\nThings You Will Need\n- Recently harvested morel mushrooms or commercially available spawn\n- Grain host\n- Sterile potting soil\n- Sterile jars and lids\n- Shovel and cultivating tools\n- Agar medium in covered petri dishes\n- Sterile knives\n- Sterilized aluminum pans\n- Charcoal or burned wood\n- Garden lime\nFot more supply list for Mush, Check out Mel‚Äôs updated list of Mushroom growing supplies list\n- Keep the spawn in the refrigerator until it is time for usage.\n- Producing spawn requires specialized equipment; commercially prepared spawn improves odds of successful fruiting.\n- Morels fruit commonly from March through May. The temperamental morel may take up to 2 years to fruit.\n- Morels demand a lot of time, attention and care. Morel kits are available for the determined hobbyist.\n- Agar dishes and other equipment are available from mushroom grower and scientific suppliers.\n- If you decide to produce your own spawn, everything ‚Äî dishes, media and equipment ‚Äî must be sterilized to keep other fungi from growing and overwhelming the delicate Morchella.\nNow that you know how to grow morel mushrooms at home and how to grow morels in your yard, remember to share this post with friends and family.","The Chinese people have been using shiitake mushrooms as a nutritional and medicinal food for over 6,000 years. One of the most well-known of the edible mushroom, shiitakes, have recently been discovered by the health food movement around the world and are considered to be one of the top superfoods most widely available. Instead of paying a premium price for shiitakes at your local health food store, however, shiitakes are relatively easy to grow and one of the easiest ways to get the nutritional and medicinal benefits your body needs.\nWhat are Shiitake Mushrooms?\nHippocrates was a Greek philosopher and writer most famous for advising humanity to ‚Äúlet food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food‚Äù. Whereas our western society has separated food from medicine, the ancient Greeks, and several other cultures around the world, understood that the wide variety of foods available to us around the world could indeed provide all the needed nutrition and medicinal needs for our human bodies.\nShiitake mushrooms are native to East Asia and grow on the decaying wood of many types of deciduous trees. Like other mushrooms, the shiitake serves a unique purpose in forest ecosystems by helping to break down the lignin found in the wood of trees. Whereas other soil organisms can effectively break down leaves and other organic matter, it is the mushrooms that get the decomposition process started on fallen trees and limbs through breaking down the lignin so that the nutrients can be accessed by other soil organisms.\nIf it weren‚Äôt for the work of mushrooms in the forest, fallen trees and limbs would simply sit on the forest floor and not decompose into the rich humus that characterizes the forest soil. Fungi, then, are a fundamentally essential element to the overall health of a number of important ecosystems around the world.\nShiitake mushrooms are unique in that, apart from serving as an essential part of ecosystems, they also offer fantastic nutritional benefits to us humans. Shiitakes can be eaten fresh or dried and are one of the main ingredients in different Asian dishes such as miso soup.\nShiitake mushrooms were reportedly first cultivated in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty of China. As their popularity has grown, however, shiitake spores are widely available in most parts of the world and can be grown almost anywhere that an abundance of deciduous wood is available and where there are humid conditions.\nHow do Mushrooms Grow?\nMushrooms aren‚Äôt actually plants, but rather exist in their own kingdom. Many researchers believe that mushrooms are actually more closely related to animals than plants due to their innate behaviors.\nMushrooms, like the shiitake, grow extremely large network of a root-like system underneath the soil. These thin filaments are called hyphae and are the main mode of vegetative growth of mushrooms. The mushrooms that appear above ground are actually the ‚Äúfruits‚Äù of the mushroom that only appear once the mushroom has grown enough hyphae underground.\nIf you have ever picked up a handful of rich humus from the forest floor, chances are that you have seen a number of white, stringy threads or fibers. These are the hyphae that colonize the forest floor and, as we mentioned above, are a fundamental part of the soil ecosystem.\nThe mushroom heads or fruits that appear above ground release spores that act like seeds. Once the mushroom head matures, it releases millions of microscopic spores into the environment where more hyphae are eventually born. Mushroom enthusiasts often make beautifully artistic mushroom spore prints through collecting mushrooms before they release their spores and collecting the spore drop on a piece of paper.\nDifferent Ways to Inoculate Logs\nWhile you can try and grow your own shiitake mushrooms from spores that you collect from other shiitakes that are growing, it is far easier to simply purchase shiitake spores through commercially available shiitake spawn.\nMushroom spawn is simply any substance that has been inoculated with a certain type of mushroom mycelium. If the spores are the seeds of a mushroom, spawn resembles the small starter plants that you purchase from the hardware store to get your garden going. By purchasing shiitake spawn from a reputable mushroom grower, you will make sure that when you inoculate your logs where your mushrooms will grow, you will only have one type of mushroom seed.\nThere are a number of companies that specialize in growing their own shiitake spawn, and the most commonly available type of spawn is dowel spawn. Dowels are simply small pieces of wood, usually cylindrical in shape that come completely inoculated with shiitake mycelium. They should resemble a piece of food that has been left in the corner of your refrigerator for several weeks and has been taken over by mold.\nTo ‚Äúplant‚Äù your mushrooms, you simply need to get the spawn into a hardwood deciduous log. The wood in your log is the growing medium for your shiitakes. The mycelium in the spawn will slowly begin to colonize the rest of the log and begin the slow process of breaking down the lignin.\nOnce the mycelium has grown and when the log is sufficiently colonized, you should start to see your first ‚Äúflush‚Äù of edible mushroom fruits. As long as you keep your colonized logs protected from the sun and sufficiently humid, shiitakes can produce yields of mushrooms for several years. If you live in a dry area or experience extended droughts, you may need to wet your logs with a hose once a day to keep the mycelium active. Mushrooms like humid conditions, and if your logs begin to dry out, the mycelium can die before producing mushrooms.\nTo get the dowel spawn (seed) into the logs (growing medium), the easiest and most efficient technique is simply to drill several holes evenly spaced around your log (the thicker the better). Drill the holes about the same diameter as the dowel spawn that you have.\nNext, stick the dowel spawn into the holes so that they fit tightly. If you need to lightly hammer the dowels to get them to fit snugly, you can do so with care. To avoid colonization of other mushroom spawn floating around in the air, it is best to seal the holes where you inserted your mushroom spawn with the wax of a simple melted candle.\nPlace your logs in a shady, humid area. If you have several logs, you can stack them in a crisscrossed manner so as to allow air flow. Keep your logs humid, but not dripping wet and after 6-9 months you should see your logs come alive with delicious, nutritious, and medicinal shiitake mushrooms.\nHealth Benefits of Shiitake Mushrooms\nShiitake mushrooms have been shown to contain all eight essential amino acids that are bodies need. Additionally, shiitakes come with certain chemical compounds that can help your body fight off oxidative damage. They are also one of the most concentrated sources of the numerous B vitamins that our bodies need.\nShiitake mushrooms also help to regulate your cholesterol and fight off aging due to their strong anti-oxidant properties. For vegetarians and vegans, shiitakes also constitute a great source of non-meat based protein.\nBenefits of Mushrooms to the Local Environment\nWe have already mentioned that mushrooms of any type are an essential element to any healthy soil. By cultivating your own mushrooms in inoculated logs, you are helping to propagate needed mushroom mycelium in your surrounding soil.\nFurthermore, once your shiitakes have finished flushing, or producing edible mushrooms, you will be left with a number of logs that are completely filled with health mycelium. These ‚Äúspent‚Äù logs can be added to the compost pile or placed directly around fruit trees. Since fruit trees prefer a fungal dominated soil, the mycelium in your mushroom logs will reach into the soil and add health and vibrancy to the soil around your fruit trees. If you are lucky, you might even find a few extra shiitake mushrooms popping up underneath your orchard.\nAnother idea for your spent mushroom logs is to use them as borders for raised garden beds. The mycelium in these logs will add to the fertility of the soil in your garden bed and could help to increase the yields of whatever you are growing.\nShiitake Mushrooms as an Easy, Healthy and Ecologically Sustainable Crop\nChinese cultures have long understood that growing your own mushrooms is an easy way to get the nutrition you need. The ecological benefits of growing your own mushrooms can also help to boost the fertility and overall soil health of your site. With so many different suppliers of quality shiitake mushroom spawn, one fallen tree can give you more than enough logs to enjoy a delicacy for years on end."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0c297937-7ace-49f3-8311-72c188d7c35f>","<urn:uuid:d29ea5e7-bd35-4295-a18d-733accffce20>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the historical significance of Vale of Evesham asparagus cultivation relate to current trends in gourmet salt seasoning?","answer":"The Vale of Evesham asparagus received EU protected food name status in 2016, joining an elite group alongside products like Champagne and Parmesan. Its distinctive quality comes from the area's unique sandy soils and microclimate, which allow deep root systems and produce fast-growing spears with characteristic flavor and texture. This focus on regional distinctiveness parallels the current gourmet salt market, where specific geographical origins and production methods are highly valued.

{"question":"Compare testing requirements: smart city systems vs AV edge cases","answer":"Testing approaches differ significantly between these technologies. For autonomous vehicles, traditional physical testing (driving millions of miles) is insufficient - they require extensive simulation-based testing to handle millions of edge cases like construction zones or unusual traffic situations. Each edge case must be validated for both object detection and decision-making. Smart city systems, on the other hand, focus more on testing data collection, analysis capabilities, and communication infrastructure, with emphasis on privacy protection and sustainable resource optimization. AVs need more rigorous testing since they must perform significantly better than human drivers who have accidents every 165,000 miles on average.","context":["Smart city programs all over the world have been rapidly rising in the past decade or two. It brings up new innovative technologies and possibilities but also risks and could have unpredictable outcomes and consequences. A good way to portray the size and growth potential of smart city market is that today over half of global GDP is produced by 380 cities and by 2025 the estimates are that 600 cities will be responsible for more than 60% of economic growth (Iliev, 2018). For the sake of comparison there were over 4000 cities with more than 100 000 inhabitants in 2015 and to this date that number has undeniably only grown bigger (Brilliant Maps, 2018).\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) has given a possibility for cities to make themselves more reachable and interconnected with its citizens and the technological advancements in data gathering and analyzing will lead to substantial cost savings and economic growth. This will also give outside investors a chance to be part of these rapidly growing programs. The effect of big and smart cities in global economy and future growth cannot be underlined enough. And if estimates come true, 66% percent of human population will be living in urban areas by the year 2050 and therefore there needs to be major accomplishments in technology and proper allocation of resources to handle this huge population (Low, 2018).\nWhat Makes a City Smart?A city might have a large population and a lot of big companies in technology and business, local public transportation and a good economical situation. But what makes a city smart is the communication, data collection and analyzation of this data and the use of it in daily life. Whether it is about optimizing the public transportation to efficiently match the needs of citizens and the current traffic flow or adjusting the lighting and heating in an office building based on the amount of natural light and warmth and more importantly the location of workers and the nature of work they are doing. The optimizing based on people‚Äôs location and the things they do extends all the way to water and energy usage and transportation and sewerage (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018), (du Preez, 2017).\nAll these things have a huge impact on citizen well-being, cost-savings due to optimizing the usage of energy and water, transportation all-around and on environmentally sustainable life in a city. An optimal and desirable smart city is efficient, focused on making life better on all areas, non-discriminating, environmentally friendly and sustainable and has a wide range of possibilities on communication with the citizens and is continuously listening to ideas for improvement. That is a place everyone would be happy to live and should be a target for all governments and city councils all around the globe.\nStrategy of Smart City Investing\nAs a company investing in a smart city is a little different from usual as there is also the government and city council to cooperate with and that lays out some new challenges that separate the smart city investing from regular business to business or business to customer -based thinking. There is a lot of restrictions involving the procedures used, quality, sustainability, safety and privacy and all the work has to be done with close interactions and communication with the authorities and there needs to be a report on everything that is done or will be done and it has to be properly and with caution delivered to the authorities who verify and check everything to make sure it matches the restrictions (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018).\nSince there is a lot of competition on the technological field concerning smart cities, the company absolutely needs to have a stand-out innovation plan that most proficiently fills the needs of the city and is sustainable, environmentally friendly and has an overall positive economic impact. And there must be a realistic plan to reach these requirements since failure in a matter of this significance and size is not really an option to the city and therefore the strict restrictions are in place.\nThere has been a lot of talk about the privacy concerns a smart city faces since the whole idea is based on data collecting and analyzing. One idea to most effectively keep the information safe is to cooperate with technology-businesses that have a lot of experience in protecting data and all kinds of challenges it creates like Google, Apple and Facebook. Cities using this data will have to find the happy medium in the depth of the data analyzing since eventually there will be a gray area of information that the citizens will not be willing to give up for use and don‚Äôt want to risk losing that information to third parties.\nA lot of the smart city ideas are based on following the locations of people. For example when a person wants to go to a business meeting in the center of the city with a car during the worst rush hour, an app could tell him where the nearest free parking spot is and where he has to turn to access this parking spot. Eventually this kind of location monitoring adds up to patterns that reveal extremely indistinguishable information about people that they certainly do not want to share. That kind of information can be where they live and work, what kind of hobbies they have, where do their friends live and what kind of medical issues they have. At some point in addition the law comes an obstacle in at least most of the modern states that value human rights and privacy (Gardner, M., Brown, M. and Petel, G. 2018).\nWays of Investing in a Smart City Ways of investing in a smart city vary on all levels of imagination. Whether it is about funding a sustainable green energy project just outside the city to cover a major part of the energy consumption in the city or developing a new kind of data storage system that can handle the massive amount of data collected and can withstand the growth of that data in the future as well (Iliev, 2018).\nMost likely the most used way of investing is and will be buying shares of the companies that have the connections and possibilities to in a major way affect some aspect of smart city technology and can be most profitable in the long run. An investor has to be extremely careful when investing in these companies though, since the smart city program is relatively new and we do not yet know how everything will turn out with it because there are no experiences from the past to compare to. In addition there is a massive amount of technology companies that want to be part of these programs but only a small proportion of them will succeed and have a profitable role in the smart city world. An investor needs to find the most potent, innovative, stable, ambitious and well-funded companies that have the necessary elements to be a successful operator in the field.\nEconomic Benefits of a Smart CityI\nmplementation of the Internet of Things allows a city to create variety of ways to both save and generate money through reducing energy and water usage and being more efficient in car-parking and speeding fines to name a few. Most importantly applying Internet of Things in the basic fundamentals of a city saves everyone‚Äôs time, money and effort and also the environment as the data collected allows cities to adjust their services and businesses to most efficiently do their work (Eichler, 2018).\nA significant effect on being a stable and profit generating city is that it attracts even more investors to make the city an even better place to live through continuous investment and new smart technology projects.\nThere has been concerns about the funding necessary for cities to start a program to implement the Internet of Things even though the overall amount of money invested in smart cities is exponentially growing. The reasons to this are mainly location- and state -based since the main proportion of funding comes from the local authorities (Eichler, 2018).\nIf a proper plan is introduced, a smart city project will get a big share of private funding, but as mentioned before, the privacy and security concerns need to be properly addressed and that requires the local authorities to have a substantial part in the developing and maintaining process, hence the need for local funding too. In addition the city itself is always held accountable for the safety and functionality of the technological systems and the area as a whole. Therefore it is understandable that the first thing to start a smart city program is to find a government-backed funding plan. Other significant reason for the hold-ups of smart city projects is the lack of infrastructure to back the systems needed to create a sufficient technological entity for the Internet of Things to be implemented (Eichler, 2018). Business Insider‚Äôs estimation of Internet of Things attracted investments. (Business Insider Intelligence)\nAs the technology grows and people keep on moving in large cities after work, family and way of life, the cities have to create more ways to save costs and at the same time be more reachable and environmentally friendly. This offers numerous chances for investors as technology companies implementing the Internet of things line up for cities to choose from. Investment choice has to be even more carefully planned than usual since the massive competition in the field compared to the amount of companies that will actually be used to build up the city‚Äôs communications- and data analyzing -systems.\nThere is a bright future in the technology-business considering the smart city programs. There is also a moral incentive as the smart city idea itself is to quarantee the well-being of the citizens and to provide sustainable and environmentally friendly services and power in addition to a huge impact on economic growth.\n- Iliev, I.

Use cases drive business models, value chains, and strategic decisions. Asutosh Padhi, a senior partner in McKinsey‚Äôs Chicago office, and Philipp Kampshoff, a partner in the Houston office, share the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility‚Äôs perspective on how the most prominent autonomous-driving use cases are developing to help executives navigate and stay ahead of upcoming changes. When will autonomous-driving technology be market ready?\nAsutosh Padhi: Our expectation is that true Level 5 autonomy is about ten-plus years away. But we are likely to see geofenced applications of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the next three to five years. The progress on the hardware has actually been very significant. The cost of LIDARs [light detection and ranging sensors], for example, has dropped by a factor of ten over the last five years. Similarly, the amount of computational capacity that the GPUs [graphic processing units] can provide has gone up dramatically.\nThere are still two challenges that remain. The first one is object detection and categorization, which is the ability of a car, for example, to recognize a pedestrian: this is what it looks like if a pedestrian is pushing a stroller, if the pedestrian is carrying an umbrella, if the pedestrian is carrying a plant, when a pedestrian doesn‚Äôt look like a pedestrian, etc. And the second challenge is decision making. When there is human driving, there are a lot of subtle signals that drivers send to each other‚Äîright of way, etc.‚Äîand often if you‚Äôre an autonomous car, you can‚Äôt pick those up. So I think a combination of those two, and in particular the edge-cases question; there‚Äôs going to be high time required to be able to teach the car how to recognize and deal with the edge cases.\nPhilipp Kampshoff: That‚Äôs really the reason why we don‚Äôt see autonomous vehicles already being readily available as robo-taxis driving around. The decision making is done by the neural net in the car, at least for the large part. And you can train the neural net relatively quickly to accurately assess 95 percent of the situations. But it takes a lot more training and a lot more miles that you have to drive in order to train the neural net up to 99 percent correctness.\nEdge cases is where the problem is. If you take a regular human driver, on average it‚Äôs roughly every 165,000 miles he has an accident. That means, in 99 percent of the cases, the human person is right when they drive themselves. However, for an autonomous car, regulators will require the autonomous car to be much safer than current human behavior. So it will come down to handling these edge cases‚Äîfor example, the four-way traffic sign where these days hardly anybody really comes to a full stop. So do you have the autonomous vehicle be the only one that‚Äôs behaving correctly and sits there forever waiting for everybody else to stop all the way? Another example is a construction site where you have a red traffic light, and the autonomous vehicle is approaching the red traffic light, but there is a construction worker who waves the people and cars through. How does the autonomous vehicle know that it can ignore the red traffic light? So these are the kinds of edge cases that have to be overcome for autonomous vehicles to really be out there in mass adoption.\nWhy is testing and validation a concern for autonomous-driving-technology readiness?\nAsutosh Padhi: Our view is that there‚Äôs going to be a completely new paradigm that has to emerge for testing and validation in the world of autonomous vehicles. In this new world, it is less about driving millions of miles. If you drive millions of good miles, there is, in effect, no new learning that happens. It really is about looking at the millions of edge cases that you‚Äôd expect that do not usually happen on a more traditional and a more frequent basis. And it‚Äôs about teaching the car and the algorithms to recognize object detection as well as decision making in those edge cases. And what it essentially implies is that you can‚Äôt do this through physical validation and testing, because you can‚Äôt have a car drive a million miles. You have to borrow techniques that are used around software-based simulation from other industries like gaming as a way to be able to complete the necessary level of validation.\nPhilipp Kampshoff: The interesting question is, ‚ÄúWhat is the driving test for autonomous vehicles going to look like before you let them on the road and work as robo-taxis or private AVs?‚Äù And for sure it‚Äôs going to be some sort of virtual testing, where you throw situations at the car and see how it would react in different situations. As a regulator, you want to keep on changing that so you cannot program the autonomous-vehicle software so it recognizes the pattern. And then you‚Äôll also need some sort of a physical driving test that these vehicles have to undergo before they‚Äôre going to be allowed on the road.\nWould you like to learn more about the\nMcKinsey Center for Future Mobility?\nOne important thing that people often forget is it‚Äôs not only about the first time that they‚Äôre allowed on the road, but then how do you make sure they are properly maintained? It‚Äôs like in the airline industries, where before the airplane can actually take off, it has to go through certain security checks and safety checks to make sure all the parts are in place and everything is running smoothly. It‚Äôs going to be somewhat similar for autonomous vehicles, where you really have to make sure, at any point in time, your sensors and other components that you need for the car to function properly are working before you let the car out on the street.\nWhat is your view on vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology: Necessity, or nice-to-have?\nPhilipp Kampshoff: The answer is not as straightforward as yes or no. It really depends on which situations, and it also depends on which manufacturer you‚Äôre talking to. Some of the manufacturers will say, ‚ÄúWe are trying to build cars that are self-sufficient. We don‚Äôt want to rely on anything else. We want our cars to be able to behave correctly in any given situation, without having to rely on the right infrastructure around it.‚Äù\nThere are some use cases that would make it a lot easier for the technology and for autonomous vehicles to be out there if V2I were available. One of the examples is the car approaching a construction site. There‚Äôs a red traffic light, and the construction worker waves you through. How does the car know that this is actually a person of authority? You could give the person, the construction worker or a policeman, a chip that basically signals very clearly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a person of authority, and I have the right to override the red traffic light.‚Äù So in these types of situations, V2I would make things a lot easier for the autonomous car. So coming back to your question, it‚Äôs not a clear-cut answer. Manufacturers will try to make the cars as self-sufficient as possible.\nBut we believe there is going to be some sort of V2I, especially in the beginning, as technology is probably, in some of instances, not quite ready. It might also depend on the geography. There might be cities, that are just being built right now where it‚Äôs a lot easier to put in this infrastructure, since sometimes, in more traditional cities, it‚Äôs harder. And the cars will have to rely more on their own rather than on new infrastructure.\nAnother example for V2I or application of autonomous vehicles in combination with infrastructure adjustments would be, for example, a scenario where you say, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs use what we currently have as high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lanes, and we make them autonomous-vehicle lanes.‚Äù Basically, you have a car that has the potential of driving autonomously, and before you enter that lane, you have to activate your autonomous mode. And while you‚Äôre driving in the HOV lane or, in that case, the AV lane, the car is going to drive autonomously. Obviously, you need the infrastructure that checks with the car, ‚ÄúIs the car really on AV mode?‚Äù If you assume that these AV cars are not crashing as often because they communicate with each other and react quicker than a human would react, you can actually allow them to go faster than regular cars. So, you might have AV lanes where cars, instead of just going 60 or 70 miles an hour, go 120 to 150 miles an hour toward downtown, based on this combination between AVs and infrastructure.\nWhat type of autonomous-driving use cases do you expect to see in the future?\nAsutosh Padhi: The Society of Automotive Engineers‚Äô Level 1 to Level 5 taxonomy is very helpful to describe the technological evolution of autonomous vehicles. However, as you think about commercial applications and policy making, a use-case-based approach is more helpful. We are going to see a spectrum of use cases that emerge from autonomous vehicles. The first element of the use-case-based approach is, ‚ÄúWhere will the autonomous vehicles operate?‚Äù Requirements for hardware and software are very different for driving in urban environments versus highway-type environments. The second element is, ‚ÄúWho owns these vehicles?‚Äù Is it going to be individuals, or are they going to be owned by private fleets? This is important, since the operating models and the economics are going to be very different. The final element is, ‚ÄúWhat is being transported?‚Äù Is it individuals, or is it different types of goods? Depending upon the choice to all of these, we‚Äôre going to see a whole different set of applications and use cases that will happen over the next few years.\nPhilipp Kampshoff: Let me tie all these elements together to give you a couple of examples of these use cases. If we talk about transport of people in an urban environment [with AVs] owned by a professional company instead of a private person, then we are talking about the use case of robo-taxis.\nOne question that we are always being asked is, ‚ÄúIs there going to be an Airbnb model of autonomous cars in the future, where people own autonomous vehicles, the autonomous vehicle takes them to work, and then they put it into the mobility-as-a-service system to work for them?‚Äù The math suggests that it is difficult for this vehicle to compete with a professional-fleet provider. The reason is that the professional-fleet provider, just because of economies of scale and purchasing power of not buying just one car but many, will get a different purchase price. They will be much more professional in terms of servicing and maintaining the fleet. And likely, the utilization of the car is going to be higher, too. So they will be able to operate at a different cost point in comparison to a private person who owns an AV and brings that into the system to work as a robo-taxi. Most likely we do not see the Airbnb model for robo-taxis, but professional-fleet providers providing that.\nGauging the disruptive power of robo-taxis in autonomous driving\nOther examples of use cases would be highway application for long distances for goods transport. We talk about ‚Äúplatooning,‚Äù at least as a bridging technology, where you have two trucks, and the second one platoons behind the first one. You don‚Äôt need a driver in the second one anymore. It just brakes and accelerates in line with the one that‚Äôs in front of it. You will have two trucks in the beginning; potentially, it will increase to a train of different trucks. Eventually, you will be able to take the driver out of each one of these trucks. When we look at the numbers, initially platooning is going to help with the total cost of ownership for a fleet provider, driving down 10 percent of the cost. Later on, when you take out all the drivers and you have this concept of platooning trains, you can go as high as 40 percent reduction on total cost of ownership.\nHow will robo-taxis disrupt existing mobility models?\nPhilipp Kampshoff: Robo-taxis have huge potential to disrupt the industry as we know it and to encourage people to go away from private ownership to using robo-taxis 100 percent of the time. We‚Äôre going to see that most likely in urban environments than in rural areas. In comparison to private ownership today, if you live in an urban environment, robo-taxis can be 30 to 50 percent cheaper for you, using robo-taxis at all points in time rather than owning a car. And that is if you factor in all the different costs around insurance, parking, and so forth. When is that going to happen? We think the true disruption is going to happen as soon as these robo-taxis are able to operate in not only an urban environment but also in suburbia or on highways.\nHighways right now are a little bit of a challenging environment, mainly since you‚Äôre traveling at much higher speeds. In an urban environment, if the car doesn‚Äôt know what to do, it can, in theory, park at the side and wait and figure out what it needs to do next. But on a highway, when you go 60 miles an hour, for example, that‚Äôs not possible. In terms of object detection, the car needs to be able to recognize exactly what is in front of the car. Imagine something falls off the truck in front of you; the car needs to be able to say, ‚ÄúIs that a paper bag, or is that a rock?‚Äù And based on whatever it detects, it needs to make the right decision of either going around the object or just driving through it.\nWhat does it take to be a leader in the robo-taxi market?\nPhilipp Kampshoff: The robo-taxi market is going to be a very interesting and attractive market. We see that already today with the movement toward shared mobility, where this is only going to pick up as we move toward robo-taxis. The market today is already 50 billion, and it will be a lot bigger once we move to robo-taxis. So the market is going to be competitive, and it‚Äôs not that simple, at this point in time, to say who is going to be the winner going forward.\nIf you come from the customer angle, there is a good question around why you choose one provider over another. One of the key reasons you would choose one provider over another is availability of cars. Once you call a shared-mobility provider, how long does it take for the robo-taxi to actually show up at your house? So the shorter that time is, the more attractive the provider is for the customer. And in order to address that, scale is going to be important. If you have a large fleet and you can provide good coverage of the network, then obviously that is going to be helpful. The other angle is the price. If two cars are at my house at the same point in time, and the cars are basically the same, then I would probably go for the one that is cheaper.\nNow if we look at the operations side of things, cooperations are going to be very important‚Äîso having the right technology in terms of autonomous vehicles, having access to different car options. Maybe you don‚Äôt want to have the same car, the same layout, of every robo-taxi. But robo-taxis are maybe more purpose-built for certain applications. So you want to have more flexibility there. All of a sudden you‚Äôre in the business of managing a fleet of thousands of cars, maybe similar to rental cars today, where you actually have to maintain and service a huge fleet of cars at any given point in time. So being lean in your operations, making sure you service your cars in the most effective way, is going to be very critical for these companies.\nWill advanced driver-assistance systems still be relevant?\nAsutosh Padhi: ADAS stands for advanced driver-assistance systems. Our view is that ADAS is going to be very important on the path toward full autonomy. That‚Äôs because there are a number of different features that are already in place, and you largely see these in more premium products that we believe can actually pay for the path toward full autonomy. ADAS teaches consumers how to be able to use these different features, and this makes it affordable for the OEMs and suppliers to invest in these technologies.\nThe current revenue generation from ADAS is pretty limited, but, going forward, our view is that the revenue potential is actually going to go up dramatically. How does that happen? It happens by expanding the usage of these features from premium products to more mass vehicles. It happens by automotive companies making it easier to partner with third parties, like insurance companies around variable insurance for car drivers.

{"question":"How do community spaces, both literary and natural, impact women's mental wellbeing and cognitive development?","answer":"Community spaces, both literary and natural, have significant positive impacts on women's wellbeing and cognitive development. In literary communities, such as writing workshops, women find support and encouragement from fellow writers, which helps them develop creatively and tackle challenging themes. These communities provide spaces for mutual support and growth, helping writers emerge and develop their voices. Regarding natural spaces, research has shown that exposure to greenspace around homes and neighborhoods improves women's cognitive function, particularly in processing speed and attention. The benefits of green spaces appear to work partly through reducing depression, as nature helps people recover from psychological stress and encourages outdoor socialization. These findings suggest that both types of community spaces - literary and natural - play crucial roles in supporting women's mental health and cognitive development.","context":["Jean O‚ÄôBrien was born in Dublin where she now lives after an eight year sojourn in the Irish Midlands where she was Writer-in-Residence.\nShe has four previous collections to her name; The Shadow Keeper (1997), Dangerous Dresses (2005), Lovely Legs (2009) and Merman (2012). Her Awards include the Arvon International Poetry Award, and the Fish International Poetry Award. Her work has been placed and highly commended in a number of other competitions including the Forward Prize.\nShe holds an M. Phil in Creative Writing from Trinity College, Dublin, and tutors in Creative Writing.\nQ: The American poet Robert Lowell once wondered why ‚Äúthose bless√®d structures, plot and rhyme‚Äù were ‚Äúno help to me now / I want to make / something imagined, not recalled.‚Äù Reading your work, however, it appears that memory and imagination mingle quite naturally. Domestic and personal recollections (of relationships or family life) seem to sit easily alongside folkloric re-inventions (like 'Merman'), for instance. Are you aware of this dynamic in your poetry? And, as I‚Äôve mentioned him, was Robert Lowell ever an important poet for you?\nA: I have been more interested in Lowell as a person perhaps than his poetry, as he suffered the same illness as my own mother and was perhaps one of the only ones of a loose group of American poets who died of natural causes rather than by his own hand. I have poured over Ian Hamilton‚Äôs biography of him and always remember his faint horror when staying with Seamus Heaney down in Glanmore Cottage in Wicklow, he said according to Heaney (in an interview with Henri Cole in the Paris Review), ‚ÄúYou see a lot of your children‚Äù. But back to your quote at the beginning, he also said further on in the same poem, ‚ÄúI hear the noise of my own voice‚Ä¶ yet paralyzed by fact‚Äù. I can only say I have a rather magpie approach to my own poetry, it‚Äôs whatever glitters bright enough that catches my eye.\nQ: For all its lucidity and fluency, your writing often sheds light on situations of harm, trauma, transgression, and consent ‚Äì in many cases highlighting the gendered reality of such experiences. I‚Äôm thinking of 'Merman', of course, and also of powerful pieces like 'The Stolen Sheela-N√°-Gig of Aghagower Speaks', which reads: ‚ÄúIn the unconditional dark someone dethroned me, / un-croned me, made me young and beautiful again. / I shrieked leave me be, I am happy.‚Äù Is this a fair interpretation of your work? And if so, can you tell us why your poetry flows that way (for a long time, after all, such themes were arguably hard to find in Irish poetry)?\nA: I remember once at the Dublin Writers Workshop, which ran very successfully for about 20 years in the 1980s and 1990s and many, many now well established poets came through the door, I was one of the founding members if such a loose gathering could be described as having such, anyway after I had read my poem out a young man said with the supreme confidence of young men, ‚ÄúYour poems are for women, I write for everyone.‚Äù He escaped with his life, but it got me thinking. You say for a long time such themes were hard to find, I say they were also hard to get published. After all Eavan Boland was almost regarded as ‚Äòruined‚Äô when she dared to write 'Night Feed', a lesser intellect would have quailed at the outpouring of criticism she received. I like women who push boundaries be they real or imagined, I have written poems about Alison Hargreaves the mountaineer and Amelia Earhart (amongst others), as I feel they should be celebrated. My poem about Amelia Earhart is called 'Yes, I can bake a cake'. In response to the headline of a French newspaper that could only think of the headline after her tremendous success, the headline read, But can she bake a cake. I know this was back in the day, but there is plenty of that nonsense still around, myself and poets like Mary O‚ÄôDonnell are writing about Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), again a subject not many want to tackle. I do also write plenty of lighter verse, such as my Skinny Dipping poem.\nQ: Yes, of course! It occurs to me that there‚Äôs also an almost preternatural sensitivity throughout your poems (\"heavy\" or \"light\") to the rhythms of time as it passes ‚Äì moving through individual lives (and individual bodies), as well as the world at large. Your poetry tunes in ‚Äúto rhyme and reason and to all the seasons‚Äù ('Spring Equinox), at times to ‚Äú[f]reeze the moment, make it stay‚Äù and at others just to bring the ‚Äúwordless flow‚Äù to some kind of expression ('Body Talk'); the results are often both luminous and illuminating. Do you have any inkling of where this urge comes from, and why it happens in the form of poetry specifically?\nA: Well I do think that myself and many other poets like to bear witness and as a women I am aware of the passing of time, going from childbearing age to older age, I often think women are meant to stay set in aspic so to speak. I am very aware of the generations of women who came before me, perhaps because I lost my mother and my beloved grandmother so early in my teens and felt bereft of much needed advice and support. I have a daughter myself and this makes me almost more aware. A startling thought is that a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have already in her body, therefore when my mother carried me in her womb I was already carrying the egg that would one day fertilise to be my daughter, if that doesn‚Äôt give you a sense of continuity nothing will. I am also interested in that idea that we live so much ‚Äòbehind‚Äô our own face and only interact with the world through our bodies, I am interested in where that border is crossed.\nQ: I asked you earlier about Robert Lowell, but there‚Äôs an abundance of inflections from other poets in your work ‚Äì quite a few of them, coincidentally (or not?), from the Boston/Massachusetts area. I‚Äôm thinking of 'Called Back', which references Emily Dickinson‚Äôs gravestone, and 'The Gates of Horn', with its echoes of Sylvia Plath. Is poetry, then, an international and time-spanning art, for you (as opposed to the 20th-century Irish bracketing that it‚Äôs often lodged into on this island, for example)? And would you like to comment on either of those poems that I‚Äôve mentioned ‚Äì the emotion or identification with Plath and Dickinson that you needed to express?\nA: Well spotted, I did go through a period when I was very interested in poets from around there, including Anne Sexton, John Berryman, Robert Frost etc. I had been reading lots of biographies, including Peter Davison‚Äôs wonderful book, The Fading Smile (Poets in Boston from Robert Lowell to Sylvia Plath), and Plath‚Äôs mother‚Äôs book of letters to her daughter. Given their mental health difficulties I was probably trying to find some understanding of my own mother‚Äôs mental health difficulties, which I have written about a lot. I was also interested in the fact that a lot of them had visited or spent time in Ireland, Frost stayed out by Sandymount I believe, Plath had the famous dinner with Richard Murphy etc. Emily Dickinson‚Äôs coffin was carried by six Irish men who worked for her father, there just seemed to be connections everywhere, which I didn‚Äôt get with European poets, except Szymborska who did spend time here. Many years ago I wrote a poem lamenting the fact that I was from the city and didn‚Äôt seem to have the wealth of things to draw on that poets from the countryside have, I know city poets like Peter Sirr and the late Dennis O‚ÄôDriscoll managed perfectly well, but the Irish are a sentimental race and any mention of the ‚Äòaul sod‚Äô seems to get a lot further than city streets. This is one of the reasons I have always preferred Muldoon's high jinks to Heaney's country matters (which is not to say that I don't like and appreciate Heaney's poetry). My poem, 'The Gates of Horn', is based as you know on the idea of the gates of ivory and horn, easy passage in sleep is given to true shades through the gates of horn and Plath seemed to spend a lot of time striving to become a shade. At the time I also used to typeset everything in [the font] Arial in homage to Plath‚Äôs Ariel. Often it is just a word or definition that sets me off and I like to play around with it a little.\nQ: You‚Äôre known (I can confirm!) as a diligent supporter of poetry and other poets ‚Äì a regular attendee at readings and literary festivals, as both participant and audience-member. Judging by your example, I‚Äôd say that poetry exists at two levels (at least) simultaneously, the communal/social and the personal/private. Is this accurate, do you think? And can you say anything about how those two levels relate to one another, in your experience as a writer (do they conflict at all, or are they mutually enriching)?\nA: When I was involved in the previously mentioned Dublin Writer‚Äôs Workshop and then the Stephen‚Äôs Green workshop, I liked the idea of community and the support we gave and got from one another. So in a way I am continuing that on a social level, I was also given help along the way from people such as Paula Meehan, Eavan Boland, Thomas McCarthy, Theo Dorgan, etc, so I like to support and encourage other poets and newer poets, this is one of the reasons I enjoy tutoring, as it energises me. I am interested in how poets emerge and what‚Äôs new such as Spoken Word etc, I think creativity is not static or shouldn‚Äôt be. When we (the members of DWW) were operating as a group we gave readings outside the mainstream and published our own yearly pamphlet called Acorn and sold it ourselves often on Grafton Street, so I don‚Äôt have an ivory tower view of creativity and where its energies come from. I am fairly gregarious it has been said, but I do have a private part, which I protect and often conceal by perhaps too much kidding around, I am trying to keep it safe. Writing as you know is a lonely business, at the end of the day it is just yourself and the blank page and words.","Summary: Living near green spaces improves processing speed, cognitive function, and attention in addition to improving mental health, researchers report.\nSource: Boston University\nCognitive function at middle age is a strong predictor of whether a person may develop dementia later in life.\nNow, a new study led by a Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH) researcher has found that increasing greenspace in residential areas could help improve cognition function in middle-aged women and that this association might be explained by a reduction in depression, which is also a risk factor for dementia.\nPublished in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study found that exposure to greenspace around one‚Äôs home and surrounding neighborhood could improve processing speed and attention, as well as boost overall cognitive function.\nThe results also showed that lowered depression may help explain the association between greenspace and cognition, bolstering previous research that has linked exposure to parks, community gardens, and other greenery with improved mental health.\n‚ÄúSome of the primary ways that nature may improve health is by helping people recover from psychological stress and by encouraging people to be outside socializing with friends, both of which boost mental health,‚Äù says Dr. Marcia Pescador Jimenez, study lead and corresponding author, and assistant professor of epidemiology at BUSPH.\n‚ÄúThis study is among the few to provide evidence that greenspace may benefit cognitive function in older ages. Our findings suggest that greenspace should be investigated as a potential population-level approach to improve cognitive function.‚Äù\nFor the study, Pescador Jimenez and colleagues from BUSPH, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Brigham and Women Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Rush Medical College estimated residential greenspace with a satellite image-based metric called the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).\nThey measured psychomotor speed, attention, learning, and working memory among 13,594 women aged 61 on average and primarily White, from 2014 to 2016.\nThe women were participants in the Nurses‚Äô Health Study II, the second of three studies that are among the largest investigations into the risk factors for chronic diseases among US women.\nAdjusting for age, race, and individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status, the researchers found that greenspace exposure was associated with psychomotor speed and attention, but not learning or working memory.\nIn addition to depression, the researchers also examined the potential roles of air pollution and physical activity in explaining the association between greenspace and cognitive function, and they were surprised to only find evidence of depression as a mediating factor.\n‚ÄúWe theorize that depression might be an important mechanism through which green space may slow down cognitive decline, particularly among women, but our research is ongoing to better understand these mechanisms,‚Äù Pescador Jimenez says.\n‚ÄúBased on these results, clinicians and public health authorities should consider green space exposure as a potential factor to reduce depression, and thus, boost cognition. Policymakers and urban planners should focus on adding more green space in everyday life to improve cognitive function.‚Äù\nWhile the study shows evidence of this association, the greenspace metric that the researchers used to measure greenspace exposure does not differentiate between specific types of vegetation. In a new project, Pescador Jimenez will apply deep learning algorithms to Google Street View images to better understand which specific elements of greenery, such as trees or grass, could be the driving factors for health.\nThe researchers also hope that their study is replicated among other racial/ethnic populations and assesses associations with cognitive decline over longer periods of time.\n‚ÄúThe distribution of green spaces in cities is not uniform,‚Äù says Pescador Jimenez. ‚ÄúIncreasing everyday access to vegetation across vulnerable groups in urban cities is a crucial next step to achieve health equity.‚Äù\nAbout this cognition and green spaces research news\nResidential green space and cognitive function in a large cohort of middle-aged women\nGreen space can decelerate cognitive decline by supporting physical activity, psychological restoration, or reducing exposure to air pollution. However, existing studies on the association of green space with cognitive decline are limited.\nTo examine whether residential green space was associated with cognitive function in middle-aged women.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nStarting in 1989, the Nurses‚Äô Health Study II enrolled 116 429 female nurses aged 25 to 42 years residing in the US. In 2014 to 2016, 40 082 women were invited to complete an online cognitive battery. This cohort study analyzed women who had data on both green space exposure and cognitive measures. Data analysis was conducted from June to October 2021.\nResidential exposure to green space was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a satellite-derived indicator of the quantity of ground vegetation. Landsat satellite data at 270-m and 1230-m buffers around each participants‚Äô residential addresses in 2013 were used.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nIn 2014 to 2016, cognitive function was measured using a self-administered online battery, the Cogstate Brief Battery, consisting of 4 tasks measuring psychomotor speed, attention, learning, and working memory; 3 composite scores, averaging together all tasks, psychomotor speed/attention, and learning/working memory, were created. In addition, the study evaluated potential mediators, including air pollution, depression, and physical activity.\nThe analytical sample included 13 594 women, of whom 13 293 (98%) were White. Mean (SD) age was 61.2 (4.6) years. In models adjusted for age at assessment, race, childhood, adulthood, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, green space was associated with higher scores on the global Cogstate composite (mean difference per IQR in green space, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07), and psychomotor speed/attention (mean difference in score, 0.05 standard units; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.08). This difference in scores is similar to the difference observed in women 1 year apart in age in the data. By contrast, there was no association between green space and learning/working memory (mean difference, 0.0300; 95% CI, ‚àí0.0003 to 0.0500).\nConclusions and Relevance\nThese findings suggest that increasing residential green space may be associated with modest benefits in cognition in middle-aged women."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7615ea8a-ef99-4049-b506-8f3d81fd0a5b>","<urn:uuid:084d451b-c0a4-4bab-b0c2-2704526cb57b>"],"error":null}

Board secretary Richard Allen of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his wife, Mary Esther Allen, led efforts to provide support for the school, and when Mary Allen died suddenly just before it opened, it was named in her honor.\nInitially operated by an all-white staff as a boarding and day school, Mary Allen Seminary was located about a mile north of the Crockett town square on a prominent hill, its campus anchored by an impressive four-story French Second Empire-style brick administration building. By 1890, the school included ten teachers and 211 students, and offered elementary and secondary classes, as well as teacher training that enabled students to earn state teaching certification. Burt Randall Smith became the first African American administrator in 1924.

{"question":"How does the typical hot Jupiter exoplanet Kepler-76b compare to the planetary formation patterns predicted by the solar nebula model?","answer":"There's an interesting contradiction between Kepler-76b and traditional solar nebula model predictions. The solar nebula model predicted that small rocky planets would form close to stars where temperatures are high, while larger gaseous planets would form farther out where temperatures are lower. However, Kepler-76b is a 'hot Jupiter' - a massive gas giant that orbits extremely close to its star every 1.5 days, with a temperature of about 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. To explain such planets, scientists had to modify the solar nebula model to include planetary migration, acknowledging that planets can move significantly from their original formation locations.

The basic modification is that things move, sometimes they move a lot: Migration theory","/ By Niva Goldberg /\nDetecting alien worlds presents a significant challenge since they are small, faint, and close to their stars. The two most prolific techniques for finding exoplanets are radial velocity (looking for wobbling stars) and transits (looking for dimming stars). A team at Tel Aviv University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) has just discovered an exoplanet using a new method that relies on Einstein‚Äôs special theory of relativity.\n‚ÄúWe are looking for very subtle effects. We needed high quality measurements of stellar brightnesses, accurate to a few parts per million, ‚Äù said team member David Latham of the CfA.\n‚ÄúThis was only possible because of the exquisite data NASA is collecting with the Kepler spacecraft, ‚Äù added lead author Simchon Faigler of Tel Aviv University, Israel.\nAlthough Kepler was designed to find transiting planets, this planet was not identified using the transit method. Instead, it was discovered using a technique first proposed by Avi Loeb of the CfA and his colleague Scott Gaudi (now at Ohio State University) in 2003. (Coincidentally, they developed their theory while visiting the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where Einstein once worked.)\nThe new method looks for three small effects that occur simultaneously as a planet orbits the star. Einstein‚Äôs ‚Äúbeaming‚Äù effect causes the star to brighten as it moves toward us, tugged by the planet, and dim as it moves away. The brightening results from photons ‚Äúpiling up‚Äù in energy, as well as light getting focused in the direction of the star‚Äôs motion due to relativistic effects.\n‚ÄúThis is the first time that this aspect of Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity has been used to discover a planet, ‚Äù said co-author Tsevi Mazeh of Tel Aviv University.\nThe team also looked for signs that the star was stretched into a football shape by gravitational tides from the orbiting planet. The star would appear brighter when we observe the ‚Äúfootball‚Äù from the side, due to more visible surface area, and fainter when viewed end-on. The third small effect was due to starlight reflected by the planet itself.\nOnce the new planet was identified, it was confirmed by Latham using radial velocity observations gathered by the TRES spectrograph at Whipple Observatory in Arizona, and by Lev Tal-Or (Tel Aviv University) using the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in France. A closer look at the Kepler data also showed that the planet transits its star, providing additional confirmation.\n‚ÄúEinstein‚Äôs planet, ‚Äù formally known as Kepler-76b, is a ‚Äúhot Jupiter‚Äù that orbits its star every 1.5 days. Its diameter is about 25 percent larger than Jupiter and it weighs twice as much. It orbits a type F star located about 2, 000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus.\nThe planet is tidally locked to its star, always showing the same face to it, just as the Moon is tidally locked to Earth. As a result, Kepler-76b broils at a temperature of about 3, 600 degrees Fahrenheit.\nInterestingly, the team found strong evidence that the planet has extremely fast jet-stream winds that carry the heat around it. As a result, the hottest point on Kepler-76b isn‚Äôt the substellar point (‚Äúhigh noon‚Äù) but a location offset by about 10, 000 miles. This effect has only been observed once before, on HD 189733b, and only in infrared light with the Spitzer Space Telescope. This is the first time optical observations have shown evidence of alien jet stream winds at work.\nAlthough the new method can‚Äôt find Earth-sized worlds using current technology, it offers astronomers a unique discovery opportunity. Unlike radial velocity searches, it doesn‚Äôt require high-precision spectra. Unlike transits, it doesn‚Äôt require a precise alignment of planet and star as seen from Earth.\n‚ÄúEach planet-hunting technique has its strengths and weaknesses.

{"question":"Compare how the Tigris and Nile rivers contribute to the economies of their respective regions.","answer":"Both rivers are vital economic assets but serve their regions differently. The Tigris River contributes through multiple channels: it's a source of livelihood for fishermen and transport workers, provides irrigation for agriculture in arid regions, generates hydroelectric power, and supports tourism through recreational activities like swimming and kayaking. The Nile, on the other hand, is primarily described as Egypt's lifeblood, serving as the main source of drinking water and irrigation for agriculture, with 94 million people dependent on the Nile delta or river valley. Additionally, Ethiopia's planned hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile is set to become Africa's largest hydropower plant and boost that country's economy, though this has caused tensions with Egypt.","context":["A source of life and tension: three potential conflicts over water\nWater is central to all human activity but not an infinite resource. With a surging world population and mounting global demand for fresh water, the idea of countries going to war over this precious resource no longer seems the post-apocalyptic fantasy plotline of a Hollywood blockbuster. In some parts of the world, disputes have already begun to simmer between countries poised to defend their water supplies. RTD takes a look at three potential flashpoints.\nControl of the world‚Äôs longest river\nRunning from Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean, the Nile feeds eleven African countries but the one most synonymous with that iconic stretch of water has to be Egypt, where the majority of 94 million population lives on the Nile delta or the river valley. The Nile is Egypt‚Äôs lifeblood and its primary source of drinking water and irrigation for agriculture.\nCairo insists on its historic rights granted by international agreements in 1929 and 1959. The country is entitled to an annual 55.5 billion cubic meters of Nile water a year, and it has the right to veto any upstream projects. The nations upriver though are no longer willing to accept Egypt‚Äôs colonial-era privileges.\nIn 2011, Ethiopia began constructing a $4.8 billion hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile, set to become Africa‚Äôs largest hydropower plant and a project that will boost the country‚Äôs economy. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has fuelled fears in Cairo of disrupting water flowing into arid Egypt, with President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi calling it ‚Äúa matter of life and death.‚Äù\nAddis Ababa has given assurances that the mega-dam will not harm Egypt, with neighbouring Sudan, that will also benefit, backing the project. Talks between the riparian states have stalled for months, with the main sticking point being how quickly Ethiopia plans to fill the reservoir. While tensions seemed to ease during the latest meeting between Egypt‚Äôs Al-Sisi and the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed in June, the next round of talks has been postponed.\n‚ÄúNeither Syria nor Iraq can lay claim to Turkey‚Äôs rivers any more than Ankara could claim their oil,‚Äù Turkey‚Äôs former leader, Suleyman Demirel once said. ‚ÄúWe have a right to do anything we like.‚Äù\nAnkara made its message clear regarding the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which both rise on within Turkish borders. But neighbouring Iraqis, have already learned how heavily they rely on the rivers for much of their surface water. In 1990, the Euphrates flow was interrupted for a month as Turkey filled the Ataturk dam reservoir reducing the flow into downstream Iraq to a trickle. This was despite vigorous opposition from Baghdad and Damascus.\nThe Ataturk dam was part of the long-running Southestern Anatolia Project (GAP), intended to bring prosperity to the country‚Äôs least developed region. It envisages a further 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric power stations that will dominate the two rivers.\nIn 2006, Turkey embarked on another GAP project ‚Äì the Ilisu dam on the Tigris, provoking concerns in Iraq, which suffers serious water shortages. Following complaints from Baghdad, Ankara agreed to delay filling the Ilisu dam the construction of which is drawing to a close. ‚ÄúWith the second decision to postpone, we have shown once again that we can put our neighbor‚Äôs needs ahead of our own,‚Äù said Turkey‚Äôs ambassador to Iraq, Fatih Yildiz, in June.\nDespite Turkey claiming it views water as ‚Äúa catalyst for cooperation rather than a source of conflict,‚Äù dams might still become tools for political leverage over neighbouring countries.\nRelations defined by water\nIn Soviet times, the republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan used a joint resource-sharing system, which ensured water for some and electricity for others.While the water-rich Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan shared their supplies from high-altitude reservoirs through the Amur Darya and Syr Darya rivers, downstream nations provided them with coal and gas in return.\nHowever, that cooperation collapsed along with the Soviet Union, unleashing the potential for disagreements in Central Asia.The revival of hydropower projects in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, put a strain on their collective relations with Uzbekistan. In 2010, Kyrgyzstan completed its Kambarata-2 power station and is already building a second. Meanwhile, Tajikistan is planning the ambitious Rogun dam, set to become the world‚Äôs highest reservoir.\nThe Uzbek government vehemently opposes these plans, fearing the dams will divert water away from their country. The late strongman, Islam Karimov, even went so far as to suggest that, ‚Äúall of this could deteriorate to the point where not just a serious confrontation, but even wars could be the result.‚Äù","The Main Importance of Tigris River\nA brief background about the Tigris River\nThe Tigris River is one of two rivers that flow in Mesopotamia which is modern day Iraq. Even though it starts on the eastern part, it joins River Euphrates and flows from Turkey into Iraq. The river is 1,900 km long and is one of the more important sources of water in the Middle East.\nThe major benefits of the Tigris River\nThere are several key roles that Tigris River plays. These include:\n- Source of water. The Tigris River has always been regarded as an important source of water for the arid and semi arid lands in both Turkey and Iraq. Both Iraq and Turkey have diverted some of the water from this river to create irrigation channels for their lands. Dams and water reservoirs have been constructed to harvest some of the water from the river for human activities. It is possible to farm using this water despite the arid conditions of the land along which it flows. This river has indeed sustained crops and human being in the dry areas.\n- Source of food. Tigris River is a major source of fish of different species. Many of the inhabitants who live along the river have relied on this river for food for many years. It is not just human beings that rely on the river for food, animals and birds as well get food from it.\n- Transport mode. From time immemorial, Tigris River has been considered a major mode of transport. During the civilization era, most goods and people were transported through this river. This has not changed and today water channels such as canals have been constructed to accommodate different vessels that pass through the Tigris River.\n- Source of livelihood. Many people who live along the Tigris River consider it a source of revenue. There are fishermen who obtain fish from the river and sell it to consumers. There are also those who operate different vessels across the river and help to ferry both people and goods. During constructions of dams and waterways, many people get employment from activities related to the river.\n- Source of energy. Hydro power from the Tigris River has helped to save energy while providing electricity to different parts of the region surrounding the river. Many people who live near the river can get cheap hydroelectric power because of its role as a source of energy.\n- Means of recreation. There are also many people who use the Tigris River as a means of recreation. These include both inhabitants of the regions around the river and tourists who visit the region. These people engage in a range of water activities that include swimming, sailing, kayaking and fishing amongst other things.\nIn the recent past, many controversies have arisen concerning the Tigris River. This is because there are environmental concerns surrounding it. With Turkey constructing major dams at the mouth of the river, Iraq is worried about interference with the normal flow of the river. The government has also relaxed its laws and the river has become a dumping site for both dirt and sometimes dead bodies."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3c1d4d1b-05e6-4223-b2e1-c3d05355a726>","<urn:uuid:bd9d0320-8292-4c0a-902f-c9bb4941af3b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does mindfulness practice compare to physical activity in terms of their benefits for mental and physical wellbeing?","answer":"Both mindfulness and physical activity offer multiple benefits for mental and physical wellbeing. Mindfulness practices help manage stress by activating the body's 'break' function, which slows down breathing, heart rate and stress hormone release. Research shows mindfulness dramatically improves stress management ability and helps people cope better with difficult thoughts and emotions. Physical activity, on the other hand, can improve memory and brain function, protect against chronic diseases, aid in weight management, lower blood pressure, improve heart health, enhance sleep quality, and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Both approaches are crucial components of maintaining overall health - mindfulness through improving stress resilience and emotional regulation, and physical activity through direct physiological benefits and mood enhancement.","context":["15 Apr Manage Stress with Mindfulness\nIn life, we cannot avoid stress entirely. Stress can come in both ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúgood‚Äù experiences. Bad stress may be from a busy schedule, finances, health issues or a recent death in the family. Good stress can be come as a wedding, birthday or excitement over an upcoming trip. Whether good or bad, stress can affect the body‚Äôs ability to regulate metabolism, sleep and other bodily functions like digestion and blood sugar. That‚Äôs why it is important to understand how to manage stress with mindfulness.\nWhen the body is stressed it releases more than 60 hormones. This can lead to increased blood pressure and heart rate, increased glucose in blood, decreased digestion and other physiological effects including metabolism. When the stress response is stimulated for a short period of time, known as the ‚Äúfight-or-flight‚Äù response, these hormones can be lifesaving. However, when we live in a constant state of stress, these hormones can affect our health. This can cause or make chronic disease worse.\nStress management is crucial to a balanced lifestyle. Whether exercise, yoga, meditation or reading is your de-stressing technique of choice, it is importance to learn how to be mindful. Then, you can manage the stressors that come your way. When we manage stress in our lives, it promotes an anti-inflammatory response in the body that can help manage chronic disease.\nWhat is mindfulness?\nMindfulness can be thought of as ‚Äúliving in the here and now.‚Äù This means being fully aware of whatever is happening in the present moment, not allowing fears, worries or anxiety control your thoughts or mind.(1) Mindfulness is observing, watching, examining and taking control over your situation. We may not be able to control the situation, but we can learn to control how we respond. A few examples of mindfulness practices include yoga, deep breathing, breath exercises, worship or praise, tai chi and progressive muscle relaxation.\nThe goal of mindfulness is to take your mind off the situation that is causing stress and refocus. Your nervous system has two different parts to it: one acts like a gas pedal, the fight or flight part that responds to stress; the other acts as the breaks. Our ‚Äúbreak‚Äù function is the part we want to activate with mindfulness. This part helps slows down breathing, heart rate and can slow the release of stress hormones. This response helps bring your body back to equilibrium, helping to control heart rate, blood sugar spikes and anxiety.\nWhat is the link between mindfulness and my health?\nThere are more links between mindfulness and your health than you might think. You can learn to manage stress through mindfulness, which can improve overall health. Here are just a few ways:\n- Mindfulness and improvement in anxiety and depression: Research is showing that practicing a mindfulness routine dramatically improves our ability to manage stress. This builds up a tolerance to life‚Äôs stressor that may come with the demands of managing our health.\n- Mindfulness and resilience: Studies have shown that mindful people are better able to cope with difficult thoughts and emotions without becoming overwhelmed\nSo, you might be thinking: great, but how do I practice mindfulness? Try this breathing exercise to help kickstart your mindfulness routine.\nMake yourself comfortable in your chair. When you do this exercise at home, you can sit in a chair, on the floor or lie down. Take a few moments to settle in and become still. Congratulate yourself for taking time to practice self-care and mindful awareness. Focus on your breathing wherever you feel it most prominently in your body. It may be at the nose, neck, chest, belly or somewhere else.\nAs you breathe in normally and naturally, be aware of breathing in; and as you breathe out, be aware of breathing out. Simply maintain this awareness of the breath, breathing in and breathing out. There is no need to visualize or count your breaths; simply notice them. Without judgment, watch the breath ebb and flow, like waves in the ocean. There is no place to go and nothing else to do. Just be in the present, noticing the breath, existing simply, one inhalation and one exhalation at a time. As you breathe in and out, be mindful of the breath rising on the inhalation and falling on the exhalation. Ride the waves of the breath, moment by moment, breathing in and breathing out.\nFrom time to time, your attention may wander from your breathing. This is normal. When you notice this, simply acknowledge where you went and then gently bring your attention back to the breath. Breathe normally, naturally, and without changing the breath in any way. As you breathe in, think ‚Äúsoft‚Äù; and as you breathe out, think ‚Äúbelly.‚Äù Again, notice where you feel the breath in your body. Think only about where you feel the breath. Repeat ‚Äúsoft‚Äù on the inhale and ‚Äúbelly‚Äù on the exhale. Use the words as an anchor for your mind. Soften ‚Äì breathe ‚Äì allow.\nMindfulness and stress\nHow did that feel? Are you more relaxed? Mindfulness does not come overnight. It is something that needs to be cultivated through daily practice ‚Äì whether that means breathing exercises, yoga or some other form of mindfulness exercise. Remember that stress is unavoidable for most of us. So, focusing on ways that you can manage stress with mindfulness is an important aspect of your overall health. Stress, as we‚Äôve seen, can have negative affects on our bodies, particularly for those with chronic illnesses. So, the negative effects of stress should not be ignored, but instead, managed through techniques like mindfulness.\n- Schmidt, L.R. ‚ÄúPositive Impacts of Meditation and Relaxation practices on Diabetes‚Äù.

{"question":"Between Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools and Loggly's log analysis system, which provides more detailed insights into application performance issues?","answer":"Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools provide more detailed insights into application performance issues. APM tools show exactly how long an application spends dealing with particular requests, code pathways, and can identify specific issues like expensive database queries or template rendering problems. While Loggly offers log analysis and flexible alerting based on events, it focuses primarily on log data and doesn't provide the same level of detailed insight into application behavior that APM tools offer.","context":["How to diagnose performance problems#\nIn a web applications, a performance problem is generally experienced in two ways: as a lack of speed in responding to client requests, or unexpected errors from the site.\nErrors caused by performance problems are typically (but not limited to) Application not responding or Gateway timeout errors.\nAlmost without exception, performance problems with sites running on Divio are caused by problems originating within the applications themselves, and are not related to the performance of our servers, network or infrastructure.\nWe monitor all of our services around the clock. Any components whose performance or operation falls outside safe parameters will immediately raise an alert, and will be checked by our SRE team. Many of those components will automatically be recycled or restarted by our monitoring systems.\nIn the case of any on-going issue affecting Divio infrastructure, we will post a notice on https://status.divio.com.\nAction without information is useless#\nIt is almost impossible to address any performance problem without adequately understanding its causes. Any action attempting to resolve the problem without a good understanding of its nature is simply a shot in the dark with little chance of success.\nIt is tempting to consider upgrading a subscription (i.e. increasing resources such as RAM and CPU) as an immediate first resort, but - as much as Divio will be pleased to see you spending more money on our services - this should be resisted.\nUse Application Performance Monitoring#\nThe single most useful thing at your disposal when trying to identify the cause of a performance issue is an Application Performance Monitoring tool. There is nothing that provides an equally valuable insight into what an application is actually doing - how long it spends dealing with a particular request, or kind of request, and the code pathways a request invokes.\nIt can quickly become apparent whether a slow response is being held up in straightforward computational processing, database or file interaction, template rendering or other process. (For example, if it turns out that a certain request triggers a very expensive database query, then there is no amount of other resources that can be thrown at the application to improve performance: the only solution is to optimise the query, or ensure that its results can be cached as much as possible. If the query takes so long to process that the request times out before the database can return a result, then only rewriting the query will be solution.)\nWell-established APM solutions suitable for web applications include New Relic and Elastic APM. Most well-known services offer integration packages for multiple different languages.\nFor any mission-critical application or serious effort to identify performance shortfalls, we strongly recommend using APM. A little investment in APM can save you great expenditure in time, effort and money.\nUse other tools#\nAll other tools are second-best to APM, and none of them can take its place. However, there are numerous other options that help provide some level of insight all the same.\nAll Divio applications include metrics. As well as showing whether an application is consuming excessive resources, metrics can also show when changes in consumption occurred (for example, following deployment of new code).\nIn most cases, users will find that their under-performing application is not in fact running out of RAM or CPU - a clear indication that adding resources by upgrading a subscription will not be a solution.\nYou may find that RAM and/or CPU consumption are reaching exceeding expected values. These can both in themselves cause degraded performance. In that case, it is possible that the application should be allocated more resources, but it is equally likely that finding ways to reduce its resource consumption will be a better solution (a memory leak for example will not be solved by adding more RAM).\nAll Divio applications provide runtime logs, accessible from the Environments view as well as from the terminal (e.g.\ndivio app logs --tail live). Logs show for example how long requests take to serve and reporting internal\nerrors, but this provides only a basic insight into behaviour. However, as with metrics, referring to runtime logs can\nhelp eliminate suspects from your enquiries quite quickly.\nDebug tools (such as Django Debug Toolbar), though not fully-fledged APM products, can also provide a degree of insight into an application‚Äôs performance, especially when investigating the behaviour of an application when dealing with a particular request, and can be easier to set up and use. They are especially useful in development environments.","Different IT infrastructure monitoring tools are designed to offer visibility into particular aspects of your overall IT system, including applications, servers, logs, and more.

Francis, despite producing Spanish-language music, admits to speaking only 'm√°s o menos' Spanish and works around this limitation by focusing on melody and production rather than lyrical content, letting his Spanish-speaking collaborators handle the actual lyrics while he treats their voices more like instruments.","context":["Larry Achiampong is a Ghanaian-British artist based in London. In 2008, he graduated with an MA in Sculpture from the Slade School of Fine Art, University College London. He works across media including sculpture, painting, photo collage, performance and sound. Achiampong has exhibited, performed and presented projects both in the United Kingdom and internationally. He has shown work at Tate Britain, Tate Modern, Iniva, the ICA, and Yinka Shonibare‚Äôs Guest Project Space. In June this year he presented a new hour-long performance at Tate Modern as part of the Group Show ‚ÄòProject Visible‚Äô. Achiampong‚Äôs experiments with sound (as musical and archival material) led to the production of the vinyl LP Meh Mogya (Sample of Me) in the form of a concept beat tape. His concept beat tapes, which also includes the recent LP More Mogya, overlay a rich variety of sounds and samples that draw on his Ghanaian heritage, his parent‚Äôs Highlife record collection and the music culture he grew up with in London. In March this year he was invited by Tom Ravenscroft to present a guest mix on BBC Radio 6 music, which included tracks by his alias Black Ph03nix. Achiampong has also recently produced the mixtape ‚ÄòAfrica in your Earbuds‚Äô for Okay Africa a hub for African youth culture.

My parents came over to the UK from Ghana in the late 1970s/early 1980s. I was born here in East London, and raised in Bethnal Green. I‚Äôm interested in visiting the past, in looking back retrospectively. Whenever I‚Äôm asked the question: ‚ÄòWhere are you from?‚Äô I respond (in an East London accent): ‚ÄòFrom Ghana‚Äô. The response is: ‚ÄòBut your accent doesn‚Äôt say that‚Äô. I was brought up with the values and customs of a Ghanaian, more specifically of an Ashanti person. I grew up with these but when I was out playing with my friends in East London it was fish and chips, football, that type of thing. I‚Äôm interested in the relationship between my Ghanaian heritage and the experiences of growing up in East London in the 1980s and the 1990s. People ask me: ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt you see yourself as British?‚Äô My response is: ‚ÄòI see myself as a Londoner‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know what British means. I think these ideas inform my work. I like to have discussions about where I come from, and I explore these conversations in my work.\nWhere does the Cloud Face come from? It‚Äôs a continuous presence in your work so far. Race is an important aspect of your work, and the Cloud Face holds so many derogatory images, stereotypes and prejudices. For example, blackface minstrel shows and vaudeville.\nThere are many images, thoughts, memories and experiences that inform the Cloud Face. We ate a lot of Robertson‚Äôs marmalade as kids. I always found the experience of looking at the Golly character, which was part of their branding, strange. It looked so alien. Why would this kind of image exist? Over the years I put the pieces together. I believe John Robertson (the son of James Robertson who started the Robertson brand) based the Golly character on the black rag dolls he saw children playing with in America. The reason the Robertson‚Äôs brand discontinued the character around the early 2000s was not because it was derogatory but because (from a business point of view) they found that it no longer appealed to their fan base. So their reason for getting rid of it was entirely to do with business. It‚Äôs not to do with ethics or with what‚Äôs right or wrong. A lot of this derogatory stuff is still in the air. It‚Äôs there in the art world too. This motivated me to create the Cloud Face.\nYour work draws a lot from comic culture: the Cloud Face and motifs such as speech bubbles.\nI grew up reading a lot of comics and graphic novels, including Vendetta by Alan Moore. It presents a vision of Britain that is dystopian and bleak (a brutal, totalitarian state). It deals with themes of prejudice, race and xenophobia. One of the characters is a guy called V identifiable only by the Guy Fawkes mask he wears. He represents a spirit of rebellion and resistance. You might recognise this mask from the Occupy Movement: the smiling face with the moustache. It comes from this comic. I always found him interesting but could never relate to the Guy Fawkes mask. My own practice is about telling stories through images and themes that I can relate to.\nWhen you talk about race or class in your work it‚Äôs something that is deeply embodied and experienced. It‚Äôs not just a theoretical abstraction for you.\nI studied in an environment where there were no black or working class people apart from me. It was alienating in some ways: studying in a place where people are talking about issues to do with race or class from a very different point of view. I could enter these conversations but I never felt comfortable with them. I felt that the way these conversations took place was very patronising, and people were talking about things that they hadn‚Äôt actually experienced.\nA lot of your work deals with the experience of being a black man. I‚Äôve noticed how in London it‚Äôs black men that get stopped by the police most of the time.\nYes. It happens to me. My work is the only place I can talk about these issues (whether it‚Äôs a one-liner or whether it explores an event in a very visceral way). ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs Not (Racist). He Owns a Black Cat‚Äô dealt with the John Terry and Anton Ferdinand incident, and the sensationalism attached to racism within football on the pitch, in the stands and amongst the commentators. It‚Äôs not a new conversation. It‚Äôs been made new by the media. This stuff has always been there. I actually made works years before that explored football culture. You‚Äôre dealing with powerful cultural icons. That particular moment dealt with whether there was racism or not. He obviously had been racist. You look at the footage; you look at the evidence and what was covered up. I was interested in what people were trying to cover up.\nWhat do you think the power of art is in entering an event such as this?\nI think the artwork allows a moment of focus. I‚Äôm not talking about who is winning or losing the premier league. I‚Äôm putting a moment under a magnifying glass. That‚Äôs what the art does. Art can isolate or focus on a moment in time. I was interested in taking a freeze frame of a moment and exploding it. I‚Äôm interested in looking at images from different perspectives. I play with the original image or photograph, and deface it just a little bit.‚ÄòCloud‚Äô, Live performance at Tate Modern, 2013.\nThe live performance at Tate Modern (in the Poetry and Dream exhibition space) was interesting from the point of view of inserting a discussion about race into an institutional space.\nI wanted to recreate a 2007 photo collage of myself in a suit with the Cloud Face. I was interested in the idea of bringing the Cloud Face into a three dimensional, living, breathing world or environment. Bringing the Cloud Face into the museum was interesting. It was not just about the experience of being black or an artist but also about the experience of going to gallery shows. There are things that are not really spoken about. Why not have a conversation without being literal. It was about bringing up a discussion that just isn‚Äôt being had, simply by existing. I sat very still. Like the museum invigilator, the invisible people. I wanted to make things that are invisible, and not spoken about, visible. I couldn‚Äôt see through the face. It was very claustrophobic and difficult to breath. It was important that it took place in the Picasso space. I wanted to reclaim a power or energy by existing as the Cloud Face in that space. Picasso claimed the energy of various African arts and traditions. I thought: ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt I do that as well?‚Äô I chose not to perform at the entrance to that particular part of Tate: you also had to walk all the way into the space to experience the work. It became a journey.\nI would like to take the Cloud Face to other gallery spaces or city streets. What would it mean for the Cloud Face to walk down Liverpool Street or through Mayfair; or through Manhattan or central Tokyo? I thought that the gallery space was a good place to start that conversation. The form of the gallery space is very interesting to me but on the other hand I am very conflicted about it. That‚Äôs why I did the ‚ÄòJam in the Dark‚Äô project.‚ÄòThe Cut‚Äô, Acrylic, emulsion, poster paint, spray paint and marker on wooden hoarding, 2010.\nWhat was the impetus for ‚ÄòJam in the dark‚Äô.\nI was thinking about gallery spaces, which I am very conflicted about. Why do we always have galleries that are white walls, and grey floors? What does it mean? What do these spaces say about power and hierarchy? I wanted to flip that on its head. As I do, as the prankster. Let‚Äôs turn out the lights. Let‚Äôs paint the walls black and make it as dark as possible. You can‚Äôt see anyone around you. You don‚Äôt know what they look like. You‚Äôre creating a moment where people are on an equal footing but through fears and through the senses. Through restricting some senses others are heightened. You can‚Äôt see, you‚Äôre being restricted, and held back.\nIt‚Äôs an interesting idea because prejudice is so much an aspect of sight and vision. You as a visual artist are denying or obfuscating sight. You also emphasise bodies in a space. The room is dark, and so vision is obscured? There is also music? Musicians are literally jamming in the dark? It is all left to chance? John Cage is perhaps a reference point. Sound is disrupted and dissonant?\nYes. I invited a range of musicians to come into the space to communicate with one another through sound. Everyone, musicians included, was on one level space. There was no stage. I would like to take the ‚ÄòJam in the Dark‚Äô performances into three-dimensional sound, which would entirely fill the space. Then, the viewer, invited into that space, would be entirely engulfed by sound.\nYou seem to be very interested in the body, and the body‚Äôs relationship to music and sound; and to vision.\nThis relates to my interest in audio samples: how do these embody the lives of individuals through time? For the Meh Mogya project I asked myself the question: ‚ÄòHow would I be able to hear a portrait, of where I come from, of who I am?‚Äô We use our vision to create ideas about portraits. Very rarely do we do that with sound. For me, sound is something that is under-rated as a way of expressing where it is we come from. I looked through my parent‚Äôs record collection, their Highlife collection. The samples for the first part of Meh Mogya came from these records. Records associated with my childhood memories. There are these moments of discovery and re-discovery. I‚Äôm isolating sounds, and chopping them up on an audio sampler. I turn these into miniature beats. I‚Äôm employing some of the techniques that are used within hip hop, within some disco and electronic music (within popular culture). I take on the element of the loop, of repetition, repeating a moment in time. But even when that moment in time is repeated it can sound different when that loop is re-visited again and again. You also have the context and history of Highlife.\nMore Mogya can be downloaded from www.larryachiampong.co.uk. You can also listen to tracks on soundcloud. Look for Blackph03nix.\nElaborate on Highlife, its relationship to Ghana.\nHighlife is a sound that was developed in Ghana. I focused on Highlife music produced between the 1960s through to the 1980s. This is considered by some to be the golden era of Highlife music. Highlife is not that well documented but it pre-dates jazz. It begins in the early 1900s. Companies like HMV were working with fisherman and sailors from the coast, and would record their sounds. With trade you also had western instruments that were married into traditional sounds. Highlife came from working class people who were talking about various aspects of life but approaching it from a very optimistic point of view. It‚Äôs a very happy sound. In a way it‚Äôs an antithesis to the blues. It doesn‚Äôt focus on sadness. It has a big band sound. Each musician plays a separate sound or rhythm but everything has to lock. When the rhythms are isolated they might sound really simple but when you have five or ten or fifteen it becomes this polyrhythmic assault of sound that just pulls you in.\nWhile I was listening to the sounds from my parents record collection, I also decided to research some of the artists. I came across Professor John Collins, a musicologist based at the University of Ghana in Accra. He‚Äôs written on various forms of African music including Highlife. He also established the Bokoor African Popular Music Archives Foundation in Accra. It houses material based on Highlife music and music that connects to it. I got in touch with him about my project: the idea of bringing together the Highlife sounds with contemporary technology and beat making culture.\nAfter I got in touch with him, I turned my bedroom into a production studio. I listened closely to the Highlife sounds. I isolated the loops, recreated them, chopped them up, turned them into beats and put them together one by one. I then sent this to John Collins and we began a conversation.\nThe ‚ÄòGlyth‚Äô series is based on personal family photographs? It‚Äôs interesting how you re-stage these images, you add the Cloud Face and you work with their imperfections.\nMy mother would send photographs to family in Ghana with the letters that she wrote. She would very deliberately orchestrate the photographs. It was almost unreal. It was like we were demonstrating products in a catalogue. I like the accidents that happen in family photographs or snapshots: things like shadows. I think you only get these interesting accidents with family portraiture. You try and set everything up as perfectly as possible but there‚Äôs always an imperfection. I scan the photographs. I don‚Äôt do too much to the image. It‚Äôs the process of selecting the image that‚Äôs most interesting to me.\nAshanti culture is grounded in so much symbolism and it‚Äôs very visual. For example, cloths are not just cloths. The motifs that decorate them symbolise something. They invoke proverbs or they tell you a story about the wearer. Different cultures have different ideas about what an artist is, and what a creative person is.\nOn the record design for More Mogya I incorporated the symbol Sankofa: a bird with its head turned backwards. It signifies the proverb ‚Äòlook back to go forward‚Äô. You have to understand where it is you‚Äôre coming from before you can create something for the future. This is a very important symbol for me as a man, as a black person, and as an artist. ‚ÄòGolden Stool‚Äô, Sese wood, spray paint, 2013.","Best known for his arena-caliber EDM and bombastic bass drops, Los Angeles-born DJ-producer Dillon Francis has a long and storied history with Latin music. He began releasing mostly dubstep tracks in 2010, when the then-nascent moombahton genre ‚Äî which combines electro-house with Latin-tinged reggaeton beats ‚Äî first took the Internet by storm. Francis then notched his first major hit in 2011 via ‚ÄúQue Que,‚Äù a Spanish-language track alongside mentor and frequent collaborator Diplo, featuring Dominican-American artist Maluca. Fast-forward to 2018, and Francis has reached the cusp of a new career chapter: Dillon Francis, Latin pop crossover star.\nSeptember 28th sees the release of Wut Wut, Francis‚Äô second full-length project and his first (mostly) Spanish-language album. Executive produced by Mexican EDM vet Toy Selectah, Wut Wut features a cast of collaborators from across the Latin pop spectrum including Ximena Sari√±ana, iLe of Calle 13 fame, Lao Ra, De La Ghetto and others. As the follow-up to his 2014 debut, Money Sucks, Friends Rule, the new album sees Francis expanding his production palette into sounds sweeping pop radio: from his moombahton roots on the club-ready ‚ÄúBaBaBa‚Äù featuring Young Ash, to rugged Latin trap on ‚ÄúVen‚Äù featuring Arc√°ngel and Quimico Ultra Mega.\nRecorded in New York City, Miami, Mexico City and the Dominican Republic, Wut Wut comes during the height of today‚Äôs Latin pop explosion, which has shepherded multiple crossover hits across mainstream genres. EDM is one of the latest industries to ride the Latin pop wave: Steve Aoki‚Äôs track, ‚ÄúAzukita,‚Äù features reggaeton king Daddy Yankee, Latin trap duo Play-N-Skillz and merengue icon Elvis Crespo; while David Guetta‚Äòs new album, 7, features two tracks with J Balvin, including the Spanish-language ‚ÄúPara Que Te Quedes.‚Äù\nBut as Francis puts it, Wut Wut is no basic bandwagon fare. Rather, it‚Äôs his way of paying homage to the sounds that gave him everything. ‚ÄúLatin music is a part of what I do,‚Äù he tells Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never not be making moombahton.‚Äù Rolling Stone spoke with the American producer about his latest venture into Latin pop and Latin music‚Äôs ongoing influence on his career.\nFirst of all, you grew up in L.A. Do you speak Spanish?\nUhhh ‚Ä¶ m√°s o menos (more or less). [Laughs]\nSo then there‚Äôs a potential that you don‚Äôt know what the singers are singing about on your new album.\nYes, but there‚Äôs a reasoning behind it. Whenever I would get in the studio with anyone that spoke English, anytime they would ask me for any advice, I would give them the most horrible advice on what to sing. When I got in the studio with most of the people [for Wut Wut], they would tell me what they‚Äôre talking about and then I would say, ‚ÄúHey, can you sing it this way?‚Äù Rather than telling them what to sing about, it would just be more like melody and production, so it was more of using their voice like another instrument.\nWhat were some of your earliest memories with Latin music, especially for someone like you who grew up in Los Angeles?\nI definitely remember the Cadillacs from Training Day just blasting reggaeton. I feel like that was like the most clich√© thing to happen in Los Angeles, just an amazing lowrider playing a Daddy Yankee song or something. Growing up in West L.A., you just hear it all the time. But I never really deep dove into the music until I found this dude Munchi‚Äòs music on SoundCloud. That was when I was starting to become a music producer. Then I started seeing this little tag called ‚Äúmoombahton.‚Äù When I started hearing it, I was like, ‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù I‚Äôm trying to DJ, I don‚Äôt know what tempo this is. It just sounds incredible ‚Äî I need to see what‚Äôs happening. I had a house record called ‚ÄúMasta Blasta‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I put it up on SoundCloud, I sent it to Munchi. I was like, ‚ÄúAlright, this is the genre for me.‚Äù There [were] no rules yet and the community was so tight because there [weren‚Äôt] a lot of producers doing it. That‚Äôs really where I started deep diving into the sounds and everything with it.\nThe album has a long history, dating back to the 2016 Latin Grammys where you met De La Ghetto and Latin alternative producer El Guincho. How does the initial sketch of Wut Wut compare to the final product?\n[Originally], we weren‚Äôt even going to get a lot of vocals on it. It was gonna be like one-shots in Spanish, like doing ‚ÄúGet Low‚Äù in Spanish. We hit up Toy Selectah. He got a bunch of one-shots, but he also got a bunch of verses from people. From that, it kind of just started turning into something else. There [were] no expectations. The whole record was just to go have fun again and have a great time making music.\nEven before that, Wut Wut traces back to your 2011 Westside! EP, which features ‚ÄúQue Que,‚Äù one of your biggest moombahton hits and one of your earliest Spanish-language tracks. What‚Äôs the connection between Westside! and Wut Wut?\nThe record ‚ÄúBaBaBa‚Äù with Young Ash [off Wut Wut] is the closest record to what ‚ÄúQue Que‚Äù was when I was making it. I‚Äôve made songs like ‚ÄúAnywhere‚Äù and ‚ÄúComing Over‚Äù [with Kygo], where they have more melodic sensibilities. It was taking that and trying to put it into a project that actually is cohesive. If you listen to my last album, that is the most non-cohesive project ever. That‚Äôs where I was like, ‚ÄúI need to focus and make everything sound like they actually exist in one project.‚Äù That‚Äôs what I felt like I did with Wut Wut, where it was like honing in on everything that I‚Äôve learned in the past 10 years of touring and making music and trying to make a cohesive album that has a great concept.\nAre you now noticing an EDM-Latin pop crossover trend?\nI guess so. I‚Äôm not trying to say, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm the first one that was doing it before it became a thing.‚Äù But I‚Äôve been doing it since 2012, and I was just kind of going back to it. When we were working on [Wut Wut], ‚ÄúDespacito‚Äù and ‚ÄúMi Gente‚Äù didn‚Äôt exist yet. Neither did ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù with Justin Bieber, which I feel like was a big catalyst. A lot of my fans will always be like, ‚ÄúIt sucks that moombahton‚Äôs dead.‚Äù And it‚Äôs funny because every single pop record in the past year has been a reggaeton/moombahton record, with like a melodic vocal drop. If anything, it‚Äôs like the most thriving genre possible right now. Mine was just going back to having fun and working with artists that I thought were just going to heighten the project and understand what the project was.\nSo this album is in no way hopping on the bandwagon of the Latin pop explosion?\nI never really wanted to say that, but I feel like people could see that if they look at my history of music. But [before] I put out the first record [off the album], ‚ÄúVen,‚Äù I had literally cleared out my Instagram to two things: a picture with Arc√°ngel from back when we worked on the record and then the other one was a video with Toy Selectah and I in the studio with De La Ghetto and El Guincho working on the records, and it was [dated] like November 4, 2016. So I was trying to lightly do that. [There have] definitely been people calling me out, being like, ‚ÄúDude, you‚Äôre jumping on the bandwagon, man. You‚Äôre trying to be like ‚ÄòDespacito.'‚Äù If you listen to the album, none of it sounds like ‚ÄúDespacito.‚Äù It literally all sounds like my music.\nYour brand and your image have been tied to a lot of aspects related to Latin culture, from your history with moombahton to your social media character, Gerald the Pi√±ata. You even brought out a mariachi band at Lollapalooza earlier this year. Have you ever faced any backlash from the Latin community or other groups for using such staples of their culture?\nNo. It‚Äôs pretty nuts that I haven‚Äôt, to be honest. When I was in Mexico promoting ‚ÄúWe the Funk‚Äù [featuring singer Fuego], everyone was like, ‚ÄúThank you so much for making music in Spanish, thank you for pushing the music.‚Äù That‚Äôs really what the whole project was about: to show people where I originally got [inspiration] from. Moombahton is reggaeton meets dance music, and that‚Äôs why I wanted to work with Spanish [-language] artists, so that people could understand that this is where the music came from. So if anything, I‚Äôm just trying to give back to where a lot of my success came from.\nWhen you look back, what role would you say moombahton and Latin music have had on your overall career?\nI‚Äôve always gone back to it. I like taking a break from it because I do produce it so much. But I always want to try to bring something fresh back when I go into it, because it‚Äôs such a fun [sound]. It‚Äôs one of those things where [if] it‚Äôs just the perfect setting, it goes off.\nWill we see more Latin albums or Spanish-language albums from you in the future?\nLatin music is a part of what I do. I‚Äôll never not be making moombahton. And I‚Äôve definitely been working with other artists as well, where it‚Äôs working on records just for them to put out. I‚Äôm definitely gonna be doing a lot more production stuff for Latin artists, which is something I never thought that people would be coming to me for."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8e639910-07f7-41b6-b09f-c45f3d427202>","<urn:uuid:e0eba87a-2fc5-4425-ad54-5ac57def8a13>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why are some oils better for biodiesel production than others, and how does this compare to their suitability for dairy processing?","answer":"For biodiesel production, cooking oils like canola are considered best because they age slowly, remain liquid at low temperatures, and have high energy content. Drying oils with three double bonds per fatty acid are poor choices as they break down quickly. In dairy processing, the focus is different - the fat composition affects product characteristics and digestibility. For instance, goat milk's smaller fat globules and higher proportion of medium chain fatty acids make it more digestible than cow's milk, though both have similar total fat percentages.","context":["Biodiesel Feedstock Oils\nBy Rick Da Tech\nWe can make Biodiesel from any plant or animal-derived oil. However, some oils are better than others for making biodiesel. We can partly describe an oil by its source, like peanut oil, canola oil, soy oil, beef tallow, and on and on, but to fully describe an oil we also need to know more about it. We need to know information like, is it hydrogenated, is it a drying oil, or a non-drying oil. Waste oils need more information, like FFA and water content.\n\"Organic oils are three long strings of fatty acids attached to a glycerin molecule. The Fatty Acids can vary in length and in how they are bonded or put together. The way we describe Fatty Acids is by the number of carbon atoms in it and the number of double bonds. We typically see between 12 and 26 carbon molecules and zero to three double bonds in our oil.\nDifferent oils have different blends of fatty acids as you can see from the chart below.\nPercentage Fatty Acid Composition of Various Oils\n|Fat or Oil||12:0||14:0||16:0||18:0||18:1||18:2||18:3||20:0||20:1||22:1|\n|Yellow Grease (typical)||.||2||23||13||44||7||1||.||.||.|\n|Palm kernel oil||48||16||8||.||15||3||.||.||.||.|\n|Pongamia pinnata oil||.||.||4-8||3-9||45-71||11-18||.||2-5||10-12||4-5|\nIf you look at the top row, the numbers indicate how many carbon atoms are in the oil, a colon then the number of double bonds. The numbers in the middle of the chart are the percentage composition of the fatty acid listed on the left.\nEach type of fatty acid has a different freezing point, a different tendency to polymerize (dry into a film), and a different energy content.\nNutritional Makup of Various Oils *\n|Palm Kernal Oil||81%||11%||2%|\n* note- approximated values - actual values vary depending on the individual plant and extraction methods.\nFatty acids without double bonds are called saturated fats. The lower the saturated fat content, the lower the gel point of the biodiesel made from it.\nFatty acids containing double bonds are called unsaturated. The double bonding site is somewhat unstable and can break off or chemically alter in the presence of heat or water. Unsaturated fats tend to spoil faster than saturated fats. If an oil contains too many double bonded sites, the oil becomes a \"drying oil.\"\nDrying oils are not good for making biodiesel as they break down quickly. They usually contain three double bonds per fatty acid. Just to give you an idea, they are used in paints and varnish and dry quickly to form a tough film. Drying oils age and turn acidic quickly, sometimes the biodiesel made from drying oils can degrade overnight. Examples of drying oils include Linseed oil, Walnut oil, and Poppy oil.\nCooking oils make some of the best biodiesel. These are unsaturated oils with a single or double bond per fatty acid. Canola is probably the best oil for making biodiesel, since it ages slowly, remains liquid to low temperatures, and has a high energy content. Olive oil is another good oil for making biodiesel. It has a slightly higher gel point, is slightly less stable, and has about the same energy content as Canola oil due to its slightly increased polyunsaturated and saturated content.\nHydrogenated oils are oils that have been chemically altered to remove the double bonding. The purpose behind hydrogenation is to lengthen the shelf life of cooking oil, but they are unhealthy oils for our bodies. Also, it is difficult to make biodiesel from hydrogenated oils. That is not by accident; the best cooking oils make the best biodiesel. There is a persistent myth on the internet that Chinese restaurants have the best oils for biodiesel, that is true if they use unsaturated, non-hydrogenated oils. Look for restaurants that sell healthy foods; their WVO makes the best biodiesel. Not only do they use the better oils, but they are more likely to be lower in FFA than other restaurants due to their cooking practices.\nCooking practices play a vital role in WVO quality, primarily on FFA content. FFA or Free Fatty Acids form when the long carbon chain breaks away from the glycerin molecule. These fatty acids are acidic and turn into soap when using our normal base catalyst processing method. They can only be turned into biodiesel if we use Acid Esterification. The soap made from oils high in FFA can cause problems in processing. To make matters worse, FFA are hygroscopic, meaning they attract water. Oils high in FFA can contain as much as 50% water.\nIf the restaurant cooks at too high a temperature, the oil breaks down quickly and forms FFA. They need to keep the oil temperature below 300¬∫F both for healthy food and good biodiesel. There are two important temperatures when cooking in oil, the flashpoint, and the smoke point. Flashpoint is the lowest temperature at which oil can catch on fire. The smoke point is the temperature at which the oil starts to smoke. Typical smoke points for new oils are around 450¬∫F, however, as the FFA content increases, both the smoke point and flash point go down. Some restaurants wait to change out their oil until the smoke point drops to their cooking temperature. I completely avoid those restaurants.\nIf the restaurant filters their oil every night before closing, the oil lasts much longer. It is because the breading and stuff that can be filtered out absorbs water from the atmosphere. The water then reacts with the oil to make more FFA. Filtering has been shown to keep FFA levels below 1ml titrations for up to a week of heavy use. Without filtering, the same oil can reach titration levels of 10 or 15 ml in just a few days.\nFood Fats and Oils (2006) ISEO 2006 This publication addresses many technical issues associated with fats and oils including their chemical composition and their role in the diet.

The second page of a three-page article contains a chart showing the fatty acid composition of various oils similar to the chart above.","Composition of Cow, Sheep and Goat Milks\nTable 1: Chemical Composition of Milk from different species.\n|Total Solid %||12.2||12.0||16.3|\nTable 2: Principle fatty acids (g/100g fat) in milk fats from different species.\nNote: The tabled figures above are averages obtained through scientific studies. Milk composition varies according to feed, breeds of animal, stages of lactation and the environment.\nAll of the products produced at Meredith Dairy are made using pasteurisation.\nCow‚Äôs milk and Goat milk have a similar percentage of fat and protein in the milk (see Table 1.). However the differences in the size and composition of the fat molecules in the milk between the two species attribute to easier digestion of goat milk.\nWhen compared to cow‚Äôs milk, the fat globules contained in goat milk are much smaller in size. As a result of this there is an increase in the surface area of the fats which are exposed to lipase enzymes within the intestines which allows a more efficient break down (digestion) of these molecules.\nIn addition to this, there are a greater proportion of medium chain fatty acids in goat milk fat when compared to cow‚Äôs milk (see Table 2.). The smaller chain size allows the lipase enzymes to process these compounds more quickly.\nSome goat milk products have a strong and sometimes offensive flavour. This flavour is due to the presence of medium-chain fatty acids (capric, caprylic and dcaproic acid) combined with bacterial enzymes (lipase) which breakdown these molecules to produce the ‚Äúgoaty‚Äù flavour. Matured goat cheese products typically present this flavour attribute, however fresh goat cheese such as the products manufactured at Meredith Dairy (Chevre, Marinated Cheese) should be absent of this flavour. Fresh, correctly treated goat milk usually has a very neutral and clean flavour.\nFood Allergies and Intolerance\nBelow is an excerpt taken from the Victorian Government website: Better Health Channel, if you would like further information please follow the link provided and consult your local health professional when seeking medical advice.\nAllergy is an immune response\nAllergies are an overreaction of the body‚Äôs immune system to a specific part of a food, usually a protein. These proteins may be from foods, pollens, house dust, animal hair or moulds. They are called allergens. The word ‚Äòallergy‚Äô means that the immune system has responded to a harmless substance as if it were toxic.\nFood intolerance is a chemical reaction\nFood intolerance is a ‚Äòchemical‚Äô reaction that some people have after eating or drinking some foods; it is not an immune response. Food intolerance has been associated with asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Food intolerance is much more common than food allergy.\nMilk Allergies and Intolerance\nGoat‚Äôs milk protein has a similar structure to that of cow‚Äôs milk thus goat milk is not suitable for those people with a true cow‚Äôs milk allergy (IgE-mediated immune response). Intolerances to cow‚Äôs milk based dairy products may be overcome by switching to goat or sheep based products however this will vary from person to person.\nIf you are unsure whether you are intolerant or allergic to milk products it is best to seek advice from your doctor or health professional before trying new foods.\nPregnancy & Our Cheese\nThe issue with pregnancy and cheese is the potential harm to the baby & mother caused by food contaminated with a bacteria called ‚ÄúListeria Monocytogenes (LM) referred to as Listeriosis. You should make yourself familiar with this bacteria and foods which can become contaminated with LM.\nThere are several strains of Listeria but only the Monocytogenes strain is harmful to health. LM, mostly referred to as just Listeria, has been found in small goods, including smoked fish, dips, salads, as well as soft cheese. There are incidents of LM in both unpasteurised and pasteurised cheeses as the bacteria can be present not only in the unpasteurised milk but in the factory environment. By law any food containing this bacteria must be removed from circulation.\nAll of the cheeses we make at Meredith are pasteurised, eliminating the presence of this bacteria in the milk for cheese making, but contamination after pasteurisation is a risk and has occurred at other cheese factories.\nAt Meredith Dairy, we test our cheeses and the factory environment for LM. To date we have not had any laboratory tests indicating the presence of LM in our factory environment or cheeses. This is reassuring for our company, but this bacteria is commonly found in the environment, in soil, wet areas & in animal feed.\nPregnancy is a very special time and the choice to eat processed foods including cheese is a personal one, perhaps avoiding processed foods whilst pregnant is a small price to pay.\nLactose, literally meaning ‚Äúmilk sugar‚Äù, is the primary sugar found in milk from most mammals. Those who have a sensitivity or intolerance toward lactose lack the ability to produce the enzyme (lactase) that is required for the break down and digestion of lactose in the human body.\nFermented dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, are manufactured using starter cultures (good bacteria) whose primary role is to convert the lactose present in the milk into lactic acid which forms an integral part of the finished product.\nDepending on their sensitivity, lactose intolerant people can better tolerate fermented dairy products due to the action of the starter cultures consuming the lactose in the milk. All products manufactured at Meredith Dairy are considered high-acid thus a high portion of lactose in the product has consumed by the starter cultures making the products more favourable for those lactose sensitive people who enjoy dairy products.\nContent on this website is provided for education and information purposes only.

I have not found any scientific based evidence to confirm that the canola we use is bad. There are references indicating that heating can change the chemical structure of cooking oils, but we use only cold-pressed oil, and don‚Äôt use any heating or cooking to make the marinade. Furthermore, cold pressing excludes the use of chemical oil extraction.\nThe cold-pressed canola we use is GMO free, grown in Australia, has a neutral taste, is free of taints and trans fats. Canola grown in the Northern Hemisphere often is GMO, not so in Australia. Australian farmers who grow GM canola, are listed on a register. We use only GMO free oils. Click here for more info.\nWe use blended Australian edible oils, Extra Virgin olive Oil (EVOO) & GMO free Canola.\n- Our product tastes better with this blend.\n- The Australian EVOO has a very robust flavour. The unblended Extra Virgin Olive oil overpowers the other flavours in the marinade.\n- Aust grown olives contain high levels of wax and when cold pressed, the wax is retained in the olive oil. At refrigeration temps the EVOO wax solidifies and looks unsightly.\n- The olive oil characteristics can vary due to seasonal conditions. A blended product helps maintain the colour, flavour and texture of the marinade.\n- Australian Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than any other oil, is second only to olive oil with levels of monounsaturated fats. It contains Omega-3 fatty acids which lowers levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. (Omega-3 is known to contribute to heart health, brain growth and development)\n- We use only cold pressed oils. The edible oils are erucic acid free.\n- After extensive sensory analysis we wanted a marinade with a neutral taste, good colour, light, smooth taste, free of cholesterol and Trans fats.\n- We use only GMO free edible oil, grown in Australia.\nUnfortunately there has been a lot of misrepresentations and generalisations made regarding plastics and their potential to migrate into our foods.\nThere is some truth in these claims, however these occurrences are only specific to certain types of plastics under certain conditions. The classic case where this issue can occur is with the use of cling film with the offender being the PVC (polyvinylchloride) component.\nWhen this product is in contact with fatty foods (e.g. meat and cheese) and is subject to a heat process such as a microwave this is where the migration can occur. This same issue can be applied to those plastic containers that are not deemed microwave safe. If I could direct you to some further reading on the link below, it will give you a little more insight into the issues at hand.\n- _A.Y, T. (2004). Yoghurt: Science and Technology.

{"question":"Wat are principles for serpentine retaining wall strength, and what stability conditions must it meet please?","answer":"Serpentine retaining walls gain strength through their curved form, similar to how corrugated metal roofing is stronger than flat metal. The serpentine form was explored by Thomas Jefferson who realized it would be stronger than straight walls. Additionally, these walls require specific stability conditions: they must resist lateral pressure, be safe from sliding, not overturn from lateral pressure, have proper foundation bearing capacity, prevent water accumulation through weep holes, and include expansion joints every 6-9m for masonry walls. The wall should also have proper batter (lean into the embankment) of at least 1-2 inches per foot of rise to create equilibrium between earth pressure and gravity.","context":["In the last post I did for this series on tips for building a dry stack stone wall\nI showed how I go about building a dry stack wall.\nThis time I want to drive home a few of the principles that I think explain\nwhy these walls work the way they do and are fundamental to the success of a wall.\nThe posts to date in this continuing series geared for the owner builder are:\nTo start let's look at the serpentine form that I use in my walls.\nThere are no straight lines here and actually I avoid them whenever possible.\nAs I mentioned in a previous post there is nothing inherent in stone that requires a straight line,\nunlike lumber, plywood, sheetrock, and even cement block that are designed for a lineal layout.\nThat is one of the things that makes stone so attractive to people\nand makes it one of the most natural of building materials.\nThis is a form that Thomas Jefferson explored in a very symmetrical way in the brick walls\nhe designed at Montecillo and on the grounds of the University of Virginia,\nas he realized that the serpentine form would be stronger than a straight wall,\nparticularly in freestanding walls.\nThink of a piece of corrugated metal roofing.\nWith the corrugation the metal is quite strong compared to a piece of flat metal,\nwhich can be very flimsy and will not hold it's shape well.\nThe serpentine wall acts much like the corrugation in metal roofing.\nAn even more important factor for the longevity of these walls is the batter\nor the way the wall leans into the embankment that it is built against.\nThis creates a tension between the earth that the wall is holding back\nand gravity that is pushing the wall back into the embankment.\nThis creates an equilibrium that will hopefully be sustained far past our time.\nAs I mentioned in the last post on building the walls, I don't think you can have too much batter.\nThe wall above is 2'+/- high and leans in about 7\" or 8\"\nwhich works out to 3\" or 4\" batter per foot of rise.\nA minimum of 1\" to 2\" per foot of rise would be required at the very least.\nYou may notice that the amount of batter I use varies from place to place in the wall,\nas I tend to go for a rather fluid form.\nIn the first photo of this post the wall shown is 3' high and leans in from 10\" to 14\".\nNow let's look into the wall (above) and see what is in there and why.\nAs I showed in the last post the top of each face stone slopes down as it extends into the wall\nensuring that the next stone on top will have a tendency to slide into the wall and not out.\nOver the lifespan of this wall, the wall will tighten into itself making it stronger as time goes on.\nThis is a fundamental principle for the dry stack stone wall!\nIn contrast to the hardness of stone, the stone wall is flexible\nand is designed for subtle movement that we will never notice,\nimperceptible to any of our senses.\nIn another section of wall above we see the same thing:\nthe face stones are selected and set so they will want to slide into the wall.\nUp on the top of the wall smaller stones have been worked in behind the face stones\nto create a tight fit and to keep debris and mud from working its way into the wall.\nWater will pass through freely.\nIn these last photos let's look at how the wall is designed to withstand hydrostatic forces,\nthat is the power of water and water saturated earth.\nHave you ever noticed a cement block, concrete, or mortared brick or stone retaining wall\nthat has been pushed out (to a negative batter) or knocked over by some unseen force?\nOftentimes that force is the pressure from the buildup of water or wet frozen ground\nhidden behind the wall and resulting from blocked or nonexistent weep holes\nthat gave the water nowhere to go.\nThe dry stack stone wall will never have that problem as it is designed for the free flow of water.\nThe soil behind is unlikely to ever be saturated enough to push the wall out\nor heave in wet freezing temperatures.\nLooking inside the wall in these photos, I think it is easy to see why.\nThese walls can even be incorporated with french drains to deal with areas\nthat have water and drainage problems.\nWhen landscaping around dry stack walls keep in mind that the soil adjacent to the wall\nwill be the first to dry out, making it excellent for plants and trees requiring well drained conditions.\nWe will end with the same photo we started this post with\nto show the finished wall that I am working on in these last 3 photos.\nNext post we will look at some of the different styles I used in the walls shown here.\nThe posts to date in this continuing series are:","Retaining wall is structures that is constructed and designed to resist the lateral pressure of the soil. Apart from soil, the lateral pressure is caused by the pressure of liquid, earth filling, sand, or other granular material filled behind the wall after it‚Äôs constructed. These walls are key components of transportation structures and is commonly employed in the construction of hill roads, masonry dams, abutments and wings walls of bridges etc. The type of material used for the construction of the wall depends on the site conditions, type of material to be retained and also the height of the wall to be constructed. Generally there are 4 types of retaining walls.\nThe primary function of the retaining wall is to hold the earth back without any stability issues like overturning, sliding or structural failure. Water table, earth fill and surcharge are crucial in retaining wall design. Problems may occur when the pressure of the earth is too much and it may tip over. Basically retaining walls are classified into four types, explained below:\nGravity retaining wall\nA type of retaining wall which depends on its own weight alone to stand up is called a gravity retaining wall. This retaining wall is massive. When designing this type of retaining wall, sliding, bearing and overturning forces should be considered and tested. This is most obvious in dams, or simple dykes.\nPile retaining wall\nIn this type of retaining wall, piles are driven so deep into the earth that the top force which usually tries to push the wall over, is held back. It uses counter force to negate the top force and keep it from tipping over. This wall is used in temporary or permanent works as the piled walls provide high stiffness retaining elements which afford large excavation depths with almost no disturbance to surrounding structures or properties.\nCantilever retaining walls\nThese walls are constructed of reinforced concrete. This wall consists of a thin stem and base slab. The base of this retaining wall is divided into two parts namely the heel and the toe. The heel is a part of the base under the backfill. This wall uses much less concrete than retaining walls but it needs careful construction and design. It‚Äôs usually economic till 25ft in height. And these walls can either be precast in a factory or formed on the site.\nAnchored retaining walls\nFor high retaining walls, deep cable rods or wires are driven deep sideways into the earth, then the ends are filled with concrete to provide an ‚Äúanchor‚Äù. These are also known as tiebacks. They work when a thinner retaining wall is needed or space is limited to install other types of retaining walls. They are very effective for loose soils over solid rocks. Anchored retaining walls are usually employed in lots of highways construction departments where they use them to keep rocks from falling on the roads by accidents.\nConditions of Stability of Retaining Walls\nTo ensure the stability of a retaining wall, the following conditions or requirements must be met:\n- The wall should be structurally capable of resisting the pressure applied to it.\n- The wall should be so properly proportioned that it will not get overturned by the lateral pressure.\n- The wall should be safe from consideration of sliding, i.e., the wall should not be pushed out by the lateral pressure.\n- The weight of wall together with the force resulting from the earth pressure acting on it, should not stress its foundation to a value greater than safe bearing capacity of the soil.\n- It is important to prevent accumulation of water behind a retaining wall. The backing material should be suitably drained by providing weep holes.\n- Long masonry retaining walls should be provided with expansion joints located at 6 to 9m apart.\n- Weep holes may be provided to relieve water pressure\nLoads on Retaining Walls\nMajor loads that act on retaining walls are as follows.\n- Self weight of retaining wall\n- Vertical earth pressure (on toe and heel of retaining wall)\n- Lateral earth pressure (active, passive or at-rest pressure)\n- Vertical live load\n- Horizontal Live load Surcharge\n- Horizontal Water pressure\n- Buoyancy or Uplift due to water table"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c1501010-39a8-4cfd-90bf-48831ab99fbf>","<urn:uuid:3fe606ef-7d6c-4b8c-9f45-5f1a1bcde047>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the immediate response procedures for dangerous goods spillage on ships, and what are the long-term environmental impacts of such incidents on marine ecosystems?","answer":"The immediate response procedures for dangerous goods spillage include: sounding the ship's general alarm to notify crew members, evacuating the area to protect people from hazardous material exposure, containing the spill using absorbent materials like sand or earth from the SOPEP locker, and contacting local authorities for assistance. For larger spills, there may be legal requirements to contact the ship's flag state. The long-term environmental impacts on marine ecosystems can be severe, affecting water quality, coastal and marine ecosystems, commercial fishing yields, and the overall health of ocean life. Such pollution can lead to the degradation of wetland vegetation, alteration of local food webs, and impacts on both recreational and commercial marine activities. The effects can persist for decades, affecting not just marine life but also the entire ocean ecosystem which governs climate, weather, and provides life support for all creatures on Earth.","context":["A spillage of dangerous goods occurring on a ship can be a frightening and dangerous situation. It is therefore important to know how to act in these circumstances, in order to minimize the risk of harm to yourself, others, and the environment.\nWhen a spillage is first detected, the crew should take immediate action to contain the spillage. This may involve evacuating the area, restricting access and the use of absorbent materials, such as sand, earth, or sawdust, to soak up the liquid. Using firefighting foam may also be necessary to prevent the spread of fire.\nEvery year, several accidents involving the spillage of dangerous goods occur on ships. These accidents can have serious consequences for the environment, the ship‚Äôs crew and passengers, and the local community.\nIn 2021, a cargo ship carrying fuel and chemicals caught fire off the coast of Sri Lanka and left in its wake an environmental disaster that the island will likely have to live with for decades. This article will provide guidance on what to do in the event of a dangerous goods spillage on a ship.\nWhat To Do If Spillage Of Dangerous Goods Occurs On A Ship?\nIf a spill involving hazardous materials occurs onboard, it is imperative that the procedures laid out in the ship‚Äôs emergency plan be followed. Such responses in the ship‚Äôs emergency plan should be based on Emergency Response Procedures (EmS Guide) for specific dangerous goods having regard to, inter alia, the type of ship, the quantity and type of packaging of the dangerous goods, and whether the goods are stowed on or under deck.\nIn addition, crew members should get a rapid general view of the situation and judge the need for the most urgent actions to be taken, such as medical care of victims, restriction of access, evacuation, reduction of leakages, etc.\nThis will involve ascertaining the properties of the goods involved and taking necessary precautions before initiating spillage control operations. The following are the procedures to follow after ascertaining the properties of the spillage.\nNotify The Ship‚Äôs Command.\nThe first step is to sound the ship‚Äôs general alarm. This will ensure that all crew members are mustered and made aware of the situation so as to be in a position to take appropriate action. It also informs the ship‚Äôs master and officers who are normally in charge of vessels‚Äô emergency actions. The alarm should be sounded as soon as the spillage is discovered.\nEvacuate The Area.\nIn the event of a DG spill on a ship, a major priority is to evacuate the area. This is done in order to protect people from potential exposure to hazardous material. Personnel who are not involved in the emergency response should be evacuated from the scene.\nIf it is safe to do so, the vessel should be moved away from the spill area. This will help to minimize the spread of the DG and reduce the potential for environmental damage. Once the area has been evacuated, emergency responders will begin to assess and address the situation.\nContain The Spill\nNext, you will need to contain the spillage. Use any available materials to do so, such as absorbent pads, sand, or earth. It is an international legal requirement to stock and carry such material in the ship‚Äôs Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) locker. If the spillage is small, you may clean it up yourself. If it is large, or if you are not confident in your ability to clean it up safely, you will need to call for help\nContact The Local Authorities.\nIn the event of a Dangerous Goods spill on a ship, it is important to contact the local authorities as soon as possible. They will be able to provide assistance and guidance on how to deal with the situation. In case of a bigger spill, there might also be a legal requirement to contact the ship‚Äôs flag state.\nThe local authorities will likely have a plan in place for dealing with such an event. They will also have the resources necessary to clean up and mitigate the damage caused by the spill. It is important to follow their instructions and cooperate with them fully in order to ensure that the situation is handled as safely and efficiently as possible.\nWhat Is the EmS code For Dangerous Goods?\nEmergency procedures for ships transporting dangerous goods (EMS) are intended to provide direction on what to do in the event of an incident involving certain dangerous materials. The goods included in the EMS are classified according to the IMDG Code and grouped in such a way that goods requiring the same or similar emergency action appear on the same emergency schedule.\nEach emergency plan is broken down into five sections:\n- Group title accompanied by the emergency schedule number.\n- Specialized equipment is required.\n- Emergency response procedures.\n- Emergency actions.\n- Basic first aid.\nThe EmS code is assigned to each UN Number in column 15 of the Dangerous Goods List in the IMDG Code, chapter 3.2. The EmS code comprises two parts ‚Äì the first part, starting with the letter ‚ÄúF‚Äù, is for fire; the second part, starting with the letter ‚ÄúS‚Äù, is for spillage\nImportance Of Contingency Plan Onboard Ships.\nWhen goods are being transported by sea, there is always a risk of them spilling and causing a dangerous situation. A contingency plan is always important, but it becomes a matter of life and death when there is a spillage of dangerous goods. In the event of such an accident, it is important for crew members to know how to act quickly and safely. The crew must know what to do in order to minimize the damage.\nThere are three key things that need to be done in the event of a spillage of dangerous goods. First, all crew members need to be aware of the emergency and know what to do. Second, the spillage must be contained and prevented from spreading. Third, the cleanup process must be started as soon as possible. If these steps are not followed, it could lead to a serious accident.\nCrews collect lentil-sized plastic pellets from a Sri Lankan beach. By one estimate, the X-Press Pearl was carrying some 75 billion of these pellets when it sank off the coast of Colombo. Photo: Shutterstock/Ruwan Walpola\nWhat Is The Emergency Schedule For Spillage?\nThe emergency schedule for DG spillage on a ship is a plan that outlines the specific actions that should be taken in the event of a hazardous material spill. This plan is designed to minimize the damage and potential health risks associated with a spill and to ensure that the proper authorities are notified and responders are dispatched as quickly as possible.\nThe emergency schedule for DG spillage on a ship will vary depending on the specific situation and the type of hazardous material involved. However, some key steps that are typically included in this plan are:\n- Notifying the captain and crew\n- Securing the area around the spill\n- Containment and cleanup of the hazardous material.\nKeeping international trade moving entails carrying dangerous goods. As with all cargoes, accidents do happen and despite the dangers associated with the carrying of such cargoes, a well-trained crew is the best team to deal with fires on board ships resulting from DG spills. Keeping this in mind onboard training must include EmS to enable the ship crew to be well prepared for incidents involving fire or spillage.","State of the planet2 - Marine environmental polution\n\"It does not matter where on Earth you live; everyone is utterly dependent on the existence of that lovely, living saltwater soup.

{"question":"What are the similarities between preparing sheet music for auditions and composing film scores in terms of professional attention to detail?","answer":"Both require meticulous attention to detail and cleanliness in presentation. For audition sheet music, performers must ensure clean, high-quality copies without missing pages, proper formatting, and clear markings. Similarly, in film composition, every note must be precisely measured and synchronized with the picture, with composers adapting their style to serve the story - for instance, Silverado using exciting themes with guitars for a western feel. In both cases, poor preparation can lead to errors and convey unprofessionalism, potentially affecting success in their respective fields.","context":["Prepare Your Sheet Music Carefully and Maximize Your Audition Success\nSo, you‚Äôve picked the perfect song (using MusicalTheaterSongs.com, of course) and worked on it with your vocal and acting coaches ‚Äî and now it sounds wonderful. The next step toward audition success is properly preparing your sheet music for a sight-reading accompanist.\nUnfortunately, singers often forget this step and end up making their accompanist‚Äôs job harder. This can lead to confusion and errors during the audition. Even more important, it conveys a poor image to the creative team, which wants to gauge what it‚Äôs like to work with you.\nIn a recent episode of ‚ÄúThe Ensemblist,‚Äù a backstage musical theater podcast, composer-lyricist Lynn Ahrens described what she looks for when she auditions actors. She said it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard to separate the vocal from the person and the actor.‚Äù In other words, the energy the actor brings into the room ‚Äî and what that tells the creative team about the actor as a co-worker and collaborator ‚Äî is every bit as important as skill and talent. And one of the ways Lynn judges this is by checking whether ‚Äúthey‚Äôre organized and have their book in order.‚Äù\nIn other words, your audition book and the preparation of the sheet music it holds demonstrates the level of professionalism the creative team can expect you to bring to the production process.\nBelow are some best practices when for preparing your audition binder and sheet music. I chose methods that I think will work in most cases, but always remember to research the preferences of the people you‚Äôre meeting and use common sense.\nYour binder: Limit the number of songs you carry on any given day. I often see actors come in with thick binders filled with sheet music. An audition book is not a repertoire book. You don‚Äôt need to carry every song you‚Äôve ever sung. I seriously question whether actors with overstuffed books are actually prepared to sing all of those songs at a professional level. I‚Äôve heard some casting directors and creative teams say that it also conveys desperation: ‚ÄúI can sing anything you could possibly want, I swear!‚Äù\nOver-filling your audition binder also makes the pages hard to turn for your pianist. And while we‚Äôre talking about page-turns, please don‚Äôt bring your music on a tablet. Sure, it‚Äôs convenient. You can have as many songs as you want. It‚Äôs not practical or appropriate for an audition. Using an iPad is a different experience for your pianist, and it takes some adjusting when you‚Äôve been playing from printed music all day. Do you want your 16-bar audition to be the pianist‚Äôs adjustment period? Page-turns can also be problematic on an iPad.\nTo me, the perfect audition binder is no wider than an inch and is not filled with music past the point of easy page-turns. This isn‚Äôt a hard-and-fast rule, but let‚Äôs two inches is definitely too thick.\nThe condition of the binder also matters. If the teeth on the rings aren‚Äôt flush, it‚Äôs time for a new binder. Otherwise, pages can fall out as your pianist attempts to turn the page.\nWhen you take songs in or out of your binder, always double check to make sure every page gets added or removed. You‚Äôd be shocked at how many times I‚Äôve played an audition for someone who had pages missing. (I had to improv on the spot, with varying degrees of success).\nYour pages: I‚Äôm about to tackle one of the most divisive issues in auditioning: sheet protectors. Some people swear by them. Some detest them. But here‚Äôs the thing: I have yet to meet anyone who totally hates bare paper. After all, no commercially produced sheet music is published in sheet protectors. You‚Äôre better off not using them.\nThat‚Äôs said, make sure your paper is clean. It shouldn‚Äôt be folded or torn, and the holes for the binder rings should be in good shape. Reinforcement stickers will help, but when all holes start to wear out, a quick trip to the copy machine will give you a clean page for a few pennies.\nIf you must use sheet protectors, for the love of all that is holy, please get the anti-glare kind. Many auditions are held in rooms that feature harsh fluorescent lighting, and if you don‚Äôt have anti-glare sheet protectors, your music can be difficult to read.\nYour pages should be double-sided, with music on the front and back of each page. Copying or printing songs single-sided forces your pianist to make twice as many page turns and doubles the opportunities for error.\nYour copies: Clean is the name of the game. Find the best-quality edition of the song that‚Äôs available. You might be able to find a free PDF of the song online, but those copies are often extremely poor in quality, in addition to being illegal.\nIf your music is faint, distorted, cut off, covered in rehearsal marks or annotated by hand, seek a better option. There are websites that make downloading single songs easy and inexpensive (musicnotes.com, sheetmusicdirect.com, newmusicaltheatre.com). Physical copies of scores, vocal selections and song collections are available from a number of sources (Amazon.com is a good one) and are a good investment for anyone making performance a profession. Libraries are also a good place to find books of sheet music and scores. I promise it‚Äôs worth the effort and money to get the best-available edition of your music. It will make your audition more successful.\nWhen photocopying published sheet music, reduce it to fit 8¬Ω x 11 paper. With most published books, a 93-percent reduction will do the trick. Make sure that you have captured all of the music on the copied page. If the left hand is missing at the bottom of the piano part, it‚Äôs going to be a real problem for your accompanist.\nBe sure your sheet music is in the key in which you want to sing. You shouldn‚Äôt expect your accompanist to be able to transpose on sight. Many of the online sheet music sources I listed above can transpose the song for you before printing, and there are many musicians who will transpose songs for you for a fee. If you are going to transpose a song more than a whole step in either direction, it is advisable to hire someone to generate a new arrangement for you. The online sheet music sources mentioned above are ideal for many things, but don‚Äôt have the technology to make the necessary musical adjustments for a larger transposition. It‚Äôs also a good idea to avoid lead sheets (sheet music that provides just a melody line and chord symbols) unless the audition notice specifically allows for them.\nYour cuts: Chances are you‚Äôre preparing a cut off the full-length song, and cleanliness is important here too. I have seen a lot of crazy ways of marking cuts, but the best approach is to physically cut out any music you don‚Äôt want played. ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù music, even if it has been crossed or scribbled out, can be just as distracting to your pianist as unnecessary marks and writing can be.\nIf you‚Äôre making cuts to your music, make a copy of the song that is single-sided. Physically cut out the pages, systems or measures that you don‚Äôt want played. Remember to include key and time signatures. If you have several smaller bits of music that need to be combined, grab a sheet of blank white paper and some tape. Tape your music to the sheet of paper (taking care to make it neat and straight, of course), then make a new copy of this page.\nIf your cut starts in the middle of the song, make sure the title and any tempo information are visible at the top of the first page. I also think it‚Äôs a good idea to always have the lyric you will actually be singing printed in your music. Sometimes actors elect to sing a different verse or version of the printed lyric, and this can lead to your pianist getting out of sync with you.\nIf you don‚Äôt play piano, find a friend who does and have him look over your music while you prepare. He‚Äôll be able to point out anything a pianist would need that you may have missed.\nYou can‚Äôt control everything at an audition. Focusing ahead of time on the things you can control will help audition confidently. Making your music clean and clear gives you the best shot at being perfectly in sync with your audition accompanist, and that‚Äôs going to help you give the kind of audition that‚Äôs will book you the job.\nLogan Culwell is a NYC-based musical director, vocal coach and audition accompanist, with experience playing for many Broadway, Off-Broadway, regional and film auditions.

Broughton has received numerous commissions from the Cleveland Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, the National Symphony, and members of the San Francisco Symphony. He is a lecturer in music composition and orchestration at UCLA and has taught film composition at the University of Southern California. Broughton currently serves on the ASCAP Board of Directors. He speaks to Final Note about his thoughts on classical music and his compositional style.\nI often say that I entered college with ‚ÄúTchaikovsky ears\". As a pianist, I was a good reader, and most of what I knew musically was piano music.\"\nWhy did you decide to follow a career in writing music ‚Äî were you inspired by anybody in particular, or was it an innate driving force that lead you down that path?\nI was driving in the car in my last year of university, wondering what I was going to do with my life, but getting excited by a song on the radio. It struck me that I would like to be able to write music that made others feel something, similar to what I was feeling at the time. I quickly decided upon motion picture music because it was of a length and style that interested me, and a captive audience usually listened to it. I felt that it definitely had to mean something emotionally.\nAfter leaving university, where did you go to learn your craft?\nI was fortunate to get a job as an assistant music supervisor for CBS Television. Neither the job nor the music department exists any longer, but for me at the time it was a total immersion into music for film. CBS produced television shows like Gunsmoke and Hawaii Five-O, and these were the first programs I worked on. Eventually, CBS began producing feature motion pictures, as well. Although my initial job was to ‚Äòtrack‚Äô the shows with library music, I began composing music for the CBS TV series while supervising motion picture recordings, meeting and working with many top film composers in the process ‚Äî composers like Jerry Goldsmith, Henry Mancini, Laurence Rosenthal, Michel Legrand, Leonard Rosenman and Quincy Jones‚Ä¶even Bernard Herrmann. I was able to attend their recording sessions and study their scores first hand. I worked my way up to become Assistant Director of Music, but it was essentially a management job, which didn‚Äôt interest me, and I eventually left CBS to become a full time composer. But before I left, I worked at almost every job a person could have in film and television music, including licensing, hiring composers and negotiating with the union.\nMy initial push was in film and television, but I was always writing concert music. As I became busy as a freelance composer, I would write concert music on my time off.\"\nHaving started in film and TV music, was writing contemporary classical music on the agenda?\nMy initial push was in film and television, but I was always writing concert music. As I became busy as a freelance composer, I would write concert music on my time off. When I was working entirely in television, I always had the summer months to myself. When I was busy doing television series, it was often a matter of working 14-16 hour days, 6 or 7 days a week. There wasn‚Äôt much time for anything else. But the TV season was generally from September through April.\nIs there a vast difference between composing for TV as opposed to Film?\nThe biggest difference is the size of the screen. When the actors are 30 feet tall, the music can be a little more discreet than when the action takes place on a smaller platform. In television, there is always the distraction of the environment, whereas with a film the action takes place in a large, dark closed-in room. You don‚Äôt have to work too hard to get the audience‚Äôs attention in a theatre.\nAre you ever concerned about your music playing ‚Äòsecond fiddle‚Äô to the film or TV shows for which you write, or is that part and parcel of the industry?\nFilm music is always and only accompaniment. Whether it‚Äôs loud or occasionally important in itself, it‚Äôs what it is because of where it is ‚Äî how it‚Äôs placed in the film. In a film score, the composer literally measures every note, because it has to be synchronized with the picture. The film strictly determines every element of a film score. The only reason music exists in film is to help tell a story. No one hires a composer for a film to write pretty flute lines. I generally don‚Äôt get concerned about this, but I‚Äôll admit to getting irritated or disappointed at times on how the music is used after I‚Äôve composed it. In the United States, all film composers work under a condition called ‚ÄòWork for Hire‚Äô. Aesthetically, it can be soul-sucking.\nHow has your compositional style evolved over the years?\nIf I‚Äôm working on a film, I adapt my style to the story I‚Äôm helping to tell. For example, Silverado has a lot of exciting and aggressive out-of-doors music with big themes and guitars because it‚Äôs a western. Miracle on 34th Street uses choirs, chimes, big brass and pretty melodies to help tell a Christmas story.\nDo you have a preferred medium in which you like to write?\nAt the moment, I much prefer writing concert music. No one tells me what to do and I can freely express myself. When working on a film or a TV show, I‚Äôm working on demand ‚Äî on behalf of a director or producer who would do my work if he could, but can‚Äôt.\nAre there any classical works that hold particular significance for you?\nMany of them! Some composers, like Bach‚Ä¶I never get tired of. I could play The Well-Tempered Clavier every day of my life and never get bored. The orchestration in something like The Rite of Spring is always interesting to me. I have such a long list of favorite composers, it‚Äôs ridiculous, but they all have something worth looking at and listening to.\nWhat are your thoughts on the value of classical music in the arts today?\nIt‚Äôs easy to sound like an old codger when talking about ‚Äòthe value of classical music‚Äô. I listen to a lot of music and I have a lot of friends who are composers. Some of them are very good. I‚Äôm always interested in new ideas, but I‚Äôm not interested in new ideas that are poorly executed, and there‚Äôs a lot of that sort of thing. Stravinsky said that technique had been better in former years, but he was referring to composers like Machaut and Ockeghem. I do a lot of teaching, and I‚Äôm always surprised at how little students learn at the start of their studies ‚Äî how little they know about basic music. With synthesizers and samplers available, it‚Äôs easy to make pretty or interesting sounds and pretend that it‚Äôs music ‚Äî but music is more than that.\nOn the other hand, as much as I love the music, I get tired of seeing Beethoven and Ravel played over and over at concerts. Those over-performed pieces become the standard for what ‚Äòreal music‚Äô is supposed to be. At the same time, music that doesn‚Äôt move me or is poorly constructed doesn‚Äôt interest me, and a lot of contemporary music falls into that category (although in fairness, most music ‚Äî especially from the 19th century, falls into the same group). Contemporary classical music is having a tough time finding an audience, and many people turn to film music to fill the gap, because the styles are familiar and the music is emotional and often dramatic, i.e. understandable and moving. But, as mentioned above, film music is really only accompaniment, and it always refers to the film. So, when one listens to a film score, one is usually reliving the film, as well. The music that includes the main idea as well as the accompaniment is the sort of music I‚Äôm interested in. Classical music today is a real work in progress. It‚Äôs trying to find an audience.\nDo you have any advice for aspiring young composers?\nThere‚Äôs no shortcut to learning to write well. Like learning to play an instrument, the only way to become a good composer is to practice, and the only way to practice is to constantly compose and then listen to what you wrote. My teacher reminded me that ‚Äúthe most important part of the pencil is the eraser‚Äù. The older I get, the more I understand what he meant.\nDo you have any advice for aspiring young composers?\nI recently finished a 10-hour TV mini-series called Texas Rising with my friend John Debney. The show premieres in the States at the end of May. I‚Äôm writing the opening piece for a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in August for the International Horn Symposium that will feature four horn quartets from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic, the American Horn Quartet, the Berlin Philharmonic and a soloist, the extraordinary horn virtuoso Radek Babor√°k (former principal horn of the Berlin Philharmonic) ‚Äî sixteen horns and a soloist!

Zero-party data is information a customer proactively shares with a brand like clothing preference or how they like something to fit. This valuable information can help Masai with both product development and retail coordination.\nToday the clothing brand is sold in 25 countries, with each country having different preferences for the shape and design of the clothing. Knowing the preferences of their customers is paramount for the brand ‚Äì but to gather this information they needed to connect to their customers in a meaningful way.\nMasai ran a personality test in multiple countries, where respondents answered questions about clothing fit, preferred shape and style, and what respondents dressed to accentuate or accommodate. Based on this, respondents received information about their ‚Äúshape‚Äù, which included general guidelines on what type of clothes best match your responses about body type. The test also included questions about color and pattern preferences that would also help determine the best match for you.\nThe responses helped Masai in three ways: the data enabled them to make informed decisions about retail and wholesale planning; insights into customer preferences, purchase intentions, and body types ensured a data-driven design and product development process; and lastly, the data aided in retail and wholesale coordination.\nCost Per Lead\nLess than before they used gamification\nTime To Purchase\nMasai saw truly incredible results. Most importantly, their customers loved the game! Over 160,000 people participated across the markets Masai operates in, which led to 60,000 new permissions. The results from the personality test provided Masai with a valuable dataset with a distribution of body types as well as color and outfit preferences.\nMasai was able to base all future decisions on this empirical evidence. They got direct statements from 160,000 respondents stating exactly what shapes and colors they prefer. This can be utilized in product development to make the most desirable colors and shapes for their customers.\nSince the campaign was run in multiple countries, the products can be coordinated for retail and wholesale planning to fit the preferences of each individual country. They were able to allocate the right amount of colors and shapes to the locations that customers will be shopping.\n‚ÄúGame mechanics give us a way to listen to our customers‚Äô preferences and use that information to direct products to the markets that they‚Äôll perform best in.

Gamification campaigns have also lowered our CPL and reduced a new customer‚Äôs first time to purchase. In addition to all of this, the data we gathered also enabled me to write a brief to our organization about what our audience wants from Masai.‚Äù\nThe E-commerce team at Masai uses gamification to get the results they want at a lower cost-per-lead (CPL). Compared to the previous year‚Äôs campaign without gamification, the CPL with gamification was 50% less.\nBecause of gamification, Masai was able to lower the time to purchase substantially. With this year‚Äôs gamified campaign, there was an average of only 7 days before a purchase was made. That‚Äî four months to just one week‚Äîis a very significant decrease in the amount of time a customer waited to purchase from Masai.\nThey have gained so much valuable information from this campaign that Maria Stigsn√¶s-Eriksen, Online Sales Manager at Masai, wrote a 20-page brief to the organization for them to use in their daily work, with suggestions to improvements to their clothing based on these findings. These insights are now actively used to ensure a data-driven design process. Gamification was a tool that Masai used to create real business results.\nNo more guesswork is needed. Through the use of game mechanics to gather insights on your audience, business decisions can be data-driven. For example, geographic preferences can be used in retail and wholesale planning and design decisions can be made based on customers own preferences.\nFor a brand like Masai that creates products that have so much to do with personal preferences, getting information that‚Äôs proactively shared by customers is invaluable. Gamification provides a channel for customers to share this information that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be accessible. Consumers are directly telling the brand exactly what they want. And most importantly, Masai is listening and using those insights to create more of what their audience wants.\nWhat will your target demographic respond to most? How can a brand get the most out of their customers‚Äô time? The target audience for Masai responded very well to a personality test, which proved to be a very familiar and fun format for them. In addition, respondents were able to learn something about themselves once they found out their results in the test. This shows the importance of finding the right game type for your target audience.\n‚ÄúWe have a strong social media following, and we always want to make sure we are able to bring them another touch point of contacting them, and gamification allows us to do that in a unique way.‚Äù","NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Est√©e Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) has signed a virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) for the Ponderosa wind farm in Beaver County, Oklahoma, adding renewable energy to the electricity grid. This agreement makes The Est√©e Lauder Companies Inc. the first prestige beauty company to execute a VPPA1 and bolsters its renewable electricity footprint in the U.S. and Canada.\nThe VPPA is the company‚Äôs largest renewable energy contract globally. The Ponderosa wind farm alone will cover more than half of the company‚Äôs global electricity footprint with renewable energy technologies, putting the company on target to meet its global 2020 Net Zero carbon emissions RE100 commitment. The company announced it would build upon this existing Net Zero commitment and set a science-based target covering Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by the end of 2020. Through the company‚Äôs renewable energy solutions in its portfolio, the company has achieved 100% renewable electricity (RE100) in the United States and Canada ahead of schedule.\n‚ÄúThe Est√©e Lauder Companies is committed to innovating to help achieve a low-carbon future,‚Äù said Nancy Mahon, Senior Vice President, Global Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability of The Est√©e Lauder Companies. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so pleased to meet our 2020 RE100 commitment for North America early. Projects like the Ponderosa wind farm and others in our Net Zero portfolio are all significant achievements toward our commitments to address climate change.‚Äù\nUnder the VPPA, the company will purchase the energy produced by 22 megawatts (MW) of the Ponderosa wind farm, owned and operated by a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, which equates to approximately 10 wind turbines. The wind energy the company will buy from Ponderosa is equivalent to powering more than 9,000 typical U.S. homes and will reduce fossil fuel emissions equivalent to removing more than 14,000 cars from the road annually. Construction of the Ponderosa wind farm is scheduled to begin in early 2020.\n‚ÄúWe are proud to partner with The Est√©e Lauder Companies on this forward-looking investment in renewable energy,‚Äù said John Di Donato, Vice President of Development for NextEra Energy Resources. ‚ÄúIn addition to low cost, homegrown energy, the Ponderosa Wind project will create good jobs and millions of dollars in additional revenue for the local community ‚Äì helping fuel America‚Äôs clean energy economy.‚Äù\nThe Ponderosa VPPA is the latest renewable energy project in the company‚Äôs renewables portfolio, which also includes a 1 MW solar PV system at its Whitman Laboratories in the U.K. and 1.4 MW ground-mounted solar array recently constructed at the company‚Äôs Melville campus in New York, among other projects in the pipeline.

{"question":"Who achieved greater commercial success in terms of chart performance - Jimmy Reed in the 1950s-60s or Holly Dunn in the 1980s-90s?","answer":"Jimmy Reed achieved greater commercial success. He had 11 songs that made the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, a feat unmatched even by B.B. King. In the R&B charts, he had multiple top 10 hits including #1 songs, and was the best-selling Chicago blues artist of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Holly Dunn, while successful in country music, had a more modest chart performance with 19 singles on the Hot Country Songs charts, of which only two reached #1 - 'Are You Ever Gonna Love Me' and 'You Really Had Me Going'. Several of her later releases failed to chart at all.","context":["|Birth name||Mathis James Reed|\n|Born||September 6 1925\n|Died||August 29 1976 (aged 50)\n|Instrument(s)||Vocals, Harmonica, Guitar|\nMathis James \"Jimmy\" Reed (September 6, 1925 ‚Äì August 2, 1976) was an American blues singer, guitarist, and harmonica player. He was the best-selling Chicago blues artist of the later 1950s and early 1960s, with classic blues hits such as \"Big Boss Man,\" \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" \"Baby What You Want Me To Do,\" and \"Aint That Lovin' You Baby.\"\nReed was a major player in the early days of electric blues, whose unpretentious style proved highly popular with R&B fans. His lazy, slack-jawed singing, piercing harmonica, and hypnotic guitar patterns were one of the blues' most easily identifiable sounds in the 1950s and ‚Äò60s. He also had a major influence on rock and roll players, most notably the Rolling Stones, among many others.\nDespite outselling his Chicago contemporaries during his heyday, Reed's battles with alcoholism led to his early decline and caused him to be unable to take advantage of the blues revival of the late 1960s and early ‚Äò70s to resurrect his career. He died in 1976 at the age of 50. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.\nReed was born on a plantation near Dunleith, Mississippi in 1925, where he lived until the age of 15. He learned the basics of harmonica and guitar from local semi-professional player Eddie Taylor, who became a close friend.\nAfter spending several years performing in clubs and playing for tips in the area, Reed moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1943 before being drafted into the United States Navy during World War II. In 1945, he was discharged and moved briefly back to Mississippi, marrying his girlfriend, Mary Reed, before moving to Gary, Indiana to work at an Armour & Co. meat packing plant.\nReed soon began to break into the growing blues scene in Gary and nearby Chicago. By the early 1950s, he had established himself as a popular musician known for his ability to play guitar and harmonica simultaneously by using a neck-brace harmonica-holder. He joined the \"Gary Kings,\" playing harmonica and guitar with John Brim, with whom he also recorded. However, when Reed attempted to gain a recording contract with Chess Records, the premier record company for Chicago-based blues artists, he was rebuffed. With the help of Brim's drummer and future guitar legend Albert King, he then signed with Vee-Jay Records. At Vee-Jay, Reed began playing again with his old mentor, Eddie Taylor. His third single, \"You Don't Have to Go,\" was his first hit record, reaching number three on the Billboard R&B chart in 1956.\nA string of blues hits soon followed. Reed's simple, straightforward style was easy for fans to relate to and was also highly danceable. He was soon outselling even the great Chess blues stars like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter. In New York, he not only played Harlem's famous Apollo Theater but also performed across town in the prestigious Carnegie Hall, although his Live at Carnegie Hall album (1961) was actually a studio reproduction of his performance there.\nLike some other successful bluesmen, Reed suffered from alcoholism. However, unlike some of them, did not hold is liquor well. He became notorious for being drunk on stage, slurring and forgetting his words, and losing the beat. His wife often had to help him remember the lyrics to his songs and stay on beat while performing. Reed's bouts with delirium tremens were so common that when he was stricken with epilepsy in 1957, the disease went undiagnosed for months.\nDespite these problems, reed continued to succeed as a recording artist. He reached his peak in 1961 with the classic \"Big Boss Man,\" followed by \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" which reached number three on the R & B charts.\nAlthough he had more hit songs than many of his peers, Reed's personal problems prevented him from achieving the same level of respect and long-term fame as other popular blues artists of the time. When Vee-Jay Records temporarily ceased operations in the second half of 1963, Reed's manager signed a contract with the fledgling ABC-Bluesway label, but Reed was never able to score another hit. He made a minor comeback as a performer in the days of the blues revival of the late 1960s and early ‚Äò70s, but continued to prove unable to rise above his problems with alcohol, often proving a disappointment to his new live audiences.\nReed lived a reclusive life in his final years before finally getting proper medical treatment and attempting a comeback, playing at the blues festivals that had achieved popularity in the mid-70s. He died in Oakland, California on August 29, 1976, a few days short of his 51st birthday. He is interred in the Lincoln Cemetery in Worth, Illinois.\nAlthough not the most skillful, passionate, or powerful of the Chicago bluesmen, Reed is arguably one of the most influential. In addition to his numerous R & B hits, Reed produced 11 records that made the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart, a figure unmatched even by the most successful bluesman of all time, B.B. King.\nReed's simple style was easily imitated, and he became a major influence on other performers from Chuck Berry to Elvis Presley, Hank Williams, Jr., and the Rolling Stones. His guitar style found its way into numerous rock and roll songs, while his harmonica riffs were often copied by players like the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger.\nIndeed, The Rolling Stones have cited Reed as a major influence on their sound, and their early set lists comprised many of Reed's songs. In their early years Stones recorded Reed songs like \"Ain't That Lovin' You Baby,\" \"The Sun is Shining,,\" \"Close Together,\" \"Bright Lights, Big City,\" and \"Shame, Shame, Shame\" as demos to offer to record labels. Their February 1964 hit single \"Not Fade Away\" was backed by \"Little by Little,\" an obvious remake of Reed's \"Shame, Shame, Shame.\" Their first album, The Rolling Stones, released in April 1964, featured their cover of Reed's \"Honest I Do.\"\nElvis Presley also covered several of Reed's songs, scoring a 1967 hit with \"Big Boss Man\" and performing \"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\" for his 1968 Comeback TV Special. \"Big Boss Man\" was performed regularly by Grateful Dead, sung by the band's Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, from their inception in the mid-1960s through the early 1970s. The song appears on the live album known as Skull and Roses.\nFew blues bands omit Jimmy Reed songs from their set lists. In 2007, Austin Texas-based bluesmen Omar Kent Dykes and Jimmie Vaughan released a tribute album to Reed entitled On the Jimmy Reed Highway featuring guest performances by Kim Wilson, Delbert McClinton, James Cotton, Lou Ann Barton, and Gary Clark Junior.\nIn 1991 Reed was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He became a member of the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980. His recordings of \"Big Boss Man\" and \"Bright Lights, Big City\" were both voted onto the list of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n|Year||Single||R&B Singles||U.S. Pop Singles|\n|1956||\"Ain't That Lovin' You Baby\"||#3||-|\n|1956||\"Can't Stand to See You Go\"||#10||-|\n|1956||\"I Don't Go for That\"||#12||-|\n|1956||\"I Love You Baby\"||#13||-|\n|1957||\"Honest I Do\"||#4||#32|\n|1957||\"Honey, Where You Going?\"||#10||-|\n|1957||\"The Sun is Shining\"||#12||#65|\n|1958||\"Down in Virginia\"||-||#93|\n|1959||\"I Told You Baby\"||#19||-|\n|1960||\"Baby, What You Want Me to Do\"||#10||#37|\n|1961||\"Big Boss Man\"||#13||#78|\n|1961||\"Bright Lights, Big City\"||#3||#58|\n|1962||\"Aw Shucks, Hush Your Mouth\"||-||#93|\n|1963||\"Shame, Shame, Shame\"||-||#52|\n|1958||I'm Jimmy Reed|\n|1959||Rockin' With Reed (Collectables)|\n|1961||Jimmy Reed at Carnegie Hall|\n|1962||Just Jimmy Reed|\n|1963||Jimmy Reed Plays 12 String Guitar Blues|\n|1963||Jimmy Reed Sings The Best Of The Blues|\n|1963||T'Ain't No Big Thing But He Is...Jimmy Reed|\n|1964||Jimmy Reed At Soul City|\n|1965||The Legend: The Man|\n|1967||The New Jimmy Reed Album/Soulin'|\n|1968||Big Boss Man/Down In Virginia|\n|1974||Best Of Jimmy Reed|\n|1976||Blues Is My Business|\nAll Links Retrieved February 5, 2009.\nNew World Encyclopedia writers and editors rewrote and completed the Wikipedia article in accordance with New World Encyclopedia standards.

Dunn recorded for MTM Records between 1985 and 1988, Warner Bros. Records between 1988 and 1993, and River North Records between 1995 and 1997. She released 10 albums and charted 19 singles, plus two duets on the Hot Country Songs charts. Two of her single releases, \"Are You Ever Gonna Love Me\" and \"You Really Had Me Going\", went to No. 1 on that chart. She is also known for her breakthrough hit \"Daddy's Hands\" and for her 1991 controversial single \"Maybe I Mean Yes\". Dunn's brother, Chris Waters, is a songwriter and record producer, having worked with both his sister and other artists in these capacities. Dunn retired from music in 2003, and died of ovarian cancer in 2016.\nWhile attending high school, Dunn performed in a band called Freedom Folk Singers, which toured the Southern United States. She attended Abilene Christian University and performed in a school-sponsored group called The Hilltoppers. Dunn also wrote songs with her brother, Chris Waters, who later became a prolific songwriter in Nashville, Tennessee. One of their collaborations, \"Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind\", was recorded by Cristy Lane. After graduating from college, Dunn moved to Nashville, where she worked as a demo singer before both Waters and she became songwriters at CBS Records, and then MTM Records. Louise Mandrell had a top-10 hit in 1984 with \"I'm Not Through Loving You Yet\", which the two co-wrote. By 1985, Dunn was signed to a record contract with MTM.\nDunn's first two releases -- \"Playing for Keeps\" and \"My Heart Holds On\" -- both failed to make the top 40 on the Hot Country Songs charts, while \"Two Too Many\" peaked at number 39. Her first top-10 hit came in 1986, when \"Daddy's Hands\", a tribute to her father, went to number seven. The song was included on her self-titled debut, from which it served as the final single. Following this song, she sang guest vocals on Michael Martin Murphey's top-five hit \"A Face in the Crowd\", from his album Americana. She was named the Academy of Country Music's Top New Female Vocalist in 1986, and then the winner of Country Music Association's Horizon Award in 1987.\nHer second MTM album, Cornerstone, produced three straight top-10 hits in \"Love Someone Like Me\", \"Only When I Love\", and \"Strangers Again\".Across the Rio Grande in 1988 included the singles \"That's What Your Love Does to Me\" and \"(It's Always Gonna Be) Someday\", before MTM Records filed for bankruptcy and closed.\nIn 1989, Dunn moved to Warner Bros. Records' Nashville division. Her first release for the label, The Blue Rose of Texas, produced her first number-one hit in \"Are You Ever Gonna Love Me\", followed by \"There Goes My Heart Again\" at number four. The latter was co-written by a then-unknown Joe Diffie, who also sang backing vocals on it. She also sang on Kenny Rogers' late 1990 hit \"Maybe\", from his album Something Inside So Strong.\nDunn's second Warner Bros. album, Heart Full of Love, was released in 1990. Although its lead single \"My Anniversary for Being a Fool\" failed to make the top 40, the followup \"You Really Had Me Going\" became her second and final number-one hit, while the title track was a top-20 hit.\nIn 1991, Dunn released her first greatest hits package, Milestones: Greatest Hits. It included the new release \"Maybe I Mean Yes\", which became controversial due to some listeners interpreting the song as condoning date rape. As a result, Dunn asked for the single to be withdrawn from rotation. Her final Warner Bros. release, Getting It Dunn, failed to produce a top-40 hit, and she exited the label in 1993.\nDunn signed to River North Records in 1995 and released two albums for the label: Life and Love and All the Stages in 1995 and Leave One Bridge Standing two years later. The former produced her final chart entry in \"I Am Who I Am\". Shortly before the release of Leave One Bridge Standing, she joined country music radio station WWWW in Detroit, Michigan, as morning show co-host. It was not her first time behind the radio mike, as she had served as a DJ during her college years. However, the decision forced her to give up touring for a time. Later, she co-hosted Opry Backstage on the Nashville Network in 1999-2002.\nIn 2003, Dunn announced her retirement from her musical career and released her final album, Full Circle, which was her one and only gospel album, to devote full-time to her other passion, art. Her paintings deal primarily with subjects from the Southwestern United States, and are available through her website www.hollydunn.com.\n|Title||Album details||Peak positions|\n|Across the Rio Grande||\n|The Blue Rose of Texas||\n|Heart Full of Love||\n|Getting It Dunn||\n|Life and Love and All the Stages||\n|Leave One Bridge Standing||\n|\"--\" denotes releases that did not chart|\n|US Country||CAN Country|\n|1985||\"Playing for Keeps\"||62||--||N/A|\n|\"My Heart Holds On\"||64||--||Holly Dunn|\n|1986||\"Two Too Many\"||39||--|\n|1987||\"Love Someone Like Me\"||2||2||Cornerstone|\n|\"Only When I Love\"||4||7|\n|\"That's What Your Love Does to Me\"||5||6||Across the Rio Grande|\n|\"(It's Always Gonna Be) Someday\"||11||*|\n|1989||\"Are You Ever Gonna Love Me\"||1||6||The Blue Rose of Texas|\n|\"There Goes My Heart Again\"||4||8|\n|1990||\"My Anniversary for Being a Fool\"||63||75||Heart Full of Love|\n|\"You Really Had Me Going\"||1||1|\n|1991||\"Heart Full of Love\"||19||12|\n|\"Maybe I Mean Yes\"||48||45||Milestones: Greatest Hits|\n|\"No One Takes the Train Anymore\"||--||--|\n|1992||\"No Love Have I\"||67||--||Getting It Dunn|\n|\"As Long as You Belong to Me\"||68||--|\n|1995||\"I Am Who I Am\"||56||56||Life and Love and All the Stages|\n|\"Cowboys Are My Weakness\"||--||--|\n|\"It's Not About Blame\"||--||--|\n|1997||\"Leave One Bridge Standing\"||--||--||Leave One Bridge Standing|\n|\"--\" denotes releases that did not chart|\n* denotes unknown peak positions\n|Milestones: Greatest Hits||\n|1986||\"Two Too Many\"||Coke Sams|\n|\"Daddy's Hands\"||Jim May/Coke Sams|\n|1988||\"Strangers Again\"||Coke Sams|\n|1989||\"There Goes My Heart Again\" (Live)|\n|1990||\"You Really Had Me Going\"||Charley Randazzo|\n|1991||\"Maybe I Mean Yes\"||Clarke Gallivan|\n|\"No One Takes the Train Anymore\"||Clarke Gallivan|\n|1992||\"As Long As You Belong To Me\"||Roger Pistole|\n|1995||\"I Am Who I Am\"||Thom Oliphant|\n|\"Cowboys Are My Weakness\"||Jon Small|\n|1997||\"Leave One Bridge Standing\"||Steven R.

A PID Controller calculates error values between measured process variables and desired setpoints, using three parameters (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative) to minimize this error and adjust processes through manipulated variables. In contrast, the VAB implements an object-oriented communication approach that uses five basic primitives (create/retrieve/update/delete/invoke) to enable end-to-end communication across different networks. While PID focuses on process control and automation through mathematical calculations, VAB serves as a communication medium that connects Industrie 4.0 components through a unified network interface.","context":["BaSyx / Documentation\nThe Eclipse BaSyx Middleware\nThe BaSyx middleware groups Industrie 4.0 components around an end-to-end communication medium, the virtual automation bus (VAB). The VAB implements an object oriented communication approach that exports all information and services as objects with a unique identifier that are connected to one virtual and homogeneous communication network, even if it is realized by multiple physical networks. The VAB therefore defines five virtual communication primitives that are mapped to concrete physical networks. VAB primitives provide a unified way to access properties and operations of VAB objects in a network and machine independent manner. VAB gateways realize inter-network communication by mapping the communication primitives to network specific telegrams, and this way enable end-to-end communication. Gateways furthermore may be used to integrate legacy devices by implementing a VAB interface for them.\nThe graphic below illustrates an architecture overview of the BaSyx middleware and its various components:\nBaSys 4.0 compliant systems consist of the following core and optionally extended components:\n|Plattform Industrie 4.0 compliant components|\n|Asset Administration Shell|| An Asset Administration Shell is a \"standardized digital representation of the asset, corner stone of the interoperability between the applications managing the manufacturing systems. It identifies the Administration Shell and the assets represented by it, holds digital models of various aspects (submodels) and describes technical functionality exposed by the Administration Shell or respective\nassets.\" (Details of the Asset Administration Shell, 2018, p. 13, )\n|Asset Administration Shell Submodels||\"A Submodel defines a specific aspect of the asset represented by the Asset Administration Shell. A Submodel is used to structure the virtual representation and technical functionality of an Administration Shell into distinguishable parts. Each Submodel refers to a well-defined domain or subject matter. Submodels can become standardized and thus become submodels types. Submodels can have different life-cycles.\" (Details of the Asset Administration Shell, 2018, p. 46, )||Core|\n|Registry||The BaSys 4.0 Registry enables registration and lookup of Asset Administration Shells within defined system boundaries. Entities that provide Asset Administration Shells including their submodels may register and hence enable other participants to find them. The necessary information required for registration amongst others are unique identifiers for the Administration Shell and her respective Asset, endpoint information regarding the Asset Administration Shell's API and their submodel service provider.||Core|\n|Discovery||The BaSys 4.0 Discovery is a service that uses the registry to find Asset Administration Shells and Submodels. It provides additional functionalities to discover Asset Administration Shells and their Submodels based on filter criteria. These criteria are more advanced than a regular query parameter. The discovery service may provide indexing and/or crawling mechanisms to cache results from queried elements resp. find deeper information when searching.||Core|\n|Control component||Control components realize BaSys 4.0 conforming service based Industrie 4.0 interfaces to assets. Assets may be devices, e.g. PLC controllers, sensors, actuators, but can represent any asset that realizes services or provide information, which also includes for example human workers. Control components provide a service based interface with callable services that e.g. drill a hole into a work piece. They define how a specific service is implemented, but do not decide about the orchestration of services, i.e. a control component does not decide when and if a particular service is called.||Core|\n|Group component||Group components implement higher-level services that use services of other control and group components. Similar to control components, group component services provide the implementation of services but do not decide about when and why a provided service is invoked. Service callers are other components that orchestrate services.||Core|\n|Virtual Automation Bus||The virtual automation bus (VAB) is our implementation of an end-to-end communication for Industrie 4.0. It maps one communication semantic with five primitives (create/retrieve/update/delete/invoke) to different networks and protocols. This way, the VAB can bridge networks via gateways, and can also integrate legacy devices into the virtual end-to-end communication network.||Core|\n|Device integration||Device integration components are VAB components that are part of devices and communicate with the VAB. Device manager components for example connect native status data to VAB objects and upload Asset Administration Shells (AAS) and Sub Models of their device to AAS servers.||Extended|\n|Gateway||Virtual Automation Bus protocol gateways bridges communication networks to enable inter-network communication. Every gateway needs to provide a mapping of all of the five BaSys communication primitives to its supported protocols to enable end-to-end communication. Gateways can be cascaded to bridge multiple networks.||Extended|\n|Strategy / Optimization||The Strategy/Optimization component calculates production plans and production schedules that define when, and on which machine a production step for a specific product will be executed. This component is usually a domain or plant specific application component. Strategy, optimization and monitoring components are highly plant specific. These components use provided interfaces of other BaSys 4.0 components, but are not required to provide defined BaSys 4.0 interfaces.||Extended|\n|Process control||The process control component executes the production plans that the Strategy/Optimization component did create. Eclipse BaSyx will integrate for example the open source Activiti BPMN engine as process control engine.||Extended|\n|Monitoring||The monitoring component enables the monitoring of the production process. It for example collects and aggregates data for analysis or pushes selected and aggregated data to a dashboard.||Extended|\nIn addition to these components, BaSyx users may add other application specific components that connect to the network via an exposed endpoint depending on the communication technology (HTTP, OPC UA, BaSyx native) used.\nBaSyx Identification Naming Convention\nBaSys provides a unified way to identify types and instances regardless whether it is an information model (Submodel, Concept Description, Data Element, etc.) or an asset type resp. asset instance. These identifiers can be used as unique identifier for Asset Administation Shells and Assets as well as for semantic references within the meta-model elements of the Asset Administration Shell:\nBaSyx defines interfaces for all components contained in the architecture overview above. Interfaces are well-defined descriptions of the interaction pattern (contract) and the necessary information models (payload) for the interaction between communication participants. All BaSyx components define at least an HTTP/REST interface on middle-ware and application level. On field device level, OPC UA as well as native BaSyx/TCP are applicable for component interfaces.\nCompliant implementations of BaSyx components need to implement at least the interfaces depicted in the following table. BaSyx provides reference implementations for core components that are necessary to create and deploy an Industrie 4.0 solution.\n|Component||Provided Interfaces||Available Technologies|\n|Control component||BaSyx control component API||OPC-UA, BaSyx native|\n|Group component||BaSyx control component API||OPC-UA, BaSyx native|\n|Gateway||Gateway||Any to any|\n|Asset Administration Shell||BaSyx Asset Administration Shell Service Provider API||HTTP-REST|\n|Asset Administration Shell Submodels||BaSyx Submodel Service Provider API||HTTP-REST|\n|Registry||BaSyx Registry API||HTTP-REST|\n|Strategy / Optimization||---||HTTP-REST|\n|Process Control||Process management, Process execution||HTTP-REST|\nEclipse BaSyx implements the following ready-to-use components:\nAsset Administration Shell & Submodel Providers\nAsset Administration Shell and Submodel providers provide generic Virtual Automation Bus objects, Asset Administration Shells, and/or Submodels with a defined ID on the network.\n- CFG Submodel provider\n- RAW AAS/Submodel provider\n- SQL Submodel provider\n- XQuery Submodel provider\n- under construction: XML AAS/Submodel provider\nReady-to-use reference implementations of the BaSyx Registry API enable Industrie 4.0 components to register their Asset Administration Shells resp. users/applications to find those in a BaSyx compliant manner.\n- Pre-compiled Registry (Local, Cloud & On-Premises via Docker)\n- Simple File-based Registry (Local & Docker)\n- SQL-based Dynamic Registry\nVirtual Automation Bus Providers\nLow-level providers provide generic Virtual Automation Bus objects and do not make an assumption on the structure.

Control Logic Process\n6. Success Criteria\n7. Case Studies\n- The fundamental goal of a control system is to automatically adjust a piece of machinery to give us what we want by comparing what is going on to what we want to go on and making appropriate adjustments to the process we want to control\n- Actuation System - xxx\n- Cascade: A control system with 2 or more controllers, a \"Master\" and \"Slave\" loop. The output of the \"Master\" controller is the setpoint for the \"Slave\" controller\n- Closed Loop Feedback -\n- Control Point - xxx\n- Controlled Variable - aka Final Controlled Variable - The device to be controlled\n- Controller - xxx\n- Dead Time: The amount of time it takes for a process to start changing after a disturbance in the system.\n- Device Tracking Control System - Operation based on the operating pattern of another device<\n- Error - In process controls, error is defined as: Error = setpoint - process variable.\n- Floating Control - Does nothing if the control point is between two limits\n- Mathematical Control System - Operation based on mathematical relationship driven by other process parameters\n- PID Controller - Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller - A PID controller calculates an error value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process through use of a manipulated variable.\nThe PID controller algorithm involves three separate constant parameters, and is accordingly sometimes called three-term control: the proportional, the integral andderivative values, denoted P, I, and D. Simply put, these values can be interpreted in terms of time: P depends on thepresent error, I on the accumulation of past errors, and D is a prediction of future errors, based on current rate of change. The weighted sum of these three actions is used to adjust the process via a control element such as the position of a control valve, a damper, or the power supplied to a heating element.\nPID controllers are designed to eliminate the need for continuous operator attention. They are used to automatically adjust system variables to hold a process variable at a setpoint. Error is defined above as the difference between setpoint and process variable.\n- Proportional Control System - The \"P\" part of a PID controller. With proportional action the controller output is proportional to the amount of the error signal. By its nature, a proportional control system will always have a difference or ‚Äúerror‚Äù between the set point and the control point except at one specific condition. We could reduce the error by increasing the gain of the controller (making it more sensitive to a level change in this case) ‚Ä¶ but at some point, feedback from the process would interact with the control loop in a way that would make it unstable\n- Integral Control: The \"I\" part of a PID controller. With integral action the controller output is proportional to the amount and duration of the error signal. By monitoring the error over time, the operator could adjust the float setting so that it always maintained the desired set point. This is what the Integral function in a Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative control loop does\n- Derivative Control: The \"D\" part of a PID controller. With derivative action the controller output is proportional to the rate of change of the process variable or error. Similarly, the operator could monitor the process and if he or she saw the error start to rapidly change relative to time, they could quickly push the float up or down to minimize the deviation from set point. Once the sudden change is over the operator could reset the float to match the current load condition and maintain the required set point. This is what the Derivative function in a Proportional plus Integral plus Derivative Set Point control loop does\n- PI and PID - Similar to proportional but with compensation for error.\n- Pneumatic Actuator - Converts energy (typically in the form of compressed air) into mechanical motion. The motion can be rotary or linear, depending on the type of actuator.\n- Process Variable - The current status of a process under control. An example of this would be the temperature of a furnace. The current temperature is called the process variable, while the desired temperature is known as the set-point.\n- Proportional Band - the change in the process variable that causes the controlled variable to go through its full range. Proportional negative-feedback systems are based on the difference between the required set point (SP) and process value (PV). This difference is called the error. Power is applied in direct proportion to the current measured error, in the correct sense so as to tend to reduce the error (and so avoid positive feedback). The amount of corrective action that is applied for a given error is set by the gain or sensitivity of the control system.\nAt low gains, only a small corrective action is applied when errors are detected: the system may be safe and stable, but may be sluggish in response to changing conditions; errors will remain uncorrected for relatively long periods of time: it is over-damped. If the proportional gain is increased, such systems become more responsive and errors are dealt with more quickly. There is an optimal value for the gain setting when the overall system is said to be critically damped. Increases in loop gain beyond this point will lead to oscillations in the PV; such a system is under-damped.\n- Quarter Decay Ratio - Open loop systems typically use the quarter decay ratio (QDR) for oscillation dampening. This means that the ratio of the amplitudes of the first overshoot to the second overshoot is 4:1.\n- Response Testing\n- Forced Response\n- Natural Response\n- Sensor - A device that detects events or changes in quantities and provides a corresponding output, generally as an electrical or optical signal. If the sensor is not ideal, several types of deviations can be observed:\n- The sensitivity may in practice differ from the value specified. This is called a sensitivity error.\n- Scale - Since the range of the output signal is always limited, the output signal will eventually reach a minimum or maximum when the measured property exceeds the limits. The full scale range defines the maximum and minimum values of the measured property.\n- Bias. - aka offset - The output signal is not zero when the measured property is zero, This is defined as the output of the sensor at zero input.\n- Non Linearity - The sensitivity is not constant over the range of the sensor, . Usually this is defined by the amount the output differs from ideal behavior over the full range of the sensor, often noted as a percentage of the full range.\n- Dynamic error - The deviation is caused by a rapid change of the measured property over time, Often, this behavior is described with a bode plot showing sensitivity error and phase shift as function of the frequency of a periodic input signal.\n- Drift - The output signal slowly changes independent of the measured property, .Long term drift usually indicates a slow degradation of sensor properties.\n- Noise - a random deviation of the signal that varies in time.\n- Hysteresis - An error caused by when the measured property reverses direction, but there is some finite lag in time for the sensor to respond, creating a different offset error in one direction than in the other.\n- Digitization error - If the sensor has a digital output, the output is essentially an approximation of the measured property.\n- Aliasing errors - If the signal is monitored digitally, limitation of the sampling frequency also can cause a dynamic error, if the variable or added noise changes periodically at a frequency near a multiple of the sampling rate.\n- External Error - The sensor may to some extent be sensitive to properties other than the property being measured. For example, most sensors are influenced by the temperature of their environment.\nAll these deviations can be classified as systematic errors or random errors. Systematic errors can sometimes be compensated for with a calibration strategy. Noise is a random error that can be reduced by signal processing, such as filtering, usually at the expense of the dynamic behavior of the sensor.\n- Setpoint - he desired or target value for an essential variable of a controlled process often used to describe a standard configuration or norm for the system. Departure of a variable from its setpoint is one basis for error-controlled regulation,that is, the use of feedback to return the system to its norm, as in homeostasis. For example, a boiler might have a temperature setpoint, which is the temperature the boiler control system aims to maintain.\n- Schedule - Operation based on time of day\n- Two position - Device is either ‚Äúon‚Äù or ‚Äúoff‚Äù, ‚Äúopen‚Äù or ‚Äúclosed‚Äù etc.\n- Identify the devices to be controlled (a.k.a. the controlled variable)\n- Identify the nature of their control signal ( Figure out what you have to do to control each device)\n- Identify the process variable (Figure out what you need to monitor to let you control each devi ce) Measurables for process systems include:\n- Identify the controlled device to process variable relationship (Figure out how to make the process variable interact appropriately with the controlled variable)\n- Identify the parameters associated with the relationship (Figure out what other things (secondary control processes) impact the primary control process for each device)\n- Identify the logic required to produce the desired parameters (Figure out how to monitor the secondary control processes and integrate them with the primary control process)\n- Identify the conditions that constrain the process (Figure out if there are any limiting conditions that apply to the control process)\n- Document the logic and/or write the sequence (Write it all down)\n- Logic diagrams communicate control system sequence information\n- Control logic needs to address not only the requirements of the design day but also the requirements of all of the other days of the year\n- As long as the demand does not exceed the capacity of the delivery system (i.e. steady state can be achieved inside the proportional band) the system will be under control\n- Condensation - For example, humid air enters the water tight area via the conduit system. Ambient temperatures drop below the dew point inside the housing. Water condenses and accumulates inside the housing. Electrodes can‚Äôt tell the difference between water shorting them out at the bottom or at the top.\n- Gain - if the gain is too high, the oscillations become unstable and grow larger and larger with time.\n- Oversized valves are forced to try to control over a very limited portion of their span where small movements make big changes\n- Lag - Big duct can have 10 - 20 second delay between when fan starts and duct pressure comes up\n- Simultaneous Heating & Cooling - xx\n- Short Cycle Compressor - xx\n- Freezing Coils - xx\n- Blowing Things up - Too much pressure\n- Non-Linear Systems -A little change in the control can result in a big change in the system\n- Repeatable - To make, do, or perform (an action) again (and again, and again, and again ‚Ä¶.)\n- Reliable - Giving the same result on successive trials\n- Robust - Sturdy; capable of performing without failure under a wide range of conditions\n- Automated Logic ( part of UTC Building & Industrial Systems,\na unit of United Technologies Corp) Kennesaw, GA - EIKON¬Æ is a graphical programming tool which eliminates line-by-line programming..\n- A Field Perspective on Engineering - Buildings are talking to us .... we just need to learn to listen\n- Resources for Understanding PID Control\n- The Control Fundamentals chapter of the Honeywell Gray Manual, which will give you a good overview of control systems written in fairly understandable terms.\n- Control Systems: Design, Performance, and Commissioning Issues - Simulcast Tue 10/14/2014 - Pacific Energy Center\n- The Control Design Guide - Provides an overview of the control design and procurement process and some of the reasons things go wrong and a design approach that addresses those issues."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4feea73b-4869-4a7a-b33c-673e52436d74>","<urn:uuid:a7eb194c-e900-4adb-ac16-8f6c3579b6e3>"],"error":null}

Many students don‚Äôt realize they could qualify for grant money and federally guaranteed loans, so be sure to find out by filling out the form.\nComplete the FAFSA after Oct. 1 of your senior year. Find the form online at fafsa.ed.gov. For help with completing the form, go to your high school counselor or the financial aid office at the college or university you plan to attend.\nThe FAFSA determines your eligibility for one or more of the following types of financial aid:\nScholarships are a great source of aid, and you do not need to pay them back. Many scholarships are available for students with special interests and backgrounds. Talk to your guidance counselor about what kind of scholarships you can get.\nYou may be eligible to receive federal and state grants of $300 to more than $7,000 per year. You do not need to pay these back.\nWork study programs give you the opportunity to work on campus or with approved off-campus employers to earn money to pay for college. Work study jobs are often very flexible, allowing you to work around your classes and personal schedules.\nYou also may be eligible for student loans, which must be paid back. Student loans usually have a lower interest rate than other kinds of loans.\nOther ways to save\nReduced out-of-state tuition\nStudents from other states don‚Äôt always have to pay higher tuition if they want to attend the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. If you live in Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota or Manitoba, Canada, you‚Äôre eligible for tuition rates similar to those paid by Minnesota residents. And 26 of the state colleges and universities allow students from other states to pay the lower in-state rates, so ask a college or university about its tuition charges.\nSome college students also benefit from two federal tax credit programs, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Lifetime Learning tax credit. These may apply to you or your family, depending on your financial circumstances.\nVeterans are welcomed at the state colleges and universities. If you‚Äôve served in the armed forces, you might be eligible for help with paying for college. Stop by one of the on-campus veterans centers for information, support and assistance. Also, check with the campus financial aid office about benefits from the new Minnesota GI Bill. Or go to www.mymilitaryeducation.org.\nCollege is more than textbooks, classes, labs and studying.

Its different in concept, different in sound. The concept comes from Adam Rudolph, a Chicago percussionist whos lived in our region for close to 25 years. And the sound . . . it wafts you through an abstract Africa outside of time and terrain.\nIt was like a spaceship, says Rudolph, exhausted, fevered and awestruck in the wake of an Organic Orchestra performance he conducted at Venices Electric Lodge on the last day of February. The afterimages stick: 21 musicians (five percussionists, a violist and 15 woodwind players) arranged in a crescent to face Rudolph, whos garbed in a North African tunic and striding around the open space, dashing now and then back to his congas, intermittently throwing up strange hand gestures. He waves up and down, makes fists, summons a chord block by raising however many fingers, hushes his lips for a diminuendo, points a digit to indicate a series of soloists. Hes improvising, and so is the orchestra, within a wide range of chordal and rhythmic structures that have been outlined in advance and coded out on music stands. The instant compositions ooze with dissonantly massed flutes, swell and fade, or cook like crazy. Butch Morris has been known to improvise with a jazz orchestra, but this has a more, uh, organic feel.\nYounger adventurers in the ensemble include Chris Heenan on bass clarinet, Sara Schoenbeck on bassoon, Harris Eisenstadt on drums. Also present are somewhat older players, such as drummer Alex Cline, bansuri player David Philipson, and flutists Ellen Burr and Emily Hay. Windman Ralph Jones points out that three generations of Detroit jazz adepts are onboard: himself, windman Bennie Maupin and windman Yusef Lateef.\nOne of Rudolphs primary mentors, Dr. Lateef, now 83, is a living link to Americas music history, but no relic. Always he has evolved, manifesting his own expressions in blues, swing, bop, hard bop, avant-garde, world, electronic and even symphonic music, and making his most challenging contributions late in life. He has taught at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst for some years, and doesnt travel too much anymore, so the sight of him makes an impression. Bundled up in burnoose, scarf and skullcap, he presents concise, authoritative statements: lonesome opening hoots on ocarina, resonant blurts on a double-reed gourd instrument, cries of painful truth on tenor. The orchestra is the writhing universe, with Dr. Lateefs instrumental lines the Genesis narration: And darkness was on the face of the deep.\nThe Go: Organic Orchestras third album, In the Garden, an exciting and maybe revolutionary two-disc document of the performances from early this year, is now available as a collaborative release on the YAL and Meta labels of its two principal creators. So here falls a good opportunity to relate some of the thoughts Dr. Lateef (slow and patient) and Mr. Rudolph (quietly urgent) shared in Rudolphs Venice living room the day after the first concert this year.\nL.A. WEEKLY: How did it feel?\nDR. YUSEF LATEEF: I enjoyed it immensely, playing in a context where so many things inspire me. I felt that I was surrounded by something very related to my own aesthetic.\nADAM RUDOLPH: Yusef and I met in 1988, and hes opened up many, many doors for me, in terms of how to look at things in fresh ways. Since hes had such a profound influence on my compositional concepts, even though I have my own aesthetic, I think that he automatically felt comfortable. And in the past Ive always written all the music, but this occasion was a collaboration Yusef sent some music ahead.\nWhat were the motivations for the Organic Orchestra?\nRUDOLPH: This music is oral tradition. I wanted to connect with more musicians and find out who was here, and what I discovered was that its my turn to be passing on things that Ive learned. So theres a lot of these younger musicians from varied backgrounds, and its been an opportunity for me to develop a mentoring and also learning relationship with them. I think a lot of them were really happy to be involved in the Organic Orchestra, because theyre getting a chance to expand their ideas of how to approach music, and I know a lot of them have taken the ideas and carried them out into their own ensembles.\nAnd what are some of the principles behind it?\nRUDOLPH: Low sounds carry more overtones, so high is embedded in low, in a way that low is not embedded in high. Like a drum especially, you strike it and there are very complex overtones thats what gives it its character and its richness. So inside of that are all the other tones. But its also tension and release so you control the low, and that controls the motion. Low to high is tension, and high to low is release. In Middle Eastern music they have a concept called usala, and thats how they structure their rhythm. Also, Yusef and I were talking about Michio Kaku, the theoretical physicist he wrote this book Hyperspace. He postulated 11 dimensions that could exist, and as you get into the higher dimensions, the laws of physics become simpler and simpler. So rather than thinking about a stylistic milieu, we look at music in the higher dimensions it becomes simpler and simpler.\nWhat has made you evolve?\nLATEEF: It was my nature.\nWho were examples to you?\nLATEEF: Uptown from where I lived as a youth was Lucky Thompson. He wanted a saxophone, but he couldnt afford one. So he got a broomstick and carved notches on it, and practiced on the broomstick until he got a saxophone. John Coltrane, every time hed come to Detroit, we would get together and study. And he was always looking for what he didnt know. He always asked me, What have you been following? And I asked him the same question. He said, I found the secondary dominants [the fifth degree above a note other than the tonic], which were in Europe years ago, but no one had used them in improvisational music, and John told me he knew his secondary dominants backwards.\nWhat moved you away from the blues and toward avant-garde and classical music?\nLATEEF: I think the basis of it is the moments that I spent sitting in the library in Detroit, and taking classes at Wayne State University in classical music, finding out what it involves Mozart, Beethoven, and the Russian composers, Borodin et cetera. And I realized that to be a musician, theres much ter-\nritory to look into. Beethoven wrote nine symphonies Id like to write nine, too. Ive written one symphony, Ive got eight\nmore to go.\nBoth of you have spent considerable time in Africa. How has that changed your attitude?\nLATEEF: Its more compassionate. You see somebody who needs help, you got to help.\nWhat attracted you to Islam?\nLATEEF: There was a mosque in Chicago, and I went and got some literature. It said through prayer and deeds ones natural tendencies are directed to the proper channels. The only virtue is in your actions thats what Islam teaches. And it spoke about respect of parents and of neighbors, and I already believed those things from my Christian upbringing. I joined Dizzy Gillespie in Chicago, and when we got to New York, a mosque was there, near Art Blakeys house. I started going to the meetings, and I said, I better try this. I thought I ought to change my name, and the reason I did was because Lateef means gentle and amiable, and Yusef means Joseph after the prophet Joseph. And Abdul Lateef means a servant of the gentle and amiable, a servant of God thats one of Gods attributes, gentle and amiable. And I said, Thats something for me to try to live up to.\nIs nature an inspiration?\nLATEEF: Nature is a prototype for painters, for musicians, for writers. We didnt create that, its beyond us. We observe it, and I think when we reflect on nature, it gives us ideas how to synthesize whatever were doing. Its a great teacher. Its reflections of the higher power. And were part of nature ourselves. This is something I believe: When we observe something thats beautiful, its not the thing that creates the beauty. The force that\ncreated that beauty is really whats attracting us. So that means a thing of beauty comes in pairs. Theres the thing itself, and theres the thing that makes it.\nRUDOLPH: Thats why I feel music is about something greater than music itself. Music is just a medium through which something is passing. Its all ultimately in service of something else.\nGet the Music Newsletter\nKeep your thumb on the local music scene with music features, additional online music listings and show picks.

He showed an interest in drums at a young age, watching the circus bands march by his family's home in Pontiac, Michigan.\nJones in 1976\n|Birth name||Elvin Ray Jones|\nSeptember 9, 1927|\nPontiac, Michigan, U.S.\n|Died||May 18, 2004\nEnglewood, New Jersey\nHe served in the United States Army from 1946 to 1949 and subsequently played in a Detroit house band led by Billy Mitchell. He moved to New York City in 1955 and worked as a sideman for Charles Mingus, Teddy Charles, Bud Powell and Miles Davis.\nFrom 1960 to 1966 he was a member of the John Coltrane quartet (along with Jimmy Garrison on bass and McCoy Tyner on piano), a celebrated recording phase, appearing on such albums as A Love Supreme. Following his work with Coltrane, Jones led several small groups, some under the name The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine. His brothers Hank Jones and Thad Jones were also jazz musicians with whom he recorded. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1995.\nElvin Jones was born in Pontiac, Michigan to parents Henry and Olivia Jones, who had moved to Michigan from Vicksburg, Mississippi. His brothers, Hank Jones and Thad Jones, both became important jazz musicians. By age two, he said he knew he held a fascination for drums. He would watch the circus marching band parades go by his home as a boy, particularly fascinated by the drummers. Following his early passion, Elvin joined his high school's black marching band, where he developed his foundation in rudiments. Jones began service in the United States Army in 1946. He was discharged in 1949, and returned home penniless. Jones said he borrowed $35 from his sister when he got back to buy his first drumset (US$352 in 2016 dollars).\nJones began his professional career in 1949 with a short-lived gig in Detroit's Grand River Street club. Eventually he went on to play with artists such as Miles Davis and Wardell Gray. In 1955, after a failed audition for the Benny Goodman band, he found work in New York City, joining Charles Mingus's band, and releasing a record called '\"Blue Moods\" on Debut records .\n1960‚Äì1966: John Coltrane and beyondEdit\nIn 1960, he joined the classic John Coltrane Quartet, which also included bassist Jimmy Garrison and pianist McCoy Tyner. Jones and Coltrane often played extended duet passages. This band is widely considered to have redefined \"swing\" (the rhythmic feel of jazz) in much the same way that Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and others did during earlier stages of jazz's development. He stayed with Coltrane until 1966. By that time, Jones was not entirely comfortable with Coltrane's new direction and his polyrhythmic style clashed with the \"multidirectional\" approach of the group's second drummer, Rashied Ali.\nJones remained active after leaving the Coltrane group, and led several bands in the late sixties and seventies that are considered highly influential groups. Notable among them was a trio formed with saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist Joe Farrell and (ex-Coltrane) bassist Jimmy Garrison, with whom he recorded the Blue Note album Puttin' It Together. Jones recorded extensively for Blue Note under his own name in the late sixties and early seventies, with groups that featured prominent as well as up and coming greats. The two-volume Live at the Lighthouse showcases a 21- and 26-year-old Steve Grossman and Dave Liebman, respectively. Jones played on many significant albums of the modal jazz era, such as The Real McCoy with McCoy Tyner and saxophonist Wayne Shorter's Speak No Evil. Other musicians of note who made significant contributions to Jones's music during this period were baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams, tenor saxophonists George Coleman and Frank Foster, trumpeter Lee Morgan, bassist Gene Perla, keyboardist Jan Hammer and jazz‚Äìworld music group Oregon.\nElvin Jones' sense of timing, polyrhythms, dynamics, timbre, and legato phrasing brought the drumset to the foreground. Jones was touted by Life Magazine as \"the world's greatest rhythmic drummer\", and his free-flowing style was a major influence on many leading drummers, including Christian Vander, Mitch Mitchell (whom Jimi Hendrix called \"my Elvin Jones\"), Ginger Baker and Janet Weiss.\nIn 1999, Jones worked with Our Lady Peace on their album Happiness...Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch. He was featured playing drums on the song \"Stealing Babies\", which was also featured on their 2009 compilation album The Very Best of Our Lady Peace.\nJones performed and recorded with his own group, the Elvin Jones Jazz Machine, whose line up changed through the years. Sonny Fortune and Ravi Coltrane, John Coltrane's son, both played saxophone with the Jazz Machine in the early 1990s, appearing together with Jones on In Europe on Enja Records in 1991. Jones, who taught regularly, often took part in clinics, played in schools, and gave free concerts in prisons. His lessons emphasized music history as well as drumming technique.\nElvin Jones died of heart failure in Englewood, New Jersey on May 18, 2004. He was survived by his first wife Shirley and his second, albeit common-law, wife Keiko (Elvin married Keiko before divorcing Shirley, meaning that legally he and Keiko were not married), in addition to his son Elvin Nathan Jones of California and daughter Rose-Marie Rosie Jones of Sweden.\n- Yanow, Scott. \"Elvin Jones\".

{"question":"What happened to Robert E. Lee's army's ability to attack after the Battle of the Wilderness?","answer":"After the Battle of the Wilderness, Lee's army rarely took the initiative and instead tended to wait in its defenses for Union attacks, which cancelled out Lee's strategic abilities and removed his chance to influence battles with inspired strategy.","context":["|Full Index||Subjects||Concepts||Country||Documents||Pictures & Maps|\nThe fourth phase of U.S. Grant‚Äôs overland campaign against Robert E. Lee. Grant had spent all of May attempting to get past Lee‚Äôs right flank, suffering and inflicting heavy casualties on the way (Battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania and North Anna River). However, by Cold Harbor, both armies had been reinforced back up to their original sizes (although on both sides some of these reinforcements came from other armies). For many in the north, Grant was failing just as badly as his predecessors, and at much higher cost.\nIn reality, Lee‚Äôs army was being badly mauled. He was losing experienced officers at a dreadful rate. The pool of potential reinforcements was being to run dry. After the Battle of the Wilderness his army rarely took the initiative, instead tending to wait in its defences for Union attacks. This tended to cancel out Lee‚Äôs own great abilities, removing the chance for him to influence a battle with a flash of inspired strategy. Each apparent Union ‚Äòfailure‚Äô was driving Lee back towards Richmond and a potential siege. Grant‚Äôs simple refusal to be beaten now began to pose a potentially mortal threat to Lee‚Äôs army.\nGrant‚Äôs army had also suffered during May. Combat had been so intense and so constant that men began to develop shell shock, more familiar from the Western Front. Just as Lee‚Äôs army was beginning to lose its ability to attack, Grant‚Äôs was beginning to slow down. This was to cost it dearly at Cold Harbor (and again soon after at Petersburg).\nThis was not immediately apparent. On 31 May Sheridan‚Äôs cavalry managed to force a Confederate force out of Old Cold Harbor. The next day he was able to hold on until the first infantry units began to arrive to reinforce him. Grant now ordered his army to concentrate at Cold Harbor, with the hope of launching an attack on 2 June. He was to be disappointed in this. Partly due to exhaustion and partly due to confusion on the roads, the Union army was not in place in time for an attack on 2 June.\n3 June saw one of only two attacks that Grant admitted to regretting ordering (the other was the second assault on Vicksburg). By 3 June, Lee‚Äôs men had had time to fortify their seven mile long line using all the experience gained over the last month. Despite an almost 2-1 advantage in numbers (although not in the actual attack itself), Grant‚Äôs men had no chance of success unless their enemy was utterly demoralised. The attack went forward early in the morning of 3 June. In one hour of fighting the Union army suffered 7,000 casualties. Confederate losses were at most 1,500. Although the two armies stayed in the trenches around Cold Harbor for some days after 3 June, the failed assault effectively ended the battle.\nWith it ended the overland campaign against Richmond. There was very little potential left for flanking manoeuvres in the vicinity of Richmond, and the swamps around the Chickahominy were just as big a barrier as they had been two years earlier. However, one of the many ways in which Grant differed from McClellan was that he was not easily discouraged. Once it was clear that he would not achieve his aims outside Richmond, he began to look for another target. He soon found that target. In mid-June, Grant‚Äôs men crossed the James River, shifting the focus of their attack from Richmond to Petersburg.\n||Save this on Delicious|\nHelp - F.A.Q. - Contact Us - Search - Recent - About Us - Subscribe in a reader\n|Subscribe to History of War|\n|Browse Archives at groups.google.co.uk|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a0dcb896-2f26-4b51-bcee-5c0d9a6bc078>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare the representation of human vulnerability in Turner's paintings and in Victorian ruin art?","answer":"In Turner's paintings, humans were deliberately placed to show both affection for humanity and its vulnerability against the 'sublime' power of nature, often depicting people drinking, making merry, or working in the foreground against majestic landscapes. In Victorian ruin art and literature, human vulnerability was portrayed through the lens of civilizational decline, with works like Gustave Dor√©'s 'The New Zealander' showing destroyed cities and collapsed monuments to emphasize humanity's transience. Both approaches explored human frailty, but Turner focused on the individual against natural forces, while Victorian ruin art emphasized the collective vulnerability of entire societies.","context":["A traveler pauses, perched on a boulder by a cool riverside to take in the view along the far bank. The scene that meets his gaze is that of a desolate and devastated London: a ravaged panorama of collapsed roofs and crumbling walls, with vegetation overgrowing amongst the ruins. Emerging high above the surrounding rubble St Paul‚Äôs cathedral still stands, but its iconic dome is caved-in like a crushed eggshell.\nDramatic scenes like this are familiar from any of the post-apocalyptic films appearing in cinemas over recent years. But this imagined vista is from Gustave Dor√©‚Äôs engraving ‚ÄúThe New Zealander,‚Äù dating back to 1872.\nThese days, ruin porn is a thriving cultural phenomenon. It includes Yves Marchand and Romain Meffre‚Äôs haunting images of Detroit, and the city of Pripyat abandoned since the Chernobyl disaster. The Tate Britain in London currently has a whole exhibition devoted to ruin lust through the ages, from 18th-century drawings of Roman ruins to photography of the broken remnants of WWII. I‚Äôve recently published a book on the science and technology needed to reconstruct civilization from scratch, and during the research I was drawn powerfully to these images of wrecked cities and ancient ruins. They got me thinking about how long the fragments of our own modern society might persist. Of course, ruin porn isn‚Äôt just oil paintings and gritty photography. There‚Äôs also a rich seam in the cinematography of post-apocalyptic films like The Road or I Am Legend, and a number of successful recent computer games have also excelled in this aesthetic, such as Fallout 3 and The Last of Us.\nBut the symbolism of ruins has been appreciated for centuries. For example, the Exeter Book, an eighth-century codex, contains this poem by an unknown Anglo-Saxon, lamenting Roman ruins:\nBurg-places broken, the work of giants crumbled.\nRuined are the roofs, tumbled the towers,\nBroken the barred gate: frost in the plaster,\nCeilings a-gaping, torn away, fallen,\nEaten by age‚Ä¶\nRuin lust grew with fervor from the 18th century: the soft, pastel hues of J.M.W Turner‚Äôs Tintern Abbey, Hubert Robert‚Äôs ‚ÄúImaginary view of the Gallery of the Louvre as a Ruin,‚Äù the ruined cathedrals and shipwrecks of Caspar David Friedrich, and Gustave Dor√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe New Zealander.‚Äù Eighteenth-century English aristocrats even went to the extent of constructing fresh ruins on their estates‚Äîfollies‚Äîfor exhibiting their wealth and sophistication whilst picnicking in the shade of the contrived remnants.\nIt is within this zeitgeist that one of the earliest examples of post-apocalyptic fiction was born, Mary Shelley‚Äôs novel The Last Man, published eight years after Frankenstein. The Victorians in particular were obsessed with the decline and fall of Rome and conscious that their mighty, globe-spanning British Empire could also succumb to chaos and disintegrate.\nRuins evoke a complex mix of emotions. It‚Äôs partly a guilty or even gleeful delight in the aftermath of destruction‚Äîeither rapid from fire or other natural disaster, or due to the slow but relentless decay of the elements. It is the melancholic beauty of the fragments that remain from a once-opulent edifice. It‚Äôs also a totem to the struggle between human will and the relentless forces of nature: of gravity and rot and vegetation. This picturesque decay plays with the dichotomy between our artificial constructions and the wildness of nature poised to overwhelm the built world as soon as an opportunity arises.\nRuin lust is all of these things. But of course, it is also something far more important, far more symbolic than that. Ruins evoke a sense of foreboding and uneasiness. The deepest allure of ruins, the source of their frisson, is not that they speak about the past, but about the future. Ruins are a premonition, a warning from history about our own inescapable destiny. They are a reminder that all eventually will be lost, even that which is grand and mighty. This antidote to hubris is explored powerfully by Percy Bysshe Shelley in his 1818 sonnet, describing the broken remains of an ancient Egyptian statue and the inscription it bore:\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!‚Äù\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\nPerhaps the most poignant examples of ruin porn are those depicting familiar or well-loved landmarks in a future state of devastation, a frisson played masterfully by Gustave Dor√© and Hubert Robert (who became nicknamed Robert des ruines) in the 18th century. And today, this marks the subtle but key difference between disaster movies and post-apocalyptic movies. The money shot in a catastrophe movie invariably indulges in the destruction of famous buildings and monuments. But in future dystopias, the role required of the ruin porn is to provide viewers with context to the scene and deliver the feeling of discomfort from the incongruity of the familiar landmark and the new world order around it. This means that in apocalyptic films the familiar landmarks are the first to be destroyed; but in post-apocalptic movies they are all that remains. (With perhaps Planet of the Apes being the pinnacle example of this: only the hand of the statue endures). The great architect Sir John Soane even commissioned the painter Joseph Gandy to imagine his own new creation the Bank of England in a future state of ruination and destruction.\nIn this way, every disintegrating edifice or monument is like an inadvertent memento mori, an allegory of death and decay, as used by Renaissance painters: a bowl of fruit, an hourglass timer, or the anamorphic skull in Holbein‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Ambassadors‚Äù being a particularly good example.\nThese are reminders of the transience of beauty and the impermanence of all things, including our lives. And in the case of Roman or Mayan ruins, for example, a stark demonstration of not only the mortality of us all as individuals, but that even entire civilizations themselves are fragile and can collapse and die.\nAs Denis Diderot, the great encyclopedia compiler, put it in 1767, ‚ÄúThe ideas ruins evoke in me are grand. Everything comes to nothing, everything perishes, everything passes, only the world remains, only time endures.‚Äù","|J. M. W. Turner|\nSelf portrait, oil on canvas, circa 1799\n|Born||April 23, 1775\nCovent Garden, London, England\n|Died||December 19, 1851\nRiver Thames, London, England\n|Cause of death||Unspecified (burial location: St. Paul's Cathedral, London)|\n|Other names||Joseph Turner, William Turner|\nJoseph Mallord William Turner (April 23, 1775 ‚Äì December 19, 1851) was an English Romantic landscape painter, watercolorist, and printmaker. His paintings are noted for their impressive use of light. Turner was one of the Romantics who rejected the rationalism of the Enlightenment, and sought to express the internal longings of his soul in his painting.\nTurner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand (with frequent scenes of people drinking and merry-making or working in the foreground), but its vulnerability and vulgarity amidst the \"sublime\" nature of the world (illustrated by majestic background landscapes) on the other hand. The sublime was an important Romantic concept, which emphasized the awe-inspiring, savage grandeur, a natural world unmastered by humans, evidencing the power of God, which a number of artists and poets explored in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Turner placed great significance on light, which to him was to the emanation of God's spirit. He refined this focus in his later paintings by leaving out solid objects and detail while concentrating on the play of light on water, the radiance of skies, and fires. Although these late paintings appear to be \"impressionistic\" and therefore a forerunner of the French school, Turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world, rather than responding primarily to optical phenomena. (\"The Sun is God,\" he stated shortly before his death.)\nTurner was born in Covent Garden, London, England. His father, William Gay Turner (January 27, 1738 ‚Äì August 7, 1829), was a barber and wig maker. His mother, Mary Marshall, became increasingly mentally unstable, perhaps, in part, due to the early death of Turner's younger sister in 1786. She died in 1804, after having been committed in 1799 to a mental asylum.\nPossibly due to the load placed on the family by these problems, the young Turner was sent, in 1785, to stay with his uncle on his mother's side in Brentford, which was then a small town west of London on the banks of the River Thames. It was here that he first expressed an interest in painting. A year later he went to school in Margate in Kent to the east of London in the area of the Thames estuary. By this time he had created many drawings, which his father exhibited in his shop window.\nHe entered the Royal Academy of Art schools in 1789, when he was only 14 years old, and was accepted into the academy a year later. Sir Joshua Reynolds, president of the Royal Academy at the time, chaired the panel that admitted him. At first Turner showed a keen interest in architecture but was advised to keep to painting by the architect Thomas Hardwick (junior). A watercolor of Turner's was accepted for the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1790, after only one year's study. He exhibited his first oil painting in 1796, Fishermen at Sea and thereafter exhibited at the academy nearly every year for the rest of his life.\nAlthough renowned for his oils, Turner is also one of the greatest masters of British watercolor landscape painting. He is commonly known as \"the painter of light.\"\nOne of his most famous oil paintings is The fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up, painted in 1838, which hangs in the National Gallery, London.\nTurner traveled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802, studying in the Louvre Museum in Paris in the same year. He also made many visits to Venice during his lifetime. On a visit to Lyme Regis, in Dorset, England, he painted a stormy scene (now in the Cincinnati Art Museum). Turner was also a frequent guest of Lord Egremont at Petworth House in West Sussex and painted scenes from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal that Egremont funded. Petworth House still displays a number of paintings.\nAs he grew older, Turner became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years, eventually working as his studio assistant. His father's death, in 1829, had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. He never married, although he had two daughters by Sarah Danby, one born in 1801, the other in 1811.\nHe died in the house of his mistress Mrs. Sophia Caroline Booth in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea on December 19, 1851. At his request he was buried in Saint Paul's Cathedral, where he lies next to Sir Joshua Reynolds. His last exhibition at the Royal Academy was in 1850.\nTurner's talent was recognized early in his life. He became a full art academician at the age of 29. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterized by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper's The Illustrated History of Art, his later pictures were called \"fantastic puzzles.\" However, Turner was still recognized as an artistic genius: the influential English art critic John Ruskin described Turner as the artist who could most \"stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature.\"\nSuitable vehicles for Turner's imagination were to be found in the subjects of shipwrecks, fires (such as the burning of Parliament in 1834, an event which Turner rushed to witness first-hand, and which he transcribed in a series of watercolor sketches), natural catastrophes, and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen in Dawn after the Wreck (1840) and The Slave Ship (1840).\nTurner placed human beings in many of his paintings to indicate his affection for humanity on the one hand (note the frequent scenes of people drinking and merry-making or working in the foreground), but its vulnerability and vulgarity amidst the \"sublime\" nature of the world on the other hand. The sublime was an important Romantic concept which emphasized the awe-inspiring, savage grandeur, a natural world unmastered by humans, evidence of the power of God which a number of artists and poets were exploring in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The significance of light was to Turner the emanation of God's spirit and this was why he refined the subject matter of his later paintings by leaving out solid objects and detail, concentrating on the play of light on water, the radiance of skies and fires. Although these late paintings appear to be 'impressionistic' and therefore a forerunner of the French school, Turner was striving for expression of spirituality in the world, rather than responding primarily to optical phenomena. (\"The Sun is God,\" he stated shortly before his death.)\nHis first works, such as Tintern Abbey (1795) and Venice: S. Giorgio Maggiore (1819), stayed true to the traditions of English landscape. However, in Hannibal Crossing the Alps (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolor technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.\nOne apocryphal story about Turner claims that he even had himself \"tied to the mast of a ship in order to experience the drama\" of the elements during a storm at sea.\nIn his later years, he used oils ever more transparently, and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering color. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in Rain, Steam and Speed‚ÄîThe Great Western Railway, where the objects are barely recognizable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner's work in the vanguard of English painting, but later exerted an influence upon art in France, as well; the Impressionists, particularly Claude Monet, carefully studied his techniques. In the modern art era, advocates of abstract art were also inspired by Turner.\nIt has been suggested that the high levels of ash in the atmosphere during the 1816 \"Year Without a Summer,\" which led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, were an inspiration for some of Turner's work.\nJohn Ruskin says in his \"Notes\" on Turner in March 1878, that an early patron, Dr Thomas Monro, the Principal Physician of Bedlam, was a significant influence on Turner's style:\nHis true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by Giston, the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.\nTurner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called \"decayed artists.\" Part of the money went to the Royal Academy of Arts, which now does not use it for this purpose though occasionally it awards students the Turner Medal. His collection of finished paintings was bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not come to pass owing to a failure to agree on a site, and then to the parsimony of British governments. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an Act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, and so began the process of scattering the pictures which Turner had wanted to be kept together. In 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the Tate Gallery. In 1987 a new wing of the Tate, the Clore Gallery, was opened specifically to house the Turner bequest, though some of the most important paintings in it remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner's condition that the finished pictures be kept and shown together.\nIn 1974, the Turner Museum was founded in Sarasota, Florida by Douglass Montrose-Graem to house his collection of Turner prints, with an online gallery and catalog of complete listing of Turner works.\nA prestigious annual art award, the Turner Prize, created in 1984, was named in Turner's honor, but has become increasingly controversial, having promoted art which has no apparent connection with Turner's. Twenty years later the more modest Winsor & Newton Turner Watercolour Award was founded.\nA major exhibition, \"Turner's Britain,\" with material, (including The Fighting Temeraire) on loan from around the globe, was held at Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery from November 7, 2003 to February 8, 2004.\nIn October 2005, Professor Harold Livermore, its owner for 60 years, gave Sandycombe Lodge, the villa at Twickenham which Turner designed and built for himself, to the Sandycombe Lodge Trust to be preserved as a monument to the artist. In 2006, he additionally gave some land to the Trust which had been part of Turner's domaine. The Friends of Turner's House were formed in 2004, to support it.\nIn April 2006, Christie's New York auctioned Giudecca, La Donna Della Salute and San Giorgio, a view of Venice exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1841, for US$35.8 million, setting a new record for a Turner. The New York Times stated that according to two sources who had requested anonymity the buyer was casino magnate Stephen Wynn.\nIn 2006, Turner's Glaucus and Scylla (1840) was returned by Kimbell Art Museum to the heirs of John and Anna Jaffe after a Holocaust Claim was made, and documentation supported the claim that the Jaff√© collection may have been unlawfully seized by the pro-Nazi Vichy regime in France in 1943. The painting is scheduled to be sold by Christie's in April of 2007.\nAll links retrieved March 11, 2018.\n|Eighteenth century - Nineteenth century|\n|Romantic music: Beethoven - Berlioz - Brahms - Chopin - Grieg - Liszt - Puccini - Schumann - Tchaikovsky - The Five - Verdi - Wagner|\n|Romantic poetry: Blake - Burns - Byron - Coleridge - Goethe - H√∂lderlin - Hugo - Keats - Lamartine - Leopardi - Lermontov - Mickiewicz - Nerval - Novalis - Pushkin - Shelley - S≈Çowacki - Wordsworth|\n|Visual art and architecture: Brullov - Constable - Corot - Delacroix - Friedrich - G√©ricault - Gothic Revival architecture - Goya - Hudson River school - Leutze - Nazarene movement - Palmer - Turner|\n|Romantic culture: Bohemianism - Romantic nationalism|\n|<< Age of Enlightenment||Victorianism >>\nNew World Encyclopedia writers and editors rewrote and completed the Wikipedia article in accordance with New World Encyclopedia standards.

{"question":"Hey there! I'm curious about egg safety - what's the proper way to cook eggs, and what are the risks of eating undercooked ones? üç≥","answer":"For proper cooking, place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan, cover with cold water by 1 inch, and heat to boiling. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 15 minutes for large eggs (12 for medium, 18 for extra large). Drain and cool under cold water or in ice water. This method produces tender eggs and minimizes cracking. Regarding risks, undercooked eggs are one of the most commonly consumed risky foods. Sunny-side up, soft-boiled, or over-easy eggs carry the risk of salmonella. If you want to eat runny eggs, it's recommended to use pasteurized eggs, which have been briefly heated to destroy bacteria and are available at many supermarkets.","context":["The American Egg Board offers cooking instructions for Basic Hard-Cooked Eggs that includes placing the eggs in a saucepan large enough to hold them in single layer. Add cold water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Heat the eggs over high heat just to boiling. Remove from burner. Cover pan. Let eggs stand in hot water about 15 minutes for large eggs (12 minutes for medium eggs and 18 minutes for extra large eggs). Drain the water immediately and serve warm or cool completely under cold running water or in bowl of ice water, then refrigerate. Remember hard cooked, not hard-boiled. Although the cooking water must come to a full boil in this method, the pan is immediately removed from the heat so that the eggs cook gently in the hot water. This produces tender, not rubbery, ‚ÄúIncredible Edible Eggs‚Äù and minimizes cracking.\nHow do I banish the green ring?\nThis harmless but unsightly discoloration that sometimes forms around hard-cooked yolks results from a reaction between sulfur in the egg white and iron in the yolk. It occurs when the eggs have been cooked for too long or at too high a temperature. The recommended method is cooking eggs in hot, not boiling, water and then cooling immediately, minimizes this. Here are some answers to some questions about egg cookery.\nCan I microwave eggs in their shell?\nNever microwave eggs in the shell. Steam builds up too quickly and eggs are likely to explode.\nMy eggs are difficult to peel. What should I do?\nVery fresh eggs can be difficult to peel. To ensure easily peeled eggs, buy and refrigerate your eggs a week to 10 days in advance of cooking. This brief ‚Äúbreather‚Äù allows the eggs time to take in air, which helps separate the membranes from the shell. Hard-cooked eggs are easier to peel right after cooking. Cooking causes the egg to contract slightly in the shell. To peel a hard-cooked egg, gently tap the egg on the counter until the shell is finely cracked all over. Roll the egg between hands to loosen shell. Start peeling at large end, holding egg under cold water to help ease the shell off. Remember, storage of the egg in the shell consists of refrigeration safely up to one week. Refrigerate in their original carton to prevent odor absorption. Once peeled, eggs should be eaten that day.\nWhat about Easter eggs?\nDecorated eggs are traditionally a part of Easter. So how can you be sure that your children color and decorate hard-cooked eggs safely for Easter? Eggs are frequently handled at Easter time and each handling is one more chance that the eggs might come in contact with bacteria. To avoid bacterial contamination, wash your hands thoroughly before you handle the eggs including cooking, cooling and decorating. Refrigerate hard-cooked eggs in their cartons if you will not be coloring them right after cooking and cooling. Refrigerate them again right after you dye them and after you display them. Color only uncracked eggs. If you plan to eat your dyed eggs later, use food coloring or specially made food-grade egg dyes dissolved in water that is warmer than the eggs. If you keep hard-cooked eggs out of refrigeration for more than two hours or several days for decoration, cook extra eggs for eating. Either discard the eggs that have been left out or use them only for decoration.\nIf you hide eggs, consider hiding places carefully. Avoid areas where the eggs might come in contact with dirt, pets, wild animals, birds, reptiles, insects or lawn chemicals. Refrigerate the hidden eggs after they have been found.\nIf you are looking for a nice recipe for a special spring occasion, try Basic Cheese Quiche. You will need these ingredients: ¬Ω to 1 cup shredded cheese (2-to 4 ounces), one baked piecrust (9-inch), and ¬Ω to 1 cup filling (6 eggs, 1 cup milk, ¬Ω teaspoon dried thyme leaves or other herb, ¬Ω teaspoon salt).\nTo make this recipe, heat oven to 375 degrees, spread cheese evenly in bottom of pie shell. Beat eggs, milk, thyme and salt in medium bowl until well blended. Carefully pour over cheese into pie shell. Bake until center is almost set but jiggles slightly when dish is gently shaken and knife inserted near center comes out clean, 30-40 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut into wedges.

That includes eggs served sunny-side up as well as raw eggs used in preparation of hollandaise sauce, meringue, Caesar salad dressing, and the like.\nFood safety authorities have long steered people away from sunny-side-up, soft-boiled, or \"over- easy\" eggs, all of which carry the risk of salmonella. If you must eat runny eggs or use them in recipes, Weis suggests you buy pasteurized eggs, which have been briefly heated to destroy bacteria. They are available -- typically at a small premium -- at many supermarkets. If you're ordering sunny-side-up eggs at a restaurant, ask if they're pasteurized, she suggests.\nRisky Take-Home Food\nFood safety experts are keeping an eye on some worrying trends in food consumption. One is the growing preference for unprocessed \"natural\" foods available at farmers' markets. While many of these foods may be very healthy, unpasteurized dairy products and juices are more likely to carry a variety of nasty bacteria, experts say. \"You can have fresh and locally-produced food that is also safe,\" Scallan says, \"and safe food means pasteurized milk and juices.\"\nAnother trend: Buying prepared food from supermarkets and then bringing it home for the family. It's dangerous to leave perishable food at room temperature for more than two hours, notes Shelly Feist of the nonprofit Partnership for Food Safety Education. That window shortens considerably when temperatures are higher -- such as when a prepared meal is placed in a hot car. So be sure to eat prepared food soon after purchasing it, Feist says.\nFood Safety in the Outdoors\nThe warm weather that makes springtime so inviting also creates an ideal breeding environment for bacteria and other pathogens found in food. Here's some advice from The Partnership for Food Safety Education on how to apply food-safety tips to the out-of-doors:\n- Clean. Wash your hands -- as well as utensils, cutting boards, and countertops -- in hot soapy water before and after preparing each food item. Also wash produce, which can carry harmful bacteria. As easy as these directives can be to ignore while in the kitchen, it's even easier when you're outside and playing with the dog, with the Frisbee, or with your baby niece, Feist notes. Don't drop your guard!\n- Separate. Sure, it's tempting to pour that sauce you used to marinate raw burgers or chicken wings onto the cooked food. It's also tempting to place the cooked grub back onto the plate that held your raw meat. Don't give in! Always keep raw meat and its juices separate from cooked food. If you want to reuse that sauce, then boil it first.\n- Cook. It's the best way to kill bad bugs. When grilling, preheat the coals on your grill for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the coals are lightly coated with ash. Use a meat thermometer to ensure that hamburgers and red meats are cooked to 160 degrees and ground poultry to 165 degrees. Poultry breast should be cooked to 170 degrees; dark meat (wings and thighs) should be cooked to 180 degrees. Poultry juices should run clear. Fish should be opaque and flaky.\n- Chill. No, this doesn't refer to what you do after breaking open a Bud at the barbecue. Bacteria grow quickly at room temperature and even faster under the hot sun. So refrigerate meat while it marinates, and keep that potato salad in a cooler that's well-packed with ice or freezer packs.\nMore tips are available at the Partnership's web site, www.fightbac.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9efef205-1c8d-4279-ac55-a0f2ca0b9e80>","<urn:uuid:0153f205-e5b4-4085-bdc6-58c60f9f165a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I want to understand two important things about wine bacteria please - when do they become problem and what happen to temperature during ferment? Can you explain with examples?","answer":"Wine bacteria become problematic when they are the 'harmful' type (primarily lactobacillus genus) that break down not just malic acid but also tartaric acid and glycerol, especially in conditions with residual sugar or high pH. For example, in stuck fermentations, they can increase volatile acidity and make wine taste thin or faulty. Regarding temperature during fermentation, it typically rises about 1¬∞F (0.5¬∞C) for each degree Brix, with about 40% of heat escaping to surrounding atmosphere. For instance, 30 gallons of must in a partially insulated container can reach 100¬∞F (38¬∞C) overnight, which can cause problems like hydrogen sulfide production (creating rotten egg smell) or stuck fermentations.","context":["Yeast, like most living things, have a climate that they prefer. Just as people like warm, sunny weather, yeast, too, like their atmosphere temperate. When things get cold, around 40 ¬∞F (4 ¬∞C), yeast start to shut down. When must gets very warm (around 100 ¬∞F/38 ¬∞C), things also start to get uncomfortable for the yeast, and undesirable results can occur.\nAdditionally, fermentation is an active, living process, and all that activity can cause temperatures to rise in your must. Ultimately, this means that to create good wine with the flavors you intend, it is extremely important to control must temperature.\nThe type of wine you are producing will direct what temperature range is optimum. White wines are generally fermented under cool (not cold) conditions, while red wines can be fermented a little warmer. For a fruity, white wine, cooler temperatures ‚Äî 40 to 70 ¬∞F (4 to 21 ¬∞C) ‚Äî allow for the retention of highly volatile aroma components. A rapid, warm fermentation will create a draft of carbon dioxide rising from the must, taking fruity esters with it. However, red wines stand up much better to elevated temperatures (50 to 80 ¬∞F/10 to 27 ¬∞C), and extraction of color and tannins may actually be enhanced by it.\nAs in most cases, there are optimum ranges. There exist formulas for predicting the temperature rise per degree Brix, but there are so many variables involved in fermentation conditions that a formula will usually not be able to truly predict the temperature your must will reach.\nThe basic math says that your temperature will rise about 1 ¬∞F (0.5 ¬∞C) for each degree Brix and assumes that around 40 percent of the heat escapes to the surrounding atmosphere. The conditions that most affect this ratio are the size and shape of the fermentation vessel, ambient air temperature, and fermentation speed.\nFermentation speed and temperature are directly related in that the higher the temperature goes, the faster the fermentation will roll. And the faster the fermentation goes, the faster the temperature will rise. If 30 gallons (114 L) of must is left to ferment overnight in a partially insulated container, it can easily reach 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C) by morning.\nWhile it might at first seem advantageous to have the fermentation finish in just two days or so, consider how this will affect both the activity of the yeast and the flavor of the must. When fermenting at rapid rates, certain strains of yeast can produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S), giving your wine a rotten egg or cooked cabbage smell. This doesn‚Äôt always happen, and it might just blow off if it does, but there‚Äôs no reason to risk such ill results. The reasons this occurs are not known, and it‚Äôs not always possible to predict which strains will produce hydrogen sulfide (though Montrachet is a good bet if you want to get some stinkiness). So it‚Äôs best not to gamble. Also, temperatures this high can produce ‚Äúcooked‚Äù flavors in the finished wine. Excessively high temperatures may also be a cause of some stuck fermentations, as the yeast find it difficult to perform when it‚Äôs too hot.\nFermentation speed and temperature are directly related in that the higher the temperature goes, the faster the fermentation will roll\nOn the other side of the coin, if a must is kept too cool, the fermentation will simply stop. The main danger here is that the must is then vulnerable to contamination by organisms that can better tolerate the low temperatures. With the yeast not producing alcohol, bacteria, wild yeasts, and mold can grow.\nThe lower the temperature, the slower the fermentation will proceed. Molasses-in-January-type fermentations leave the must open to those other organisms and all the ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù they produce. It‚Äôs best to get the fermentation started quickly and then keep it rolling at a nice, even temperature for the duration of the process.\nWarming Ways and Cooling Trends\nIn commercial applications, wine is warmed by its own fermentation activity in an insulated container and cooled by glycol or ammonia jackets. Heat exchangers are used both to warm and cool must, juice, and wine. These same principles can be used at home, but equipment will have to be slightly different (unless you are interested in building an anhydrous liquid ammonia system in your garage).\nThe first step for red wines is to jump-start fermentation by your desired organism. If you crush and add yeast into insulated containers, the yeast will rapidly build up heat in the liquid. Then, when the must reaches around 80 ¬∞F (27 ¬∞C), simply transfer it to an uninsulated container, where it will cool. The fermentation will stabilize and should stay at 70 to 80 ¬∞F (21 to 27 ¬∞C) until the sugar is almost all consumed.\nRegular punchdowns, in addition to all their other purposes, will keep the juice under the cap from storing heat.\nIf the must gets too cool (under 65 ¬∞F/18 ¬∞C), just put it back in the insulated container. If you have the resources, Rubbermaid Roughneck trash cans, sprayed with foam insulation, work very well. You can also use the same container with some other insulation, such as room-temperature water or blankets. The other nice thing about these cans as fermenters is that they have lids that fit snugly but aren‚Äôt completely airtight.\nRegular punchdowns, in addition to all their other purposes, will keep the juice under the cap from storing heat. As long as your fermenter is not too big (under 50 gallons/190 L, say) and the must is transferred before it gets too hot, you will not likely have problems with keeping it at the right temperature.\nFor white wines you‚Äôll see better results if the fermentation proceeds a little slower and at a cooler temperature. Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky. The same problems with bacteria and wild yeast exist here, so start the fermentation at room temperature to get it going. Then once it‚Äôs rolling, get the must to a cool atmosphere. If your fermenters are small, you can immerse them in water (a bathtub or water trough works well). Cooling the water by running it (not too environmentally friendly), adding ice, or circulating it through a heat exchanger will keep your fermenters at whatever temperature you like.\nThe key here is to check the must temperature regularly, two or three times a day or so, to make sure the must doesn‚Äôt get too warm or too cold. If you happen to have a refrigerator that will keep a constant temperature near 50 ¬∞F (10 ¬∞C), this is an ideal place to keep fermenting juice. Most refrigerators don‚Äôt get that warm but if you‚Äôre lucky, you can find one that‚Äôs not too efficient or reduce its efficiency by adding jugs of water. An older refrigerator should work just fine. Be careful that your must doesn‚Äôt get below 40 ¬∞F (4 ¬∞C), though, or your yeast will go into hibernation.\nIf your fermentation is going too slowly or activity ceases, warm it up a little to get it going. If neither of these methods works for you, try freezing milk jugs full of water and floating them in the must, stirring with them, or using them to do your punchdowns (if you‚Äôre making red). As long as the liquid is being stirred around (and even probably if it‚Äôs not), parts of the must won‚Äôt get too cold.\nThe basic goal is to keep a strong, smooth fermentation going consistently until all of the sugar is consumed. If you can keep red wines around 70 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) and whites at around 55 ¬∞F (13 ¬∞C), you‚Äôll probably achieve this. Diligent temperature taking and temperature correcting should keep your must at the ideal temperature for the best results.","Malolactic fermentation & lactic bacteria\n(based on Emile Peynaud‚Äôs Connaissance et Travail du Vin)\nAlso a useful scientific paper available here\nWhat is malolactic fermentation?\nAfter draining off the wine from the vat in which alcoholic fermentation takes place, a second 'finishing' phase takes place, a slower fermentation 'd'achevement' 'de finition'. Carried out correctly, malolactic fermentation softens and rounds out the wine, and increases microbiological stability. If it is not carried out (or if more harmful bacteria go to work on the wine), the wine can become hard, tough and with overly high Total Acidity.\nIt's a fermentation of malic acid by lactic bacteria rather than yeasts. Think of it also as a chemical de-acidification that breaks down the malic acid. Characteristics of 'mouelleux'/round mouthfeel are associated with lower acidity. For fine wines, malolactic fermentation can be seen as the first step of qualitative ageing and stability.\nThe presence of lactic acids in wine was first observed over a century ago, but it's only been 50 years since the recognition that the fermentation of malic acid could be both useful and controlled (because often it happened spontaneously at the end of alcoholic fermentation before ecoulage if the cuvaison is prolonged and so went unnoticed). This was discovered by Peynaud in 1956\nBacteria usually become visible very early on during alcoholic fermentation (after a few days).This is not the beginning of an infection, as was previously thought, but these are malolactic bacteria which are beginning to develop. In some years (or in certain winemaking estates who make this choice) malo takes place slowly over winter if it's mild enough to allow the wine to remain fizzy (they seem to be fermenting all winter even though they no longer contain any sugar). In other cases it happens as temperatures warm up in spring, even summer. The rise in temperature allows the bacteria to be 'activated' if there is malic acid in the wine still.\nIn northern regions particularly (septentrionales in french) grapes retain high levels of malic acid even after fermentation and can be almost undrinkable without this malolactic fermentation. They can regularly keep 8-10g of fixed acidity without it!\nUsually during alcoholic fermentation totaly acidity drops by between 1.5 and 3 grams per litrqe. So maybe 6.5g/l (sulfuric acid) to 3.8. This is not due simply to a tartric precipitation (as used to be believed), but the disappearance of malic acid. At the same time the quantity of lactic acid increases.\nGlobal reaction = malic acid (1g) becomes lactic acid (0.67g) + carbonic acid (0.33g or 165cm3)\nThe carbonic gas produced escapes and the wine becomes fizzy. This is the direct reason for the lessening of overall acidity (it is 'escaping' through the fizzy carbonic acid). Malic acid has two functions while lactic acid only has one. By transforming malic acid into lactic acid, about half of the total acidity is lost because it has transformed into volatile carbonic acid, which then disengages from the wine, turning into bubbles of carbonic gas, and disappears into the atmosphere.\nAt the same time, there is a slight increase in volatile acidity, of around 0.1-0.2g/l. This is partly due to the lactic bacteria attacking traces of sugar and citric acid (most usually by the coques bacteria) at the same time as they are attacking the malic acid. Because of this, it is not advised to add citruc acid during vinification.\nThe higher the levels of malic acid at the start, the greater the gustatory impact of this secondary fermentation. The improvement to the taste and mouthfeel comes because there is an overall lowering of total acisity, and because the malic acid, which has a markedly aggressive taste, is replaced by lactic acid, which is far less aggressive to your tastebuds. Remember after the transformation 1g of malic acid gives around 0,67g of lactic acid.\nThe colour of the wine will often become a little softer and rounder also after the secondary fermentation. The aromas will also have been modified, getting further away from the colours of the grape and closer to more nuanced colour of 'wine'. The texture will become more fleshy and rounder in red wines.\nIt is less easy to generalise with white wines. Not all regions find this secondary fermentation desirable or necessary.\nIn dry whites, even when it's possible, it does not always lead to an improvement in quality. White wines are primarily judged on their aroma and on the delicate balance between alcohol and acidity. The freshness given by acidity is essential in some dry whites.many white wines are able to take up to 4.2-4.5g total acidity by keeping their malic acid.\nIn other regions, or depending on vintage, it can be useful. Regularly carried out in Champagne, Burgundy, Switzerland, Maconnais. In Germany and Austria, they prefer usually to use a chemical disacidification. In regions where acidity is naturally low, malo would leave the wines flabby. It's a question of grape varieties, and personal taste. Some varieties lose their aromatic typicity if undergo a fermentation by lactic bacteria, and lactic notes can dominate the fruit. In this case, better to sulphite the must to stop any secondary fermentation taking place (or do it on only a small part). Varieties that are very rich in natural aroma, such as chardonnay, find that malo just adds another layer of aromatic complexity (as with red wines).\nSo red wines basically all need malo, whites and ros√©s only under caution. Generally, if you are looking for freshness and primary aromas only, better to avoid it. But if looking for vinosity and volume, possibly a good idea.\nFor sweet wines, they are often sulfited early on in the process, before malo can take place. They do sometimes happen, but they are not wanted becausethey can lead to a rise in volatile acidity, which is already a risk in sweet wines.\nThe Bacteria of Malolactic Fermentation\nThe fermentation of malic acid is prompted by the development of lactic bacteria (cells that are able to turn sugar into lactic acid in the same way that yeast is able to turn sugar into alcohol). These bacteria can take various shapes, mainly falling into coques/cocci (round or oval), bacilles/batonnets (long & thin)\nStreptocoques (streptococci, think Guys and Dolls Adelaide singing about developing a cold - knew that song would come in useful throughout my life!)\nOften early in fermentation, it is tough to distinguish between the 'good lactic bacteria' that help with malolactic fermentation, and those lactic bacteria that will lead potentially to wine spoilage. And certain conditions (such as residual sugar or high pH/low acidity) can also make these lactic bacteria more likely to be harmful. Generally, the higher the pH, the more starins of lactic bacteria are likely to be present -sometimes up to 8 or 9 strains at moment of harvest. But not all will be capable of developing in the specific pH of grape must, or in presence of alcohol, or in competition with the yeasts etc. Yeasts find the sugar etc present in must easier to cope with, which is why they establish themselves more quickly than lactic bacteria. It's when they start to diminish that lactic acid bacteria take hold.\nSome are homo-fermentary (so do one thing - turn sugar into lactic acid) and hetero-fermenatary (so alongside lactic acid also produce alcohol acetic acid, succinic acid, glycerol, mannitol, carbonic gas etc).\nIn cold regions, cocci are more prevalent than bacillus and it hot regions its the opposite.\nWine lactic bacteria are either:\n1) Leuconostoc (cocques heterofermentary)\n2) Pediococcus (coques homofermentary)\n3) Lactobacillus (bacilles can be both homo and heterofermentary) - and most usually these contain the harmful bacteria also\n4) Oenococcus (only classified in 1995)\nThis classification is important because the malo will work differently, and give different results, depending on which strain if wine bacteria is present.\nThe lactic bacteria are found on ripe grapes at harvest, mised up with yeast, acetic acid bacteria and molds. Fairly irregular year to year. Probably also lactic bacteria in the buckets, pails etc used for harvesting and storing wine. Have to be v careful as cross-contamination possible at various stages of winemaking. Can also live in 'used barrels'. Equally a new cellar can make malolactic fermentation difficult to start.\nA young wine at the end of fermentation almost invariably has lactic acid bacteria capable of breaking down malic acid if the wine is not sulfited (homofermentary). Just a few contain lactic bacteria that is capable of also breaking down tartaric acid, glycerol, raising volatile acidity etc (heterofermentary). The population is greater in young wine than in the grape must.\nUseful and Harmful Lactic Bacteria\nOnce malolactic fermentation has taken place, the principles of 'bacteria are harmful' once again take precedence. Bacterial difficulties don't have to go as far 'piqure lactique' or the 'tourne' where all tartaric acid is consumed - more usually there effect is to raise the levels of acetic acid/volatile acidity and sometimes fixed acidity. The effect of this is a wine that seems dry of thin, lacking in the qualities that they should have, even if they don't seem especially 'faulty'. The harmful lactic bacteria are primarily in the lactobacillus genus.\nSo, there can be two types of lactic bacteria in wine:\n1) Bacteria capable of decomposing malic acid primarily, and sugars secondarily, and sometimes citric acid, but not tartaric acid or glycerol. These are the normal agents of malolactic fermentation. They are not dangerous except in stuck fermentations, when they can cause alterations such as volatile acidity - if there is residual sugar and/or high pH, if in non-sulphured environment.\n2) Bacteria capable of composing pentose, tartaric acid, glycerol, which are more unstable and potentially more harmful. These are the harmful bacteria.\nThe 'ideal' lactic bacteria would only decompose malic acid and not touch the other components of wine - this bacteria doesn't exist, but there are 'degrees of danger' according to the genus of bacteria, and the conditions of vinification, from pH to residual sugar."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e9662ae1-f98a-4cb5-b458-2e8e7e3323c5>","<urn:uuid:39bed341-c661-4c32-b59b-7ff56621b42c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What antimicrobial applications do wine compounds have in food safety, and how are vintners adapting their growing practices to climate change?","answer":"Wine compounds have broad antimicrobial applications in food safety, protecting various foods including beef, chicken, frankfurters, lettuce, and oysters against contamination by pathogenic microorganisms and toxins. In response to climate challenges, vintners are adapting their growing practices through multiple approaches, including composting vine cuttings instead of burning them to reduce carbon emissions, implementing extensive shading systems, introducing new cover crops for flood and drought protection, and conducting experimental trials with different rootstocks and planting techniques to develop climate-resilient vines.","context":["Location: Produce Safety and Microbiology Research\nTitle: Antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content Author\nSubmitted to: Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry\nPublication Type: Peer Reviewed Journal\nPublication Acceptance Date: June 5, 2014\nPublication Date: June 19, 2014\nCitation: Friedman, M. 2014. Antimicrobial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. DOI: 10.1021/jf501266s. Interpretive Summary: Food safety scientists, regulatory agencies, microbiologists, virologists, epidemiologists, nutritionists, physicians, and the general public have been increasingly concerned about the growing number of foodborne illness caused by some pathogens. Antibiotic resistance of some pathogens associated with foodborne illness caused by the overconsumption of medicinal antibiotics seems to exacerbate these effects. There has been increasing interest in developing novel plant-derived safe antimicrobial and antitoxin compounds, including those present in grapes and grape products. The main objective of this review is to unify and interpret widely scattered information of reported studies on the inhibitory effects of bioactive grape pomace, grape seed, and grape skin extracts in relation to flavonoid content and sensory, antioxidative, and imunostimulating properties against pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and fungi in culture and in/on food. The cited findings and suggested research outlined may facilitate and guide further needed studies to optimize the use of wines and grape-derived products to improve microbial food safety and to protect animals and humans against infectious diseases. Because grape phenolic phytonutrients are considered to be generally accepted-as-safe (GRAS), the cited and proposed studies will provide numerous benefits. The most active compounds could be used to protect liquid and solid foods against contamination by pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms and microbial toxins. The grape pomace, seed, and skin extracts have the potential to provide inexpensive sources of novel antimicrobial formulations. These byproducts will also provide a source of income to grape growers and wine producers. Growers will be encouraged to produce grapes with high levels of bioactive compounds.\nTechnical Abstract: Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds (flavonoids) that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of wine making, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and in wines. To develop a better understanding of the roles of these flavonoids in food microbiology, this review surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacteri jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monoocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersenia enterocolytica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio fulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiellae pneumoniae) bacteria, viruses (adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitits virus, norovirus, rotavirus), fungi (Candida albicans, Botyris cinerea), parasites (Eimelia tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects. The collated information and suggested research needs might contribute to a better understanding of the agricultural, chemical, microbiological, and cellular bases of the health-promoting properties and facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety.","We‚Äôve all been concerned to see animals silhouetted against smoke and flames, fleeing wildfire in my native Australia. The devastating scenes have drawn attention to the impact of climate change on a global scale. We‚Äôve seen communities near Napa Valley devastated by wildfire as well, but fire is not the only threat to the valley‚Äôs elite wineries and heritage. U.C. Davis‚Äô viticulturist S. Kaan Kurtural, who is working to develop climate-resilient vines with Beckstoffer Vineyards, said that the ways that climate has affected wine growing in recent years have ‚Äúshocked‚Äù him.\n‚ÄúAnyone who farms anything has known that the climate has been shifting for a while, but now there‚Äôs an economic necessity to take action,‚Äù Mr. Kurtural told a USA Today reporter. Consideration of the purchase of a winery and significant agricultural property in Napa Valley should now include an awareness of the effects of climate change, from potential lengthy service interruptions from Pacific Gas and Electric requiring back-up power solutions to the way that climate change is affecting production of some of Napa Valley‚Äôs iconic wines, especially Cabernet Sauvignon.\nHow are Napa Valley Winemakers Responding to Climate Change?\nMolly Moran Williams, the community relations director for our Napa Valley Grapegrowers‚Äô association, said that winemakers had been interested in agricultural permanence for many years. The association uses the term ‚Äúclimate resilience‚Äù to describe the efforts members are taking to adapt to the changing climate and its diverse impacts.\nNapa Valley Winemakers are independent thinkers, and we do see a number of approaches to climate impacts on our vineyards throughout the region. Molly Williams said that ‚Äúgrape growing is always a practice in foresight.‚Äù Napa Valley Grapegrowers currently urges its members to compost vine cuttings; the previous practice had been to burn them ‚Äî adding carbon to the atmosphere. Composting not only creates less air pollution, but it can also even sequester carbon. This common-sense step benefits wineries and the environment, but alone, it can‚Äôt make enough of an impact on changing climate patterns and environmental threats.\nClimate change is the correct term for the environmental challenges we face in Napa Valley. ‚ÄúThe big deal is the erratic nature that we have with climate,‚Äù Andy Beckstoffer of Beckstoffer Vineyards told CBS News. Andy is making a significant investment in a partnership with U.C. Davis and working with Kaan Kurtural on a Cabernet Sauvignon rootstock and clone experimental planting trial. Beckstoffer sees this as an opportunity to preserve the quality of Cabernet Sauvignon, one of our two most renowned Napa Valley wine varieties. The idea is to develop ways to protect Cabernet Sauvignon vines and use different planting techniques, including vertical plantings. One hundred combinations of planting, shading, and other technology are being tested ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not a short-term project. It will take at least six years to determine which methods and rootstocks are preferable. Without initiatives like this and continued climate change, within 20 to 30 years, it‚Äôs possible that Cabernet grapes could no longer be viable in Napa Valley.\nBeyond the initiatives of the 700-member Napa Valley Grapegrowers‚Äô association and owner-sponsored trials like Andy Beckstoffer‚Äôs, the 500-member Napa Valley Vintners association have formalized environmental sustainability in an initiative they have developed for nearly two decades, Napa Green.\nWhat is the Role of Napa Green For the Napa Valley Winemaker?\nNapa Valley Vintners launched Napa Green in the early 2000s and the initiative has grown since that time. If you‚Äôre considering buying a wine property in Napa Valley, you may want to investigate the approaches that the Napa Green program has taken regarding climate change, which focuses on conservation and stewardship. Napa Green offers third-party certification in environmental sustainability for land management practices and also in winemaking. You may hear Napa Green‚Äôs education and certification program described as ‚Äúsoil to bottle‚Äù sustainability.\nThe Napa Green initiative has set a goal of having 100% of the Napa Valley Vintner‚Äôs association members becoming Napa Green Land or Winery Certified by the end of 2020. As of December 2019, 70% of the association‚Äôs members were certified in one or both certifications. At present, about 26,000 acres of Napa Valley vineyard land is Napa Green Land certified, and 50 of our Napa Valley wineries are comprehensively Napa Green certified from ‚Äúsoil to bottle.‚Äù\nIf you‚Äôre interested in learning more about Napa Green‚Äôs environmentally sustainable methods and how wineries use them, five of our wineries have been awarded the California Sustainable Winegrowing Green Medal award:\n- Spottswoode Winery\n- St. Supery Estate Vineyards & Winery\n- Cakebread Cellars\n- Silver Oak Cellars\n- Domaine Carneros\nWhat Climate Change Impacts Are Of Greatest Concern For Napa Valley Properties?\nNapa Valley‚Äôs average annual temperatures have increased 1.3 degrees Celsius since the late 1800s, about .3 degrees C more than the U.S. average. The region‚Äôs best-known and loved varietals, especially Cabernet Sauvignon, are sensitive to temperature change. When the heat rises in the Valley, the internal temperature of grapes can rise above 150 degrees, devastating the slow maturation and ripening of the grape which produces Napa Valley‚Äôs world-renowned fine wines.\n‚ÄúI have to plan ahead in a way I never thought I‚Äôd have to,‚Äù said Beth Novak Milliken of Spottswoode Estates and Winery. Milliken is a leader in Napa Valley‚Äôs sustainable winemaking movement and her Spottswoode Estate Cabernet Sauvignon is offered for $90 to $225 a bottle. High temperatures in 2017 put Spottswoode Estates and Winery vineyards into stasis according to Milliken‚Äôs winemaker and vineyard manager Aron Weinkauf. The event was unheard-of, leading to a variety of new procedures in the vineyards to prevent another ‚Äústasis‚Äù year. Spottswoode‚Äôs vineyards are now extensively shaded and include new cover crops that can protect vines in case of flooding or another dry period. Spottswoode (and other wineries) are planting experimental rootstocks that can thrive in higher temperatures.\nFew people in Napa Valley are debating whether climate change is real or when it will happen. Politics isn‚Äôt on the table, but uncovering and developing realistic solutions are. Beth Milliken echoed the sentiment of most long-time winemakers in Napa Valley when she said, ‚Äúclimate change is here.‚Äù\nLooking to be a Winemaker in Napa Valley?\nFortunately, if you are interested in an elite vineyard or winery in Napa Valley, you will join a community of vintners and owners who have been developing solutions for our wine growing and climate challenges for decades, and who are committed to continuing the wine legacy of Napa Valley for many decades to come."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:181586e2-e8eb-4517-a677-78b918aab6bf>","<urn:uuid:d40373e1-90ff-4efb-a529-03c39ec37b82>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can power plants implement a comprehensive safety program to reduce accidents and improve operational excellence? What specific tools and procedures should be incorporated?","answer":"A comprehensive safety program for power plants should include several key components: 1) Validation and verification processes to identify gaps in training and safety procedures, 2) Motor vehicle safety training with defensive-driving techniques, 3) Daily safety meetings to discuss work tasks and potential hazards, 4) Job Safety Analysis procedures for hazard identification and mitigation, 5) Incident reporting systems for accidents, injuries, or near-misses, and 6) Progress measurement and tracking. These components should be supported by extensive classroom and hands-on training, background checks for drivers, continuing education, and application of field experience knowledge.","context":["Safety should be the top priority on any job site and goes hand in hand with operational excellence. Risk mitigation and safety are exceptionally important for power plants due to the nature of the industry.\nContractors are responsible for providing a safe work environment at all power generation facilities, safe transportation for all personnel to and from the job site, and must be equipped to use every resource available to prevent accidents.\nManagement, field employees, and associates can be trained to demonstrate leadership and promote safety as a core value. This can be executed through extensive classroom and hands-on training before acquiring certification to work on field service teams, background checks on all potential drivers, internal programming and audits, continuing education, and applying knowledge gained through field experiences.\nThe following is a list of safety tools, internal programs, and environmental audits that can be implemented to reduce error and confirm safety compliance at any type of plant. Specific components can be measured with field supervisors responsible for auditing and recognizing areas of opportunity for improvement.\nValidation and Verification. The validation and verification process can identify gaps in training, process knowledge, and safety policies and procedures throughout the workforce. Software-based calendar programs make tracking dates and renewals more efficient.\nMotor Vehicle Safety. Training programs for various types of equipment provide equipment operators with the most up-to-date defensive-driving techniques and safe operation education (for example, the Smith System driving program).\nDaily Safety Meetings. Daily safety meetings can be implemented to discuss the day‚Äôs work tasks, safety expectations, review past incidents, and discuss ways to mitigate any potential hazards.\nJob Safety Analysis/Worksite Examination Procedure. This type of job safety procedure provides an opportunity for each employee to plan, discuss, and identify hazards associated with each work task. Hazard mitigation is then used to remove the potential hazard. Employees can be trained to recognize and mitigate hazards before harm is done (Figure 1).\nIncident, Accident, Injury, or Near-Miss Reporting. Employees should be trained to respond and immediately report an incident, accident, injury, or near-miss to their supervisor and safety manager.\nMeasuring Success. Measuring and tracking progress is a critical element of any safety program. Without measures, processes will not be sustained and or improved.\nInternational Safety Events. The Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance recently completed a three-day event targeted at improving safety of commercial motor vehicles around the world. During the 72-hour event, 17 trucks or buses were slated for inspection on average every minute across North America with a 37-step procedure that included an examination of the driver and vehicle.\nWhole Team Improvement.Success and growth should be based on teamwork and communication. Better communication creates better teams, and safe and healthy employees are more effective and efficient. As a result, the workforce should have more opportunity for growth and improvement.\nThese types of safety events, industry advocacy, and the sharing of best practices among companies will continue to help improve transportation safety, eliminate accidents on the job site, and enhance performance and accountability at power plants. Injury and illness prevention have a direct impact on employee morale, productivity, company earnings, and customer satisfaction and retention.\nWorking safely is the primary component of a successful job and requires ongoing improvements to policies, philosophy, and practices. ‚ñ†\n‚ÄîTom Verbridge is safety and compliance manager for AIMS Companies."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e08f9288-1eb5-438f-b88d-ba5fbd68f44e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did weather and environmental conditions affect both the German-Russian settlers in North Dakota and the early Kansas Territory pioneers?","answer":"Both settler groups had to adapt to challenging environmental conditions in their new territories. The German-Russians who first arrived in Russia were initially dismayed by the treeless steppes, but over successive generations they gradually adapted to the harsh environment. Similarly, Kansas Territory settlers faced significant environmental challenges, with many leaving after the bitter winter of 1856. Bad weather and crop failures created hardships that offset the sense of economic prosperity, requiring aid from Northern organizations to provide food and clothing to needy settlers. Both groups ultimately learned to adapt to their respective prairie environments, though the challenges initially caused significant hardship and displacement.","context":["Immigration and Early SettlementMany of the people who settled in Kansas Territory came for land and business opportunities. These settlers were not involved in the debate about whether or not Kansas should enter the Union as a free or slave state. All settlers in Kansas Territory endured the hardships found on any frontier. They raised crops to feed themselves and their livestock. They built houses and stores and established schools and churches. The weather was often a factor, and a large number of settlers left the territory after the bitter winter of 1856.\nEven though the Kansas Nebraska Act \"opened\" Kansas Territory for settlement in 1854, a number of people already lived in the area. This included several tribes of Native Americans. Plains Indian tribes, the Kansas, Pawnees, and Osages, lived in and moved across Kansas, depending on the season. After 1830, about twenty tribes who lived east of the Mississippi River were resettled west of Missouri under the federal government's Indian removal policy. In 1853 the government began negotiations to move these tribes again. By the end of 1854, the various tribes had ceded much of the land in what had become the Kansas and Nebraska territories to the federal government through various treaties.\nEven before Kansas Territory was opened to non-Indians in the spring of 1854, groups with varied political interests had formed to encourage settlement. The New England Emigrant Aid Society (later Company) and other groups formed to promote and support free state settlement, while Missourians with an immediate stake in the outcome poured across their border with Kansas. The first organized band of New Englanders arrived in the territory in July 1854 and founded the city of Lawrence, making it the focal point of abolitionist activity. Before the end of the year Cyrus K. Holliday and others established the city of Topeka as another free state community.\nOn the other side, activity was also swift. David Rice Atchison, Missouri's senior senator from Platte City, and brothers John H. and Benjamin F. Stringfellow, \"urged their people to resist the abolitionist plot to surround their state with free territory.\" These men helped establish the proslavery town of Atchison. Proslavery Missourians founded Leavenworth about the same time.\nIt is safe to say, despite the attention paid to the political tumult and violence known as Bleeding Kansas, most of the people who came to Kansas Territory sought land and opportunity. They were not primarily concerned with the free/slave question, but with making a living or surviving on the rough frontier, which by 1859-1860 was made even rougher by a severe drought. Initially, many came from Missouri, but soon people from the states of the Ohio valley, Mid-Atlantic, and upper South, in addition to those from New England, arrived in Kansas Territory in substantial numbers. In many ways these immigrants were quite similar, and, regardless of their particular political persuasion, it is probably safe to say that a big majority wanted Kansas to be free from the institution of slavery and the \"Negro.\" These settlers sought free-soil for whites only. For their part, Missourians may have been as concerned about preventing the establishment of a safe haven for run-away slaves on their western border as they were about having Kansas become a slave state.\nIn its early years, Kansas Territory had several relatively distinct \"cultural regions\" and the settlers in those regions, whether Yankees or Southerners, had different value systems. However, the extent of these differences was often exaggerated in the newspaper stories of the Bleeding Kansas era. According to Lawrence's Kansas Free State, the eastern immigrant came \"to Kansas for the purpose of instructing the Western people how to build up a model New England State. . . . They work themselves into a belief that Western men, and especially Missourians, are of an inferior order of people, unfit for social intercourse.\" Stereotypes on both sides certainly influenced the Eastern press, and were frequently employed by local partisan editors to fan the flames of border conflict.\nIn reality of course, most of Kansas' territorial settlers were not \"Yankees.\" The Northern states--New England, northern tier states west of New England, and Iowa--contributed 16 percent of the territory's 1860 population of 107,209, while the \"lower South\" contributed only 13.5 percent. It was the border states that populated the territory of Kansas: northern border states, 35.3 percent; southern border states (including Missouri), 24.1; the total border state contribution was 59.4 percent. Nevertheless, despite the \"relative statistical unimportance of the New England contribution,\" a mere 3.9 percent, these folks wielded a disproportionate amount of influence, which tended to magnify the differences between early settlers on the slavery issue.\nThe Kansas population (1860), in terms of the place of birth of residents, received its greatest contributions from Ohio (11,617), Missouri (11,356), Indiana (9,945), and Illinois (9,367), followed by Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and New York (all three over 6,000). The territory's foreign-born population stood at roughly 12 percent, most of whom hailed from the British Isles or Germany. Racially, of course, the population was overwhelmingly white. The 1860 census takers found only two slaves in Kansas Territory and 625 \"Free Colored\" residents. One hundred and eighty-nine Indians were listed in the census, 141 of whom resided in Wyandotte County. And, of course, the population was overwhelmingly rural. The territory had only two communities that the U.S. Census Bureau classified as cities: Leavenworth with 5,000 inhabitants, which had the only telegraphic service in Kansas at the time of admission, and Atchison with 2,500 residents. Lawrence had a substantial population (2,000) and seven other towns had over 500 inhabitants.\nThe number of slaves in the Kansas territory was never large, but the number of \"free\" blacks in Kansas grew steadily. During the territorial period, many passed through on the \"Underground Railroad\" and during the war hundreds of contrabands fled Missouri for freedom in the Union state of Kansas. The number of slaves assisted by this secret, rather ill defined network is impossible to determine. Because of this, its impact has been both exaggerated and inappropriately minimized. Regardless of the railroad's overall impact, however, a number of Kansans were involved; according to one \"conductor,\" commenting on April 4, 1859, \"nearly three hundred fugitives\" had \"passed through and received assistance from the abolitionists here at Lawrence\" during the previous four years. It should not be surprising that Missouri would feel threatened. After 1861 enslaved blacks continued to make their way across the border in even larger numbers. Whatever the numbers involved, black flight to free Kansas was an important factor in the relations between Missouri and Kansas, before and during the Civil War.\nMany of the people settling in territorial Kansas came primarily for real and perceived economic opportunity. They acquired land for farms or for businesses and homes in the new towns being established. Most of the farm land acquired by the first settlers in Kansas Territory was claimed under the provisions of the Pre-emption Act of 1841. An individual could claim up to 160 acres of land and pay $1.25 per acre once the public land survey was completed. After that, public land was sold through auctions until the passage of the Homestead Act in 1862.\nSettlers with extra cash and absentee investors often participated in town site speculation. Companies organized to create and promote new towns and they sold shares and town lots to investors and actual settlers. These people hoped that the land, lots, or town company stock would increase in value so they could be sold for a profit. This dealing in town company stock or extra land was often highly speculative and helped create rivalries among new towns. Towns tried to attract new businesses and settlers with promotional information and some towns competed to be on the routes of railroads, which were just starting to be built. Some town companies organized what were known as \"paper\" towns because they never developed beyond a structure or two. All of this activity, whether based on real or potential prospects, created an atmosphere of economic prosperity during part of the territorial period.\nHowever, bad weather, bad crops, and destruction of crops and property by the opposing forces often offset this sense of prosperity. Several Kansas organizations and a number of groups in Northern states, such as the National Kansas Committee, sponsored efforts to raise funds and collect clothing and supplies for free state settlers. Food and clothing were then distributed to needy settlers.\nBy the time Kansas entered the Union in January 1861, most settlers were focusing on making a living and raising families in their new home.","The German-Russians in North Dakota a Brief History\nRead, Tamar C. \"The German-Russians in North Dakota a Brief History.\" Festival of Ethnic Musical Traditions in North Dakota,\n1983, 40-46, 49-50.\nAccording to the 1980 census, Americans of German descent comprise\nthe largest ethnic group in North Dakota. Few outside observers, however,\nare aware of the enormous diversity that exists among those in North\nDakota who are identified as ‚ÄúGerman.‚Äù No doubt the largest\nand most visible segment of this population is that of the German-Russians\n(also known as Germans from Russia or Russian-Germans). At present,\nNorth Dakota has more citizens of German-Russian extraction than any\nother state, in the entire nation.\nOne finds an astonishing degree of linguistic and religious variation\namong even the German-Russians themselves. Nonetheless, the majority\nof North Dakota's German-Russians trace their ancestry to agriculturally-based\ncolonies in the Black Sea region of South Russia. These villages\nwere established in the early nineteenth century during the reign\nof Tsar Alexander I (particularly in the years 1804-1810). The composition\nof the Black Sea colonies reflected the different German provinces\nfrom which the original settlers emigrated: Wuerttemberg, Baden,\nAlsace, the Palatinate, and various other principalities. Each German-Russian\nvillage, however, was homogeneously Protestant, Roman Catholic,\nor Mennonite. Most of the Black Sea German villages were located\nnear the port city of Odessa, in settlement areas known by such\ncolorful names as Liebental, Glueckstal, Kutschurgan, and Beresan.\nOther major areas of German colonization in South Russia included\nthe Crimea and Bessarabia.\nAlthough the first German emigrants who settled in Russia were\ndismayed by the sight of the treeless steppes that greeted them,\nsuccessive generations gradually adapted to the harsh realities\nof their environment. For nearly a century, the Black Sea German\ncolonists enjoyed a relatively isolated life and were cut off from\nboth their German homeland and their Slavic neighbors. Such self-imposed\ncultural isolation was disrupted in the early 1870s, when Russification\nmeasures were enacted by assimilation-minded government officials.\nThe Black Sea German men folk, who had enjoyed freedom from compulsory\nmilitary service since 1804, now faced the prospect of donning uniforms\nand marching in the tsar‚Äôs regiments like other Russian subjects.\nThis new development, among others, prompted thousands of German-\nRussian families to consider immigrating to the New World.\nThe first German-Russians made their way to what is now North Dakota\nin 1884, settling on rocky prairie lands in the south-central part\nof the state. As in Russia, the emigrants in North Dakota tended\nto settle in tightly-knit groups based on common religious affiliation.\nThus, one still finds German- Russian settlement areas in North\nDakota that are solidly Roman Catholic or Protestant. In present-day\nsouth-central North Dakota, for example, German-Russian Protestants\ndominate much of McIntosh County and the eastern half of Logan County\nwhile German-Russian Catholics are concentrated in the southern\nhalf of Emmons County and in the western portion of Logan County.\nOther important centers of German-Russian settlement include the\nnorth-central portion of North Dakota (especially Pierce, Henry,\nMcLean, Sheridan, Stutsman, Kidder, and Wells counties) and several\nsections of the state west of the Missouri River (particularly Morton,\nGrant, Hettinger, Stark, Dunn, and Mercer counties).\n|A German-Russian congregation poses\nat the entrance of St. Peter‚Äôs Lutheran Church, 1914.\nThe church once stood north of present-day Hazen, N.D. (Photo\ncourtesy of Victor Knell and Timothy Kloberdanz.)\nAlthough present-day German-Russian Americans\nare in many ways vastly different from their emigrant forebears\nwho arrived on the North Dakota prairies in thick sheepskin coats,\nhigh Russian boots, and flowered head shawls, evidence of a strong\nGerman-Russian culture identity persists. In many areas of the state,\nthe German-Russian dialects still can be heard, particularly among\nfamily members born before 1950. A variety of German- Russian food\nways have been maintained and in some areas of the state have resisted\nbeing replaced by American ones. Distinctive German-Russian ethnic\ndishes include Gollodetz, Halupsy, Fleischkuechla, Strudla,\nPlachenda, Schlitzkuechla, Riwel Supp, Borsch, and Kuchen.\nA vitally important aspect of the German-Russian cultural heritage\nin North Dakota is a strong musical tradition. Many German-Russians\npoint with obvious pride to the success of the famous band leader\nLawrence Welk, who began his musical career by playing an old family\naccordion brought from Russia. Welk grew up on a prairie farmstead\nnear the German-Russian Catholic community of Strasburg, North Dakota.\nFor many German-Russians, certain community and family-related\nevents (such as wedding dances) retain a rich Old Country flavor.\nFavorite folk songs of the German-Russians include \"Schoen\nis die Jugend‚Äù (Youth is Beautiful); ‚ÄúZu Strasburg,\nein wunderschoene Stad‚Äù (To Strasburg, a Wonderful Fair\nCity); ‚ÄúWie die Bluemlein draussen zit tern‚Äù\n(How the Flowers Tremble in the Distance); ‚ÄúWenn die Soldaten\ndutch die Stadt marschiere‚Äù (When the Soldiers March\nThrough the City); and the always popular \"Du, du liegst\nmir im Herzen‚Äù (You, You Dwell in My Heart); Many of\nthese folk songs are similar to those performed by other German-speaking\nethnic groups. Yet certain tunes-such as the beautiful ‚ÄúWir\nsitzen so froehlich beisammen‚Äù (We're Sitting Together\nSo Happily) have special meaning for the German- Russians, since\nthe songs recall their ancestors' emigration to Russia following\nthe devastation caused by the Napoleonic invasions in Europe. This\nparticular song also is significant because it reflects a theme\nrecurrent in other German-Russian folk tunes, as evidenced by the\nhaunting line: ‚ÄúIm Krieg wird keiner verschont‚Äù\n(In War, No One is Spared).\nThe singing of folk songs by the German-Russians, however, does\nnot represent a mere desire to cultivate what the German-Russians\nperceive to be a dying aspect of their heritage. Many German-Russians\nprefer to sing in the language of their forefathers because such\nsinging is an expressive and deeply satisfying part of their lives,\na comfort in times of both happiness and sorrow.

All band members had parents or grandparents who came\nto this country from Russia.\nJames Schwab, the group's organizer, and his older brother, Larry\nSchwab, both learned music from their dad, an accordion player who\nlearned from other musicians, including Lawrence Welk‚Äôs dad\nwho had brought over music from the old country. They always had\nmusic in their house. Their dad was born in Strasburg, N.D., in\n1902 and their grandfather came to the Strasburg area from Russia\nJames talked his father into buying him a $100 trumpet during his\nsecond year of high school. In addition to playing with the high\nschool band, he played with a six-piece dance band known as the\nSilver Six. After high school, he began playing for public wedding\ndances with his father.\nLarry was 12 years old when he began playing piano with his father\nfor wedding dances and barn dances. Both Larry and James played\nfor a time with Mattie Lipp's band, but in 1954 they left Lipp and\nasked Bill Mastel to join them in a group known as the Bubbling\nBill Mastel's father was born in Russia and later came to the Linton,\nN.D., area where Bill was born in 1928.

Gene learned some of the wedding marches from her when she\nsang them to him. He is the youngest of four brothers, all of whom\nplayed together. As a young man he played the accordion for barn\ndances and during the 1940s and early 50s he had three- and four-piece\nbands of his own.\nIn 1970, Doug Weber joined the group and Bill Mastel returned to\ncomplete the present Bubbling Quintet. Doug's grandparents came\nfrom Russia in 1890 and his parents were born around Ashley and\nFreeman. Doug plays bass horn and trumpet and began playing in an\nold German dance band, Becker and Bollinger, at the age of 16. Later,\nhe played in the Venturia city German band, which played on the\nstreet corner every Saturday night.\nThe Bubbling Quintet has performed at Smithsonian's Festival of\nAmerican Folk life in 1975, and also at the International Polka\nfest in Kitzb√ºhel, Austria, in 1978.\nJames Schwab, trumpet, drums; Larry Schwab, piano; Bill Mastel,\ncordovox; Douglas Weber, trumpet, tuba; and Gene Weisbeck, accordion.\nVerna and George Mack, Pettibone.\nThe Merry Macks like to dance so much that they sometimes got home\nin time to milk the cows the next morning. George, 75, and Verna,\n68, have been dancing since they were youngsters. George learned\nto polka on blustery days in school to the music of a comb and thin\npiece of paper; he learned the waltz and two-step to the music of\nhis mother's accordion. Verna learned to dance by going to house\nparties and barn dances as a young girl.\nWhen George and Verna were married in June 1936, Larry and James\nSchwab's father played at their wedding dance.

The Hutterites live in colonies that share all\nproperty according to Acts 2:44. This principle, as well as pacifism\nand a simple way of dressing, has set the Hutterites apart from\nthe outer society.\nThe Hutterian Church was founded in 1528 by leaders of the Swiss\nBrethren. The early leaders began to establish colonies in the Tyrol\nregion of Austria, but the persecution became so intense that they\nhad to migrate to Moravia. There the Hutterites lived in relative\npeace from 1533-1633. By the turn of the century they had reached\na population of 15,000. In 1633 the Thirty Years War broke out,\ntaking a heavy toll on Europe and also causing the Hutterites further\npersecution. The Jesuits were determined to exterminate the Hutterite\nChurch because they were declared to be heretics by the Catholic\nChurch. This determination by the Jesuits started in the 1600s and\nby about 1750 there were fewer than 50 Hutterites who would not\nrecant from the beliefs of the Hutterian Church. These few were\nthen living in Romania. There they were also persecuted, so they,\nalong with some Austrian migrants, decided to move to Russia. The\nmove was made in 1770 with 70 souls. They lived in Russia for the\nnext century. In 1874, the government took away two main privileges\nthat the Hutterites cherished: exemption from military service and\npermission to teach German in their schools. Therefore, upon finding\nsuitable land in America, they decided to make the move to South\nDakota in the 1870s.\nSince 1874 the Hutterites have established over 300 colonies throughout\nnorthwestern United States and southwestern Canada with a current\npopulation of about 30,000.\nForest River Community\nForest River Community was founded in 1950 by the New Rosedale Colony\nnear Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. Like every other Hutterite colony,\nForest River has a farming operation of livestock and grain. They\nfarm 2,500 acres and have 48,000 chickens, 20,000 pullets, 50 dairy\ncows, and 12,000 geese.\n\"We profess to be a Christian Church that seeks to live by\nthe commandments of Christ Jesus as we are given to understand His\nWord.\" During its 30-year history, Forest River has associated\nwith many people and communities of like persuasion, such as, Koinonia\nFarms, Americus, Georgia; Reba Place, Evanston, Illinois; Society\nof Brothers, Rifton, New York; Habitat for Humanity, Americus, Georgia;\nand many others.\nMany of these 'contacts‚Äô have been to help people in need,\nalso to help people establish Christian communities, not only by\naiding them financially but also by sharing know how and experiences\nrelating to farming and community living.

{"question":"What advantages do VCAs and Remote Source Redundancy (RSR) offer over traditional audio mixing methods in their respective contexts?","answer":"VCAs offer advantages over traditional faders by lasting longer, being less prone to scratching from wear and dust, and providing more accurate and precise control since the audio signal doesn't pass through the fader itself. Additionally, VCAs allow for remote control of multiple channels while maintaining clean gain structure. RSR, in comparison, offers advantages over traditional recording methods by enabling isolation of remote participants' audio, allowing transcriptionists to resolve crosstalk issues by accessing separate audio clips, and providing searchable speech-to-text functionality that helps locate specific points in recordings. Both technologies represent improvements over conventional methods by offering more precise control and cleaner audio management in their respective applications.","context":["What is Remote Source Redundancy (RSR)?\nAny transcriptionist who has worked from a digital recording will tell you that transcribing through crosstalk scenarios can be difficult, if not impossible, to discern what is being said. What exactly is a crosstalk scenario in the context of a digital recording? The most common instances are when two or more people are speaking at the same time. However, this can also include someone coughing at the exact moment a word is spoken, construction noises from next door, a phone alert, even a squeaky chair.\nThese extraneous noises that occur at the wrong moments, often during important testimony, represent one of the fundamental barriers with adoption of digital reporting or recording. The principles of Auditory Scene Analysis detail how two competing speech sound waves, when overlapped, become incomprehensible for the human mind to understand.\nThis barrier is especially salient for adoption of remote depositions. When configuring a deposition recording with everyone in the same room, standard practice is to setup dedicated microphones connected to a multi-channel mixer. Remotely connected deposition configurations have not had a solution for isolating channels in a similar fashion to multi-channel mixer technology. That is until today.\nRemote source redundancy (RSR) is a tool that isolates the audio of remote participants enabling the production of a higher quality transcript. How does it work?\n- Remote streams first produce a composite video with all the feeds in one video file.\n- While the composite video is being generated, isolated audio clips are captured and recorded separately from the remote feeds, creating a redundant recording for remote streams.\n- Isolated audio clips are transcribed using speech-to-text.\n- Text lines and isolated audio clips are synced to the composite video recording.\n- Transcriptionist can quickly search and play isolated audio clips during crosstalk scenarios.\nHere‚Äôs a clip of it in action:\nHow do transcriptionists use remote source redundancy (RSR)?\nMany court transcriptionists who work with digital playback software will use synced notes generated by a digital reporter to find a specific location of the video to begin transcribing. A problem that occurs after taking a break is that unless the exact second was written down, finding the desired point in the video can be time consuming. With RSR, a Speech-to-text rough is generated that orients transcriptionists to the point in the proceeding, saving time by making it easy to pick up where the work was left off.\nWith the ability to ‚Äúsearch the video‚Äù for an exact point of a long recording, this saves time with getting started on the day‚Äôs project. For example, let‚Äôs say the previous day‚Äôs work was ended during the introduction of Exhibit 6. Simply type ‚ÄúExhibit 6‚Äù and the playback will begin at that point in the recording.\nNow that the transcriptionist has been oriented with the video, the new day‚Äôs work can begin. For most of the duration of the testimony, using the composite video playback to complete the transcript is sufficient. However, a scenario occurs that throws a monkey wrench into the quality standards that are expected. The deposer throws out a question, and the witness‚Äôs response was given at the exact same moment as an opposing counsel‚Äôs objection. Not to worry. The transcriptionist need only find the ScriptSync lines using the search function, then play back the isolated audio clips to discern what each person said. The witness said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and their counsel interjected with ‚Äúobjection to form.‚Äù The transcript reads clean verbatim without an inaudible.\nCurrently, this technology is optimized for fully remote depositions with the use of headphones, as computers will kick in echo cancellation if two people are speaking at the same time for too long. However, for short crosstalk interactions, RSR will work without the use of headphones. In 95% of real-world scenarios, two people are not actively trying to speak over each other at the same time, that is, unless the proceedings get particularly heated.\nIn a few years‚Äô time this technology may even be possible for same room depositions. Advanced array microphones today, such as the Amazon Echo, can ‚Äúfocus‚Äù on active speakers in the same room. It may be possible to train these microphones to produce multichannel isolation in a similar mechanism to RSR for remote participants. The giant tech companies are investing big money into a problem called ‚Äúspeaker diarization‚Äù that will identify different speakers located in the same room based on the wave pattern of their voice. Advancements such as this will change the game for digital recording solutions and simplify same room digital capture configurations.\nGiven the unique advancement of remote source redundancy on the deposition experience, the same sophistication applied to multi-channel sound mixers can be applied to remote depositions. With true isolation of crosstalk scenarios no longer a concern for legal transcriptionists, the highest quality of verbatim record can be achieved for remotely conducted depositions. Tools like RSR demonstrate how capture software that is built with transcriptionists in mind help overcome barriers, and move the industry forward with practical solutions.","In the previous post, we got started talking about groups. Most church sound boards have groups. Some have VCAs. As a church sound volunteer, it‚Äôs important to know what they do and how to use them. To recap, Groups are additional mix busses on your board that allow you to collect inputs and make them controllable by a single fader. That‚Äôs the vast over-simplified version anyway. A more elegant way to accomplish that task is with a VCA.\nSo now, picking up where we left off‚Ä¶\nThe VCA Masters from a Yamaha PM5000 (click to enlarge)\nVCA stands for Voltage Controlled Amplifier. The clears it all up, no? Well, how about this: According to Wikipedia, ‚ÄúA voltage-controlled amplifier is an electronic amplifier that varies its gain depending on a control voltage.‚Äù In other words, rather than controlling the level of a signal through a resistance network, the way a typical fader control does, a VCA uses changes in control voltage (which is adjusted by fader movement up and down) to control an amplifier that alters the level of the signal. In a non-VCA fader, the audio signal actually runs through the resistance network of the fader and the level is altered based on how much resistance to signal flow there is. Lowering the fader raises the resistance, lowering the level of the signal.\nIn a VCA desk, when you raise and lower the fader, you‚Äôre actually raising and lowering the control voltage that tells the amplifier to raise or lower the level of the signal. It‚Äôs kind of like the difference between a switch and a relay. A switch has the signal (say 110 volts of AC to power your light) flowing right through it. When you turn off the switch, you directly break the connection. A relay however is controlled by another switch. Flip the switch, and the control voltage tells the relay to close and let signal through. Hopefully, this is making sense.\nVCAs have several advantages over regular faders. First, they last longer and are less prone to get ‚Äúscratchy‚Äù because of wear and dust. Second, because the fader is not processing the signal, VCAs can be more accurate and precise. Finally, because a VCA is sort of like a remote control, they can be remote-remote controlled. Enter what is known as the VCA (really, they‚Äôre VCA Groups).\nFor the purposes of illustration, let‚Äôs assume that we‚Äôre using a 1K tone as our signal source, and that we have adjusted the head amp (or trim, or preamp, or gain, or whatever your board calls it) so that the channel, when in PFL (or solo) mode reads 0 dBu.\nLet‚Äôs say you turn up channel 1 to 0 dBu, or unity. That tells the amplifier in channel 1 to let the signal flow with no gain or cut applied to the signal. When you lower the fader to -10, that tells the amplifier to apply 10 dB of cut to the signal.\nNow, let‚Äôs say we assign channel 1 to VCA Group 1 (more commonly known as VCA 1). And let‚Äôs turn channel 1 back to 0. If we were to now lower VCA 1 to -10, that would tell the amplifier in channel 1 to apply 10 dB of cut to channel 1 [above left]. And if we now dial the fader of channel 1 back to -10, that tells the amplifier in channel 1 to apply another 10 dB of cut to the signal [above right]. ‚ÄúMadness!‚Äù You might say, ‚ÄúLowering the signal twice!‚Äù That‚Äôs true, but it‚Äôs also highly useful.\nConsider this; we can accomplish the same thing, level-wise, with a group. However, we‚Äôre sending the signal through 2 amplification stages. And once the signal leaves the group, it goes through a third amplification stage at the main faders. With a VCA, there is a single amp stage on each channel. The channel faders and the VCA faders simply tell that amp what to do. At no point does the signal pass through the VCA group, because there is no ‚Äúgroup.‚Äù I said it gets interesting, so here‚Äôs how it could play out.\nAt Upper Room, we have our VCAs (well, technically they‚Äôre DCAs, but they act essentially the same) set up like this: 1‚ÄìKick & Bass; 2‚ÄìThe rest of the drum kit; 3‚ÄìGuitars; 4‚ÄìKeys; 5‚ÄìAll Band; 6‚ÄìVocals; 7‚ÄìFX; 8 Speech mics. VCAs 1-4 act like groups for us, in that we can quickly adjust the entire drum kit up and down, add or subtract keys, whatever. However, we also have the whole band on another VCA. So that means that every channel that is assigned to VCA‚Äôs 1-4 is also assigned to VCA 5. That allows us to take the level of the entire band up and down on one fader, without altering the relative levels between each of those channels. If during the set the band gets crankin‚Äô and starts to overpower the vocals, we turn down the band VCA. That‚Äôs it, the whole band comes down.\nWhere this is very elegant is that the signal is processed strictly in the channel amp; it‚Äôs not going through multiple amp stages of gain/cut to get there. So let‚Äôs play this out.\nTake the kick, channel 1 in our setup. Let‚Äôs say on the fader, it‚Äôs set to -5 dBu. So at the channel level, we‚Äôve knocked 5 dB off the level (relative to 0, or unity, which is determined by the head-amp control). Now, as part of the drum kit, it‚Äôs assigned to VCA 1. And we might run that at -2. That knocks another 2 dB off the level for a total cut of 7 dB. As part of the band, it‚Äôs also assigned to VCA 5, which we might run at -5 also. That‚Äôs 5 more off, for a final level of -12 dB. And again, all of this level changing is done on the channel strip itself, in a single amp stage; it‚Äôs not going through multiple stages at each VCA. The VCA groups simply alter the control voltage of that channel‚Äôs amp.\nBy definition, and unlike a group, a VCA group can never overload. This is because it‚Äôs simply a ‚Äúmaster remote control‚Äù for a bunch of inputs. Even if you push your VCA group fader to +10, you‚Äôre merely telling all the channels assigned to that VCA group to add 10 dB of level to their respective signals. At that point an individual channel might clip, but the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù never will because it‚Äôs really more of a virtual group.\nWe should also note that by lowering VCA 1 (kick & bass) to -2, it also tells channel 9 (bass) to turn down by 2 dB as well. And by setting the VCA 5 at -5, it tells all of the band channels (basically 1-14) to lower by 5 dB. But each individual channel can be adjusted relative to each other, so the mix is preserved.\nYou do have to be careful with VCAs, however. Because you are remotely controlling a channel (for lack of a better term), you could be tempted to over-drive your input channels with too much signal. This could happen in the above example very easily. Let‚Äôs say someone wasn‚Äôt paying attention and set VCA 1 (kick & bass) to -20, and VCA 5 (the whole band) to -30. That would lower the signal of the drum mics by 50 dB. That would be pretty low in most systems. You would probably want to hear more drums than that, and even if your channel fader is already at +10, the total output of the channel is -40 (+10 plus -20 plus -30). So you might be tempted to turn up the head amp control to get more level. However, you would quickly drive the head amp into distortion. When using VCAs, getting good gain structure is more important than ever.\nStill, that shouldn‚Äôt dissuade you from using them. Their much cleaner than groups, and the level of control is far greater. You also have more options for control, as shown above. Moreover, when you mute a VCA group, you also mute the channels. On most boards, this will have the effect of shutting off the Aux sends as well, which keeps you‚Äôre monitors quiet when you want them quite. Another benefit of VCAs.\nDCA stands for Digital Controlled Amplifier. Essentially, they are the same thing as a VCA, but on a digital board. Every digital board I‚Äôve seen has DCAs, which makes sense because the signal is already in the digital domain, and it‚Äôs just a simple matter of programming to make a DCA group behave the same as a VCA group. So there‚Äôs not really any more to see here. Move along.\nYou do have to pay attention to your DCAs on a digital board, however, because most of the time they‚Äôre on a separate layer. So it‚Äôs really easy to have the scenario I illustrated above play out (40 dB of cut applied without you knowing where it came from). As always, proper gain structure is important.\nI hope this has shed some light on the concept of Groups versus VCAs/DCAs. While they can all have the same ultimate effect on the signal, they go about it differently. And when you use one versus the other depends mainly on your board. If you have both, use VCAs for your channel ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù and groups for sending mixes somewhere else besides the main speakers. They are great for ‚Äúsubmixes‚Äù for an Aviom system for example. If all you have are groups, break your band up into logical ‚Äúgroups‚Äù and control them as described. Most of all, I want to encourage you to explore what your mixer can do. It probably has more power than you thought. To paraphrase my favorite foodie, Alton Brown, ‚ÄúGet out there and play with your mixer‚Äù (preferably during non-service times‚Ä¶)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e13b737-30a7-41f2-b558-dedf6165a768>","<urn:uuid:676046a7-88f9-4c54-a760-cc320f879c1c>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How lab coats protect medical workers safety, and what infection risks they avoid when using disposables ones? Need explanation por favor!","answer":"Lab coats provide barrier protection on both the front and back of the torso and come in various styles with features like buttons, zippers, pockets, collars, and elastic wrists. Most lab coats are made of PP or SMS material. When using disposable lab coats instead of reusable ones, healthcare providers significantly reduce the risk of nosocomial infections (hospital-acquired infections) which cause approximately 1.7 million cases and 100,000 deaths annually in the United States. Disposable lab coats eliminate the risk of cross-contamination between patients and protect medical staff who might otherwise be exposed to infections when handling or cleaning used medical products.","context":["Disposable Coveralls, lab coats, gowns, aprons, even pants -we can do it! When it comes to barrier protection for your body, there are numerous options. Think of body protection like clothing. In clothing, there are three primary aspects:\n- Material of clothing\n- Type of garment\n- Style of garment\nFor instance, with with a pullover, it can be made of cotton, wool, polyester, nylon, another material or a combination of materials. For simplicity, let‚Äôs say the pullover you choose is a cotton pullover. The style of the pullover means that the pullover has two side pockets, no collar, and a zipper that zips halfway up. The style of a garment represents the majority of complexity of design and manufacturing because there are myriad variations and styles each garment can have (an essence of fashion). While most people don‚Äôt consider disposable body protection fashionable -it can be complex‚Ä¶but it doesn‚Äôt have to be.\nWhen it comes to the type of garments within body protection there are 4 primary types of garments:\n- Lab coats\nIn terms of usage, gowns and lab coats represent the largest market share of the body protection market because each of those items is heavily used within the medical market. Coveralls are also used by a significant number of industries, but primarily in the industrial market. Whereas, aprons are mostly used within the food industry and lastly, pants are used in niche situations.\nDisposable Gowns generally provide body coverage on the torso, arms. Some gowns provide back coverage -whereas others do not provide coverage on the back. Very few gowns provide barrier protection from the waist down or on the head. Most gowns are made of PP and SMS, although there are gowns made of PE material too.\nDisposable Labcoats all provide barrier protection on the front and back of the torso, unlike some gowns. Also, unlike most gowns, there are a wide variety of styles of lab coats (buttons, zippers, pockets, collars, elastic wrists, etc.). Most lab coats are made of PP or SMS material.\nDisposable Coveralls provide the most body protection of any garment. While there are many styles of coveralls, most lab coats cover your legs, torso, and head. Some coveralls cover your feet as well. Most common variations are related to hoods, booties, zippers, buttons, and tape on the seams. As for material, most coveralls are made of PP, but you can find many coveralls made of microporous and SMS.\nDisposable Aprons primarily cover the front of your body or your chest. Depending on the size and length of material, some coveralls cover a portion of your back or a portion of your arms, but most only cover your upper torso. These are made of PE, PP and PVC material.\nDisposable Pants are rarely used in the market, but when they are used it is made of PP, SMS or Microprous material in the medical or corrections environment. Pants are used as a scrubs replacement or coverall, gown, or lab coat is not sufficient for the specific task at hand. While this garment has the least demand, we are certainly open to discussing your pant need.\nAs for materials, there are 4 primary types of materials used in disposable body protection. Bear in mind, all disposable body protection is considered non-woven material. Meaning, it is not a woven textile product -it is a plastic based product. As such, all of the materials used to make disposable body protection are plastic products.\nPE stands for Polyethelyene material. Trashbags are made from this material. Polyethelyene is the most commonly manufactured plastic in the world. All of these plastics are water resistant, generally durable and provide good barrier protection depending on how they are used (e.g. certain materials perform better under certain conditions). PE material is generally considered the least expensive material within body protection.\nPP stands for Polypropylene. PP is basically like a plastic paper. While still water resistant, it is more breathable than PE material. While more expensive than PE, it is significantly less expensive than SMS and Microporous material.\nSMS is a type of PP material. It stands for Spunbond, Melt blown, Spunbond. What distinguishes SMS material is how the PP material is processed. When SMS is manufactured, PP is processed with a machine that separates the plastic compounds apart and turns the PP material into what looks and feels like cotton candy. This process is called ‚ÄúSpunboning‚Äù. This process increases the material‚Äôs surface area and changes the material dynamics of the PP material. Afterward, the material is ‚Äúmeltblown‚Äù meting the material decreases the permeability of the PP material. After it has been melt blown, it is again Spunbond to add material elasticity and improve the feel of the product. SMS is far more expensive than PP, but it is far less permeable garment. SMS is most appropriate for Operating Rooms, medical settings, or clean room environments where it is important to prevent any permeability of liquid to or from the garment. Hypothetically, a garment can be SMMS or SMMMS if a person is looking to minimize liquid permeability.\nMicroporous material is a flash spun PE material. This material is used in building insulation, for packages, and for personal protective equipment (PPE). Most are familiar with the company Dupont. Several decades ago, Dupont promoted its brand Tyvek selling patented versions of microporous material. While Tyvek is a great variation of this product, the underlying material is a microporous PE simply known as microporous. This is the least permeable material in body protection. The permeability is less than 2 nano meters. Unfortunately, it is the most expensive material and the least breathable material; however, for high risk situations, most Hazmat suites utilize are a variation of microporous material. Within microporous material there are a wide variety of specifications; however, most garments made using this material are coveralls.\nPVC stands for polyvinylchloride. Mostly disposable sleeves and gloves are made of our this material. Only some aprons utilize material. PVC has the best ‚Äúhand‚Äù or overall feel of all the plastic materials in non-woven. However, it is the most dense, most expensive second to microporous material. While many people prefer to feel and comfort of the material, the cost is prohibitive for most as it relates to body protection.\nWhen it comes to body protection, we recognize no two people are the same as such no PPE provider should provide a one fit solution for all companies. We work you find the best product for the task at hand.","As infection control efforts in hospitals and other healthcare settings intensify, medical providers are turning to disposable medical products as a way of ensuring staff and patient safety. Nosocomial infections are infections caused by treatment in a hospital or other healthcare unit. Hospital-associated infections are a serious problem for patients and the healthcare industry. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approximate that there are 1.7 million hospital-associated infections each year that cause nearly 100,000 deaths in the United States. Hospitals, clinics, and doctors‚Äô offices are looking for ways to reduce these tragic statistics, and disposable medical supplies are an essential part of increasing patient safety.\nBefore disposable medical products were widely available, healthcare providers relied on autoclaves to sterilize all equipment. Autoclaves use high heat and intense pressure to sterilize items. The autoclave has been used for over 100 years and is generally very effective. Autoclaves are essential pieces of equipment in hospitals and many other medical settings.\nUnfortunately, the autoclaving process is not always perfect and medical products may not, in fact, be sterile after autoclaving. Some plastics cannot be autoclaved because they would melt. In addition, while autoclave sterilization kills viruses, bacteria, and fungi, it is not effective against prions that cause diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Mad Cow Disease. Even when autoclave sterilization works well, it takes time and effort to run the autoclave. Autoclaves are still used in hospitals, labs, and even tattoo parlors to sterilize equipment that is not disposable. However, supplies that are available in a disposable form are certainly safer and easier to use.\nWhen items such as face masks, syringes, or scalpels are reused, they can spread infections from one patient to another. Many patients in hospitals have weakened immune systems, so the risk from cross-contamination is especially great. Hospital staff members are also at risk of being exposed to infections when they handle or clean used medical products.\nDisposable medical supplies are intended for single patient use, so they do not pose the risk of spreading infection. For example, if a patient needs an IV to replenish lost fluids, the procedure can be safely done using only disposable medical products. All of the products used, from the tourniquet, alcohol swab, and gauze to the stylet, catheter, tubing, and IV bag, are all disposable medical products that pose no risk to the patient or healthcare provider of transmitting an infection from a different patient.\nSterile Disposable Medical Products\nMany disposable medical products are sterile and individually wrapped to provide maximum patient protection. These disposable medical supplies are especially important for patients with compromised immune systems. In these cases, when infection control is a top priority, health care providers should use sterile disposable medical products as much as possible. For instance, if a nurse needs to take a patient‚Äôs temperature, a sealed disposable thermometer is a better option than an electric thermometer that has been used with other patients. Catheters, bandages, applicators, tubing, syringes, and more are all available as sterile disposable medical supplies.\nPersonal Protective Equipment\nHealth care providers must take great precautions to protect their health. They may be exposed to many pathogens every day, and proper protective gear is the best way for them to stay safe. Disposable medical supplies are essential to keeping doctors, nurses, and EMTs safe from infections. One of the most important safety products is the disposable glove. Health care providers should always wear gloves and change them frequently. Disposable gloves are available in latex or non-latex and in a range of colors and sizes. Other disposable medical products that are vital for personal protection include face masks, protective isolation gowns, protective shoe covers, and bouffant caps."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eb89edaa-bc1d-4f26-b3c8-1cdb4081e4a2>","<urn:uuid:b53fab39-b01e-4900-9264-1f2f1d87caaa>"],"error":null}

While we sleep at night, we go through REM sleep and non-REM sleep multiple times.\nWhy is sleep important for children and adolescents?\nGood sleeping habits are tied to a healthy immune system. Good sleep can clear one‚Äôs mind after a busy day. Sleeping well also can lead to good mental health overall.\nHow much sleep should we get?\nThe amount of sleep needed at night changes with age (see Table 1). As children get older, they need fewer hours of sleep. Newborns need around 14-17 hours of sleep. Preschoolers require 10 to 13 hours of sleep. Adolescents need fewer hours of sleep and have later bed and wake times.\nTable 1: Recommended hours of sleep by age\n|Newborn (0-3 months)*||14-17|\n|Infants (4-12 months)*||12-16|\n|Toddlers (1-2 years)*||11-14|\n|Preschoolers (3-5 years)*||10-13|\n|School Age (6-12 years)*||9-12|\n|Adolescence (13-18 years)*||8-10|\n|Young Adults (18-25)||7-9|\n|Older Adults (65 years and older)*||7-8|\nNote: *includes naps. Source: Hirshkowitz et al. (2015).\nHints for creating healthy sleeping habits\nCreating a bedtime ritual.\nParents should create a bedtime ritual for their children. This could include the child taking a bath and changing into pajamas. The parent also can read a short calming story or poem to the child. Going to bed around the same time each night is important at any age.\nRelax before bedtime.\nChildren have busy lives with school, sports, and home-work. These activities can increase stress and sleeping problems. Learning how to relax and unwind at night can help children fall and stay asleep. This can include teaching children not to focus on worries and ‚Äúbad thoughts‚Äù just before bed.\nAvoid caffeine and large meals before bedtime.\nParents should teach their kids healthy drinking and eating habits before bed. Drinking caffeine and energy drinks and eating before bed can lead to sleeping problems. Also, drinking liquid (even water) before bed can disrupt sleep.\nCreating a healthy sleeping space.\nChildren can be taught how to create a healthy sleeping space. This includes having a regular space for relaxing and falling asleep. Having a door for the bedroom can block out noises and light. Keeping the room cool, dimly lit, and quiet can improve sleeping. There are also sleeping products, such as weighted blankets, that can help children fall and stay asleep.\nLimit screen time before bed.\nChildren should limit the use of cell phones, computers, and video games before bed. Children who use these devices a lot before bed sleep poorly. For instance, texting before bedtime can distract the natural process of winding down at night. The blue light created by the screens can lower melatonin levels. This can make it harder to fall asleep.\nParents are wonderful role models.\nChildren also learn good sleeping habits by observing their parents. Also, many of the suggestions mentioned above also work well with adults.\nYou CAN do it.\nTeaching children healthy sleeping habits can be hard for many parents. It can take\ntime to make these changes. Seeking the support of friends and family can help during\nthis process. Finally, it‚Äôs important to remember that you\ncan do this."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f2a09591-9f29-4a6c-9bbc-05320673ba45>","<urn:uuid:6ced8d2a-6f1b-4e11-bb03-b9415a19346c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can rainwater be harvested through both traditional well systems and modern rain barrels, and what are the current regulatory standards governing these collection methods?","answer":"For traditional well systems, rainwater can be harvested by directing water from the terrace through a first flush system that filters initial impure rainwater, then passing it through gravel/river sand filters before storing it in a sump or directing it to a recharge well. Recharge wells, typically 10 feet deep, should extend just beyond the clay soil layer. For modern rain barrel systems, current regulations specify that systems under 100 gallons per vessel don't require permits, while larger systems need city approval. The California Plumbing Code has no approved standards for rainwater harvesting systems. All systems must include proper screening, secure fastening, and cannot connect to domestic water supplies. Water from both methods can be used for irrigation, though rain barrel water doesn't require treatment and isn't limited to subsurface irrigation.","context":["I happened to visit the Rain Center, Chennai (Mandavelipakkam) where passionate individuals are creating awareness about Rain Water Harvesting & enabling people to implement the same in their premises.\nWhat is Rain Water Harvesting?\nOur cities are expanding quickly and the density of population per sq. KM is increasing drastically due to high-rise buildings/apartments coming up almost everywhere. This will put a lot of pressure on the water table in that region as people draw more and more water from the well/deep bore. Corporation water/tank lorries maybe available at some places but only a certain amount of water can be supplied by them, and the cost of water supply is often steep.\nRain Water Harvesting consists of various techniques that can be implemented by individual house owners and apartment complex owners to catch the rainwater falling in their premises and either use it (or) send it back to the ground, thereby replenishing the water table of that region. This will save rainwater from going to the sea (through stormwater drains) or evaporating.\nWhy harvest Rain Water?\nBasically, rainwater is harvested to ‚Äì\n- To replenish the ground water table to make sure that you have enough water to draw from the wells, throughout the year.\n- To dilute iron salts in brackish water (if your ground water happens to be brackish) and provide clear water.\n- To avoid flooding of low-lying areas, as rain water in and around the house is diverted to the ground.\nHow to harvest Rain Water?\nThe Rain Center, Chennai has many educational posters that convey the importance of RWH and how to conserve rain water. They have published a small booklet on the topic, ‚ÄòRainwater harvesting in urban areas‚Äô. More than all that, people here are eager to consult/explain how people can implement rainwater harvesting in their homes/offices.\nHow are they harvesting rain water in their own premises?\nLook at the above photo. A pipe drains the rainwater from the terrace. But since the initial few minutes of rainwater maybe impure, water from initial rains is held in the left side pipe (Named ‚ÄòFirst Flush‚Äô) and can be drained out later on. When this pipe is filled with water, the rainwater enters the neighboring pipe (they are interconnected on the top) which is then allowed to pass through a filter (which contains some gravel/river sand).\nThis water is then allowed to pass through a sump (the above photo shows just a model, not a real sump), where some water can be stored and drawn directly for usage. This is optional, and rainwater from the terrace can directly be allowed to fall into the well too.\nRainwater can also be harvested from the area around the house, near the gate, and even outside the gate. Have a look at the rainwater drain they have constructed just inside the gate ‚Äì\nSo, rainwater, instead of running outside, rushes into the holes shown above from where they are directed into a recharge well (shown below). Rainwater from just outside the street is also diverted into this recharge well.\nYou may not be able to see inside the recharge well (from this photo) ‚Äì it is similar to a normal well (with cement rings around the edges), but the depth is lesser. In this case, it is 10 feet deep but the depth varies based on the region. It seems, this well should extend just beyond the clay soil in the ground (as clay soil can hold/prevent water from percolating down). You can also construct a recharge bore pit, to send the rainwater to greater depths. But recharge wells are preferable.\nI would like to thank Dr. Sekhar Raghavan and Dr. Indukanth S. Ragade for spending a considerable amount of time educating me on this subject and showing me around their premises.\nContact/Address/Further Info: The Rain Center website.\nEdited to add after receiving a mail from the Rain Center officials: Our advice comes free, and people can contact us through email: sekar1479[at]yahoo.co.in or mobile 96770 43869.\nSo, have you implemented rain water harvesting in your house/apartments?","Rainwater Harvesting: Rain Barrels\nThe California Plumbing Code has no approved standards for rainwater harvesting systems. No permit or city approval is needed for rain barrel systems of 100 gallons or less per vessel, provided all city requirements are met. Rainwater catchment systems over 100 gallons require permits and approval from the City of Berkeley Building Department.

Label all rainwater harvesting pipes and barrels with: ‚ÄúNon-Potable Water, Do NOT Drink‚Äù.\n- All rainwater collection systems must have an overflow to a safe disposal location (stormwater drain or rain garden).\n- If you intend to water edible plants with your rainwater, consider installing a first flush diverter, which disposes of the first inch of rain and ensures that you harvest only the cleanest rainwater.\n- Rain barrel must be secured on a firm, level surface so that it will not tip over.

{"question":"Why do children learn what new words mean through fast mapping instead of active teaching?","answer":"Children learn new words through fast mapping because it's an instinctive method of learning that uses information they already know to place words in the right context. Rather than being actively taught their mother tongue, children pick up words and their meanings through everyday life by excluding possibilities that already have words attached to them and applying unknown words to objects or actions that don't have names yet.","context":["Learn something new every day\nMore Info... by email\nFast mapping is one way children learn what a particular word means. When they hear a word for the first time, kids can often figure out what it means. This instinctive method of learning uses information the child already knows to help him or her place the word in the right context. Often, the kids narrow down the meaning by excluding possibilities that already have words attached to them and apply the unknown word to the object or action that does not already have a name.\nFirst described in 1978 by Carey and Bartlett, fast mapping is usually applied to children. Kids do not learn their mother tongue through active teaching but rather through picking up words and their meanings through everyday life. For instance, the concept of a black cat is understood by children who identify the word cat as a particular sort of animal and also as a particular inanimate representation of that animal in a book or as a toy. The concept of black enters their minds as a color that can apply to many objects because they hear it used in this context.\nAll words are new to kids at some point in their lives, and at age two, they know three times as many words as they do at one. If the English language, for example, can be imagined as an entire dictionary, young kids only know some of the words, with large, empty holes where all the potential words could be. As they get older, more of these black holes are filled in. One of the ways this occurs is through fast mapping.\nIntegral to the concept of fast mapping is that kids use their acquired knowledge to narrow down the range of things a new word could refer to. A little girl who already knows what a black cat is, for example, is at an advantage when presented with a black cat and a white cat. If her mother asks her to point to the white cat and not the black cat, the little girl can exclude the black cat from the list of possible things her mother is referring to.\nEven though the room may be full of new objects, the girl can also exclude these from the list of possibilities as she knows what a cat is. Using fast mapping, therefore, the girl can identify the white cat as the object of interest. Thereafter, she also has an idea what white means. Conversely, if the girl knew what white and black meant, but not what a cat was, she could infer from the mother's instruction to point at an object, and the fact that two creatures were white and black, to figure out what a cat was.\nDogs may also be able to use fast mapping. A 2004 study of an intelligent collie showed that the dog could bring back a new item to the researcher that he had not seen before simply by excluding all the other items that had names that he knew. Fast mapping is a very quick process and only requires a few seconds. Adults can also fast map when confronted with one new item among known items.\nIt makes sense that dogs can learn to name and identify objects the same way children can.\nDogs can be trained to identify objects or people based on smell and to guide the blind based on sight. Both of those actions are related to the same routine/familiarity idea that is the basis of fast mapping.\nOne of our editors will review your suggestion and make changes if warranted. Note that depending on the number of suggestions we receive, this can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days.

{"question":"¬øCu√°l es la diferencia entre el man√° regular y el man√° del Sabbath en t√©rminos de su preservaci√≥n? What evidence is there about worms appearing in each case?","answer":"The regular manna and Sabbath manna differed in their preservation properties. According to Exodus 16, regular manna collected on normal days would breed worms and become foul if kept overnight. However, the manna collected on the sixth day for the Sabbath was special - when stored overnight for the seventh day, it had no maggots and did not smell foul. This is specifically mentioned in Exodus 16:20 and 16:24, where two Hebrew words for worms are used: tola'im and rimmah, which refer to caterpillars or larvae that feed on corrupting matter.","context":["Worm (1.) Heb. sas (Isa 51:8), denotes the caterpillar of the clothes-moth. (2.) The manna bred worms ( tola'im ), but on the Sabbath there was not any worm ( rimmah ) therein (Exo 16:20, Exo 16:24). Here these words refer to caterpillars or larvae, which feed on corrupting matter. These two Hebrew words appear to be interchangeable (Job 25:6; Isa 14:11). Tola'im in some places denotes the caterpillar (Deu 28:39; Jon 4:7), and rimmah , the larvae, as bred from putridity (Job 17:14; Job 21:26; Job 24:20). In Mic 7:17, where it is said, \"They shall move out of their holes like worms,\" perhaps serpents or \"creeping things,\" or as in the Revised Version, \"crawling things,\" are meant. The word is used figuratively in Job 25:6; Psa 22:6; Isa 41:14; Mar 9:44, Mar 9:46, Mar 9:48; Isa 66:24.\nWormwood Heb. la'anah , the Artemisia absinthium of botanists. It is noted for its intense bitterness (Deu 29:18; Pro 5:4; Jer 9:15; Amo 5:7). It is a type of bitterness, affliction, remorse, punitive suffering. In Amo 6:12 this Hebrew word is rendered \"hemlock\" (R.V., \"wormwood\"). In the symbolical language of the Apocalypse (Rev 8:10, Rev 8:11) a star is represented as falling on the waters of the earth, causing the third part of the water to turn wormwood. The name by which the Greeks designated it, absinthion , means \"undrinkable.\" The absinthe of France is distilled from a species of this plant. The \"southernwood\" or \"old man,\" cultivated in cottage gardens on account of its fragrance, is another species of it.\nWorship Homage rendered to God which it is sinful (idolatry) to render to any created being (Exo 34:14; Isa 2:8). Such worship was refused by Peter (Act 10:25, Act 10:26) and by an angel (Rev 22:8, Rev 22:9).\nWorshipper (Gr. neocoros = temple sweeper [Act 19:35] of the great goddess Diana). This name neocoros appears on most of the extant Ephesian coins\nWrestle (Eph 6:12). See GAMES.\nWriting The art of writing must have been known in the time of the early Pharaohs. Moses is commanded \"to write for a memorial in a book\" (Exo 17:14) a record of the attack of Amalek. Frequent mention is afterwards made of writing (Exo 28:11, Exo 28:21, Exo 28:29, Exo 28:36; Exo 31:18; Exo 32:15, Exo 32:16; Exo 34:1, Exo 34:28; Exo 39:6, Exo 39:14, Exo 39:30). The origin of this art is unknown, but there is reason to conclude that in the age of Moses it was well known. The inspired books of Moses are the most ancient extant writings, although there are written monuments as old as about B.C.2000. The words expressive of \"writing,\" \"book,\" and \"ink,\" are common to all the branches or dialects of the Semitic language, and hence it has been concluded that this art must have been known to the earliest Semites before they separated into their various tribes, and nations, and families. \"The Old Testament and the discoveries of Oriental archaeology alike tell us that the age of the Exodus was throughout the world of Western Asia an age of literature and books, of readers and writers, and that the cities of Palestine were stored with the contemporaneous records of past events inscribed on imperishable clay. They further tell us that the kinsfolk and neighbours of the Israelites were already acquainted with alphabetic writing, that the wanderers in the desert and the tribes of Edom were in contact with the cultured scribes and traders of Ma'in [Southern Arabia], and that the 'house of bondage' from which Israel had escaped was a land where the art of writing was blazoned not only on the temples of the gods, but also on the dwellings of the rich and powerful.\" Sayce. (See DEBIR; PHOENICIA.) The \"Book of the Dead\" was a collection of prayers and formulae, by the use of which the souls of the dead were supposed to attain to rest and peace in the next world. It was composed at various periods from the earliest time to the Persian conquest. It affords an interesting glimpse into the religious life and system of belief among the ancient Egyptians. We learn from it that they believed in the existence of one Supreme Being, the immortality of the soul, judgment after death, and the resurrection of the body. It shows, too, a high state of literary activity in Egypt in the time of Moses. It refers to extensive libraries then existing. That of Ramessium, in Thebes, e.g., built by Rameses II., contained 20,000 books. When the Hebrews entered Canaan it is evident that the art of writing was known to the original inhabitants, as appears, e.g., from the name of the city Debir having been at first Kirjath-sepher, i.e., the \"city of the book,\" or the \"book town\" (Jos 10:38; Jos 15:15; Jdg 1:11). The first mention of letter-writing is in the time of David (Sa2 11:14, Sa2 11:15). Letters are afterwards frequently spoken of (Kg1 21:8, Kg1 21:9, Kg1 21:11; Kg2 10:1, Kg2 10:3, Kg2 10:6, Kg2 10:7; Kg2 19:14; Ch2 21:12; Ch2 30:1, Ch2 30:6, etc.).\nYarn Found only in Kg1 10:28, Ch2 1:16. The Heb. word mikveh , i.e., \"a stringing together,\" so rendered, rather signifies a host, or company, or a string of horses. The Authorized Version has: \"And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price;\" but the Revised Version correctly renders: \"And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.\"\nYear Heb. shanah , meaning \"repetition\" or \"revolution\" (Gen 1:14; Gen 5:3). Among the ancient Egyptians the year consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, with five days added to make it a complete revolution of the earth round the sun. The Jews reckoned the year in two ways, (1.) according to a sacred calendar, in which the year began about the time of the vernal equinox, with the month Abib; and (2.) according to a civil calendar, in which the year began about the time of the autumnal equinox, with the month Nisan. The month Tisri is now the beginning of the Jewish year.\nYeshebi The Hebrew word rendered \"inhabitants\" in Jos 17:7, but probably rather the name of the village Yeshepheh, probably Yassuf, 8 miles south of Shechem.\nYoke (1.) Fitted on the neck of oxen for the purpose of binding to them the traces by which they might draw the plough, etc. (Num 19:2; Deu 21:3). It was a curved piece of wood called 'ol . (2.) In Jer 27:2; Jer 28:10, Jer 28:12 the word in the Authorized Version rendered \"yoke\" is motah , which properly means a \"staff,\" or as in the Revised Version, \"bar.\" These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe bondage, or affliction, or subjection (Lev 26:13; Kg1 12:4; Isa 47:6; Lam 1:14; Lam 3:27). In the New Testament the word \"yoke\" is also used to denote servitude (Mat 11:29, Mat 11:30; Act 15:10; Gal 5:1). (3.) In Sa1 11:7, Kg1 19:21, Job 1:3 the word thus translated is tzemed , which signifies a pair, two oxen yoked or coupled together, and hence in Sa1 14:14 it represents as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, like the Latin jugum . In Isa 5:10 this word in the plural is translated \"acres.\"","Exodus - Chapter 16\n3 and said to them, 'Why did we not die at Yahweh's hand in Egypt, where we used to sit round the flesh pots and could eat to our heart's content!

For example, the doors of the trucks usually comprise the safety materials and avoid the accumulation of water.\nThese protective tools keep the sealing dry and avoid breakage conditions. In addition, the drying remains stable between the doors and sealing material for multiple months.\nHowever, the worn-out material requires instant replacement. Therefore, the avoidance of these situations can generate problems.\nPurchase new truck door weather stripping\nAlways select the right size and design of stripping according to measurements. Then, take the layout of dimensions on the store to bring the high-quality products.\nNever select a cracked stripping because the adjustment becomes difficult. Few manufacturing companies offer warranty cards and always consider the rigid material with appropriate tools.\nMatch the new stripping with the old material to reduce errors. If you are purchasing it for the first time, then consider the material.\nThe foamy stripping is retainable, and they have high performance. You can also approach the manufacturer, and they have accurate tools like the previous materials.\nThe problems are resolvable due to these steps, and a person can replace them without any professional help. However, the comprehension of the structure is necessary while buying these stripping tools.\nAdjust it properly\nIt is a testing process to observe the stability and adjustment of new stripping. Therefore, you should perform this step before removing the already existing door stripping.\nThe testing can prevent various problems in the future. However, the adjustment of the stripping is a tricky process, and you cannot perform it alone.\nTake the support of a friend and then adjust them in the particular frame, and it provides a complete layout of the errors.\nIt should match the old material in structure and design, and you can select the same color for appealing results. In addition, these stripping materials have specific internal tools.\nThe new matter must comprise the necessary holes on the spots. The presence of the rubber blocks and precise channels is essential.\nYou cannot avoid these materials because they are a supporter of the procedures. Moreover, the installation becomes convenient due to such comfortable equipment.\nRemove old weather stripping from the truck\nThe old weather-stripping comprises the screws for proper adjustment. You have to unscrew them to remove the old material.\nUse a screwdriver of precise size and then discard them one by one. Never pull the old material with excessive force.\nIt can result in the formation of irreversible problems. The peeling of the old weather-stripping from the door is challenging.\nYou have to keep the movements gentle to avoid breakage. The removal of old rubber blocks is essential without decreasing the paint.\nNever scratch this material with aggressive actions. It can cost heavily on the budget and is not advisable.\nThe removal of these rubber blocks is tricky, and you need to remove them manually. The discard of the channeling structures is also necessary for this step.\nYou can also use a weather-stripping remover. It allows convenient cleaning of the material. Then, you can peel off the stuff appropriately with minimum effort.\nClean its surface\nClean the surface with the help of a weather-stripping cleaner. Use a piece of fabric and damp it in the cleaning liquid. Rub it on the surface and repeat this process at least 2 to 3 times.\nRemove all the scratches on the old materials. It is essential for the proper adjustment of the new stuff. In addition, the remaining pieces of the old material can generate various harmful issues.\nThe process becomes time reducing, and things restrict the completion.\nScratch adhesive material\nUse a sharp tool to remove the adhesive material from the door structure. The pieces or scratches of the sticky material can increase the time consumption.\nIn addition, the installation becomes impossible due to the presence of old material. The new adhesive stuff can never adjust on these scratches.\nThe instability enhances, and it is not a suitable condition. The sharp tool removes every piece of the material conveniently.\nYou can also melt the tiny patches of adhesive material.

First, check and observe the attachment of the material with the frame.\nNever generate new holes at the end of procedures. It can damage the structure into various pieces.\nWhy would you replace the weather stripping of the truck door?\nThe broken seals and other damages lead to the replacement of weather-stripping around a pickup. People change them due to the old age of the material.\nIt becomes less efficient, and the moisture accumulates in the pickup. The excessive noise orientation also leads to the replacement of these materials.\nThe presence of water in the pickup truck is also a leading cause to change them. However, the materials are cost-effective, and you can replace them at approximately $8 to $10 on each door.","How to Install Weather Stripping Onto Sliding Windows and Doors\nInstalling weather stripping onto sliding windows and doors presents some unique challenges. We'll show you in this section how to solve the various problems associated with these tasks.Installing Weather Stripping Onto Sliding Windows\nSliding windows, those in which the sash moves laterally, come in both wood and metal frames. Weather-strip the wooden frames much as you would a double-hung window turned sideways. If only one sash moves, weather-strip it and caulk the stationary sash. For metal frames, follow the instructions for weather-stripping standard metal windows.\nSpecial gaskets are designed for sealing gaps in jalousie and casement windows. To weather-strip jalousies, measure the edge of the glass louver, cut the gasket to size with scissors, and snap the gasket in place. To weather-strip casement windows, measure the edges of the frame, cut strips of gasket to size, miter the ends of the gasket strips where they will intersect, and slip the strips in place over the lip of the frame.\nDouble-hung wood windows almost always require weather-stripping, although if the top sash is never opened, you can solve an air leak problem by caulking to seal any cracks. You may find it advantageous to use more than one type of weather stripping to complete the job. Be sure to follow the correct installation procedures for each type of weather stripping.Installing Weather Stripping Onto Doors\nAll four edges around a door can permit air to leak in and out of your house. In fact, the average door has more gaps than a loose-fitting window. Doors, moreover, don't run in grooves as windows do, so any crack area around a door is likely to be far greater than the area around a window. Weather stripping your doors can seal those gaps, get rid of drafts, and help to reduce your heating and cooling bills. In this article, we'll review the various types of weatherstripping for doors and how to install them.\nBefore you start weather stripping, inspect the door to be sure it fits properly in the frame opening. Close the door and observe it from the inside. Look to see that the distance between the door and the frame is uniform all along both sides and at the top. The distance does not have to be precisely the same all the way around, but, if the door rests crooked in the frame, weather stripping may make it impossible to open or close. Naturally, if there is great variance in the opening between the door and frame, it will be difficult to fit weather stripping snugly at all points, and gaps will result.\nThe cause of most door problems is the hinges. Therefore, the first thing to do is open the door and tighten all the hinge screws. Even slightly loose screws can cause the door to sag. If the screw holes have been reamed out and are now too big to hold the screws, you can use larger screws as long as they will still fit in the hinge's countersunk holes. If even the larger screws won't work, pack the holes with toothpicks dipped in glue, and use a knife to cut off the toothpicks even with the surface. Now the screws have new wood in which to bite.\nSometimes the door must be planed off to prevent binding. If so, you can usually plane the top with the door still in place. Always move the plane toward the center of the door to avoid splintering off the edges. If you must plane wood off the sides, take the door off its hinges, plane the hinge side, and always move toward the edges.\nSpring metal is quite popular for door weather stripping. It works effectively when installed properly and is not visible with the door closed.

Environmental culturing is also an option but has serious limitations and should only be used with support from infection prevention staff, microbiology laboratory, administration, and environmental services.","context":["Infection Prevention Orientation Manual\nSection 9: Environmental Services\nDavid R. Woodard, MSc, CLS, CIC\nDownload a printable PDF Version of this section.\nAt the completion of this section the Infection Preventionist (IP) will:\n- List the considerations for choosing cleaning products\n- List the hierarchy for cleaning and disinfection of equipment (Spaulding classification)\n- List methods to evaluate the cleaning process in the healthcare environment\nNumber of hours\n- Key Concepts ‚Äì 6 hours\n- Methods ‚Äì 4 hours\n- Wyoming Infection Prevention Orientation Manual, Section #8 Medical Instrument and Device Reprocessing\nEnvironmental cleaning in the healthcare setting is one of the most often overlooked but key elements in infection prevention. The discipline is generally unseen unless there are problems. The current versions of the regulatory standards for healthcare facilities, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Joint Commission and the Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program do not have specific standards for environmental cleaning and hygiene; they are scored in the infection prevention and leadership standards. Therefore IP must be intimately involved with the development and monitoring of the environmental services (EVS) department‚Äôs activities. The entire process of cleaning should be monitored by a multi-disciplinary team of administration, infection prevention, and the EVS personnel.\nDr. E. H. Spaulding classified the cleaning of medical equipment into three general levels: non-critical, semi-critical, and critical. Each of these levels in the classification system is based on the relative risk of the transmission of an infection in the healthcare setting. The plan for cleaning the healthcare environment should evolve from an assessment of the relative risk of infection based on the Spaulding classification, and then scheduled accordingly. For more information on the specifics of cleaning and disinfecting medical devices and equipment, please read the Medical Instrument and Device Reprocessing section (Section #8) of the Wyoming Infection Prevention Orientation Manual.\nProper cleaning and disinfection of the environment requires the right combination of:\n- Equipment (wipes, mops, automated washers, etc.)\n- Supplies (soaps, detergents, disinfectants, etc. at the correct dilutions and for the correct duration of contact time)\n- Personnel (environmental services staff)\n- Training (of those staff on the proper use of said equipment and supplies and compliance with facility policies)\n- Monitoring (of policies and procedures related to cleaning, as well as the overall effectiveness and efficiency of cleaning).\nIndividuals responsible for the cleaning and disinfection of equipment and healthcare environment must receive adequate and appropriate training. Training should be conducted as part of general orientation, remediation (if there are issues or concerns identified), and re-training as products or methods change. Documentation of training should be available to the IP. There should be agreement in the policies as to what constitutes ‚Äúclean‚Äù and how the process is monitored and maintained.\nCheck lists are invaluable in guiding and tracking the effectiveness and efficiency of cleaning and disinfection processes and procedures. The selection and methods of cleaning and disinfection are essential to a successful program.\nThe IP and/or EVS director are responsible for developing a cleaning matrix that includes: the frequency, the product, the responsible individual and any essential comments. The IP meets with the department heads to develop this matrix.\nPrepare a matrix that lists equipment, the type of detergent/disinfectant that should be used, the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting, the responsible party, and any pertinent comments related to the process. Use Table 1 to get started (Please download the printable PDF version of this section, linked at the top of the page, to view Table 1).\nWheelchairs should be assigned ‚Äúowners‚Äù by department to assure their cleanliness. All ‚Äúrolling stock‚Äù should be itemized in this matrix.\nDocumentation and Reporting\nDocumentation of the cleaning/disinfection process helps assure compliance. Additionally, documentation allows EVS managers and the IP to be informed when remediation is needed and to recognize EVS staff when goals are exceeded. Documentation also provides evidence for remediation and reward of met/exceeded goals. It is also used to evaluate the availability of cleaning equipment and the competency of the staff to use and clean the equipment properly. A variety of commercial methods that can be utilized to verify a particular environment is clean. These methods include fluorescent markers (Dazo¬Æ) and adenosine triphosphate biolumeninescence assay.\nThe use of environmental culturing as an option for cleaning evaluation has serious limitations and should only be undertaken with the assistance and support of the IP, the hospital or associated microbiology laboratory, administration, and EVS.\nPrepare and complete a list of equipment, an evaluation of the cleaning, and any pertinent comments related to the process in Table 2 (Please download the printable PDF version of this section, linked at the top of the page, to view Table 2). Use the check list provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shown in the Appendix or at www.cdc.gov/HAI/toolkits/Environmental-Cleaning-Checklist-10-6-2010.pdf\nHealthcare facilities must have a process in place to approve disinfectants, including those used by EVS, respiratory therapy, endoscopy etc. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must approve all agents used in the healthcare facility. The approval for products can be found by agent on the EPA website www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm.\nCMS regulation 42 CFR 482.42(a) recommends an annual review of all disinfecting products used by the healthcare facility be conducted by the infection prevention committee. This approval should be done based on the active ingredient as opposed to the ‚Äútrade name‚Äù e.g. ortho-phthalaldehyde not Cidex OPA¬Æ. Disinfectants must be used as directed by the manufacturer. Specific product use directions and guidelines can be found on the product website. Product indications and limitations for Cidex OPA¬Æ can be found at www.aspjj.com/us/products/cidex-opa/specs#page_content. Auto-dilutors must be measured and calibrated by the manufacturer, and the results of these calibration activities documented and available; both internally (as by the IP) and externally (as by healthcare licensing).\nPerform a survey of your facility to determine what disinfectants, cleansers and detergents are currently in use. List each agents‚Äô trade name, active ingredient, proper dilution and whether or not the dilution has been verified to be accurate and according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.\nThe director of Environmental Services and the IP should review findings of the cleaning evaluations, new concepts or techniques. The EVS director is an essential member of the Infection Prevention Committee and should attend all meetings.\nSchedule a meeting with your EVS director to review the contents of this section and meet regularly.\n- Rutala W, Weber DJ, et al.

{"question":"What's the primary focus of networking events between C√¥te d'Azur professional networks and general business clubs?","answer":"Professional networks on the C√¥te d'Azur primarily focus on bringing together companies' strengths for joint projects and economic opportunities, emphasizing business development activities and stakeholder collaboration. In contrast, general business clubs organize various types of networking events including breakfast meetings, speed networking events, and rotating meeting times (breakfast, lunch, and evening) to encourage attendance. While both aim to facilitate business connections, general business clubs appear to have more structured and diverse meeting formats compared to the C√¥te d'Azur networks' emphasis on collaborative business development.","context":["Finding a job on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur\nSeveral job posting websites dedicated to the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur and the Alpes-Maritimes department were created to help job seekers find an employment in the Azurean territory.\nThose websites usually provide a hiring service in a specific industry of job type to deliver an accurate job search.\nDeveloped and democratized for several years now, the general job postings websites are an interesting and efficient alternative to look for a job on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. Those websites allow searching for a job by keyword, by specific sector or by location. Yet, they are not necessarily specific to the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur or the South Region.\nRecruitment and temp agencies on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur\nRecruitment agencies on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur carry out several services to allow their candidates finding a job quickly depending on their profiles. Services include the promotion of CVs and the coaching in job interviews and in writing cover letters.\nBy using a recruitment agency, you will benefit from a broader and more encompassing vision of consultants regarding the job market depending on your profile and previous experiences.\nThere are many recruitment agencies on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. Find out more below.\nTemp agencies provide employees to companies for a temporary time. By using a temp agency, you will be able to join a company specializing in the sector of your choice temporarily. Yet, you will not be an employee of the company. Temp agencies keep the employer status.\nDuring a recruitment process with a temp agency, the company must fill in a Preliminary Employment Statement (‚ÄúD√©claration Pr√©alable √† l‚ÄôEmbauche ‚Äì DPAE‚Äù) to comply with any administrative formalities. You will then sign a Mission Contract, which will state the tasks you will be working on during the validity of your temp contract, as well as an Availibility Agreement, which certifies that the temp agency and the company agreed to recruit you.\nIf you are a foreign resident, additional procedures will be carried out for your registration with a temp agency. You will need a work permit, which is mandatory to work in France (unless exceptions).\nIf you are not a member of the European Union, a residence permit will be required. If you are a member of the E.U, you will not need a residence permit to work. Yet, you will need a work permit, unless you are a member of one the following countries: Andorra, Monaco, Switzerland and Saint-Martin.\nThere are many temp agencies on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. Find out more below.\nPublic services for job assistance\nThe Local Program for Integration and Employment (PLIE)\nThe Local Program for Integration and Employment (¬´ Plan Local pour l‚ÄôInsertion et l‚ÄôEmploi (PLIE) ¬ª) is a program led by several cities to help job seekers find an employment. It provides customized assistance; professional integration schemes and job offers. The ‚ÄúPLIE‚Äù program is effective in several municipalities of the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur, such as Nice, Cannes, and Sophia Antipolis. It is supported by the South Region and the Alpes-Maritimes Department.\nEach city has its own ‚ÄúPLIE‚Äù accessibility criteria. For further information, we invite you to contact the municipalities.\nThe Regional Bank for Employment and Traineeship (BREA)\nThe Regional Bank for Employment and Traineeship (¬´ Banque R√©gionale de l‚ÄôEmploi et de l‚ÄôApprentissage (BREA) ¬ª) is a program set up by the South Region to help facilitate the job/internship/traineeship search. It directly links job seekers with companies.\nJob seekers can share their CV and consult job offers and companies looking for employees.\nThe ¬´ FAJE ¬ª Programme\nCo-financed by the South Region and the European Union, the FAJE programme helps promoting training for young graduates through professional integration in a company or a foreign association ;\nThe conditions to benefit from this programme are :\n- Being under 30 years old\n- Holding a Bac+3 diploma minimum. The last year of studies completed must be less than 3 years ago.\n- Living on the territory of the South Region\n- Having received your baccalaureate or a higher education diploma on the territory of the South Region\n- Being registered at the ¬´ P√¥le Emploi ¬ª of the South Region\n- Looking for a first significant job which will last at least 6 consecutive months.\nTo know more about the FAJE programme, we invite you to consult the South Region‚Äôs website.\nLocal professional networks\nThe professional networks within companies are places to gather, exchange and brainstorm. They are strong assets for any company seeking to develop their business activities on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur.\nThe benefits of networking are numerous and have been underlined by different studies. Networking allows working more efficiently on certain topics, putting together the individual added value within gathering venues or events. In addition to the human contribution, networking brings many economic and social opportunities. In particular, networking is useful for creating economies of scale by combining goods and services between the different stakeholders involved. It is also a way of bringing companies‚Äô strengths together to develop joint projects and grow faster than ‚Äúisolated‚Äù companies. Being a member of a professional network also offers higher visibility for companies looking at promoting their activities towards other members of the same network.\nOver the years, many professional networks specializing in different fields have emerged on the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur.","A business network, also known as a business club, is a membership group in which business people share knowledge, experience and contacts. Some are narrowly focused on members generating business leads for one another. Others offer a broader exchange of knowledge and support, and may also provide services such as mentoring, member-to-member discounts, office space and online promotion of members' businesses. The launch of the Young Entrepreneurs Swindon Network should see the purpose of this network being defined as well as its legal status and if you are a young entrepreneur or know of one in the area we hope to see them there.\nNetworks are usually operated via regular networking meetings, which may be formal or informal, and have a website with event listings, news and often a members' discussion forum. Breakfast business meetings are increasingly common, as are speed networking events. Many networks rotate their meetings between breakfast, lunchtime and evening in order to encourage attendance.\nBusiness networks or clubs typically generate their income via membership subscriptions. Fees vary greatly, from around ¬£50 to around ¬£500 per year. Some make additional charges for events or for services such as training. Many raise money from corporate sponsorship and from advertising on their websites. Some may charge for, and make a profit from, catering. For example, some business breakfast clubs charge an additional ¬£10 per meeting to cover refreshments.\nFor many people, the ultimate purpose of networking is to generate new business by finding potential new business partners and obtaining word-of-mouth referrals, recommendations and introductions. However, networking can also help to:\n- Share or learn about new ideas.\n- Find out what competitors are up to.\n- Gather general or specific industry information.\n- Get help with problems from people with appropriate knowledge and experience.\n- Keep up to date with new industry developments, regulations and policies.\n- Form relationships with potential partners.\nThere are a number of common traits among business people who are effective networkers:\n- They treat everyone equally and with respect.\n- They are good listeners.\n- They demonstrate empathy.\n- They are friendly and approachable.\n- They are interested in other people.\nIn addition to good listening and verbal communication skills, it is important to be able to react appropriately to different kinds of situations and emotional moods. These skills can all be developed with practice.\nNetworking is often the start of forming new business relationships and alliances. This can take a number of months, so it is important to have a plan for when and how to follow up with new contacts to nurture and develop the relationship.However you approach business network here's three tips all attendees:\n- Always follow up conversations or introductions later and never promise something that can't be delivered.\n- When collecting business cards, have a plan for maintaining contact with people in order to encourage further meetings or invitations to events.\n- Networking is reciprocal so it is as much about giving and sharing contacts and referrals as receiving them"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency_implied","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3214b936-41eb-45fe-9e1f-2ad32019ab64>","<urn:uuid:f04100c8-bef5-48a2-95a1-edbba6a30815>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Satantango use long takes to affect viewers, and what scientific insights exist about how films control audience attention?","answer":"Satantango's extended long takes, which can last several minutes, create an almost out-of-body experience where real-time blends with 'Tarr-time', making the seven-and-a-half hour runtime feel shorter than expected. These takes show respect for characters' integrity and make viewers become complicit with the characters by spending extended time with them. As for audience attention control, research shows that filmmakers use specific techniques to direct viewers' eye movements, including careful staging, lighting, depth of field, and camera movements. Interestingly, studies have shown that while filmmakers can control where viewers look through these techniques (dubbed the 'tyranny of film'), they cannot fully control how viewers comprehend or interpret what they're seeing.","context":["Holy crap, Bela Tarr‚Äôs legendary seven-hour Satantango was finally released on DVD earlier this week. The L‚Äôs Cullen Gallagher watched it all, and wants you to know about it.\nSurpassing the high-standards set by the Criterion Collection and Masters of Cinema, Facets‚Äô long-awaited release of Bela Tarr‚Äôs Satantango (1994) is a shoe-in for one of the best DVDs of the year. Meticulously restored, the film‚Äôs deep, oceanic black-and-white images retain all of Tarr‚Äôs signature hypnotic beauty. The film, one of the monuments of world cinema, defies all but the most basic of summaries (which ultimately fails to encapsulate its intimate and still-life-like minutiae). In a desolate and failing farming collective in post-Communist Hungary, a group of villagers live out their days in a ceaseless continuum of despair and poverty. The tragic death of a young girl briefly unites them as they place all their hopes in the false promises of a con man ‚Äî an act that only perpetuates, rather than relieves, their seemingly eternal condition.\nUnfolding over the film‚Äôs seven and a half trance-inducing hours, Tarr‚Äôs extended long takes (many lasting several minutes) invoke an almost out-of-body experience in the viewer, as real-time blends with Tarr-time and the minutes on-screen encapsulate something both intimately specific and profoundly universal. Time has rarely been used more wisely in cinema than in Satantango, which is, along with Andrei Tarkovsky‚Äôs Stalker (1979), one of the most resolute cases against wearing wristwatches during a movie. The film‚Äôs pacing, more than being deliberate, is absolutely organic and, as those who have seen the film will (hopefully) attest, the hours move by almost unnoticed. Tarr‚Äôs unobtrusive observational style approaches the narrative with an empathetic patience: he doesn‚Äôt push his characters into situations ‚Äî they create them for themselves. \"The long take is also a token of respect for the integrity of the person,\" remarked David Bordwell in a transcribed conversation (also including Jonathan Rosenbaum and Scott Foundas) included in the DVD set and which serves as a brilliant introduction to Tarr‚Äôs filmography. Rosenbaum elaborated:\n\"There is a very important moral or ethical dimension to the long takes of faces, or even landscapes, because it‚Äôs about being implicated in what you are watching. There are a lot of ways this happens. I think the point is that all of the characters in Satantango certainly are vile individuals, terrible people, but you become complicit with them by being with them for so long√¢¬¶I think that‚Äôs what he [Tarr] wants in some way.\"\nWhat Rosenbaum hits on the nose is the lack of moral authority Tarr asserts over his characters and their actions. He‚Äôs not interested in judgment; rather, he‚Äôs interested in their experience, and in creating a communal experience that involves the characters on-screen and the audience off-screen, and where the screen in between them serves less as a boundary than an invitation to peer through the looking glass. But instead of seeing any sort of wonderland, we are shown the open wounds of humanity: the heartless who thrive off of the weakness of others, and those who can only persevere and push on ahead, if even in a never-ending circle. As Albert Camus suggested, \"One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\"\nAccompanying Satantango is a trio of Tarr rarities. Macbeth (1982) is a made-for-television adaptation of Shakespeare‚Äôs play, filmed entirely in two-shots and using almost exclusively close-ups. Tarr‚Äôs playful attitude towards temporality is such that while seconds flash by on-screen, years pass by in the story. It‚Äôs a time-oriented surrealism, as opposed to the narrative- and logic-driven modes that one typically encounters. Journey on the Plain (1995), a short video based around the poems of Sandor Petofi, was shot using the same locations as Satantango, and Prologue (2004) is a remarkable, five-minute tracking-shot of a welfare food line.\nThe four films in this collection span twenty-two years of an artist‚Äôs career, and they exhibit both continual growth and maturation, but also a steadfast conviction to a particular aesthetic. Seen together, they reveal Bela Tarr‚Äôs acute awareness for not only the human condition, but also the aesthetic sensibility of the cinema.","The Tyranny of Film\nHow filmmakers use their craft to direct our attention\nPosted Jul 27, 2016\nBy Joe Magliano and guest contributors Lester Loschky and Tim J. Smith\nIt‚Äôs movie season again, so what better time to discuss the psychology of film.\nMy colleagues Lester Loschky and Tim Smith have co-written this movie-themed blog. We have been collaborating together for several years because we‚Äôre all fascinated with how movies influence us psychologically and cognitively.\nOver the past 100-plus years, the film industry has developed a set of editing and filming approaches to efficiently tell stories on the big screen. While any given movie may feel like its scenes flow as if they happened in the real world, the way in which a film is produced couldn‚Äôt be further from reality.\nFeature films are made up of thousands of camera shots. Any scene can have hundreds of shots, but each could have been filmed at very different times and in different places. Filmmakers have developed strategies that allow them to tell a story across a series of shots in a way that they believe gives viewers the illusion of a continuous story happening in coherent space and time.\nFor example, a scene of two characters having a conversation could have involved filming each actor delivering lines in isolation from one another, but you edit them together, and the viewer perceives a conversation.\nOur research has shown that these techniques may do more than just make the story clear. They also grab and direct the audience members‚Äô attention in ways that profoundly change our psychological understanding of the storyline.\nFor example, cross cutting is a common technique used to help viewers predict what will happen next. Think of a car chase scene where the movie switches back and forth from the chase to a group of men carrying a pane of glass across the street. You just know that the cars will crash into the glass.\nWe demonstrated the effectiveness of cross cutting in a study (Magliano, Dijkstra, & Zwaan, 1996) that involved the James Bond movie, ‚ÄúMoonraker‚Äù (Broccoli, R. & Gilbert 1979). One 12-second-clip from the movie is helpful for illustrating how cross cutting works to help people make predictions.\nBond‚Äôs nemesis, Jaws, is shown falling through the air. He pulls the ripcord of his parachute, but it fails to open. Then the movie switches back and forth between shots of him continuing to fall and shots of a circus tent. When study participants were able to watch the scene in the context of the entire movie, 100 percent of them predicted what would happen next‚Äîthat Jaws would plunge into the tent.\nIn a new study we published last year, we show that this idea of having our attention controlled by the movie is borne out in terms of how our eyes move across the screen but not necessarily in our comprehension of a scene.\nWe made a simple manipulation that changed the viewers‚Äô experience in a dramatic way. Half of our study participants watched the entire three-minute scene leading up to the 12-second segment in ‚ÄúMoonraker‚Äù; the other half watched the 12-second segment without the full-scene context.\nPeople who watched the entire scene leading up to the 12-second segment were much more likely to make an accurate prediction than those who only saw the critical segment.\nIn this study, we also were highly interested in the eye movements of audience members. We were interested in determining if they would be different between the groups. We thought they could be because our manipulation changed how the two groups understood the film. It is well established that eye movements are very different between a group of readers who understand what they are reading and a group that does not.\nWould this be the case with movies?\nSo, as the 12-second segment unfolded, we used a device to track audience members‚Äô eye movements across the screen.\nThe eye movements of the two groups were virtually identical, even though members of one group lacked context and didn‚Äôt understand the segment in the same way. We call this phenomenon the ‚Äútyranny of film.‚Äù\nHow does this tyranny happen?\nFilmmakers typically want to make it easy for us to process a movie, so they do things that attract our eyes to the exact regions of the screen where the action is happening.\nThe techniques filmmakers use to guide our eyes include many aspects of a film‚Äôs production. A director, for example, will stage a scene so that the actors don‚Äôt overlap in their performances. That way viewers can clearly shift their attention between the key events.\nA director of photography (or cinematographer) will design a shot so that the framing, lighting and depth of field (how blurry the background is relative to the sharp foreground) all direct attention to the most important object in each image. The director of photography will also move the camera so that actions such as an actor‚Äôs head-turn, a punch, or leaving the frame cues attention to what will happen next.\nThe editor can then use these cues to direct our attention to new content across a cut or a series of shots. By choosing close-up shots that show the key points of an event sequence (such as Jaws flapping mid-air and then crashing into the circus tent), the editor can even de-emphasize space and time without the viewer even noticing.\nAll of these members of the film crew (and many more not mentioned) have an intuitive insight into how viewers attend to the final audiovisual experience created by a film.\nHowever, our research shows that knowing where viewers look does not guarantee that a filmmaker knows what the audience is thinking.\nThis mismatch between attention and comprehension is one of the powers of cinematic storytelling. It ensures that members of an audience can simultaneously have a powerful shared experience of gasping, screaming, or laughing, while also taking away a uniquely personal view of the narrative from the film.\nSo, next time you feel your attention glued to the screen, you might think of all the skill used to create such tyrannical control of your attention. But you can rest assured‚Äîfor the most part‚Äîthat filmmakers only have our best interests in mind. By showing us where to look, we can devote our energies to enjoying the show (or not) in our own way.\nNOTE: If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about the art of filmmaking, Bordwell and Thompson‚Äôs ‚ÄúFilm Art: An Introduction‚Äù (2016), is a great place to start.

He teaches courses about cognitive psychology and the psychology of language. His research focuses on how we understand narratives across different media (text, film, graphic narratives) and how we can help struggling readers.\nLester C. Loschky, Ph.D., is an associate professor of psychological sciences at Kansas State University. His work is concerned with visual cognition and scene perception, from both a perceptual and a cognitive viewpoint, and its real world applications. His research emphases are on the relationships between eye movements, attention, and higher-level cognitive processes, with applications in human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-assisted instruction (CAI), and educational applications of better understanding the processes involved in visual narrative perception and comprehension.\nTim J. Smith, Ph.D., is a reader in the Department of Psychological Sciences at Birkbeck, University of London. He teaches cognitive psychology and advanced research methods. His research focuses on how we process audiovisual scenes in real-life, the lab, virtual reality and media. He has specific interest in understanding how filmmakers have intuited the way we see the world and exploit this to craft our experience at the movies.\nBordwell, D. & Thompson, K. (2016).
