{"question":"How does the timing of winter protection methods compare to pruning timing for fruit trees in terms of allowing proper plant hardening?","answer":"Both winter protection and pruning timing must carefully consider plant hardening processes. For winter protection, it's crucial not to apply protective measures too early, as this can interfere with plants' natural hardening off process - mulch should only be applied in late November after a hard frost or two. Similarly with pruning, timing is essential - while winter pruning can be done during full dormancy in fall and winter, summer pruning should be done around the solstice when trees have completed their spring growth phase. In both cases, premature intervention can disrupt the plant's natural preparation for winter conditions.","context":["PROTECTING PLANTS FROM WINTER DAMAGE\nBy Dr. Vern Grubinger\nExtension Vegetable and Berry Specialist\nUniversity of Vermont\nBesides ice dams on the roof and piles\nof snow in the driveway, horticultural injury is a fact\nof life during northern winters. Surprisingly, there\nare many ways that otherwise long-lived plants may meet\ntheir demise in between growing seasons.\nDirect injury from exposure to cold temperature\nis the most obvious, and as a result, most gardeners\nand homeowners pay attention to maps of plant hardiness\nzones. These define the average annual minimum temperature\nof geographical areas based on years of meteorological\nThe southern corners of Vermont are in\nzone 5a, where the average minimum temperature is between\n15 and 20 degrees F below zero. That's why some people\ncall it the \"Banana Belt.\" Up in the Northeast\nKingdom, it's zone 3b, where the coldest temperature\neach year averages 30 to 35 F below.\nAvoiding the problem is one way to prevent\nwinter injury to your plants. Be sure to buy the hardiest\nplants you can find. When selecting species or varieties,\nnever choose those that aren't suited for your hardiness\nOf course, hardiness zones are based on\naverages, and that can lead to problems because some\nyears are colder than average. That's why it's advisable\nto err on the side of caution when choosing plant varieties\nbased on hardiness claims. If possible, purchase plants\nthat are suited to survive in a hardiness zone colder\nthan yours. If you must put in\"marginally hardy\"\nplantings, try to place them in protected areas, where\nthe winds are reduced by the presence of structures\nor by the topography.\nWinter conditions can cause the death\nof plants in many ways. Their tops or roots may freeze\nor plants may dry out when whipped by persistent winds.\nSometimes, roots are heaved out of the ground by alternate\nfreezing and thawing.\nSunny winter days followed by frigid nights\ncreate rapid temperature variations that really hurt\nplants. Ice storms can cause breakage of stems and limbs.\nMice and deer browsing for food also may cause damage.\nWhat's a grower to do?\nFor many valuable crops, winter protection\nis essential. But protecting crops too early can interfere\nwith the plant's natural ability to adjust for winter\nor \"harden off.\" The first step to take for\nwinter protection is to wait, so that plants are given\nenough time in the late fall to properly harden off.\nDon't apply mulch too early, and don't\napply nitrogen (N) late in the season. Too much available\nN, whether from fertilizers or manure, keeps plants\nsucculent in the autumn and increases susceptibility\nto winter injury.\nMulching plants is a means of stabilizing\nsoil against freezing and thawing. A thick layer of\nweed-free organic residue-like straw is best. Because\nstraw has hollow stems, it is a very good insulator.\nLeaves also can be used, but if they mat\ndown, their insulating value is diminished, and they\nmay smother plants. Mulch should be applied in late\nNovember, after a hard frost or two.\nWhen mulching roses, cut the canes back\nto 18 inches, surround with chicken wire, and cover\nthe whole plant to protect shoots as well as roots.\nLow-growing perennial flowers, strawberries, and the\nlike are easy enough to cover completely, but they may\nrequire re-covering if the winds blow off the mulch.\nFor grape varieties that are not very\nhardy, remove the vines from the trellis and lay them\non the ground before mulching. For upright plants that\ncannot be lowered to the ground, erecting a fence of\nsome kind can protect plants against drying winds. Burlap\nor other material stretched between posts works well.\nSo does snow fence. It breaks the wind somewhat even\nwhen there's no snow, and works really well to protect\nplants when there is snow.\nAntidesiccants are materials that add\na protective coating to plant leaves, helping them to\nretain their moisture. These can be sprayed on leaves\nof some plants to reduce the loss of water in winter.\nIn northern climates, winter injury to\nplants is hard to avoid. With proper precautions, it\ncan be minimized,but be prepared next spring to prune\naway winter-killed canes and limbs and to remove dead\nplants. These can be a source of plant disease if left","Many fruit trees — including semidwarf varieties — can easily grow to 15 feet and taller. Anyone who has tried to manage one of these large trees in a backyard will instantly appreciate the value of small fruit trees: They require less space, are easy to care for, and produce fruit in manageable quantities. Growing compact trees allows you to tuck more varieties of fruit into corners of your property or a small orchard, and means you can choose those varieties by flavor and climate adaptability rather than by tree size. Nearly any standard and semidwarf tree — from pears, peaches and plums to apples and apricots — can be trained to stay much more compact.\nThe pruning treatment outlined in this article will create an appreciably smaller fruit tree than what you’re used to — as small as most dwarf trees (see “Why Not Choose a Dwarf Fruit Tree?”). Here’s the key to this little-known technique: Fruit trees’ reaction to pruning is dependent on the season in which the cuts are made. The trees’ response is determined by whether the tree is actively growing (spring), gathering nutrients (early summer), preparing for dormancy (late summer), or fully dormant (fall and winter). Keep this cycle in mind when wielding your shears.\nPrune Fruit Trees for Small Gardens: The First Cut\nThe first step to growing a small fruit tree is to make a hard heading cut (a cut that removes the growing tip) when planting. While such a cut may seem extreme, your planting job will only be complete when you’ve lopped off the top two-thirds of your new tree. This pruning cut is critical because it will create a low scaffold (the primary limbs that make up the canopy of a tree), and making this cut during dormancy will give the tree strength and resilience, which is especially crucial for heavy stone fruits. Most importantly, it will help keep the canopy of the mature tree within arm’s reach.\nHere’s how to handle the first cut. As winter comes to an end, and the ground is workable for planting, buy a dormant bareroot tree that’s about as big around as your thumb. Plant the tree as soon as possible. Choose a bud at knee-height (about 18 inches from the ground), and make a clean, 45-degree cut that angles away from the bud. Cut close enough to the bud so it can heal cleanly in a natural line, but not so close that you cut into the bud itself. Several buds should remain between the cut and the graft — the knobby place low on the trunk where the scion (the graft that determines fruit variety) meets the rootstock. A knee-high prune is reasonable for almost all fruit trees for small gardens, but peaches and nectarines will sprout more reliably if you cut just above a nurse limb (a branch left to absorb the tree’s spring energy and encourage sprouting). A young tree will probably be a 5- to 6-foot whip at the nursery, so in most cases you’ll remove more than you’ll leave behind. Your beautiful sapling will now be a knee-high stick.\nGranted, this cut sounds harsh. Do it anyway. The compact structure of the tree to come will begin to develop as a consequence. Heading your tree while it’s still dormant will take advantage of nutrients stored in the roots, and vigorous growth and branching will occur in spring, when the plant directs its energy to the remaining buds — the perfect combination of conditions to get a small fruit tree off to a strong start. Your initial cut will awaken the buds below, and they will eventually develop into new limbs, each with a growing tip of its own. The resulting open-center tree will be shorter, stronger, easier to care for, and far more usefully fruitful.\nPrune Fruit Trees for Small Gardens: The First Spring\nAfter the first buds start to break in early spring, examine the spacing of the branches and decide if you like the arrangement of the top buds. If not, simply prune lower to a place where the configuration of leafing buds suits you. This place will eventually become the crotch of the tree. The lower the crotch, the easier it will be to keep the tree small. The earlier in the season you make this cut, the more vigorously new limbs will grow.\nA young tree with a stem thicker than three-quarters of an inch may have a hard time pushing buds. In this case, make the first dormant cut where the caliper (width of the stem) is thumb-sized, then make a second cut lower as soon as buds begin to develop. After the sprouts get going, you can cut the scaffold as low as you prefer.\nRevisit the tree once more in early spring just as sprouts reach 1 or 2 inches long, before woody branches begin to form. Gently pinch off all but one bud where multiple sprouts grow on a single node.\nPrune Fruit Trees for Small Gardens: The First Summer\nIn spring and early summer, deciduous fruit trees aggressively expend their energy reserves as they bloom and leaf out. This is when trees are in the mood to grow, and grow they will, often at an alarming rate.\nBy the time of the solstice in late June, a tree’s resources will have migrated from the roots and trunk to be stored primarily in the foliage. Solstice pruning will remove some of those resources and reduce late season root growth. In other words, summer pruning will slow a tree down, a desirable result for compact fruit trees. While peaches, plums and apricots pruned in fall and winter — the traditional pruning season — can grow as much as 8 feet the following spring, the same pruning cuts made in summer will yield growth of only 1 foot or so. Cuts made while a tree is actively growing will heal quickly, too.\nIn a perfect world, a young tree would have three or four branches evenly spaced around its trunk. In the real world, branches grow anywhere and anyhow they please. The key to pruning is to envision the future: Consider the placement of the fully grown limbs in relation to one another. You may have too many options. You may have an open area with no branching. You may be tempted to let nature take its course, but leaving too many branches will prevent sunlight from penetrating the interior of the tree. Remove competing branches to create space. An ideal branch angles upward at 45 degrees. If you want to keep a vertical branch, consider a heading cut to encourage horizontal growth, or hang weights on the branch to direct its growth downward.\nAfter removing extraneous branches, cut remaining scaffold branches back by at least half (see Photo 5), to a bud that faces the direction you want the branch to grow. In the case of aggressive growers, such as apricot and plum trees, feel free to prune by\ntwo-thirds. Remove any suckers growing from the lowest part of the trunk or the base of the tree.\nThe closer to the summer solstice you prune fruit trees, the greater your size-control effects. By late summer, nutrients collected by the leaves will have already begun to move into the trunk and roots. A tree begins the shift into dormancy as early as July.\nPrune Fruit Trees for Small Gardens: Winter\nWinter will be the best time to make structural and aesthetic decisions because your tree will be bare. The dormant season will also be a good time to remove any limbs that just don’t look quite right — those that are too horizontal, grow into a fence, or branch out over a path. You’ll want to remove what Portland, Oregon, pruner John Iott calls “The Three Ds” — the dead, the diseased and the disoriented. Open up the interior with a few well-considered cuts. Observe the growth pattern of the tree, and prune to enhance its natural grace.\nMake heading cuts in winter only if you want an enthusiastic response — when you’re trying to develop the first low scaffold branches, or when you’re trying to rejuvenate an older tree. Prune heavily in winter only if a tree has stalled, if pruning has been neglected and needs correction, or if you were too timid last time and want to generate some better choices this time around. The tree will outgrow the pruning with the full force of its reserves.\nIn subsequent years, just keep pruning: Make architectural decisions in winter and take height down around the summer solstice. When fruit is about the size of the end of your thumb, thin clusters down to a single fruit. Depending on the variety, you may harvest a few fruits by the third year and a few dozen fruits by the fourth.\nHow should you choose what to keep and what to prune? Ask yourself what seems best, listen to your instincts, and cut something out. The tree will create new choices and you can always make adjustments next season.\nGrowing Small Fruit Trees: The First Year in 4 Basic Steps\n• Prune a dormant, thumb-thick sapling about knee-high, or 18 inches from the ground, when you plant in late winter.\n• After buds begin to break the first spring, choose your scaffold. Pinch off all extraneous buds or prune a little lower to a height where the configuration of leafing buds suits you.\n• Near the summer solstice, prune to slow growth and begin to shape your scaffold. Remove any redundant branches and make heading cuts.\n• In winter, prune to open the interior of the tree and form a well-balanced shape. Remove dead or diseased material.\nWhy Not Choose a Genetic Dwarf Tree?\nGenetic dwarf fruit trees have their short stature bred into their genetic makeup. Genetic dwarfs aren’t grafted; they grow on their own roots. On average, they stay between 6 and 8 feet tall, but are known to be less vigorous and have a shorter lifespan. When a fruit tree is bred for one quality, such as size, then other traits, such as fruit flavor, climate adaptability and overall vitality, become necessarily secondary. By selecting for size, you will miss out on the tastiest varieties.\nSome fruit trees are available grafted on ultra-dwarfing rootstocks. These trees stay quite small, a petite 4 to 6 feet, but because of their extremely small root systems, ultra-dwarfing rootstocks present many of the same problems genetic dwarfs do in terms of short lifespan and overall plant health.\nMost nurseries offer fruit trees grafted onto semidwarfing rootstocks. People seek these out with reasonable expectations of smallish trees, but semidwarf only means “smaller than standard.” If a full-sized fruit tree is 30 feet tall, then a semidwarf might grow to be as tall as 25 feet.\nIf you want a broad variety of choices, opt for a standard or semidwarf variety. The regular and strategic pruning described in this article is the best way to limit the size of a fruit tree.\nThis article was adapted with the permission of Storey Publishing from Grow a Little Fruit Tree by Ann Ralph.

{"question":"I'm developing a new food product and need to understand both the design process and market testing. How does product design in the lab relate to scale-up, and what market testing approaches can validate its success?","answer":"Product design begins with lab-scale development, where variables affecting product qualities are screened and optimized. During scale-up, the product moves from laboratory to pilot plant or production runs to verify quality and quantity requirements. This transition must be carefully timed - rushing from lab to production can result in wasted materials, while excessive lab perfectionism may create processes impossible to duplicate at scale. For market validation, several testing approaches can be used: sales-wave research offering free samples repeatedly to gauge repeat usage, simulated test marketing where 30-40 consumers choose between new and existing products, controlled test marketing in selected stores, and full test markets in representative cities. These tests help determine trial rates, repeat purchases, adoption levels and purchase frequency before full launch.","context":["Product Design and Process Development\n5.3 STEPS IN PRODUCT DESIGN AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT\nCarrying out the design in the five successive steps listed in Figure 5.1 goes some way towards eliminating the mistakes of choosing the wrong design and also making the product on a large scale when very little is known of the processing system.\n5.3.1 'Getting the feel'\nThis is a continuation of the development of the product concept and the product design specifications. The processing methods and conditions outlined in the product design specifications are used to make the early product prototypes, and the technical testing methods are examined for reliability and accuracy in testing both the technical product characteristics and also their relationships to the consumer product characteristics.\nThere is a question of consumer involvement at this stage; some people advocate this strongly because it means that there is control over the design; others say that it is faster and just as accurate to use the knowledge of the designers. The choice of no consumer testing depends on the level of consumer knowledge held by the designer.\nThe basic costing used in the company is also identified so that a simple method of determining costs can be used in the next stages of the product design.\nThe target market was identified in the product concept stage and the consumers are selected to represent this target market(s).\nScreening reduces the wide range of raw material and processing variables to the input variables affecting important product qualities. This hastens the design.\nInitially the variables can be reduced using the previous knowledge of the designer and also published or company information easily available. There can still be a number of floating variables and these are studied in controlled experimentation, not 'ad hoc' try-and-see experimentation. Many experimental designs are available to screen the variables but the most common are partial factorial designs, or Plackett and Burman designs.\nIn a Plackett and Burman design, it is possible to screen N-1 variables with N experiments. The screening experiments identify the important variables and their magnitude levels that affect the product qualities, but they are not statistically accurate and cannot quantify the relationships between the input variables and the product qualities.\nSome food designers have the consumers test many samples in these designs, sometimes for acceptability, but more usefully in product profile tests. Other designers use trained sensory panels.\nAt this stage, the raw materials are being selected, and the quality, availability and costs of those raw materials are studied. There is likely a basic total cost range for the raw materials, but it is important not to select individual materials only on cost at this stage. Higher qualities of raw materials may give a unique property to the product, and also the more expensive materials may not need to be used in the same quantities as the cheaper. Sometimes there are restrictions in the company on the raw materials that are to be used; the buying department can often give some indications without restricting the design.\n5.3.3 Ball-park studies\nIn ball-park studies, the aim is to set the limits of the raw materials and the processing variables which give acceptable product qualities as judged by the consumer. By this stage, the variables are reduced in number and their outside limits are set. They are examined in factorial designs, and for raw materials in mixture designs.\nIn factorial designs each input variable is considered at high and low levels, and the combinations of these high and low levels for all input variables are tested. In a full design all possible combinations are run, therefore for three variables the total number is 23 = 8 experiments.\nIn food formulations, mixture designs are often used because it is impossible to vary one ingredient while holding all the others constant; in mixture designs, the sum of all the ingredients in the formulation must add to 100%. The product designer must always be aware that when they change the content of one ingredient, the proportion of the other ingredients changes, for example reducing the fat content will increase the proportion of other ingredients: carbohydrate, protein or water. With factorial designs and mixture designs, the effects of the various input variables, alone and together, on the product qualities are analysed, and mathematical relationships developed between the input variables and the product qualities. To set up the experimentation and to analyse the results, there is computer software readily available for food product development.\nBoth technical testing and consumer testing of these product prototypes are carried out. The consumers are testing for acceptability and the technical tests are examining the chemical, microbiological, physical and sometimes the sensory properties of the products. Accuracy and reliability are important considerations in this testing, both for studying the effects of the input variables on the product qualities and for developing the quality assurance programme. The total processing costs of these product prototypes are compared to identify the effects of the input variables on the costs, and to check that the costs are within the target cost range.\nHere the aim is to optimise the overall product quality by determining the levels of the input variables which will give the best possible product quality. The problem is that often when optimising one product quality, another product quality is less than optimum. So it is a case of setting the relative importance of product qualities, and for the most important product qualities studying the formulation and processing variables to find the optimum. But the limits that are acceptable across all the product qualities need to be known so that during the optimising experiments none of the other product qualities become unacceptable.\nFor raw material formulations, linear programming can be used to optimise a number of product qualities and costs with the amounts of raw materials in the formulation held between upper and lower levels.\nScale-up (or ramp-up) of both the production and the marketing is the last stage of the product design and process development. The production scale-up is the in-plant test to verify that the product can be made at the quality and quantity required, and the marketing scale-up is a large consumer test to verify that the target consumers will buy the product and what marketing strategy will encourage this buying.\nThe aim of the processing scale-up is to determine the optimum production process for product quality, product yield, process control and costs. If the previous design research has combined the product and the process, this can be achieved without too many problems. But if the process has been ignored, then there can be disastrous problems. For example, if some of the intermediate materials have never been pumped during the design experimentation, then they could break down during scale-up.\nThe scale-up can be either on a pilot plant or short production runs on the main plant. If it is a new process, or there is to be quite extensive experimentation, then the scale-up is conducted on a pilot or small-scale plant. If the process is only an adaptation of the present production, then the scale-up is conducted on the main production plant. The decisions on the type of scale-up are often much influenced by cost; the production trial can cost a great deal if the product cannot be sold and this restricts the use of the production plant until the final stage. But if there is no investment money to build a pilot plant then the production run may be the only scale-up available.\nThe question can often be asked as to when the scale-up from the laboratory bench to the small plant to the production line should be carried out. A great deal of time can be spent perfecting a product in the laboratory, only to find that it is impossible to duplicate this in the plant. If the product is rushed from the laboratory to the production line, then there can be a great deal of raw material and product discarded at a substantial cost.\nKnowledge of the interrelationship of the processing variables and the product qualities can reduce these failures. EVOP (evolutionary operations) are used in optimising the process variables, especially if using the production line in scale-up. EVOP is a way of plant operation that tests small changes in the process variables in a simple factorial design. It continuously changes the process variables until optimum product qualities are reached, but only slowly so that the product can be used for large scale testing or even sold.\nThe marketing scale-up aims to define the market, describe the market strategy to reach this market and predict the possible sales revenues for the product. Possible market channels are studied and the market channel suitable for reaching the target consumers and for the company is chosen. The price range related to the production costs, competitors' pricing and company policy is tested with consumers to see how it affects their buying intentions. Also the final product concept (the product proposition) is built up from the final prototype product, the packaging design and consumer studies. The definitions of the product, price and market channel are used not only to develop the aims and methods for the promotion of the product but are also the basis for planning the marketing mix during product commercialisation.\nThe final prototype product from the production scale-up and the various parts of the marketing strategy are tested in a large-scale consumer test where the consumers test the product in their usual environment and are interviewed about the marketing strategy.\nIn Case Study 5 are some comments on food design for the future from an Italian design journal, to start you thinking about the development of food design. Certainly today there is a need to determine the direction of food design both for food ingredients and consumer products, and also for the fresh products which are being designed on the land and in the water.\nBack to the top","Definition: The Test marketing is a tool used by the companies to check the viability of their new product or a marketing campaign before it is being launched in the market on a large scale.\nThe market test is generally carried out to ascertain the probable market success in terms of new product’s performance, the level of acceptance of the product, customer satisfaction, and the efficiency of the marketing campaign.\nThrough test marketing, a marketer may ascertain the success ratio of the new product and the marketing campaign and can design the marketing mix ( viz. Product, price, place, promotion) very well before its launch.\nThe test marketing of the consumer goods and the industrial goods vary, let’s discuss it one by one.\nConsumer-Goods Market Testing\nThis test is conducted to know the consumer behavior in terms of:\n- Trial: Whether a consumer will try a product, at least once.\n- Repeat: Whether the consumer will repurchase it after the trial.\n- Adoption: Whether the consumer accepts the product and will purchase it again.\n- Purchase Frequency: How often the consumer will buy the product.\nTo ascertain these variables the following test are conducted:\n- Sales-Wave Research: Under this test, the consumer is offered the product, again and again, free of cost. This is done to determine the willingness of the customers to use the product every time it is offered.\n- Simulated Test Marketing: Under this test, 30-40 customers are selected and are invited to the store where they can buy anything. The new products are placed with the old or competitor’s product and then consumer’s preference is ascertained through their selection of the products.\nIn case, the new product is not chosen by them, then the free samples are given to the customers and are inquired telephonically about their product experience after some weeks.\n- Controlled Test Marketing: Under this test, the company select certain stores in different geographic areas and ask them to keep its new product into their stores in return for a fee. The company controls the shelf position, displays, point of purchase promotions and pricing.\n- Test Markets: Under this, the firm chooses the representative cities where the full-fledged launch of the new product is done starting from the promotion campaign to the ultimate sales. Once it is successful, the firm goes for the national launch.\nIndustrial-Goods Market Testing\nThere are two types of market testing:\n- Alpha testing (within the firm)\n- Beta testing (with outside customers)\nAlpha Testing: The alpha testing is done within the firm by test engineers or employees who check the marketing mix of a new product and fix the issues arising in any steps of launch.\nBeta Testing: The Beta Testing is done with the customers where they are asked to use the product and give their feedback on its usage.The other way to test the business goods is to introduce it to the trade shows and observe the reaction of customers to it. Also, these goods can be tested at distributors and dealers showrooms the attention of the customers can be gained."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b32bda0f-c6be-437f-9402-6d15e581c052>","<urn:uuid:e1d65164-9216-4e0f-a9e5-e9b568543c1e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main challenges faced by African artists in gaining international exposure, and what barriers exist for food security in urban African American communities?","answer":"African artists face challenges in international exposure as less than 0.1% of the international art market was represented by African artists as of 2016, with only a handful of artists like El Anatsui and William Kentridge receiving recognition, most of whom live outside Africa. For food security in urban African American communities, significant barriers include lack of transportation, absence of major supermarkets, and high poverty rates - as exemplified in Camden where residents spend nearly half of their $27,000 median household income on housing. The city's only major supermarket closed in 2021, forcing residents to rely on small businesses with higher prices and fewer healthy options.","context":["Nigerian Contemporary Art Takes On The World With Hannah O’Leary\nArt, in Nigeria, is experiencing a rebirth. Once restricted to underfunded departments on university campuses and overly dedicated starving artists, our artists and their work are gradually staking a claim for their fair portion of Nigerian contemporary culture. Institutions like Nike Arts Gallery – founded by the iconic Nike Davies-Okundaye and home to over 8,000 distinct works of Nigerian art – and Rele Gallery – founded by Adenrele Sonariwo – have established themselves as firm components of Nigeria’s cultural scene. Art X, West Africa’s first international art fair is also consolidating its status as the most prominent. Local artists, such as Victor Ehihkamenor and Peju Alatise, who have gained international acclaim are giving back to the culture, contributing artistic learning spaces like Angels and Muses and ANAI Foundation respectively. And away from the limelight, a growing number of younger Nigerians are beginning to view art as a viable career path.\nAs our art slowly infiltrates mainstream culture, the world is beginning to pay attention. Last year, the first Nigerian pavilion was presented at the 57th Venice Biennale in Italy, earning critical acclaim. At Sotheby’s – the world’s oldest, largest and arguably most prestigious auction house – the inaugural sale of Modern and Contemporary African Art was held in May 2017. With over a 100 unique pieces by 63 artists from 14 countries on display and 29 participating bidders, the sales generated about £2.8 million, achieving a sell-through rate of 78% by value. Out of the 63 artists on display, record sales were set for 16 of them. Critical to this success is Hannah O’Leary, an evangelist of African culture and Director and Head of Modern and Contemporary African art at Sotheby’s, who set up and has run the auction house’s department dedicated to promoting art from Africa and the Diaspora since 2016. On her work, Hannah has commented, “We are seeing a monumental shift in the art market towards greater diversity and a surge in interest in contemporary art from Africa, and of course Nigeria is leading the way. Our African auctions see bidding from every corner of the globe, and we are proud to promote the very best Nigerian art to an international audience.”\nCritics have argued that the apparent boom in African contemporary art, highlighted by the growing attention being paid by prestigious houses and record sales, is hardly representative of the general landscape, as only a very few African artists are at its forefront. Others have counterargued that these very few are a starting point, heralding a renaissance of some sort. Both sides of the divide are united in the opinion that there is irrefutable progress. In conversation with Hannah O’Leary, I discuss this progress and Sotheby’s positioning as arbiters of taste in contemporary African art.\nStarting off on a personal note, you have over a decade’s experience developing the African contemporary art scene, making huge contributions to the field at Bonham’s before crossing over to Sotheby’s. How did your interest in African contemporary art originate and what personal accomplishments in this field have brought you most fulfilment over the years?\nMy interest in African art developed alongside my career. I worked for Sotheby’s in Australia with modern and contemporary Australian art in the early 2000s, and so I was interested in international art and regional markets since the beginning of my career. When I moved to London in 2006 my job at Bonhams included researching art from every corner of the world. It became apparent quickly that Africa had a rich modern art history that was not yet appreciated by the international art market. Up until that point, the market for traditional African art was strong, but African art from the 20th and 21st centuries was simply not represented. In 2006 we sold a self-portrait by Gerard Sekoto, one of the fathers of modern South African art, for £120,000. That kick-started the introduction of the South African sales in 2007, which were extremely successful from the beginning, followed by auctions of modern and contemporary art from across the African continent in 2009. I love my job and find it enormously rewarding to promote the art of a whole continent to the international art world. I have many personal highlights including the successful foundation of these auctions, both at Bonhams and now at Sotheby’s – as one of the largest and best-respected names in the art world, our entry into the market was a real game-changer – and setting many new world record prices for important artists from the continent over the past decade, including Ben Enwonwu, Yusuf Grillo, Yinka Shonibare, El Anatsui, and Njideka Akunyili Crosby.\nAs you have already alluded to, the contemporary art scene is constantly growing and this expansion – in demand and categories demanded – is creating opportunities for art sourced from regions that have been largely out of the mainstream, such as Africa. An example of the extent of this demand is Ben Enwonwu’s painting, ‘Africa Dances,’ which was recently sold by Sotheby’s for $264,568 USD, a figure almost ten times its pre-sale estimate. At Sotheby’s, what does the process – of sourcing art from places such as Nigeria to supply this unique demand – entail?\nSotheby’s has an extremely well-respected reputation in the art world, which we work hard at to maintain; we offer the best expertise, excellent customer service, a wide network of offices and representatives internationally, and a holistic view of the business of art, including everything from appraisals, to shipping services, to tax and heritage advice, and scientific authentication services. Combined, this gives us an edge over all our competition and ultimately results in the best prices for our clients. This means that people often come to us with potential consignments and Nigeria has been no different, and I have been delighted at the enthusiastic response to our entry into this market. We work closely with consultants and logistics companies to ensure consignment from Nigeria is straightforward for our clients. However, the painting you refer to by Ben Enwonwu did not come to us from Nigeria. One of the most exciting aspects of this market is that there are masterpieces by modern African artists in homes worldwide that have yet to be discovered. That painting came from a gentleman in Europe who had inherited the painting and did not know what it was, or indeed its value potential value, until he contacted us.\nIn May, Sotheby’s also set the new world record for Nigerian artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby with ‘Bush Babies,’ 2017, which sold for $3,375,000 USD, making her the most valuable Nigerian artist of all time. You have also mentioned Sotheby’s success with other contemporary Nigerian artists like Yinka Shonibare, Toyin Ojih Odutola and Abiodun Olaku. Are there currently any other Nigerian artists you are excited about?\nThere are many! Of course, there are many factors we consider before including an artist in our auctions, and the artists sold at Sotheby’s are already well-known internationally and have an existing following among both collectors and museums. However, of course, I also keep an eye on younger emerging artists, especially when I visit art fairs such as 1-54 in London and New York and Art X Lagos. Some of my favourites yet to appear at a major auction house include Odili Donald Odita, Victor Ehihkamenor, Modupeola Fadugba, and Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze.\nSotheby’s landmark sales, despite being positive indicators of growth, highlights the concern that a larger amount of collecting is done by people from outside the continent. This is a concern because the sustainable development of art infrastructure is highly dependent on local collecting to sustain artists at the grassroots who do not have immediate access to institutions such as Sotheby’s. How, in your opinion, could local collecting be encouraged at the grassroot level?\nI think the local market here in Nigeria is extremely important. I always describe the art world as an ecosystem. There are many players who build an artist’s reputation, including art schools, commercial galleries, museum curators, collectors, critics, writers and, finally, the auction houses. I could not do what I do in London, promoting Nigerian art to the world, without being able to point to a thriving market in Nigeria itself. Of course, the market here is already thriving and we can credit initiatives such as the many commercial contemporary art galleries, Arthouse Contemporary, and Art X Lagos in helping to advance the local market. Beyond this, I would like to see more museums and education initiatives, more public engagement with the arts and government support.\nSpeaking of education initiatives, Bruce Onobrakpeya, yet another Nigerian who has been featured by Sotheby’s, started out as a high school art teacher in prestigious schools such as St. Greg’s, Lagos and amongst his students have been ministers, governors and captains of industries. I understand there’s a high and competitive demand for his work amongst his former students till this day simply because of the role he has in their personal histories. Given that the value of art can occasionally be attributed to instances such as this where there is a keen understanding of the history of the artist and context of the art, do you think there is potential for Africa as a competitive buyer’s market for African art?\nI think Bruce Onobrakpeya is a genius, a true master of the arts, and that is why his work is so highly collectable. But also I agree that it is Nigerians who should dictate who the most important Nigerian artists are, as part of a national art historical discourse. Nigerian collectors are hugely important to the market and to Sotheby’s. In fact, from our first auction in this field, over 30% of our collectors for African art have been from the African continent, and this is a percentage we would like to increase going forward. Sotheby’s has been at the forefront of regional markets over the years, from Latin America to Asia to the Middle East and now Africa. Buyers from Asia and the Middle East are now among our most important collectors across the board, from impressionist art to jewellery and watches contemporary art. I don’t see why Africa should be any different in the next 10 to 20 years.\nWhile it is important to abstain from confining artists to their geography, the success of African artists working on and finding international success from the continent serves as a lighthouse of aspiration to local artists. An example of such inspirational artists is Enugu based Ghanaian, El Anatsui who’s work – Paths to the Okro Farm – sold for $1.45 million at Sotheby’s New York. In your opinion, how critical is local representation to the development of art in Africa?\nWhen I joined Sotheby’s in 2016, less than 0.1% of the international art market was represented by African artists. The African artists who were included in international contemporary art auctions could be listed on my fingertips. They include El Anatsui, Marlene Dumas, William Kentridge, Wangechi Mutu and Julie Mehretu – most of whom live and work outside the African continent. By offering expertise and standalone sales dedicated to art from the African continent, Sotheby’s is addressing that imbalance. We are currently seeing more diversity in our international contemporary art auctions as seen by the record prices set for African American artists and artists of the African Diaspora in our most recent New York sales. However, artists living on the African continent are still under-represented in the international art market and that is why we hold dedicated African contemporary art auctions, in order to provide a platform and ultimately increase the number of artists from Africa who are represented in our international auctions.\nI’m glad you mentioned your dedicated auctions, Sotheby’s next sale of Modern and Contemporary African art is in October 2018. What are your expectations for it? And what is your advice for getting involved, either at the buying or selling end?\nYes, this year we have doubled the number of African contemporary art auctions at Sotheby’s, which is indicative of the success we have seen in this field. We will continue to offer a curated auction of the best art the continent has to offer. We encourage all those interested in being involved to get in touch and can find full contact details for me and my colleagues on our website: http://www.sothebys.com/en/departments/african-modern-contemporary-art.html\nThose interested in selling artworks should email us images and details of those pieces for a free and confidential auction appraisal. For those interested in bidding, the sale catalogue will be available online approximately one month before the auction, and we hope to see as many people as possible for the public exhibition in London, which opens three days before the auction. Of course, people can bid in the auction in many ways, including online and on the telephone as well as in person. Registrations can be made online or people should contact me for more information.\nUnfortunately, the art scene has earned infamy for being a medium for money laundering and corruption – the global phenomena with many Nigerian friends. What is being done to stem these ethical concerns especially in new markets?\nThis is an issue that Sotheby’s takes very seriously, and we have large compliance departments in our main offices in New York and London, and we screen all new clients and also the artworks which we sell for any issues well in advance of the auction. Buyers can rest assured that works sold at Sotheby’s are both authentic and have a full legal title.\nSotheby’s has been around for nearly three centuries and through history has often been the confluence at which African art and the western world interacts. Also central to the mutual history of African art and the western world is the appropriation of historic Nigerian artefacts by Britain during the colonial era. Do you think there is a case for the repatriation of such historical art to their places of origin for the preservation of culture?\nThis is an interesting issue, and we fully investigate the provenance of all works sold at Sotheby’s and comply with all legal requirements regarding import and export. Of course, we would love to see more of these heritage objects available for public consumption in world-class museums in Africa.\nFair enough. To finish – as we started – on a personal note, art as we know it is a subset of culture. Are there any other interesting elements of Nigerian culture you are looking forward to exploring during your trip?\nI always enjoy my visits to Lagos, I am welcomed as if I am coming home! I am lucky to have many old and new friends in the city, so a trip here never feels like it is only business. Lagos is a city that changes constantly, there is always something and somewhere new to explore including art galleries, of course, but I also love to visit artists in their studios, check out the local music and theatre scenes, and the wonderful bars and restaurants of course! My only regret is that my visit is always too short, I always promised myself that next time I will stay for longer and see more of the country.","This article is part of Black Food Sovereignty: Stories from the Field, a series co-produced by Frontline Solutions and NPQ. This series features stories from a group of Black food sovereignty leaders who are working to transform the food system at the local level. It explores how these leaders are addressing critical issues at the intersection of food sovereignty, racial and economic justice, and community.\nHow can a community reduce food insecurity? For over 30 years, the Camden Dream Center, which I direct, has addressed food insecurity through a food pantry, which works in in partnership with the Food Bank of South Jersey to serve well over 1,000 families per year in Camden and its vicinity.\nFood pantry work is important. But the Center aspires to do more—to advance economic empowerment in an environmentally sustainable way. One strategy for achieving that vision is to support urban agriculture and community agency, giving people the chance to produce their own food.\nAdvancing urban agriculture in Camden\nHow do you move from dependency on charitable food to cultivating your own food? It’s not easy, the process requires a drastic shift in mindset among those involved. In particular, increasing Black youth involvement in farming requires that we first erase the connotation that farming has for many Black youth of slavery and sharecropping.\nAnd we must do so while addressing both the historical legacy and contemporary reality of racism. It is not enough to fund the problem. Dismantling barriers to food access requires clear strategies and methodologies that inform funding, drive policy, and guide community-based initiatives. While the answers remain complicated, we must use our collective power and community agency to address our needs.\nA Camden community vision emerges\nCensus figures confirm that Camden is a poor city (with a poverty rate of 33.6 percent) and overwhelming BIPOC (50.5 percent Latinx, 42.5 percent Black). What the numbers do not show, however, is that Camden is a city full of problem solvers and residents who are eager to improve their city as well as their living conditions.\nCamden is also home to young people who regularly show incredible power and strength. However, persistent poverty plagues the city’s residents. Low wages and/or benefits are insufficient to meet high costs of living; the average Camden resident spends nearly half of their $27,000 median household income on housing. Divided by multiple highways, Camden, a hyper-local city whose many residents largely stay within its border, lost its only major supermarket in 2021, and lack of transportation impedes residents from accessing healthy food, as well as social support resources. Residents purchase food at local small businesses, where prices are higher than at larger grocery stores and healthy food options fewer. Though robust, the city’s network of supplemental food distributors can be complex and time-consuming for residents to navigate, limiting access to healthy foods.\nAs in other cities, in Camden, dedicated community-based organizations are working to close these gaps through nutrition education, food assistance programs, and social services. For example, the Food Justice Innovation Hub, which the Center is developing in partnership with community groups, aims to develop the local food system infrastructure necessary for sustained food security.\nThe centerpiece of the Center’s strategy, backed by a grant from Feeding America, involves developing a vertical hydroponic farming facility, which will help feed residents while increasing intergenerational knowledge of sustainable farming practices. The hydroponic controlled environment agriculture (CEA) project is based on an IoT (Internet of Things) platform with sensors that allow for careful monitoring of growing conditions. The facility is designed to increase participation of underrepresented students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), Computer Science (CS), and Agricultural Science (AS). Participating students learn about controlled environment agricultural management and the underlying technologies—eg, sensors, data collection, and data analytics—and the operations and maintenance of an indoor hydroponic farm. The figure below describes the innovative hub and its components.\nPutting the Food Hub Together\nTo achieve the food justice vision depicted in the diagram, all stakeholders must work together to develop strategic alliances and comprehensive strategies that support common goals, drive real change, and create equity. Harnessing the power of marginalized communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses our communities’ complex needs. This involves work in the following four areas:\n- Transforming local food systems demands moving from a dependent charitable food pantry model to a sustainable local food system. This includes: a) developing a distribution process for farm yield; b) establishing neighborhood co-location of multiple services for food delivery; c) leveraging the value of federal SNAP (Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, also known as food stamps) and WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants & Children) benefits; and d) expanding agribusiness opportunities for residents and local businesses.\n- Agriculture Science and STEM Education requires working closely with school districts, colleges, and universities to expand educational opportunities and career pathways to support a sustainable local food system. Training scholars using recognized national certifications and curricula focused on hydroponic systems technology, urban agriculture, natural sciences, and farming management will create a workforce for in-demand agricultural occupations that pay livable wages.\n- A vertical farming (VF) solution for urban areas is not only sustainable and scalable; it can outproduce a traditional farm of like size in a similar climate. One 40-foot vertical farm can grow 365 days/year and produce annual yields equivalent to those produced on up to four acres. VF enables large-scale agricultural production in environments where space and soil are limited. Hydroponic VF solutions use no soil and as much as 90 percent less water than traditional farming. A hydroponic VF solution will grow fresh produce year-round without pesticides or herbicides, improving the quality of food available to families, seniors, and others seeking to control what they eat.\n- Sustainable development for food security warrants local and national metrics that demonstrate reductions in disparities for marginalized communities, such as those utilized by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s), which strive to end poverty and hunger by 2030. The report, Never More Urgent, reveals that the greatest disparities facing Black and Brown people in the United States are in five main areas: justice, food and housing security, education, economic security, and health. A related report, In the Red: The US Failure to Deliver on a Promise of Racial Equality, indicates that white communities are receiving sustainable development education, resources, and opportunities at three times the rate of communities of color, leaving us behind. The Food Justice Hub is designed to ensure that culturally relevant approaches engage our communities in sustainable development.\nBeyond the four areas outlined above, addressing social determinants of health—which include poverty, hunger, quality education, health, and wellbeing—is key to the Camden Food Hub initiative. To do so, the Center’s partners at the Food Bank of South Jersey and the Camden Coalition have engaged a broad set of stakeholders, including community residents, health systems, industry, schools, and public agencies.\nThese meetings are needed to develop the wrap-around and comprehensive services necessary to help people navigate disjointed systems. Such services include economic development, critical thinking skills and decision making, veterans and reentry services, mentoring, leadership development, early childhood development, and addiction recovery.\nThis work also requires partnerships with federal, state, and local agencies, including the US Department of Labor (DOL), state departments of labor, education, and agriculture, chambers of commerce, and others. Longstanding relationships with school districts, colleges, and universities are also critical to advance equity at the neighborhood level.\nThose of us who lead predominately Black and Brown organizations know injustice and inequity. However, we often lack resources and tools to effectively measure our impact in dismantling those injustices.\nTo better address racial disparity and develop our food justice model, the Center has researched not only racial equity models, but current “DEI” (diversity, equity, and inclusion) approaches. Unfortunately, such approaches rarely speak to specific neighborhood needs. Instead, most DEI efforts are led by human resource professionals with limited understanding of communities like Camden.\nEarlier this year, famed community development scholar John McKnight recalled that when he started studying urban issues in the late 1960s, many urban studies scholars were “looking at neighborhoods and especially lower income neighborhoods in terms of their problems, deficits, needs, and brokenness…their deficit approach did not see that the people who lived in the neighborhood had some agency, some ability, some capacity, because all of their work was to help institutions come in and fix us. And I just thought that was insulting.” It would be nice to say that such an analysis is no longer applicable, but we know better than that.\nThis raises an important point—namely, this is not just a story about Camden. We are part of a broader national movement for food justice, urban agriculture, and sustainable development. And we are seeking to develop a new paradigm of economic development—one that centers community agency, production, and self-sufficiency, rather than promoting a model that centers dependency and begging philanthropy for crumbs.\nIn short, communities must be able to tell their own stories. We must set goals and strategies that increase equity, reduce structural barriers, and strengthen belonging and identity. We must self-organize to move the needle, meet critical community needs, and exercise our collective power.\nLike many organizations, our Center sees this work as a calling. We believe it is our life’s purpose and passion to serve others as equal partners and co-producers of change. This requires approaching our work with cultural humility and servant leadership, as we move from dependency to agency."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:257796f1-52c5-4f52-a3ac-f4b5ba808390>","<urn:uuid:f4e04889-a64f-435f-a60c-5234383fe748>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission ensure that First Peoples maintain control over their testimonies and knowledge?","answer":"The Yoo-rrook Justice Commission upholds Indigenous data sovereignty principles, which give First Peoples the right to own, control, access, and possess their respective data. This means that First Peoples who provide evidence maintain ownership of their information and can determine how it is treated regarding confidentiality and accessibility. This differs from past royal commissions where evidence was typically made available to the public, which wasn't always in First Peoples' best interest.","context":["Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) – By Maggie Walter, Commissioner, Yoo-rrook Justice Commission, University of Tasmania\nThere can be no Treaty without truth.\nThis simple but powerful statement is the reason for the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission’s mandate to reveal, record and analyse the systemic injustices experienced by Victorian First Peoples since colonisation.\nNamed from a Wamba Wamba word meaning truth, the Yoo-rrook mandate will take three years from 2021-24. This is a significant step for truth-telling in Victoria.\nTruth-telling commissions are formal bodies tasked with discovering and revealing past wrongdoings in the hope of resolving conflict and repairing relationships.\nYoo-rrook’s strategic vision is for a transformed Victoria. A Victoria based on truth and justice, grounded in First Peoples’ enduring spirit, cultures and self-determination.\nAs any other royal commission, Yoo-rrook will have broad powers to hold public hearings, compel evidence and make recommendations to the Victorian government as to what should change.\nThe commission’s letters patent is the legal document from the governor-general setting up the Yoo-rrok’s royal commission. This document essentially gives instructions to Yoo-rrook about how to inquire into the experience of past and present systemic injustices for Victorian First Peoples.\nThe letters patent details a wide-ranging set of obligations that can be summarised as:\nestablishing an official record of the impact of systemic injustice on the First Peoples of Victoria from colonisation to the present\ndeveloping a shared understand among all Victorians on the impact of these systemic injustices, as well as the diversity, strength and resilience of First Peoples\ndetermining the causes and consequences of systemic injustice and make recommendations for system reform and changes to laws, policy and education.\nThe commission’s findings also aim to support the founding of a new relationship between First Peoples, the state, and the people of Victoria, inclusive of informing Treaty negotiations.\nEstablishment of the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission\nAn historical first for Australia, a truth-telling commission was an agreed action of the Victorian government and the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria.\nThe First Peoples’ Assembly was established in 2019 and is the elected representative body of Traditional Owners and other Victorian Aboriginal people.\nThis is a crucial step in the realisation of the Advancing the Treaty Process with Aboriginal Victorians Act 2018.\nYoo-rrook began in May with the appointment of five commissioners. Independently selected from 64 applicants, we are:\n- Chairperson: Professor Eleanor Bourke (Wergaia/Wamba Wamba)\n- Dr Wayne Atkinson (Yorta Yorta/Dja Dja Wurrung)\n- Sue-Anne Hunter (Wurundjeri/Ngurai illum wurrung)\n- Distinguished Professor Maggie Walter (Palawa)\n- Professor the Honourable Kevin Bell AM QC (non-Indigenous)\nYoo-rrook employs a human rights framework aligned to the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. To ensure the priority of First Peoples’ voices and knowledge, this framework is enacted through a methodology that weaves together First Peoples knowledge systems, worldviews and Western methods of scientific analysis. This methodology ensures an approach that respects Victorian First Peoples values and culture.\nThe commission’s terms of reference are extensive.\nThe instructions to inquire into historical systemic injustices perpetrated against First Peoples include (among other areas):\ncultural violations, such as denial of First Peoples’ law and lore by colonial state authorities and systems\ntheft and misappropriation of land and culture\ndispossession and displacement of Aboriginal peoples, families and children\nmassacres, wars and killings\nunfair policies and practices in areas such as labour, the justice system, child protection and welfare, and health care\nThe findings of the royal commission’s inquiry into these areas will be the basis for the official record, and more details will come.\nPriority #1: Sovereignty over knowledge\nYoo-rrook is the first Aboriginal-led royal commission. It is also the first in which the foundational evidence is First Peoples voices, stories and knowledges. The commission has now determined four strategic priorities for its first year.\nTo maximise participation, Yoo-rrook’s first strategic priority has been to build strong foundations to bring about trust that First Peoples’ voices will be heard, and the commission’s processes are conducted in a culturally appropriate way.\nDespite the COVID-19 lockdowns of the last six months, the commissioners and commission staff have consulted (mostly online) with Traditional Owner groups and many Aboriginal community-controlled organisations across Victoria.\nYoo-rrook is instructed to uphold the sovereignty of First Peoples over their knowledge and stories. This will be done through the Indigenous data sovereignty principles, which is the right of First Peoples to own, control, access and possess their respective data.\nThis means the First Peoples who provide evidence to Yoo-rrook will maintain ownership of their respective data, determining how their information is treated with regards to confidentiality and accessibility.\nThis is significant because with past royal commissions, evidence has been available to the public. This is not always in First Peoples’ best interest.\nPriority #2: Culturally appropriate ways of collecting evidence\nYoo-rrook’s second strategic priority is to focus on formal evidence collection from Elders and those who are unwell.\nThe commission is acutely aware of First Peoples unease toward formal processes such as these. So, culturally safe systems have been developed.\nFor example, the commission is accepting evidence in relation to the experience of historic and ongoing systemic injustice in a myriad of ways. These include individual witness statements, group testimony and testimony through cultural means, such as ceremony, dance and art. Evidence can also be given confidentially and on Country, with ongoing support for social and emotional wellbeing in place.\nPriority #3: Creating a public record of systemic injustice\nThe third strategic priority is to develop a comprehensive picture of systemic injustices against First Peoples as part of the official record of what happened in Victoria.\nThis will be done via the compilation and interrogation of existing knowledge sources. This work has begun with the collection of official records, academic studies and legislative materials.\nPriority #4: Reviewing the criminal justice system\nThe fourth priority is to review current reform processes in criminal justice and law enforcement.\nThis will begin with First Peoples’ experiences with these systems and an examination of the implementation of Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody’s recommendations in Victoria.\nSetting a global precedent\nThe task of the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission is intimidating and the timeframe is short. Yoo-rrook is required to deliver an interim report in June 2022 and a final report in June 2024.\nIt is the only truth-telling commission anywhere authorised to scrutinise First Peoples’ experiences of systemic injustices, past and present, arising from colonisation.\nThat Yoo-rrook has been initiated in Victoria should be a matter of pride for all Victorians. The commission is setting a national and global precedent. Because Yoo-rrook is the first, it assuredly will not be the last.\nThe world is watching.\nIf you are interested in reaching out to the commission, you can do so here.\nMaggie Walter is a Commissioner with the Yoo-rrook Justice Commission and also Distinguished Professor of Sociology (adjunct) University of Tasmania and receives funding from the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Minderoo Foundation\nProfessor the Hon Kevin Bell AM QC is also the Executive Director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law in the Faculty of Law at Monash University.\nEleanor Bourke, Sue-Anne Hunter, and Wayne Atkinson do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n– ref.

{"question":"What is the key difference between how cats and children acquire tick-transmitted diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever?","answer":"There is a notable difference in transmission methods. In cats, tick-borne diseases are primarily transmitted through direct tick bites, or in some cases, by eating infected ticks. In children, Rocky Mountain spotted fever is specifically transmitted only through tick bites from infected ticks like the American dog tick, Rocky Mountain wood tick, or brown dog tick - it cannot be transmitted from person to person or through ingestion of ticks.","context":["What is Parasitic Blood Infection?\nThe types of parasites that infect your cat may also come in a wide variety, from single-celled protozoa to more complicated bacteria forms. While there are varying methods of infection, the majority of these parasitic blood infections are transmitted through ticks and fleas. To prevent these conditions, you should always work with your vet to develop an effective flea and tick control regimen for your pet.\nParasitic blood infections in cats include a variety of diseases in which parasitic organisms will invade your cat’s blood system. These diseases range in origin and severity. Some lead to mild sickness while others may cause severe anemia or even death.\nSymptoms of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats\nExact symptoms of parasitic blood infection will vary, depending on which of the various types of infection your cat has contracted. Most of these, however, will have certain common characteristics that you should watch for.\n- Loss of appetite\n- Weight loss\n- Pale gums\n- Urinary tract infections\n- Enlarged Spleen\n- Difficulty breathing\nThere are a variety of parasitic blood infections capable of infecting your cat. Below is a short list of the most common specific conditions and their parasitic cause:\nCaused by a parasite by the same name, this disease occurs naturally in wild cats in North America and is spread to domestic cats via tick bite.\nFeline Infectious Anemia\nAlso called hemobartonellosis, this is one of the most common parasitic blood infections in cats. Infection is caused by a type of bacteria that enters the bloodstream via blood-sucking insects such as fleas and ticks, and can also be transmitted via scratches or fighting.\nA tick-borne disease that is transmitted by the brown dog tick. The tick becomes infected when feeding on an infected host, but cats can only acquire the disease by eating the tick, not by being bitten.\nCaused by an infection by trypanosomes, biting insects can transmit this disease between wild animals and domestic cats. This condition can also be transmitted to humans from their pets.\nCauses of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats\nWhile the majority of parasitic blood infections in cats are spread by biting insects, there are a variety of other ways these conditions can be transmitted. Wild cats, or cats allowed to interact with wild or feral cats, may be especially at risk. Common causes include:\n- Spread of parasite through tick or flea bites\n- Spread of blood through mating\n- Spread of blood through fighting with other cats\n- Spread from infected mother to kittens\n- Blood transfusion\nDiagnosis of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats\nDiagnosis of parasitic blood infection in your cat will begin with a thorough physical examination by your vet and a review of your cat’s medical and symptomatic history. You should provide detailed information about your cat’s diet, whether it is an indoor or outdoor cat, and whether it has recently come into contact with any other wild or domesticated animals. You should also discuss whether or not your cat is on any flea and tick control regimen, as this could potentially help narrow down the organism causing the parasitic blood infection.\nYour vet will thoroughly examine your cat’s gums to determine whether there are any signs of anemia. They will also inspect your cat’s coat to look for fleas, ticks, or any evidence of recent bites, scratches or fighting. The most definitive diagnostic tool will be a complete blood panel and a blood slide. In this test a small sample of your cat’s blood is withdrawn through a quick and painless needle stick. A drop is then placed on a slide and examined under a microscope for the presence of any abnormal cells. The shape and size of these objects will tell your veterinarian or laboratory just which of the numerous possible parasites are infecting your cat.\nTreatment of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats\nTreatment of parasitic blood infection in your cat will be two-fold. First, your veterinarian will stabilize your cat and deal with immediate life-threatening symptoms. This may include intravenous fluids, medicated baths to eliminate any fleas or ticks and, in some severe cases, blood infusion to counteract severe anemia.\nThe next step will be addressing the parasite, and treatment will depend on the exact organism that is identified in the diagnostic tests. It will be important for your veterinarian to identify the exact type of parasitic infection, since the medication of choice will vary greatly from parasite to parasite. In the case of most bacteria, antibiotics will be the preferred course of treatment. Anti-protozoal drugs will be used to treat parasitic infections of that nature.\nRecovery of Parasitic Blood Infection in Cats\nPrognosis for full recovery in most cases of parasitic blood infections is good. It will be especially important to follow veterinarian instructions and administer the full course of medication as many of these parasites may return if not fully eradicated. Once eliminated from your cat’s system, there are typically no long term side effects. You should also work with your veterinarian to develop an appropriate flea and tick control program, as this will greatly reduce the possibility of most parasitic blood infections that are caused by biting insects.","Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) in Children\nWhat is Rocky Mountain spotted fever?\nRocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a bacterial infection spread by the bite of\nan infected tick. It usually occurs from April until September, but it can occur anytime\nduring the year where weather is warm. The mid-Atlantic and southeastern states are\nmost affected. The disease is spread to humans through a bite from an infected tick;\nit is not spread from one person to another.\nIn the U.S., the American dog tick, the Rocky Mountain wood tick, and the brown dog\ntick, have been identified as the ticks that transmit the RMSF bacteria.\nWhat are the symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever?\nThese are the most common symptoms of RMSF:\nRMSF is a serious illness that should be treated as soon as possible. Death has occurred\nin untreated cases of RMSF.\nThe symptoms of RMSF may look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see\nyour child's healthcare provider for a diagnosis.\nHow is RMSF diagnosed?\nYour healthcare provider can diagnose Rocky Mountain spotted fever based on your symptoms\nand history of a tick bite. The appearance and characteristics of the rash are important,\nif your child gets one. Skin biopsy samples and lab tests are usually done to rule\nout other conditions and confirm the diagnosis.\nWhat is the treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever?\nTreatment may include antibiotics and treating the symptoms. Doxycycline is the antibiotic\nof choice, and it will be continued for several days after the fever goes away. Doxycycline\nis in the tetracycline drug family, and these drugs are usually not given to children\nunder the age of 8 because of the risk of staining the permanent teeth. However, in\nthe case of suspected RMSF, it is more important to treat the illness.\nHow can Rocky Mountain spotted fever be prevented?\nOnce a child has RMSF, he or she cannot be reinfected. Some general guidelines for\npreventing RMSF include the following:\nSince ticks cannot bite through clothing; dress your child and family in:\nLight-colored clothing so that ticks can be easily seen\nLong-sleeved shirts tucked into pants\nSocks and closed-toe shoes\nLong pants with legs tucked into socks\nCheck your family often for ticks, including:\nAll parts of the body that bend: behind the knees, between fingers and toes, underarms,\nOther areas where ticks are commonly found: belly button, in and behind the ears,\nneck, hairline, and top of the head\nAreas of pressure points, including:\nWhere underwear elastic touches the skin\nWhere bands from pants or skirts touch the skin\nAnywhere else where clothing presses on the skin\nAll other areas of the body and hair, and run fingers gently over skin. Run a fine-toothed\ncomb through your child's hair to check for ticks.\nOther helpful measures include:\nWhen possible, walk on cleared paths and pavement through wooded areas and fields.\nShower after all outdoor activities are over for the day. It may take up to 4 to 6\nhours for ticks to attach firmly to skin. Showering may help remove any loose ticks.\nUse insect repellents safely:\nProducts that contain DEET are tick repellents, but may not kill the tick and are\nnot 100% effective. Use a children's insect repellent (20% to 30% DEET). The current recommendations\nfrom the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC for children older than 2 months\nof age are to use 10% to 30% DEET. Products that contain DEET should not be used on\ninfants less than 2 months of age. Do not apply insect repellants around your child's\nmouth, nose, or eyes, or over cuts or open sores.\nTreat clothing with small amounts of a product that contains permethrin, which is\nknown to kill ticks on contact. Do not use permethrin on the skin.\nCheck pets for ticks and treat as needed."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d8675e58-1d42-456e-b0b8-e5f0bed02689>","<urn:uuid:1f9f4890-481a-4419-954f-bd2e136a65a3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello, what's the recommended first-line treatment approach for managing VT storm?","answer":"The first-line treatment approach for VT storm typically includes intubation, sedation, and administration of amiodarone. Intubation is generally required as patients may lose airway control during VT/VF episodes, and sedation itself is therapeutic. For amiodarone, the usual regimen is a 300 mg bolus, followed by 1 mg/min for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min. Additional boluses can be given for recurrence, up to a total of about 1,200 mg in boluses, but the total dose should not exceed 2.2 grams within 24 hours. Deep sedation, particularly with propofol, can help break VT storm.","context":["- Common causes\n- Questions & discussion\n- PDF of this chapter (or create customized PDF)\nwhat is VT/VF storm (a.k.a. “electrical storm”)?\n- Generally defined as three or more episodes of VF or sustained VT within 24 hours.\n- Patients can be shocked out of VT/VF reasonably easily, but then they keep flipping back into to VT/VF (this differentiates VT storm from refractory VT wherein the patient is continually in VT/VF and never goes back to sinus rhythm).\n- If a patient is shocked out of VT/VF and then has a recurrence very soon thereafter, this is a harbinger of VT/VF storm (and might be considered storm by some).\n- Presentation typically dramatic:\n- (a) If patient has an ICD (implanted cardiac defibrillator), this may present with recurrent ICD firing.\n- (b) If patient doesn't have an ICD, this may cause recurrent symptoms. Depending on the heart rate and cardiac function, symptoms may range from palpitations to recurrent cardiac arrest.\n- The problem with VT storm isn't generally breaking any individual episode of VT. Rather, the problem is often that the VT keeps on coming back – so it's difficult to keep patients out of VT for a prolonged period of time.\ntorsade vs. non-torsade storm\n- Torsade de pointes (TdP) is defined by the combination of polymorphic VT plus a prolonged QT interval. This should be managed according to the chapter on Torsades here.\n- Patients with polymorphic VT with a normal QT interval (following cardioversion) don't have Torsade de Pointes. Such patients often have ischemia-mediated VT and may be managed by the treatment pathway described in this chapter.\nVT storm is a vicious cycle\n- VT/VF increases intracellular calcium levels, which may be pro-arrhythmic.\n- Shocks and episodes of cardiac arrest (e.g. treated with epinephrine) may cause myocardial injury.\n- Myocardial injury & pain stimulate outpouring of endogenous catecholamines, promoting recurrent arrhythmia.\n- Key point: The natural history of VT storm is generally to deteriorate (even despite the use of standard ACLS algorithms to interrupt each individual episode of VT). Aggressive therapy is needed to stop this process.\n— J. Christian Fox (@jchristianfox) November 4, 2017\n- Most patients have severe structural heart disease (usually ischemic cardiomyopathy).\n- If the patient has a structurally normal heart, this suggests a rare form of arrhythmia requiring specific management (e.g. Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT).\n- Sometimes present (but only in ~10% of cases)1\n- Triggers may include:\n- Acute MI\n- Heart failure exacerbation, volume overload\n- Electrolyte abnormality (especially: hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)\n- Medication toxicity, substance abuse (e.g. sympathomimetics)\n- Medication non-adherence\n- Pro-arrhythmic drug toxicity\n- Thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm with VT/VF storm)\nTreatment of VT storm requires an organized approach, with coordination between multiple services (e.g. critical care, interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, unit pharmacist). Call for help early and try to think a couple steps ahead (e.g. start ordering esmolol or propranolol before you actually need it).\nintubation & sedation\n- This is generally required for a true VT storm. Intubation offers numerous benefits:\n- Patients may lose airway control during episodes of VT/VF\n- Sedation itself is therapeutic\n- Intubation may facilitate safe performance of procedures (e.g. VT ablation).\n- Analgesia is important for any intubated patient, but it's especially important in VT storm because untreated pain can drive sympathetic tone and promote recurrent arrhythmia.\n- Initially err on the side of over-aggressive analgesia (until the VT storm is controlled).\n- Deep sedation can help break VT storm.\n- Propofol seems to work particularly well here.3\n- Propofol may cause hypotension due to vasodilation; this may be counteracted with the use of vasoconstrictors (e.g. phenylephrine).\n- Dexmedetomedine may also reduce sympathetic tone, so it's not a terrible choice here. However, dexmedetomedine has some drawbacks which probably make it 2nd line here (at least initially until the storm has abated):\n- Dexmedetomedine is sluggish to titrate.\n- Dexmedetomedine can't achieve the same depth of deep sedation that propofol can.\n- To date, no evidence on dexmedetomedine in VT storm.\n- Benzodiazepine may be used if unable to tolerate propofol/dexmedetomedine due to severe hypotension.\nA-line & pressors\n- These patients are often very hemodynamically labile (e.g. with recurrent episodes of cardiac arrest).\n- By definition, in every case of VT storm we will be aggressively titrating numerous drugs which affect hemodynamics (e.g. propofol, amiodarone, beta-blockers).\n- An arterial line is usually indispensable and should be placed as soon as possible.\n- These patients may be good candidates for crash femoral access.\n- Phenylephrine may be the best choice, because it won't stimulate cardiac beta-receptors.\n- Pressor support may facilitate the use of propofol and beta-blockers to treat VT storm.\n- The coronary circulation is perfused in diastole, so don't allow the diastolic Bp to decrease too much.\n1st line antiarrhythmic: amiodarone\n- Usual regimen: 300 mg bolus, then 1 mg/min x6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min.\n- Additional boluses can be given for recurrence, up to a total of ~1,200 mg in boluses.\n- Avoid >2.2 grams total dose within 24 hours.\nmagnesium & electrolyte management\n- 2-4 grams of IV magnesium sulfate may be considered, particularly if patient is deficient.\n- There is no strong evidence to support the use of magnesium. Given that intracellular calcium overload may be implicated in VT/VF storm, magnesium might be expected to alleviate this problem given some antagonism of calcium's effects.\n- Correct other electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypokalemia)\n2nd line antiarrhythmic: beta-blockers (might actually be the most effective therapy)\n- IV Esmolol infusion is fairly well supported by evidence.4,5\n- Loading dose is 0.3-0.5 mg/kg IV (~30 mg).\n- Start infusion at 0.050 mg/kg/min (~3 mg/min).\n- May re-load & up-titrate infusion in increments of 0.05 mg/kg/min every 10 minutes.\n- Max dose is 0.3 mg/kg/min.\n- The advantage of esmolol is titratability. From a mechanistic standpoint, it may be less effective than propranolol because it lacks efficacy at beta-2 receptors.\n- IV Propranolol\n- Superior to metoprolol (and probably esmolol) because antagonizes both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. However, may be harder to get access to and more difficult to titrate.\n- IV regimen: Bolus 0.15 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes, then 3-5 mg IV Q6hr.5,6\n- Oral regimen: Propranolol 40 mg PO q6hrs has been proven superior to metoprolol (50 mg q6hr).7\n- IV metoprolol may be used if nothing else is available (5 mg IV every 5 minutes for total of 15 mg).\n3rd line antiarrhythmic: lidocaine (unclear value)\n- Lidocaine is traditionally recommended as third-line antiarrhythmic after amiodarone & beta-blockers.\n- Efficacy may be limited to patients with acute ischemia.1\n- However, caution is advised, as class-I anti-arrhythmics may worsen cardiac function due to negative inotropic effects.2 Given lack of proven benefit in the context of VT/VF storm, it's unclear whether this risk is worth it. Furthermore, combining systemic lidocaine with stellate nerve block(s) might increase the risk of systemic lidocaine toxicity.\n- Growing evidence is suggesting that it might be best to move directly to stellate ganglion block at this point, rather than trialing IV lidocaine (see below).\n- Dose: Bolus with 1-1.5 mg/kg and then infuse at a rate of 0.02 mg/kg/min.1\n- May re-bolus with 0.5-0.75 mg/kg IV up to a total dose of 3 mg/kg.\n- May up-titrate infusion up to ~4 mg/min.\nstellate ganglion block\n- Nerve block in the neck cuts off sympathetic outflow to the myocardium.\n- Supported by case-study level data, which show a dramatic reduction in arrhythmia burden.8\n- Seems fairly safe (e.g. used as an outpatient procedure for control of neuropathic pain).\n- Sensible intervention for patients failing to respond to intubation & anti-arrhythmics.\n- The block should cause an ipsilateral Horner's syndrome (pupillary constriction), which is evidence of a successful block.\nleft stellate ganglion block versus bilateral blocks?\n- The left stellate ganglion is more important in autonomic regulation of the heart, so most literature has described unilateral left-sided blockade.\n- In a recent systematic review of the literature, 34/38 reported cases received left-sided block, with the remaining four receiving bilateral blocks.8\n- However, bilateral blockade may be most effective. Some authors are currently advocating for bilateral blockade.9\nbasic anatomic principles\n- (1) Operate at the level of the C6 transverse process (Chassaignac's tubercle; figure above).\n- This bony structure might be appreciated with deep palpation adjacent to the trachea at the level of the cricoid membrane.\n- The C6 transverse process should be visible during the procedure as a bright, bony signal.\n- The C6 transverse process provides a back-stop which blocks the needle from hitting the vertebral artery (although ideally you should never hit the bone).\n- (2) The injection target is just anterior to the longus coli muscle, which runs underneath carotid artery.\noverview of two different techniques\nTwo general techniques may be used. There's no firm evidence regarding which is better, so both will be described here.\n“landmark technique” approach\n- Traditionally, stellate ganglion blocks were performed using a landmark technique as follows:\n- Palpate the neck adjacent to the trachea to locate the lateral process of C6 (Chassaignac's tubercle)\n- Insert a needle straight into the neck until it hits Chassaignac's tubercle.\n- Inject some local anesthetic, then withdraw 1-2 mm and inject some more anesthetic.\n- This is a fast and simple technique (see video below). The problem is that if you're off a little (either too cephalad or caudad) the needle could slip past Chassaignac's tubercle and hit the vertebral artery.\n- This approach can be replicated using ultrasonography, which allows needle visualization and prevents going too deep. Ideally anesthetic should be placed just anterior to the longus coli muscle.\nThe Ultrasound Podcast provides a nice video illustrating the ultrasound views that would be used for this technique (start at 5:10 if you're in a hurry).\n- In this approach, the patient's head is turned to the contralateral side. The longus coli is approached lateral to the carotid artery (figure below). As with any technique, the goal is to deposit anesthetic just anterior to the longus coli muscle.\n- This technique has the advantage of providing a greater margin of safety between the needle and vital structures (e.g. the carotid artery and thyroid).\nA more detailed illustration of the sono-anatomy at the level of C6 is shown below:10\n- The key sono-landmarks are the carotid artery and the Chassaignac's tubercle (marked “at” in the figure below).\n- The longus coli (with the ganglion anterior to it) are sandwiched between the carotid artery and the anterior tubercle.\n- Using some gentle posterio-medial pressure with the ultrasound probe may displace the carotid artery medially, opening up this space between the carotid and Chassaignac's tubercle.11\nThe following video illustrates this general approach, albeit at the C7 level (not my preferred level because, as you can see in the video, incorrect angulation of the needle could risk laceration of the vertebral artery)\nAnother short video to reinforce the anatomic structures:\ntreatment of cause\nImplanted Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) optimization\n- Any patient with an ICD requires device interrogation.\n- Ensure that the device is truly detecting VT (rather than over-responding to artifact).\n- Anti-tachycardia overdrive pacing may be optimized to break episodes of VT without requiring shocks.\nRevascularization & therapy for myocardial infarction\n- MI is an important cause of VT storm.\n- Recurrent VT/VF should always prompt consideration for emergent cardiac catheterization.\n- Additional therapies for acute coronary syndrome should also be considered (e.g. aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor).\nCatheter ablation of VT/VF\n- Case series suggest that ablation has a surprisingly high initial success rates in monomorphic VT storm.\n- Recent meta-analysis of 417 patients with VT storm demonstrated clinical arrhythmia suppression in 92% of patients, with an impressive safety profile (complication rate of 1% and peri-procedural mortality of <1%).12\n- May serve as bridge to revascularization and/or ablation.\n- May facilitate use of very high-dose beta-blockers and sedation, to settle arrhythmias.\n- Unavailable in most centers (and patients are usually too unstable to transfer).\npost-cardiac arrest care\npost-cardiac arrest care\n- Patients who have had a VT/VF arrest causing anoxic brain damage require temperature management to prevent neurologic injury.

This is a pitfall, because Torsade de Pointes requires a specific magnesium-based therapeutic plan.\n- A wait-and-see approach, which will often fail these patients (VT storm is a vicious cycle which often deteriorates without aggressive management).

{"question":"What's the main difference between regular sockets and impact driver bits? Both tools have special features for attaching to power tools! 🛠️","answer":"The main difference is in their compatibility and design. Impact driver bits have 1/4-inch hex shanks and can only be used with impact drivers' quick-change sleeves, while regular sockets come in various sizes and can be used with regular wrenches. Impact-rated sockets are specifically designed to withstand high torque and have features like higher tolerance for misalignment and black oxide finish for corrosion protection, whereas regular sockets can crack or break under high torque conditions.","context":["When it comes to home improvement projects, a power drill is one of the most common tools you’ll need. But an impact driver is perhaps an upgraded version that you should consider adding to your arsenal.\nPower drills and impact drivers are similar tools: both look a lot alike, and they both are able to drive screws into different materials. However, impact drivers make the work a lot easier.\nWhat Impact Drivers Do\nHere’s the main difference: Impact drivers utilize the same rotational motion that power drills use, but as you’re driving in a screw, impact drivers also mix in a hammering action that not only hammers down, but sideways. This makes it way easier to drive screws into tough materials, and it prevents the drive bit from slipping off the screw head, which could potentially strip the head and ruin the screw.\nIf you’ve ever heard an impact driver in action, then you’ve probably noticed this in the form of a really loud, repetitive clicking noise that it makes as it’s driving in a screw. That’s the noise of the hammering action, and it occurs dozens of times per second, depending on how fast you’re driving in the screw.\nWith a power drill, you’d normally have to apply a lot of pressure in order to prevent the drive bit from slipping, but the hammering action of impact drivers mostly prevents this, and all you have to do is apply enough pressure to keep the screw guided and on point.\nImpact drivers are also great for removing stubborn screws or bolts when reversing the spin direction. The hammering action can make it easier to remove fasteners that corroded or were over-torqued.\nWhat Impact Drivers Can’t Do\nIf you end up getting an impact driver, it’s important to know that there are a few small disadvantages compared with power drills.\nFirst off, impact drivers really shouldn’t be used for precise drilling—your power drill will always do a better job at that since you don’t want a hammering action when drilling. Plus, power drills have a chuck, which is a device on the end of the drill that consists of claws that can open and close to accept all different sizes of drill bits. Impact drivers have a quick-change sleeve that only accept bits with 1/4-inch hex shanks. You can find drill bits with hex shanks, but they’re few and far between.\nPower drills also have two gears: one that’s slower with more torque for driving in screws, and a second gear that’s faster for drilling holes. Impact drivers only have one gear, so you have to be a bit more precise with the variable-speed trigger if using an impact driver.\nPower drills also have a clutch, which is similar to having a built-in torque wrench of sorts. It allows you to drive in a screw, without accidentally tightening it down so much that it blasts through the material. Instead, you can set it to a number and when it gets to a certain torque level, it will stop driving. Impact drivers don’t have clutches, so you’re at the mercy of your own strength and precision.\nUse Both for the Best of Both Worlds\nContrary to what you might think, power drills and impact drivers actually complement each other rather than compete, so it’s best to have both tools in your tool box if possible—power drills are great for drilling and impact drivers are great for driving. In fact, many tool manufacturers sell power drill and impact driver combos, like this one.\nWith that in mind, I always like to have a drill bit ready to go in my power drill, with a drive bit ready to go in my impact driver. That way if I’m drilling a lot of pilot holes, I can drill them using my power drill and then just quickly switch to my impact driver to drive in the screw—no need to constantly change bits in my power drill.","When it comes to impact wrenches, there are two types of sockets that can be used: regular and impact. Regular sockets are the most common type and are made of steel or chrome. Impact sockets, on the other hand, are specifically designed for use with impact wrenches and are made of a softer material, such as aluminum.\nWhile both types of sockets can be used with an impact wrench, it’s important to know which one is best suited for the job at hand.\n- Make sure that the socket is compatible with the size and drive of your impact wrench\n- Insert thesocket onto the anvil of the impact wrench\n- Hand-tighten the socket until it is secure on the anvil\n- Use theimpact wrench to loosen or tighten bolts as needed\nWhat Kind of Sockets Do You Use With an Impact Wrench?\nIf you’re using an impact wrench, you’ll want to make sure you have the right kind of socket for the job. There are two main types of sockets that can be used with an impact wrench: standard and deep. Standard sockets will work for most applications, but if you’re working in tight spaces or need to reach a fastener that’s set deep into a recess, you’ll need to use a deep socket.\nWhen it comes to choosing the right size socket, it’s important to match the size of the socket to the size of the fastener. Impact wrenches come in a variety of sizes, so make sure to choose a socket that’s compatible with your particular model. In general, 3/8-inch and 1/2-inch impact wrenches are the most common sizes on the market.\nOnce you’ve selected the right type and size of socket for your application, it’s time to attach it to your impact wrench. Most models will have either a detent pin or friction ring system that secures sockets in place. To attach asocket, simply align it with the chuck jaws and tighten until it’s secure.\nWhat is the Difference between Regular Sockets And Impact Sockets?\nThe most significant difference between regular sockets and impact sockets is that impact sockets are designed to withstand the high torque of impact wrenches. This makes them much sturdier than regular sockets, which can crack or break under the same amount of force. Impact sockets also have a higher tolerance for misalignment, meaning they are less likely to round off fasteners.\nFinally, impact sockets typically have a black oxide finish to protect against corrosion.\nWhat Happens If You Use Non Impact Sockets?\nIf you use a socket that is not impact rated, it is possible to damage the socket, the ratchet, and/or the fastener. The most common type of damage is chipping or cracking of the socket walls. This can occur from over-tightening the fastener or from using the wrong size socket (one that is too small).\nIf you use an impact wrench with a non-impact rated socket, you run the risk of shattering the socket.\nCan You Use Regular Sockets With a Torque Wrench?\nMost torque wrenches come with a socket that is specific to the wrench. However, it is possible to use a regular socket with a torque wrench as long as the fit is snug and there is no play in the joint. It is important to make sure that the socket is compatible with the drive size of the torque wrench so that it can handle the amount of torque being applied.\nChrome & Impact Sockets… The stepbrothers of the tool world.\nImpact Wrench Sockets\nAn impact wrench is a power tool that delivers a high torque output with minimal effort on the part of the user. It is most commonly used in automotive and construction applications, where it is used to loosen or tighten bolts and nuts that are difficult to turn by hand.\nImpact wrenches come in a variety of sizes and styles, but all share the same basic mechanism of operation.\nWhen the trigger is pulled, a hammer inside the tool strikes a piston, which in turn drives an anvil. The anvil then hits the socket, causing it to rotate at high speed. This rapid rotation breaks loose stubborn bolts and nuts much more quickly than if they were turned by hand.\nThere are two main types of impact wrench sockets: detachable and integral. Detachable sockets are those that can be removed from the tool for easy storage or transport. Integral sockets are permanently attached to the tool and cannot be removed without disassembling the entire device.\nMost impact wrench sockets are made from steel or other durable metals for long-term use. Some models feature a built-in light source, which can be helpful when working in low-light conditions. Many brands offerimpact wrench socket sets that include multiple sizes of socket for greater versatility.\nWhat Type of Socket Should Be Used With an Impact Wrench\nIf you’re in the market for an impact wrench, one of the first decisions you’ll need to make is what type of socket to use. There are three main types of sockets that can be used with an impact wrench: standard, deep, and extensions. Here’s a quick rundown of each so you can decide which is right for your needs.\nStandard Sockets: Standard sockets are the most common type and will likely come with your impact wrench if you don’t purchase any separately. They’re designed to work with most nuts and bolts, making them a versatile option. However, they may not be able to reach all the way into deep recessed areas.\nDeep Sockets: Deep sockets are designed for those hard-to-reach bolts and nuts. They’re longer than standard sockets, so they can extend further into tight spaces. Keep in mind that they may not work with all sizes of bolts due to their length.\nExtensions: Extensions are a great choice if you need even more reach than what deep sockets offer. They attach to the end of your socket and come in various lengths to fit your needs. Just be aware that they can add some extra weight and bulkiness to your impact wrench which could affect its performance.\nDeep Impact Socket\nA deep impact socket is a type of socket that is designed to be used with an impact wrench. It is distinguished from a regular socket by its longer shank, which allows it to reach deeper into the recesses of a fastener. Deep impact sockets are also usually made from stronger materials than regular sockets, such as chromium-molybdenum steel, in order to better withstand the high torque loads generated by an impact wrench.\nImpact Wrench Socket Size\nAn impact wrench is a powerful tool that can loosen or tighten bolts and screws quickly and easily. However, before using an impact wrench, it is important to know what size socket you need for the job.\nThere are three main types of sockets that are commonly used with impact wrenches: standard (or inch), metric, and deep well.\nStandard sockets are the most common type of socket and are typically used in North America. Metric sockets are more common in Europe and other parts of the world. Deep well sockets are designed to be used with deep set bolts or screws.\nWhen choosing a socket for your impact wrench, it is important to select one that is compatible with the size of bolt or screw you will be using. Impact wrenches come in a variety of sizes, so it is important to choose a socket that is the right size for your particular model. In general, smaller impact wrenches use smaller sockets while larger impact wrenches require larger sockets.\nOnce you have selected the right sized socket for your needs, simply attach it to the end of your impact wrench and you’re ready to get started!\nIf you’re in the market for a new impact wrench, you may be wondering if you can use regular sockets with it. The short answer is yes, you can use regular sockets with an impact wrench. However, there are a few things to keep in mind before using them.\nFirst, make sure that the socket is compatible with the size and power of the impact wrench. Second, check to see if the socket has any damage that could cause it to break while in use. Finally, be sure to use only Impact Rated Sockets when using an Impact Wrench as they are specifically designed and tested for safety with this type of tool."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7097add3-02ce-4a43-a37f-f08cc6a6b39c>","<urn:uuid:424049d4-e696-4a79-bf4a-3775529b12b9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm having trouble with my rond de jambe. What are most difficult parts of this movement and why is it considered hard?","answer":"Rond de jambe is considered one of the hardest steps at barre in ballet for several reasons. The two most challenging parts are: 1) When carrying the leg from front to side, you must rotate the heel while channeling energy up into the hip socket and rotating the femur head outward, all without changing the foot or leg shape. 2) Moving from side to back is particularly difficult - you must stabilize the hips by rotating outwards while preventing the pelvis from rocking or swaying, maintaining weight distribution, and making the circle even larger. Additionally, the movement requires creating infinite circles that get bigger each time while keeping the pelvis neutral and legs long, and maintaining relaxed feet without gripping.","context":["Notes on Rond De Jambes (a terre)\n“Round of the leg on the ground”\nposter available here in 3 sizes. (click here)\nEeesh. This is one of the hardest steps at barre in ballet. The exercise requires a ton of control and focus. In theory, this step should be really easy and a lot of people overlook how complicated rond de jambe is. Somewhere in between adagio qualities and stretching, rond de jambes are one of those things that you either have or you don’t.\nRond de jambes are versatile, you can do them en l’air, in a jump, on relevé, done en dehors or en dedans or even in fondu/plié. The list goes on. It can be done at varied heights, at varied speeds, or varied accents. Like most steps in ballet, you can do them any way you want.\nSo, let’s get to breaking down rond de jambe.\nen dehors:It is easier to learn rond de jambes from first. Standing very tall, you press through to tendu devant. Both legs are extremely straight without gripping the quad, and you need to focus on the inner hip socket. From this position, you hold the turnout and push to the side without changing the shape of the leg. Without gripping the quad you rotate the hip socket rotates even more and you continue the semi-circle to get to tendu devant. Nothing moves. I MEAN NOTHING! You keep the shape of the leg the entire time, the turn out, the shape, everything. Closing through the tendu and relaxing the toes, the heel gradually pushes forward and closes back to first. The important thing in rond de jambe is to keep the turn out active at all times. (Reality… you are supposed to keep your turn out active at all times but sometimes you just need to relax. Relax in first position if you need to relax.)\na. Standing in first position. If you need to get some tips on improving your first position. Click here >> (https://aballeteducation.com/2016/03/25/first-position-it-is-so-hard/)\nb. Just like a tendu start pressing the heel forward and pushing through the floor. Because barre is built one step on top of the other, don’t miss out the notes on tendu. Click here >>(https://aballeteducation.com/2016/03/26/notes-on-tendu-well-tendu-devant/)\nc. Reaching the maximum length of tendu devant, you have to extend even more in rond de jambe. You want to create enough length in the working leg to free up the hip socket. To do this, you have to push through your standing leg, or channel energy down into the floor on your supporting side.\nd. This is the hardest part of rond de jambe… You have to start rotating the heel even more, and channel energy up into the hip sock and start to rotate the femur head in the socket outward. Don’t change the shape of the foot or leg, don’t relax the knee. Grow taller and start to carry to the side. You should feel a ton of tension pressing outwards in the supporting hip.\ne. Keep carrying till you hit tendu a la seconde. A very long a la seconde. Keep lifting in the supporting side.\nf. The next hardest part of rond de jambe is ridiculously hard. This is where a lot of people go a muck. Stabilize the hips by rotating outwards and channeling energy into the floor and start to rotate towards the back. Do not flip the hips or let the pelvis rock. Don’t sway in your back, don’t sit in your hips, don’t let your weight shift. You have to be even more mindful of your supporting leg. All while making the circle even larger.\ng. Reach to tendu derriere\nh. Relax your toes and press the heel forward leaving the toes behind.\ni. Pull up harder into your standing leg and hip flexor. Lift even higher. The energy should never die in rond de jambe. You have to constantly grow and channel energy through each extremity of the body. As your relax your full foot on the floor your turn out should feel the deepest in the hip socket.\nj. Reach back into a taller first.\nOkay, here are some of the ridiculously hard things about rond de jambe… One, your body has to create tons of infinite circles that move through your space at barre. It is rather difficult, each time trying to make the circle bigger and bigger. Keeping the pelvis neutral and legs long. The best way is to keep your hamstrings constantly engaged without gripping into your quads and locking up your hip flexors. Another really difficult thing to do in rond de jambe is to keep the foot relaxed and not gripping.\nRond de Jambes for the young child…\nIt is a common imagery tool to teach kids to draw a half circle on the floor. The problem with this, is that kids will usually push most of the work and effort into the quad. I find it better to tell kids to make an egg-like shape with the foot. This keeps from adding too much pressure in the knee, and not letting the student grip in the quad.\nRond de Jambe for the adult dancer…\nNowadays, rond de jambe kills my hip. Like to the point of exhaustion. It is easier to work from a more turned in first than perfect first, and definitely in fifth position, it puts too much pressure to the knee… For me. I also find when being in a more turned in fifth position, I use my quad too much, so I rond de jambe from first. Less pressure all over, and my legs don’t die and I don’t grip in my quad.\nWhere in the world do you put your weight in rond de jambe… Classically speaking, rond de jambe should always be centered… meaning the weight is centered in your pelvis and the weight is placed over the arch. Some teachers allow weight to shift into the standing leg even more so that the hamstrings are longer. The weight then shifts so the center of the pelvis is above the arch and there is slight pressure in the ball of the foot. This frees up the working hip. The standing hip and leg then channels more energy.\nThe stylistic rond de jambe… Some teachers teach to over cross the rond de jambe in tendu devant and derriere (over crossing meaning that the toe of the working foot lines up to the heel or arch. Some teachers, teach a more open rond de jambe that pushes the focus on the in between positions. Like half tendu front and half tendu back. Some teachers teach an exaggerated over crossing where the working toe lines up with the supporting toe. This definitely causes a weight shift.\nSome final thoughts on rond de jambe…\nRond de jambe is hard, but don’t give up! The most important thing in rond de jambe is to open the hips and really create a connection through the space and floor. I always enjoy rond de jambe, and try to find really great musicality. Some teachers prefer accent front and back, some prefer accent side, and some prefer no accent and to keep the motion evenly. Depending on the song and the musicality and tempo, I accent in various places including first.

{"question":"What are the key characteristics of adaptive peacebuilding approaches, and how do formal institutional frameworks define the overall goals of peacebuilding initiatives? Please provide a comprehensive answer.","answer":"Adaptive peacebuilding is characterized by an iterative process of experimentation, learning, and adaptation where peacebuilders and affected communities actively engage in sustaining peace. It employs inductive approaches and continuous learning, contrasting with predetermined design approaches. Examples include UN peacekeeping operations in Central African Republic and South Sudan, where strategies are continuously adapted based on effectiveness assessments. According to institutional frameworks, as defined by various organizations, the overall goals of peacebuilding initiatives include establishing durable peace, preventing violence recurrence, addressing root causes of conflict, building institutional capacity for conflict management, and transforming relationships. The OECD specifically defines it as including activities to prevent conflict through addressing structural causes, while the UN emphasizes it as a continuum of strategies aimed at sustaining long-term peace and reducing conflict relapse risk.","context":["Complexity thinking and adaptive peacebuilding\nAnother concept that unlocks new insights for understanding change in complex systems is resilience, which refers to the capacities of social institutions, such as formal and informal justice systems, to sustain acceptable levels of function, structure and identity under stress. Resilience to withstand shocks and challenges, and the ability to adapt, grows as social institutions develop increasingly complex forms of self-organisation. Christine Bell and her colleagues at the Political Settlements Research Programme have shown that from Aceh and Mindanao to Colombia and Mali, national and local peace agreements reached through self-renewing and inclusive peace processes have proven to be more resilient when roles and responsibilities, including for implementation, are distributed among a broad group of participants.\nSelf-organisation, in this context, refers to the ability of organisations and individuals within a complex system, like a large community, to organise, maintain and adapt themselves without the direction of a controlling agent. It is thus not surprising that one aspect of self-organisation that is strongly associated with sustaining peace is the inclusion of outsider groups,ie interest and identity groups otherwise excluded from peace talks. Societies that have found political and social models that can accommodate multiple identities of ethnicity, religion, language, race, gender and sexual orientation are less likely to experience violent conflict. For example, Tania Paffenholz and colleagues at the Inclusive Peace and Transition Initiative have found that when a broad range of actors beyond the principle conflict parties are included, and these actors were able to assert influence over the process, their inclusion was vital for preventing violence and for sustaining peace. This is partly because self-organisation facilitates and modulates the flow and processing of feedback information, for instance through developing a shared understanding, participatory decision-making or monitoring mechanisms. It distributes and dilutes vulnerability across social networks. If one node is weak, others can carry the load, thus preventing the system from breaking down. Based on these insights, support for peacebuilding should prioritise facilitating and enabling resilient, self-organising and adaptive national and local social institutions.\nAdaptive peacebuilding is one such complexity-informed approach where peacebuilders, including communities and people affected by the conflict, actively engage in a structured process to sustain peace by employing an iterative process of experimentation, learning and adaptation. It builds on the work of Andrews, Pritchett and Woolcock, who have pioneered the problem-driven iterative adaptation (PDIA) approach to escape the linear tyranny of the log-frame in development planning and evaluation. Adaptive peacebuilding applies this approach to sustaining peace and links it with other complexity-informed approaches to peacebuilding. Examples include the work of Dialectiq, Humanity United’s work in Mali and Zimbabwe, the work of Burns, Gray and Roos on community-based peace processes in Myanmar and the International Rescue Committee and Mercy Corps’ ADAPT project, also in Myanmar.\nUN peacekeeping operations in the Central African Republic and South Sudan, together with local communities, employ a range of strategies to pursue local peace agreements, improve local security, disrupt local conflict dynamics and encourage local economic activity. The people involved are continuously learning from their experiences and are adapting their approaches based on their assessment of which initiatives are more or less effective. Adaptive peacebuilding in these contexts does not necessarily imply following a specific methodological approach like PDIA. It is more a pattern of practices that experiment with an inductive, iterative and adaptive approach. These adaptive approaches differ fundamentally from the determined-design approach that was in vogue over the past two decades, where the logic of the programmatic intervention has been predetermined, and the role of the peacebuilders and communities was to implement the programmes as designed.\nWhile peacebuilders can influence complex social systems by enabling and stimulating the processes that enable resilience and inclusiveness to emerge, the prominent role of self-organisation in complex system dynamics suggests that it is important the affected societies and communities have the space and agency to drive their own process. External fixes will not stick if they have not been internalised, so local adaptation processes are ultimately the critical element for inclusive political settlements to become self-sustainable. In How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, Yuen Yuen Ang describes this paradoxical mixture of top-down influence and bottom-up improvisation as ‘directed improvisation’.\nThis is why the notion of peacebuilding is unfortunate. It subconsciously suggests that experts can design and build peace, as if it was an engineering challenge. In On the Frontlines of Peace, Severine Autesserre shows how many successful examples of peacebuilding have involved innovative grassroots initiatives, led by local people, often using methods that international peacemakers tend to undervalue. In Global Governance and Local Peace, Susanna Campbell goes one step further and argues that the capacity of UN agencies to successfully pursue their peacebuilding aims relies to a large degree on the ability of their people in the field to make the organisation responsive to parties in the local context. Thus, not only is sustaining peace dependent on resilient local communities, but also the international efforts to support such efforts are more successful when they are accountable to local populations and informed by feedback from local communities.\nAs these examples show, adaptive peacebuilding approaches can contribute in original and innovative ways to more inclusive peace processes and more self-sustainable political settlements. This does not mean, however, that adaptation is a solution in and of itself. There are common fallacies associated with complexity that should be avoided, such as that complexity thinking implies embracing messiness, abandons goals and gives up on transformative change. What incorporating complexity thinking will do is to help mediators and other peace practitioners to become more confident in coping with uncertainties and more comfortable experimenting with adaptive approaches.","Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding\nThe following list is not exhaustive and only provides some of the most prominent academic and institutional definitions of peacebuilding.\nConflict Information Consortium, University of Colorado\nPeacebuilding is a process that facilitates the establishment of durable peace and tries to prevent the recurrence of violence by addressing root causes and effects of conflict through reconciliation, institution building, and political as well as economic transformation. This consists of a set of physical, social, and structural initiatives that are often an integral part of postconflict reconstruction and rehabilitation.\nPeacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that “remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur.” Conflict resolution mechanisms “should be built into the structure and be present there as a reservoir for the system itself to draw upon, just as a healthy body has the ability to generate its own antibodies and does not need ad hoc administration of medicine.”\nGlobal Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict\nPeacebuilding involves addressing social and political sources of conflict as well as reconciliation.\nJoan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice, University of San Diego\nStrategic Peacebuilding Principles:\n- Peacebuilding is complex and has multiple actors.\n- Peacebuilding requires values, goals, commitment to human rights and needs.\n- Peacebuilding goes beyond conflict transformation.\n- Peacebuilding cannot ignore structural forms of injustice and violence.\n- Peacebuilding is founded on an ethic of interdependence, partnership, and limiting violence.\n- Peacebuilding depends on relational skills.\n- Peacebuilding analysis is complex; underlying cultures, histories, root causes, and immediate stressors are essential.\n- Peacebuilding creates spaces where people interact in new ways, expanding experience and honing new means of communication.\n- Peacebuilding heals trauma, promotes justice and transforms relationships.\n- Peacebuilding requires capacity and relationship building at multiple levels.\nLederach, John Paul\n[Peacebuilding] is understood as a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships. The term thus involves a wide range of activities that both precede and follow formal peace accords. Metaphorically, peace is seen not merely as a stage in time or a condition. It is a dynamic social construct.\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n[Peacebuilding] includes activities designed to prevent conflict through addressing structural and proximate causes of violence, promoting sustainable peace, delegitimizing violence as a dispute resolution strategy, building capacity within society to peacefully manage disputes, and reducing vulnerability to triggers that may spark violence.\nSchool of Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University\nPeacebuilding is a term used within the international development community to describe the processes and activities involved in resolving violent conflict and establishing a sustainable peace. It is an overarching concept that includes conflict transformation, restorative justice, trauma healing, reconciliation, development, and leadership, underlain by spirituality and religion. It is similar in meaning to conflict resolution but highlights the difficult reality that the end of a conflict does not automatically lead to peaceful, stable social or economic development. A number of national and international organizations describe their activities in conflict zones as peacebuilding.\nUnited Nations Development Program\nPeacebuilding involves a range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management, and laying the foundations for sustainable peace and development. Peacebuilding strategies must be coherent and tailored to the specific needs of the country concerned, based on national ownership, and should comprise a carefully prioritized, sequenced, and therefore relatively narrow set of activities aimed at achieving the above objectives. This office works specifically with peacebuilding in the context of conflict prevention.\nUnited Nations: Peacebuilding Support Office\nPeacebuilding is rather the continuum of strategy, processes and activities aimed at sustaining peace over the long-term with a clear focus on reducing chances for the relapse into conflict…. [It] is useful to see peacebuilding as a broader policy framework that strengthens the synergy among the related efforts of conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping, recovery and development, as part of a collective and sustained effort to build lasting peace. This office works specifically with peacebuilding in the context of postconflict reconstruction.\nUnited States Institute of Peace\nOriginally conceived in the context of postconflict recovery efforts to promote reconciliation and reconstruction, the term peacebuilding has more recently taken on a broader meaning. It may include providing humanitarian relief, protecting human rights, ensuring security, establishing nonviolent modes of resolving conflicts, fostering reconciliation, providing trauma healing services, repatriating refugees and resettling internally displaced persons, supporting broad-based education, and aiding in economic reconstruction. As such, it also includes conflict prevention in the sense of preventing the recurrence of violence, as well as conflict management and postconflict recovery. In a larger sense, peacebuilding involves a transformation toward more manageable, peaceful relationships and governance structures—the long-term process of addressing root causes and effects, reconciling differences, normalizing relations, and building institutions that can manage conflict without resort to violence. The US Government does not have a publicly available definition of peacebuilding, other than the definition provided by USIP."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:51ca372d-3dd8-4480-bbe2-7d807fd7df7b>","<urn:uuid:7a473c9a-2a9f-45a1-8356-9071b7f65836>"],"error":null}

In addition to everything else it has to offer, this region is becoming increasingly well-known as one of the nation’s premier winemaking centers.\nIn fact, the American South’s longstanding history with grapes and viniculture, or winemaking, dates to some of the region’s first European settlers. Upon arriving on North Carolina’s Roanoke Island, they observed the vines to be so plentiful that “…in all the world the like abundance is not to be found.”\nToday, with more than 70 wineries in North Carolina alone, nine distinct wine regions in Virginia and an official Florida wine trail, the southern United States produces thousands of tons of grapes annually.

He was a beer guy, but “this wine was my\nepiphany wine. I was hooked from that day forward” says Henry. It was in the same year that\nhe birthed the idea to one day own his own vineyard and make wine. After a couple trips to\nItaly, the dream began to manifest.\nHenry grew up on a small-scale subsistence farm and knew farming was hard work. As he began\nplanning, his focus turned to Italian grapes. But why? A couple years before he planted the\nvineyard, the University of Florence published the results of a ten-year study as it related to\nsouthern Italian varietals, especially Sangiovese and Aglianico. Henry got his hands on an\nEnglish translation of that study and in 2000 settled on the north Sierra Foothills of California as\nthe best place on the west coast of the US to grow those (mostly) southern Italian varietals he\nChicago Park, California lies in the north Sierra Foothills, northeast of Sacramento, and west of\nLake Tahoe. Farming two small vineyards, Mark Henry produces roughly 1,500 cases of wine\nmade from Italian varietals. With no professional training in winemaking, the process was trial\nand error. Says Henry, “I’ve watered the vineyard with more wine than I like to admit”, and\nsomewhere along the way, quality wine appeared.\nIn the Montoliva vineyard, the grapes are farmed organically, though not certified. Henry\n“firmly believes in the idea that the best fertilizer is the owner’s boot prints in the soil”. He does\nhave a goal to seek biodynamic certification, but doesn’t have the amount of land necessary to\nmeet the livestock levels required. His daughter is slated to take over the business/sales and\nwinemaking side of things, and Henry will then be able to focus on that goal.\nHenry is a low-intervention winemaker and does most everything by hand. He is personally out\nin his nine acres of vineyard every day. “It’s hard work” He says, “but I sleep well”. His goal in\nthe winery is to “let it [the wine] become whatever it is it wants to be”. The Montoliva wines\nare balanced, a bit rustic, and calling for food, similar to Italian wines.\nYou’ll see “Chicago Park” prominently on the labels for Montoliva, although it’s not a\nrecognized AVA. Technically Montoliva is in the Sierra Foothills, but Henry doesn’t prefer to use\nthat designation as it’s too large, rendering it almost meaningless to the consumer, and in any\ncase, has a “less than stellar” reputation.\nHenry says he did not come into this business with delusions of grandeur. Making wine from\nobscure grapes in a place called Chicago Park was never going to lead to fame or fortune. His\ngoal, according to Henry, was “to raise children in a nice small community, operate a farm that\nwas successful enough to pay the mortgage, and wake up every morning looking forward to the\nday.” I’d say Mark Henry has succeed both in life and in the bottle.\nMontoliva Vineyard & Winery 2019 Negroamaro $35\nMade from the Negroamaro grape, with “negro” meaning black in Italian and “amaro“ meaning\nbitter. The wine is unfiltered and throwing a bit of sediment in the glass. Pale garnet in color,\nwith a hint of bricking. The nose was very earthy, yet the palate gave ripe fruit plus the same\nearthiness. On the palate, the wine is gives ripe red and black fruit notes plus a savory,\nherbaceous character. 120 cases produced\nMontoliva Vineyard & Winery 2019 Dolcetto $35\nMade from the Dolcetto grape, native to Piemonte in norther Italy.

Black fruit and drying, though well-integrated\ntannins, form the foundation of this wine. There’s a smokiness to this wine that calls for a plate\nof BBQ to complete the picture. 140 cases produced.\nMontoliva Vineyard Winery 2017 Sinistra $40\nA blend of Teroldego and Barbera, Sinistra is Italian for “left”, and the name arrived because\nMark is left-handed. A good combination of fruit and earthiness, characteristic of Montoliva\nwines. Also, a bit lighter than to be expected with a 65% Teroldego blend. An interesting wine\nto keep you intrigued as you’re drinking it. 120 cases produced.\nMontoliva Vineyard & Winery 2020 Due Baci $35\nItalian for “two kisses”, this Due Baci wine is a blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Aglianico. This\nwine was originally made in 2008 when Mark married Julianne. Their guests loved the wine so\nmuch, they decided to continue producing it. A great smooth and easy wine for the red blend\nlover.

{"question":"What are the best mulching practices for winter protection - comparing their application for strawberries versus roses? Is straw truly the optimal choice for both? cuando es el mejor momento para aplicar el mulch en ambos casos?","answer":"For both plants, straw is indeed an excellent mulching material due to its hollow stems making it a very good insulator. However, the application methods differ. For roses, you need to first cut the canes back to 18 inches, surround with chicken wire, and then cover the whole plant to protect both shoots and roots. For strawberries, you need about 4 inches of straw when temperatures drop below 20°F. The timing is similar for both - mulch should be applied in late November after a hard frost or two. For strawberries specifically, the mulch should be removed gradually in spring when growth signs appear to prevent shock from temperature changes. In both cases, the mulch helps stabilize soil against freezing and thawing.","context":["PROTECTING PLANTS FROM WINTER DAMAGE\nBy Dr. Vern Grubinger\nExtension Vegetable and Berry Specialist\nUniversity of Vermont\nBesides ice dams on the roof and piles\nof snow in the driveway, horticultural injury is a fact\nof life during northern winters. Surprisingly, there\nare many ways that otherwise long-lived plants may meet\ntheir demise in between growing seasons.\nDirect injury from exposure to cold temperature\nis the most obvious, and as a result, most gardeners\nand homeowners pay attention to maps of plant hardiness\nzones. These define the average annual minimum temperature\nof geographical areas based on years of meteorological\nThe southern corners of Vermont are in\nzone 5a, where the average minimum temperature is between\n15 and 20 degrees F below zero. That's why some people\ncall it the \"Banana Belt.\" Up in the Northeast\nKingdom, it's zone 3b, where the coldest temperature\neach year averages 30 to 35 F below.\nAvoiding the problem is one way to prevent\nwinter injury to your plants. Be sure to buy the hardiest\nplants you can find. When selecting species or varieties,\nnever choose those that aren't suited for your hardiness\nOf course, hardiness zones are based on\naverages, and that can lead to problems because some\nyears are colder than average. That's why it's advisable\nto err on the side of caution when choosing plant varieties\nbased on hardiness claims. If possible, purchase plants\nthat are suited to survive in a hardiness zone colder\nthan yours. If you must put in\"marginally hardy\"\nplantings, try to place them in protected areas, where\nthe winds are reduced by the presence of structures\nor by the topography.\nWinter conditions can cause the death\nof plants in many ways. Their tops or roots may freeze\nor plants may dry out when whipped by persistent winds.\nSometimes, roots are heaved out of the ground by alternate\nfreezing and thawing.\nSunny winter days followed by frigid nights\ncreate rapid temperature variations that really hurt\nplants. Ice storms can cause breakage of stems and limbs.\nMice and deer browsing for food also may cause damage.\nWhat's a grower to do?\nFor many valuable crops, winter protection\nis essential. But protecting crops too early can interfere\nwith the plant's natural ability to adjust for winter\nor \"harden off.\" The first step to take for\nwinter protection is to wait, so that plants are given\nenough time in the late fall to properly harden off.\nDon't apply mulch too early, and don't\napply nitrogen (N) late in the season. Too much available\nN, whether from fertilizers or manure, keeps plants\nsucculent in the autumn and increases susceptibility\nto winter injury.\nMulching plants is a means of stabilizing\nsoil against freezing and thawing. A thick layer of\nweed-free organic residue-like straw is best. Because\nstraw has hollow stems, it is a very good insulator.\nLeaves also can be used, but if they mat\ndown, their insulating value is diminished, and they\nmay smother plants. Mulch should be applied in late\nNovember, after a hard frost or two.\nWhen mulching roses, cut the canes back\nto 18 inches, surround with chicken wire, and cover\nthe whole plant to protect shoots as well as roots.\nLow-growing perennial flowers, strawberries, and the\nlike are easy enough to cover completely, but they may\nrequire re-covering if the winds blow off the mulch.\nFor grape varieties that are not very\nhardy, remove the vines from the trellis and lay them\non the ground before mulching. For upright plants that\ncannot be lowered to the ground, erecting a fence of\nsome kind can protect plants against drying winds. Burlap\nor other material stretched between posts works well.\nSo does snow fence. It breaks the wind somewhat even\nwhen there's no snow, and works really well to protect\nplants when there is snow.\nAntidesiccants are materials that add\na protective coating to plant leaves, helping them to\nretain their moisture. These can be sprayed on leaves\nof some plants to reduce the loss of water in winter.\nIn northern climates, winter injury to\nplants is hard to avoid. With proper precautions, it\ncan be minimized,but be prepared next spring to prune\naway winter-killed canes and limbs and to remove dead\nplants. These can be a source of plant disease if left","Strawberries are a great fruit choice for a home garden. They are easy to plant and care for, and a well-taken care of patch will continue to produce bright, red strawberries for years to come. Strawberries are very high in Vitamin C, and can supply a daily requirement of this vitamin with only one cup of berries. Strawberries can be eaten directly from the garden, or used in pies, ice cream, smoothies and many other yummy treats! If you have an excess of berries they can be frozen very easily for future use!\nSelecting your strawberry cultivar is very important. There are two main types of strawberries, early-season or June-bearing cultivars and ever-bearing cultivars. The early season plants will produce a crop in June while the ever-bearing varieties will begin production in late June and continue producing fruit through out the summer. The ever-bearing varieties will require more maintenance and probably irrigation during the summer. Ogallala and Ozark Beauty are two great choices in ever-bearing varieties. Ever-bearing varieties will yield better under cool periods throughout the season. Some good choices for early-season cultivars include Sunrise and Earliglow. Be sure to buy your plants from a reputable nursery and that they will guarantee they are virus-free.\nStrawberries should be planted in early spring, ideally in April. Plants should be set in the garden as soon as you purchase them. If you cannot plant the same day, you should place them in a dark room and pack moist packing material around the roots. You need to make sure that the roots will not dry out, as that will cause the plant to die.\nThe site you select for your strawberry patch is also important. Strawberries need dry conditions, so an area with a slight slope is ideal. The plants will bloom early in the spring, so you may want to choose an area that has an added frost protection. If the blooms freeze, the plants will not bear fruit. Do not plant strawberries on a south facing slope as the warm sun will trick the plants into thinking the weather is warmer and they will set out their blooms only to be attacked by frost.\nA sandy or loamy soil is best for strawberries. If strawberries are planted in a hard, clay like soil, the plants will suffer from fruit rot. Try to stay far away from trees and do not plant near tomatoes, potatoes or peppers. Those vegetables are attacked by the same bugs, so you will want to avoid placing them close together. Fertilize the soil with about 10 pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer and work it into the top 6 inches of soil. Strawberries like a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5.\nThe first year you plant your strawberries you will want to pick all the blooms off so that the plant does not bear fruit. This allows the roots to grow and develop a strong root system. Cultivate the bed often to prevent weed growth and mulch the rows between the plants. After the first year, you can allow your plants to flower and bear fruit. It is very important to keep weeds under control by weeding the patch often.\nAfter the growing season is complete for the year you will want to trim or prune the plants. To do this you can mow off the plants to about one inch of height. This will prevent the patch from becoming overgrown and crowded out. The trimming should be done immediately after fruit production is complete. You don’t want to wait long because new leaves will grow up, and you want to allow them to grow.\nWinter mulching is very important to protect your strawberry plants. Low winter temperatures may kill the fruit buds as well as the roots and crowns of the plants. When the temperature drops to below 20 F you will want to cover the plants with a heavy layer of mulch. Straw and chopped cornstalks make excellent mulching materials. 4 inches of straw is needed to protect the plants adequately. Remove the mulch in the spring as soon as you see signs of growth. Remove the mulch little by little so that the plants do not suffer from the shock of the cooler temperatures. If there is a threat of frost, you can place the mulch back over the plants for a short amount of time.\nOnce you have planted the strawberries, you will need to maintain the patch year after year for optimum production. Rotating the crops and setting out new plants through out the patch will assure new growth and healthy roots. Try planting a small patch and see how delicious your berries are!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c72f7763-2f12-40a5-bb16-c79eb033de77>","<urn:uuid:0c1faada-795a-4ce9-8618-3380e7f51f61>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the physical solutions for improving restaurant acoustics, and how do they specifically benefit cochlear implant users in noisy dining environments?","answer":"Physical solutions for improving restaurant acoustics include installing sound-absorbing materials, particularly those effective at frequencies corresponding to human speech (500-2000 Hz). These can be suspended ceilings, wall-absorbing linings with fabric or perforated wood, acoustic screens, suspended baffles, and sound-absorbing totems. These improvements help cochlear implant users who typically struggle in noisy social settings like restaurants. Studies have shown that with proper acoustic treatment, combined with simple listening tactics like turning one ear towards the speaker at a 30-degree angle, users can achieve up to a 4-decibel improvement in speech intelligibility, which can mean the difference between understanding nothing and perfect understanding.","context":["Simple listening tactic could be especially beneficial for cochlear implant users in noisy social settings study finds.\nListeners in a noisy situation benefit from facing slightly away from the person they are listening to, turning one ear towards the speech, concludes a study by Cardiff University, funded by UK charity Action on Hearing Loss (RNID).\nThis listening tactic was found to be especially beneficial for cochlear implant users who typically struggle in noisy social settings such as restaurants. It was also found to be compatible with lip reading which was unaffected by a modest, 30-degree head orientation, illustrating that the benefits of lip-reading and turning an ear towards a talker can be combined.\nDr Jacques Grange from Cardiff University’s School of Psychology said:\n“Noise can be a big issue for any listener and especially for someone with a cochlear implant. Our study shows that by simply turning one ear towards the person they are listening to, cochlear implant users find it much easier to hear that person above background noise, enabling them to engage in conversations in noisy environments, and not become isolated. It’s better to have a clear signal in one ear than a mediocre signal in both.”\nWhen tested in the laboratory, with the speech in front of the listener and interfering noise behind, the technique resulted in a 4-decibel improvement to intelligibility of speech in a noisy environment for both normal-hearing listeners and cochlear implant users. A 4-decibel improvement can be the difference between understanding nothing and perfect understanding.\nDr Ralph Holme, Head of Biomedical Research at Action on Hearing Loss said:\n“Action on Hearing Loss is delighted to have funded this important study which has highlighted a simple, yet effective tactic that everyone can use to help hear friends and family in noisy places such as restaurants and hopefully this advice can be relayed to cochlear implant users who would really stand to benefit. We are also campaigning for bars, restaurants and cafes to do more to improve their acoustics to make it easier for people with a hearing loss to engage in conversation.”\nTo simulate a realistic restaurant listening situation, acoustic measurements were also taken in the Mezza Luna restaurant in Cardiff and used to create a virtual acoustic simulation. In the simulation normally hearing listeners were tested at each table with three different head orientations: facing the target talker, with a 30-degree head turn to the left, or with a 30-degree head turn to the right. The data showed that a significant head-orientation benefit still occurred with this high level of realism.\nThe two experiments allow for conclusions to be made about the causal effect of head turning on the understanding of speech in both a laboratory and a real-world setting.\nSource: Cardiff University\nImage credit: Cardiff University\nA Atlantic Hearing Aid Center opened its doors in January 1971 and has been serving the hearing community ever since!

{"question":"I'm a digital animation student. Can you explain how early animation studios developed their iconic characters, and what technological limitations did they face in producing their cartoons?","answer":"Early animation studios faced significant technical limitations as they worked before advances like animation cels, making their process quite primitive. Despite these constraints, studios managed to create enduring characters. For example, the Fleischer brothers developed Koko the Clown, who appeared in 'Out of the Inkwell' cartoons like 'The Circus' (1920), and later created icons like Popeye and Betty Boop. Similarly, Walter Lantz, who initially appeared as a live-action animator in cartoons like 'Lost and Found' (1926) featuring Dinky Doodle, went on to create characters like Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willy. The period from 1930 to 1960 became known as the golden age of hand-drawn animation, when soundtracks became fully integrated with visual images and cartoon shorts became standard features alongside films.","context":["Even if you're not old enough to remember when animated cartoons were every bit as big a draw as the main feature showing at your neighborhood movie theatre, you're probably familiar with the fact that cartoon icons like Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse unleashed their shenanigans on the big screen before going into retirement on the small screen. You see, cartoons weren't just for kids -- they were produced for all ages! Animated cartoons are nearly as old as motion pictures themselves; as far back as 1900, pioneers like Emile Cohl, Winsor McCay and J. Stuart Blackton ushered in the art of moving screen images that were, in a nutshell, drawings brought to life.\nOne of J. Stuart Blackton's earliest efforts, Lightning Sketches (1907), is one of several shorts (fifteen in all) featured on a collection entitled Cartoon Roots, a joint DVD/Blu-ray venture between Thunderbean Animation -- a company whose previous home video releases include Technicolor Dreams & Black and White Nightmares and Noveltoons: Original Classics -- and Cartoons on Film, a company specializing in animated shorts from the silent era. Tommy J. Stathes is the CEO of the latter establishment, a highly respected film archivist/historian whom you might have seen chatting it up with Turner Classic Movies' Robert Osborne back in October of 2014 on a very entertaining special entitled 100th Anniversary of Bray Studios.\nA few of the selections from Cartoon Roots were also showcased on the (John Randolph) Bray anniversary special. The Circus (1920) is one example, an 'Out of the Inkwell' cartoon featuring Koko the Clown (who's frustrated by the antics of an ornery circus equine), who would later migrate with the creative Fleischer brothers (Max, Dave, and Joe) to a studio that also became home to such cartoon icons as Popeye and Betty Boop. The same goes for Lost and Found (1926), in which Dinky Doodle and his dog Weakheart give chase to a kidnapper who's made off with a fetching young lovely. The live-action animator in the cartoon dons a Sherlockian disguise and enters the short, in cartoon form, to help out Dinky and his pal, and that animator is none other than Walter Lantz, who later started his own studio that put stars like Andy Panda, Woody Woodpecker and Chilly Willy on the payroll.\nSo you can see why the presentation is titled Cartoon Roots; it features some of the earliest work by individuals who ultimately became prominent figures in the field of animation. Cartoons on Tour (1915) is from the Raoul Barre studio, one of the earliest animation companies (future film director Gregory La Cava was on the payroll) and Tour spotlights a nice mix of live-action and animation in one of Barre's amusing 'Grouch Chaser' frolics. The Jolly Rounders (1923) is an early 'Aesop's Fables' effort from Paul Terry, who also worked his way up to animation studio mogul -- his Terrytoons featured such stars as Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle. (The 1923 cartoon Springtime is another one of Terry's 'fables,' starring one of his earliest cartoon stars, Farmer Al Falfa.) Animation legend Dick Huemer (in tandem with Sid Marcus and Art Davis) is represented with a 1930 RKO entry, The Milkman, starring the now-forgotten Toby the Pup.\nWhen I was growing up, weekends were often set aside to pay my father's parents a visit, and one of the things I recall most about dropping in on Grandma and Grandpa was Grandpa subscribed to a magazine entitled The Good Old Days, featuring reprints of comic strips from that bygone era. So some of my favorite shorts on Cartoon Roots feature characters from the 'funny papers': Bud Fisher's Mutt and Jeff are represented with Fireman, Save My Child (1919); George Herriman's Krazy Kat in Scents and Nonsense (1926, quite different from the depiction of K.K. in the comics); Walter Hoban's Jerry on the Job in The Bomb Idea (1920). Watching these cartoons was not unlike seeing the comic pages literally come to life. I had long thought that the early era 'Bobby Bumps' character (who appears on Roots in Bobby Bumps Starts to School ) was based on R.F. Outcault's Buster Brown, but in an extra included among the many in this set, there's revealing background that Bumps' creator Earl Hurd drew an embryonic version of his creation entitled 'Brick Bodkin' for The New York Journal from 1912 to 1914.\nRounding out the cartoons on Cartoon Roots are Col. Heeza Liar, Detective (1923), a most entertaining short (which was also featured on TCM's Bray tribute) similar to Lost and Found in that the Colonel must use his powers of deduction to track down a rooster thief. Sadly, Heeza Liar never made it to the comic strip pages (there probably would have been competition with the likes of Happy Hooligan and Hawkshaw the Detective), but Pat Sullivan's Felix the Cat did shortly after his debut on the silver screen. The famous feline stars in the inventive Felix Comes Back (1923) in the Cartoon Roots collection. The last cartoon is a 1932 Van Beuren offering entitled The Farmerette, which is the only entry here to feature spoken dialogue (though some of the others feature it among the sound effects). It treads too far into Betty Boop territory, and the imitation unfortunately makes it the weakest short in the collection.\nThe most incredible find on Cartoon Roots -- and one that definitely makes it worthy of 'Where's That Been?' status -- is a 1930 short entitled Hoe-Toe Mollie. It stars the irrepressible Binko the Cub, a would-be employee of the Romer-Grey studios (the 'Grey' was the son of famed Western novelist Zane Grey). A series that never got off the ground, Binko starred in two unreleased shorts (the first being Arabian NIghtmare) that featured work from Bob and Tom McKimson, Preston Blair, Pete Burness, Cal Dalton, Ken Harris and Riley Thomson. These animators would later work for the likes of Warner Bros., MGM and Walt Disney. Both shorts were long believed to be lost, but Stathes and collaborator David Gerstein unearthed a mostly-complete print of Mollie in the Library of Congress, and with that, film preservation was allowed to do that voodoo it does so well.\nIf you're as crazy about cartoons as I am, I know you will enjoy watching Cartoon Roots. Keep in mind that while the shorts are a bit primitive (this was many years before strides like animation cels and the like came about) it doesn't make them any less entertaining, and some of them feature some really side-splitting gags. (I never fail to marvel at the imaginative ways Felix finds to use question marks and his tail.) Animation lovers, silent film devotees, and aficionados of movie history will unquestionably want to see Cartoon Roots on their DVD or Blu-ray shelf.\nIvan G.

These images changed position slightly as the cylinder turned and thus appeared to be in motion. This invention has been dated back as far as second-century China but became popular in the West only as late as the mid-19th century.\nFlip books, in which readers riffle the pages so that a sequence of drawings appears to move, were invented in England around this same time, made possible partly by the development of cheap paper. Whereas zoetropes were circular and therefore best suited to repetitious, cyclical motions such as the galloping of a horse, flip books could portray a linear sequence.\nSome of the earliest creators of motion pictures, at the turn of the 20th century, experimented with animation. The French filmmaker Georges Méliès discovered stop-motion animation by accident when objects changed position in a scene he was shooting while the camera was halted by a malfunction. Another French filmmaker, Émile Cohl, pioneered drawn animation shortly afterward with his film Fantasmagorie (1908), which consisted mostly of simple drawings of human figures, animals, and other objects doing fanciful things. During the following decade, drawn animations grew more sophisticated, became known as cartoons, and began to be shown regularly in movie theaters.\nThe period from 1930 to 1960 is considered the golden age of hand-drawn animation. Soundtracks had become fully integrated with the visual images, moviegoers had come to expect cartoon shorts alongside feature films, and many series were built upon popular cartoon characters such as Felix the Cat, Mickey Mouse, Betty Boop, and Popeye the Sailor. After success with Mickey Mouse and a transition to color images, Walt Disney began to plan what became the first feature-length animation to be released in the United States, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1938). The production almost bankrupted Disney's studio, but the finished film was a huge commercial and critical success, to be followed by Pinocchio, Fantasia, Bambi, and other releases.\nTelevision created a new outlet for animation, but animators who wanted to create enough material to fill a weekly series were hampered by the slow, labor-intensive nature of hand-drawn animation. The animation directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, after success in the movies with Tom and Jerry cartoons, solved this problem by using partial animation, in which most of the drawings remained static and only essential parts needed to change from one frame to the next. Their characters, such as The Flintstones and The Jetsons, had muzzle-like mouths so that the rest of the face (except the eyes) could remain stationary while they talked.\nTelevision was an early adopter of computer-generated animation for applications such as title sequences and dynamic weather maps.\nComputer-generated animations began appearing in feature films in the 1970s. One of the first instances was in Westworld (1973), where they were used to show the point of view of a robotic character. In the original Star Wars film (1977), they were displayed as part of a training exercise for the attack on the Death Star. In the 1980s, the technology was advanced enough to render computer-generated images (CGI) to represent real objects rather than schematics. For example, the spaceships that appeared in The Last Starfighter (1984) were all rendered by CGI. In the 1990s, CGI was able to represent human body movements and even skin texture with considerable realism.\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, some animators adopted a new technique, motion capture, to render body movements with greater realism than was possible with purely computer-generated images. To use this technique, the animator films a live actor in motion, usually covered in a black suit dotted with white balls. The computer tracks the motion of the balls in the film and then reassigns these movements to the corresponding locations on the body of an artistic creation, such as a monster. The Polar Express (2004) was the first entirely computer-animated 3-D film to use motion capture.\nAnimation has been important in video games since the late 1970s, when the games moved beyond purely geometrical images (as in Pong) and began to depict aliens, asteroids, and angry gorillas. At first, only arcade game machines had sufficient computing power to render the sophisticated graphics of the most detailed and fastest paced animations, but beefed-up home consoles eventually lured dedicated gamers away from the arcades.\nWhen desktop computers shifted from text-based to graphic interfaces in the 1980s, they improved on simple animations, such as hourglasses, and began to use more sophisticated animations to represent common operations, such as files being copied from one drive to another. Personal computers have also made it possible for amateurs to create complex animations and share them on sites such as YouTube. Animation continues to improve every year. Today's video games, such as Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor (2014) and Call of Duty: Black Ops III (2015), feature characters with complex physical movements and facial expressions that are the most realistic and lifelike yet.\nJuly 24, 2017\nJuly 20, 2017\nJuly 19, 2017\nJuly 18, 2017\nFree sample resumes and expert advice\nFree sample cover letters and expert advice\nSample interview questions and expert advice\nGet networking tips and expert advice"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7938221e-c8df-4b58-8b37-b873c259c0a1>","<urn:uuid:094b66f8-881f-4de9-acff-f13f65555419>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was the financial achievement of MindMaze in its first funding round and what is the company's self-description?","answer":"MindMaze raised $100 million in its first funding round, achieving a valuation of over $1 billion dollars. The company describes itself as the 'world's first end-to-end multisensory computing platform.'","context":["In VR, immersion and presence are the result of, essentially, tricking your brain. But what if that same technology could \"trick\" your brain enough that it helped you recover from paralysis? A company called MindMaze has this very mission in mind, and it's expanding its work out into the consumer and business space.\nMindMaze currently operates in the healthcare industry, and its products combine aspects of virtual reality, computer vision, neurosciences, AI and haptic feedback in a variety of patient treatments, but the company is going to license its technology to be sold to consumers and businesses.\nAnd it has the funds to do so: The company, which calls itself the “world’s first end-to-end multisensory computing platform,” announced today that it has raised $100 million in its first funding round, leading to a valuation of over $1 billion dollars.\nWe had the chance to speak with the CEO of MindMaze, Tej Tadi, to learn more about the company and the technology fueling the investment excitement. With a billion-dollar valuation and ties to virtual reality technology, we were intrigued, to say the least.\nTadi told us that he has a background in electronic engineering, earned a master’s degree in VR and graphics, and then went on to study neuroscience. With this unique skillset, he was able to develop a number of tools that have been used in the medical field to help patients recover from paralysis caused by stroke or other brain damage. These tools also offer medical professionals measurable data about patient recovery.\nMindMaze currently manufactures a product that is designed to help stroke and brain injury patients regain control of paralyzed limbs. Tadi told us that this product uses motion capture sensors to track a patient moving their arm or hand. MindMaze uses a VR HMD to deliver a rendered version of their moving arm, but mirrored to the opposite hand. The idea is that the patient moves their able arm, but their brain is tricked into thinking that their paralyzed hand moved. Tadi said that this confuses the brain into disbelief, but it accepts that the motion is real because a real trigger to move an arm came from the brain. Tadi told us this process has been shown to accelerate recovery from paralysis onset by brain injuries.\n“If someone can’t move their hand but they see it happen on a virtual avatar, it helps trick the bran into believing that the hand can move, and it actually starts to accelerate recovery,” said Tej Tadi, CEO, MindMaze. “Just by watching his avatar move, though he cannot really physically move his hand, it triggers that recovery. It’s a very powerful trick. It’s interesting to see.”\nThis technology can, and is, also applied to amputees. Many people who have lost a limb suffer from phantom pain -- that is, they feel pain emanating from the missing appendage. Tadi told us that amputee patients report instant relief from phantom pains, and psychologically, they become unaware of their disability because they can no longer perceive the missing part when wearing the HMD.\nMindMaze has developed technologies for motion capture of fingers and full body movement, facial expression detection, haptic feedback, and 3D rendering. Tadi said that between 2010 and 2012, he realized that all of these components are fundamental pieces needed for full immersive VR, and shifted towards making a unified platform of all these different technologies.\nMindMaze develops its own hardware and software, allowing the company to maintain control of its pipeline. Tadi told us the proprietary MindMaze platform needed to be able to “meet the very stringent needs for medical pieces” while remaining applicable to “gaming and other consumer media.”\nTadi said he took the company down the medical path because he saw a need there, but he noted that another reason is that because any medical tech proves itself by maintaining stringent certifications. “You’ve got to prove your tech beyond doubt and it makes sense to have your own hardware,” he said.\nThe next step for MindMaze is to move into other verticals beyond the medical sector, which it will do by licensing the technology platform to third parties that will sell products to businesses and consumers.\nTadi was not willing to go into specifics, but he said we will hear about the first consumer-facing product in the near future. He did say that future products will include facial tracking sensors that can detect fatigue. Tadi said the first example of this tech will be used in pilot and driver training software.\nThe $100 million first round investment into MindMaze will help the company bring its technology into other markets. We asked Tadi what his ultimate vision for MindMaze will be, and his response leads us to believe that $100 million is just the beginning. \"It’s a lot like the 'Intel Inside' model. A lot of the human experiences are going to be powered by MindMaze,\" he said."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:198aab8d-1634-4514-b30c-a6019f963e2e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do consistency and commitment play in human behavior, and how might this relate to mental health treatment adherence?","answer":"People have an almost obsessive desire to be consistent with their prior actions and commitments, leading to personal and interpersonal pressures to behave in ways that justify earlier decisions. Once someone takes a visible stand, they feel driven to maintain that position to appear consistent. This psychological principle can be connected to mental health treatment, where consistency is crucial for recovery. Treatment success often requires ongoing commitment to both medication and therapy - it's not enough to rely solely on medication. For the best possible outcome, patients need to consistently participate in counseling, group support, and other therapeutic activities as part of a comprehensive treatment approach.","context":["You and I exist in an extraordinarily complicated stimulus environment, easily the most rapidly moving and complex that has ever existed on this planet. To deal with it, we need shortcuts. We can’t be expected to recognize and analyze all the aspects in each person, event, and situation we encounter in even on day. We haven’t the time, energy, or capacity for it. Instead, we must very often use our stereotypes, our rules of thumb to classify things according to a few key features and then to respond mindlessly when on or another of these trigger features is present.”\nDr. Cialdini’s book, “Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion” explains the psychology of why people mindlessly say yes, including 6 universal principles and how to use them to become a skilled persuader. This is a *must read* book for business/marketing professionals who want to understand the science of persuasion and the psychological foundations of marketing.\nWhat follows are some of the insights (straight from the book) that I found most fascinating for each principle of influence.\n- By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like.\n- Most of us find it highly disagreeable to be in a state of obligation.\n- Because the rule for reciprocation governs the compromise process, it is possible to use an initial concession as part of a highly effective compliance technique. The technique is a simple one that we can call the rejection-then-retreat technique. Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will more likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along. Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own, the only one I would have immediately open to me — compliance with your second request.\n- If I want you to lend me five dollars, I can make it seem like a smaller request by first asking you to lend me ten dollars and then retreating to five dollars, I will have simultaneously engaged the force of the reciprocity rule and the contrast principle. Not only will my five-dollar request be viewed as a concession to be reciprocated, it will also look to you like a smaller request than if I had just asked for it straightaway.\nCommitment and Consistency\n- It is, quite simply, our nearly obsessive desire to be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done. Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision.\n- They (department stores) undersupply the stores with the toys they’ve gotten the parents to promise. Most parents find those things sold out and are forced to substitute other toys of equal value. The toy manufacturers, of course, make a point of supplying the stores with plenty of these substitutes. Then, after Christmas, the companies start running the ads again for the other, special toys.\n- Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with the stand.\n- …people who have just asserted that they are doing/feeling fine–even as a routine part of a sociable exchange–will consequently find it awkward to appear stingy in the context of their own admittedly favored circumstances.\n- …be very careful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not only increase our compliance with very similar, much larger quests…”\n- …what those around us think is true of us is enormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true.\n- Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a drive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person.\n- Persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.\n- Social scientists have determined that we accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressures.\n- The principle of social proof states that one means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct.\n- In an ambiguous situation, the tendency for everyone to be looking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating phenomenon called “pluralistic ignorance.”\n- A victim is much more likely to be helped by a lone bystander than by a group, especially if the people in the group are strangers to one another. It seems that the pluralistic ignorance effect is strongest among strangers: Because we like to look poised and sophisticated in public and because we are unfamiliar with the reactions of those we do not know, we are unlikely to give off or correctly read expressions of concern when in a grouping of strangers. Therefore, a possible emergency becomes viewed as a non-emergency, and the victim suffers.\n- We will use the actions of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves, especially when we view those others as similar to ourselves.\nWhat are the factors that cause one person to like another person?\n- Physical attractiveness\n- Contact and Cooperation\n- School desegregation is more likely to increase prejudice than to decrease it.\n- Because much of the heightened prejudice from classroom desegregation seems to stem from increased exposure to outside group members as rivals, these educators have experimented with forms of learning in which cooperation rather than competition with classmates is central.\n- The crucial procedure was the experimenters’ imposition of common goals on the groups. It was the cooperation required to achieve these goals that finally allowed the rival group members to experience one another as reasonable fellows.\n- The evidence that team oriented learning is an antidote to this disorder may tell us about the heavy impact of cooperation on the liking the process.\n- Conditioning and Association\n- There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news.\n- (On intensely loyal sports fans who buy tickets to games they did not attend): Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth that directs them to seek prestige not from the generation or promotion of their own attainments, but from the generation or promotion of their associations with others of attainment.\n- It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the (Milgram “shock”) study.\n- The paradox is, of course, the same on that attends all major weapons of influence. Once we realize that obedience to authority is mostly rewarding, it is easy to allow ourselves the convenience of automatic obedience. The simultaneous blessing and bane of such blind obedience is its mechanical character. We don’t have to think; therefore, we don’t. Although such mindless obedience leads us to appropriate action in the great majority of cases, there will be conspicuous exceptions — because we are reacting rather than thinking.\n- [On the extent of mechanical obedience to doctor’s orders]: (1) The prescription was transmitted by phone, in direct violation of hospital policy. (2) The medication itself was unauthorized; Astrogen had not been cleared for use nor placed on the ward stock list. (3) The prescribed dosage was obviously and dangerously excessive. The medication containers clearly stated the the “maximum daily dose” was only ten milligrams, half of what had been ordered. (4) The directive was given by a man the nurse had never met, seen, or even talked with before on the phone. Yet, in 95 percent of the instances, the nurses went straightaway to the ward medicine cabinet, where they secured the ordered dosage of Astrogen and started for the patient’s room to administer it.\n- …because we know that the things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess, we can often use an item’s availability to help us quickly and correctly decide on it’s quality. Thus, one reason for the potency of the scarcity principle is that, by following it, we are usually and efficiently right.\n- The drop from abundance to scarcity produces a decidedly more positive reaction than does constant scarcity (i.e you value things more that have recently become more scarce).\n- Not only do we want the same item more when it is scarce, we want it most when we are in competition for it.\n- The joy is not in experiencing a scarce commodity but in possessing it. It is important that we do not confuse the two.\nVery often in making a decision about someone or something, we don’t use all the relevant available information ; we use, instead, only a single, highly representative piece of total. And an isolated piece of information, even though it normally counsels us correctly, can lead us to clearly stupid mistakes — mistakes that, when exploited by clever others, leave us looking silly or worse.","Stress is at an all-time high in the United States, and the American Psychological Association says effects of the coronavirus will be “serious and long-lasting.” If everybody is feeling lonely and anxious, how do you know when it’s time to get help? The good news is that you don’t have to figure it out yourself. The National Rehab Hotline at 866-210-1303 can answer your questions confidentially and free of charge. Find out where to go for treatment, what the symptoms of specific conditions are, or how to approach some else if you think they need help. The hotline operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nWhat Is Mental Health?\n“Mental health” refers to the condition of your psychological, social, and emotional well-being. It determines how you think, deal with stress, get along with others, and make decisions. It affects you from childhood through adulthood and varies over the years, depending on factors like brain chemistry, DNA, and other biological factors; history of abuse or trauma; and genetic predisposition to mental illness.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lists 15 early warning signs that something might be wrong:\n1. Lack of energy or motivation\n2. Sleeping too little or too much\n3. Feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, or numbness\n4. Withdrawing from activities or people that once brought pleasure\n5. Unexplained physical complaints and illnesses\n6. Feelings of helplessness or inability to act\n7. Trouble getting along with family or friends\n8. Increase in use of alcohol, drugs, or nicotine\n9. Intense mood swings that affect performance and social life\n10. Relationship problems caused by moodiness\n11. Irritability, confusion, anger, anxiety, fear, or memory problems\n12. Compulsive thinking or unwanted memories\n13. Believing things that aren’t true or hearing voices\n14. Thoughts of harming oneself or others\n15. Inability to carry out daily responsibilities at home or work\nGood mental health enables you to live up to your potential, cope with stress, be productive, and contribute to society in meaningful ways. Living a healthy lifestyle, having a positive attitude, being part of a community, and helping others play a role. It’s also important to learn ways to cope with stress, practice good self-care habits, and ask for help when it’s needed.\nMental illness can be treated. Symptoms and treatments vary, however, depending on the individual and the specific illness.\nWhat Is Mental Illness?\nMental illness, or mental disorder, is a general term for any health problem that interferes with thinking, behavior, or relationships and makes you unable to perform daily tasks. It includes a group of illnesses diagnosed by specific criteria.\nHere are some of the most common mental disorders:\n1. Anxiety, including generalized anxiety disorder, phobias, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder\n2. Mood disorders, including bipolar disorder and depression\n3. Personality disorders, including narcissistic personality and borderline personality disorders\n4. Eating disorders, including anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating\n5. Post-traumatic stress disorder\n6. Psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia\nDuring their lives, approximately 1 in 2 Americans will be diagnosed with a mental disorder, an assessment that is based on medical history, a psychological evaluation, and a physical exam. Disorders may also occur together, or one may follow another. Examples include depression and anxiety or substance use disorder and PTSD.\nWhat Causes Mental Health Disorders?\nMental illness can’t be attributed to a single cause, but it may be linked to a variety of specific factors. The three most common include family history and genes, chemical imbalances in the brain or other biological conditions, and past trauma or abuse. Other factors include traumatic brain injury, exposure to toxins in the womb, substance use, and serious physical illness. Individuals who have few friends or feel isolated are also at risk.\nHow Is a Mental Crisis Different From a Mental Emergency?\nA mental health emergency can involve an imminent threat to oneself or others, but it can also apply to someone who is not able to function, extremely disoriented and out of touch with reality, or out of control and distraught. Examples include someone who is acting on a threat to commit suicide or threatening to hurt someone. It may also apply to severe intoxication or highly unpredictable, dangerous behavior. For a mental health emergency, call 911.\nA mental health crisis is a situation that involves someone who is in emotional distress, has thoughts of harm to self or others, is out of touch with reality, unable to function, and can’t calm down. An example is talk of suicide without imminent danger. Substance use, going off psychiatric medications, low mood, and eating disorders may fall into this category.\nIf there is doubt, call 911. If the situation is ongoing but not an immediate threat, it’s time to talk to someone about getting help. In this case, resources like The National Rehab Hotline 866-210-1303 can help.\nIs It a Myth or a Fact?\nThe knowledge and administration of mental health care have improved in the past 20 years, but there are still misconceptions that create a stigma and prevent many of us from getting the care we need. Let’s put these myths to rest:\n1. Mental health problems only affect a minority of our society.\nMental illness is common. In 2014, 20% of American adults experienced a mental disorder, and half of those involved major depression. Four in 100 had a serious illness, such as major depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder.\n2. Mental illness makes people dangerous.\nOnly 3-5% of violent acts result from people with a serious mental illness, but individuals with severe mental disorders are over 10 times more likely to be victims of violent acts than the rest of the population.\n3. Children don’t have mental health disorders.\nChildren may show symptoms of mental health issues when they’re very young, but they usually can’t be diagnosed at that age. Approximately 1 in 2 mental health disorders show up before the age of 14, and 3 in 4 start before the age of 24. Fewer than 1 in 5 children and teens who can be diagnosed get the treatment they need.\n4. Jobs are too stressful for people with mental illness.\nSometimes, someone who has a severe mental health problem can’t do a particular job, but most can be as productive as anyone else. With proper treatment, they have fewer medical expenses, are absent from work less often, and incur fewer disability expenses.\n5. Mental health issues result from a lack of motivation or willpower.\nMental illness is not a sign of weakness or poor character. On the contrary, a person has to be strong to fight a mental health condition. Telling someone to “snap out of it” is hurtful, and it’s simply not possible. They may get better with treatment, and many completely recover.\n6. Talk therapy and self-help programs don’t work.\nTreatment varies for every patient and may include counseling and/or medication, depending on the disorder and the individual. A strong support system is crucial to recovery and relapse prevention.\n7. There’s nothing friends or family can do.\nLoved ones can assist by making treatment accessible, reaching out with support, learning about the illness and its symptoms, and treating the individual with respect.\n8. Mental conditions can’t be prevented.\nEliminating or reducing factors that contribute to mental illness helps people of all ages, but it is especially important for children and adolescents. It leads to better education, lower crime rates, greater productivity, stronger economic conditions, lower health care expenses, a better quality of life, and longer lifespans.\n9. Medication is all it takes to get well.\nSome illnesses require prescription medications to keep them under control, but counseling and group support are also essential for the best possible outcome. Some conditions don’t need to be treated with pills, but talk therapy and cognitive-behavioral training are still important.\nHow to Find a Treatment Center\nBecause everyone has unique needs and responses, they also respond differently to treatment. A rehab program tailored to suit individual patients improves recovery rates and lowers the odds of relapse. Depending on issues like budget and work demands, programs may be inpatient or outpatient. Inpatient programs include live-in facilities, and outpatient services allow participants to return home at night.\nSubstance use disorder often occurs along with mental health disorders, and it affects the lives of addicts and everyone around them. To succeed, rehab must address substance use and co-occurring disorders, careers, health and general well-being, and relationships. It should also uncover the original cause for the addiction and offer ways to replace the old behavior with healthier ways to deal with stress and trauma.\nA medically supervised detox program is usually the first step for addicts, followed by rehab and aftercare. The entire process is easier if one provider offers detox, rehab, and treatment of both substance use and mental disorders.\nSeven Reasons to Call a Mental Health Hotline\nIt’s easy to get overwhelmed when you or someone you love is in distress, and talking to friends or relatives may be difficult. Reaching out saves lives, however, and a hotline provides the ear of a compassionate professional who knows how to deal with a mental health crisis. Sometimes, a brief conversation is all it takes to put things in perspective and move forward.\nA helpline can help in many ways, including these:\n1. Providing information about mental health treatment centers and how they work\n2. Educating callers about mental health issues and their impact on society\n3.

Supporting callers during times of crisis\nMaking the Call\nMost people don’t like asking for help, even when they get stuck and don’t know to move forward. The good news is that it’s never too early to call a helpline when someone is in distress, and there are no silly questions. Sometimes, it’s enough just to know you aren’t on the path alone. Most people who attempt suicide, for example, don’t want to die. They’re just too distraught to go on with the life they’re living. Reaching out for help, however briefly, can save lives.\nWhen you call The National Rehab Hotline, make a list of the things you want to know beforehand, and keep a pen and paper handy to jot down information. Our staff members know that you feel vulnerable and reluctant to share your story, and they’re trained to get to the core of the matter without making you more distraught. We listen without judging, suggest steps for moving forward, and make recommendations or referrals. In the end, however, it’s up to callers to weigh the information we provide and decide how to proceed."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2616c4ad-8307-414c-8267-c1771a28f27b>","<urn:uuid:8a95890c-bb91-4d68-9553-26c9600d9fea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which government agency enforces the Information Blocking Final Rule versus HIPAA compliance?","answer":"The Information Blocking Final Rule is enforced by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, while HIPAA compliance is enforced by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The OCR has investigated over 150,000 HIPAA Privacy Rule complaints since 2003, while the OIG will impose penalties of up to $1 million per violation for Information Blocking Rule violations.","context":["New Federal Information Blocking Law, Healthcare\nThe 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT Certification Program, also known as the Information Blocking Final Rule, is an amended federal healthcare law that was passed by the U.S. Congress in 2020. The 21st Century Cures Act was initially enacted by U.S. Congress in 2016 for the purpose of improving the nation’s healthcare system. More specifically, as stated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the FDA, the law was designed to “help accelerate medical product development and bring new innovations and advances to patients who need them faster and more efficiently.” With this being said, the Information Blocking Final Rule was passed in order to address the widespread issue that information blocking has presented to both patients and healthcare professionals within the medical industry.\nDue to the fact that information blocking can result in a wide variety of adverse consequences for U.S. healthcare patients, as the practice effectively makes it more difficult for said patients to share and transfer their Electronic Health Information or EHI to other providers, federal legislation was created to reduce the measures, policies, and tactics that have been used in the past decade to prevent U.S. citizens from being able to fully access their healthcare information and data. To this point, the law establishes a number of provisions that are geared toward enabling healthcare professionals and patients within the U.S. to access and share their EHI when looking to provide or receive medical services.\nWhat are the provisions of the Information Blocking Final Rule?\nThe Information Blocking Final Rule prohibits healthcare providers, EHI vendors, and other related professionals from undertaking any policy, measure, or practice that would be likely to interfere with, or discourage the access to or exchange of EHI. These policies, measures, and practices can include hospitals that customize their EHI systems to intentionally create barriers to the access and disclosure of EHI, health IT vendors that discourage customers from getting data integration capabilities from third-party providers, and healthcare systems that require their workers to obtain written authorization prior to disclosing the EHI of a particular patient, among a host of others.\nWhat’s more, the Information Blocking Final Rule also updated the data elements and personal information that are considered to be Patient Health Information or PHI under applicable legislation. Prior to the enactment of the Information Blocking Final Rule, PHI was limited to the data elements contained within the first version of the United States Core Data for Interoperability or the USCDIv1 for short. Such data elements included specific classes of health data, including vital signs, clinical notes, patient demographics, personal information concerning patients such as their names and addresses, as well as data concerning lab reports, among other details. However, after October 6, 2022, all information within a U.S. healthcare patient’s medical records, with the exception of psychotherapy notes and information that has been collected in relation to litigation or administrative action, will constitute PHI.\nInformation Blocking Exceptions\nWhile the provisions of the Information Blocking Final Rule generally forbid healthcare providers and professionals from taking steps to prevent their respective patients from sharing or accessing their EHI, there are some exceptions to the law. Many of these exceptions are geared toward instances in which the blocking of the EHI of a patient is done to protect the privacy of a patient, or to safeguard a patient from material harm, among others. As such, the exceptions to the Information Blocking Final Rule include:\n- Preventing harm exception.\n- Privacy exception.\n- Security exception.\n- Infeasibility exception.\n- Health IT performance exception\n- Content and manner exception.\n- Fees exception.\n- Licensing exception.\nWhat are the penalties for violating the Information Blocking Final Rule?\nAs it relates to the enforcement of the law, the Information Blocking Final Rule is enforced by the Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the OIG for short. To this point, health information networks (HIN) and health information exchanges (HIE) that violate the law are subject to a wide range of fines, penalties, and sanctions. Most notably, HINs and HIEs that fail to comply with the Information Blocking Final Rule will be subject to a monetary penalty of up to $1 million per violation, once all of the provisions of the law have been put into effect after October 6, 2022. Additionally, healthcare providers and professionals that violate the law will also be subject to “appropriate disincentives”, though these regulations have yet to be implemented.\nWhile citizens of the U.S. may not be aware of the adverse effects of having their EHI or PHI blocked, the practice serves to reduce the level of care that many American citizens receive when visiting their doctors or healthcare providers. As such, federal legislation has been enacted to punish individuals and organizations that are found to have engaged in practices that work to block the EHI and PHI of the patients that they serve. While all of the provisions set forth in the law have yet to come into effect, the end goal is to ensure that all patients within the U.S. healthcare system can access and share the data that is used to treat their various ailments and illnesses, at their own discretion.","HIPAA Compliance Best Practices\nQuestions and Answers to Improve Security and Avoid Penalties\nBy Bill Becker\nEven after 14 years, public and private sector organizations are still routinely found out of compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Security management processes are among the weakest links in HIPAA compliance. In this article, we’ll look at some of the basics that covered entities and their business partners need to follow to ensure that they are not hit with financial or other penalties.\nFor the uninitiated, HIPAA regulates the use and disclosure of certain information held by health plans, health insurers, and medical service providers that engage in many types of transactions.\nEnforcement of HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules falls to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Enforcement of compliance began in 2005, with OCR becoming responsible for Security Rule enforcement four years later. Since April 2003, over 150,000 HIPAA Privacy Rule complaints have been investigated by OCR. 98% (or 147,826) of the complaints have been resolved.\n3 Steps To HIPAA Compliance\nPlease see HIPAA Journal\n- Step 1 : Download Checklist.\n- Step 2 : Review Your Business.\n- Step 3 : Get Compliant!\nThe HIPAA Journal compliance checklist provides the top priorities for your organization to become fully HIPAA compliant.\nOCR enforces HIPAA Rules by applying “corrective measures,” including ether settlement or a civil cash penalty.\nOnly 47 cases have resulted in a settlement, although the total monetary penalty is still an eye-opening $67,210,982.00. Most compliance issues, OCR reports, stem from improper use or disclosure of electronic protected health information (ePHI); poor health information safeguards; inadequate patient access to their ePHI; and the absence of administrative safeguard for such information.\nIn other words, there is a fundamental failure in developing and maintaining appropriate security management processes. Which is ironic because one of the very first stipulations in HIPAA § 164.308 (a)(1) calls for organizations to implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.\nThere are several required specifications to implement these management safeguards. These include the following:\nRisk analysis – Accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity (or its business associate/s).\nRisk management – Security measures to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a “reasonable and appropriate level.”\nSanction policy – Workforce members who do not comply with the security policies and procedures must be sanctioned according to a standard policy applied to violations.\nInformation system activity review – Procedures to review records of information system activity, including audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports.\nBefore any of that, however, organizations must use best practices to get their arms around the protected information under their control, and to apply some common sense thinking to managing access to that information.\nLet’s look at some of these best practices.\nIdentify relevant information systems – It seems obvious, but here’s where many organizations fail. You have to be able to identify all information systems that house ePHI. Moreover, you have to be able to analyze business functions and verify the ownership and control of those information systems.\nAsk yourself the following questions:\n- Does the hardware and software in your information systems include removable media and remote access devices?\n- Have you identified the types of information you manage?\n- Have you identified and evaluated the sensitivity of each type of information?\nConduct a risk assessment – You have to have an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.\nTo ensure accuracy and thoroughness, ask yourself the following questions:\n- Is the facility located in a region prone to any natural disasters?\n- Have you assigned responsibility to check all hardware?\n- Have you analyzed current safeguards and identifiable risks?\n- Have you considered all processes involving ePHI — including creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting protected information?\nAcquire IT systems and services – After identifying your systems and exposure to risk, you may find that you’ll need additional hardware, software or services to adequately protect information such as:\n- Multi-Factor Authentication\n- Data-at-Rest Encryption\n- Data-in-Transit Encryption\n- Cryptographic Key Management\nWhen planning for new systems or services, ask yourself the following questions:\n- Will new security controls work with the existing IT architecture?\n- Have you conducted a cost-benefit analysis to make sure the investment is reasonable when measured against potential security risks?\nCreate and deploy policies and procedures – This is the crux of any working set of management processes. You have to have policies that clearly establish roles and responsibilities and assign ultimate responsibility for the implementation of each control to particular individuals or offices. Does your formal system security and contingency plan stand up to that kind of scrutiny?\nIn both the public and private sectors, hospitals, clinics, and other health care providers that manage private health information today must adhere to strict policies for ensuring that data is secure at all times. The best practices presented here can help ensure that data isn’t stolen or compromised, and that your organization doesn’t face steep fines for being out of compliance.\nBill Becker is Technical Director of SafeNet Assured Technologies.

{"question":"What cool-season crops show the highest economic returns in organic farming systems?","answer":"In organic farming systems, onions and lettuce showed the highest economic returns. Onions had the highest net return, averaging more than $14,000 per acre over a three-year period, while lettuce followed with a net return of more than $9,000 per acre. While these crops had the highest total costs, their costs decreased as acreage increased. Additionally, these cool-season crops were chosen because they are easier to grow organically in the Southeast due to low insect and disease pressures. The study found that net returns for most cash crops generally increased over time.","context":["Organic vegetable farmers in the Southeast now have a successful model for planting summer cover crops with high-value, cool-season crops, thanks to a University of Georgia study. The two models use a series of crop rotations to increase yields, control insects and diseases, improve crop quality and build soil biomass.\nThis system’s approach can be used to develop production recommendations and a production budget for organic farmers or for conventional growers interested in transitioning to organic production.\n“The purpose of the project was to take a systems approach to evaluate crop rotations to produce high-value, organic horticultural crops in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of the Southeast,” said project investigator George Boyhan, a horticulturist with the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.\nOriginally, Vidalia onion growers interested in organic production were targeted for the study. Between 300 and 400 acres of these onions are grown organically in Georgia.\n“We wanted to see what cool-season, high-value crops could be incorporated in the crop rotation for onion growers in order to boost their profits,” Boyhan said. “As the study progressed, we found that the crop rotations would be suitable for any vegetable growers interested in organic production.”\nWith funding from a Southern Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education grant, Boyhan, along with crop and soil scientist Julia Gaskin, plant pathologist Elizabeth Little, horticulturist Suzzanne Tate and agricultural economists Sam Kaninda and Greg Fonsah, studied two-crop rotations over a three-year period: (1) strawberries, bush beans and oats to Austrian winter peas, potatoes, sunn hemp, onions and southern peas, and (2) broccoli, lettuce, sudan-sorghum to cowpeas, carrots, sunn hemp, onions and millet.\nThe rotations were developed with growers’ input to improve soil quality through cover crop biomass additions, to rotate between crop families to break pest cycles, to use cover crops to supply nitrogen and suppress weeds and to use cover crops and crop cycles to suppress nematodes.\n“The cover crops worked best when they were paired with a certain cash crop for a specific function,” Gaskin said.\nFor example, sunn hemp planted before onions: “Onions are a high nitrogen-demanding crop and sunn hemp is known to fix nitrogen” and suppress nematodes and weeds, Gaskin said.\nA sunn hemp rotation plus nutrients in the soil provided 75 percent of the nitrogen for the onions. By contrast, the sorghum-sudan and cowpea mix grown before carrots may not have been the best rotation, Gaskin said.\n“The idea was to suppress weeds and nematodes. But the sorghum dominated the mix, outperforming the cowpea,” she said. “Yields with carrots were not as good.”\nBroccoli followed by lettuce produced “very good” yields, Gaskin said, but millet was not a great weed suppressor.\nInsects were practically nonexistent, although there some disease issues were found.\n“We chose cool-season crops because they are the easiest to grow organically in our region due to low insect and disease pressures,” Little said. “As far as diseases go, I’d say it was a success.”\nSome minor Botrytis was found in onions, Sclerotinia was noted in lettuce and beans, and a few leaf spots were recorded in strawberries. Very minor fruit rot problems were found. There was no evidence of root diseases in strawberries, and no diseases in potatoes or carrots, she said.\nOver the three-year period, onions produced the highest yields, exceeding the Vidalia onion county yield average for each of those years. Lettuce and broccoli yields were also high. Although the potatoes and carrots stored well, their yields were low.\nAs far as the economics of the crops – based on variable and fixed costs, pre-harvest variables, and harvesting and marketing costs – the onions had the highest net return. The onions averaged more than $14,000 per acre and the lettuce followed, with a net return of more than $9,000 per acre over the three-year period.\nThe UGA study found the net return for the cash crops generally increased over time, except for the strawberries. Summer cash crops of bush beans and southern peas were not profitable.\nThe highest value crops also had the highest total costs; however, total costs were lower as the acres increased.\nAverage net returns by crop rotations were $17,592 per acre for rotation one, and $20,964 per acre for rotation two.\nResearchers speculate the growing season was too short between cool-season crops.\nCover crop costs averaged $6,000 per acre over the life of the rotation. The cover crops served as a weed control-soil building-nutrient cycling program.\n“The crop rotations show promise for mid-scale producers,” Boyhan said, ”but the one thing we learned is that timing is critical. This is an intensive system that requires work and a market to sell the product.”\nTo view the complete study findings, go to http://tinyurl.com/LS10225."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:336b3d8d-9964-4add-9fb4-6a844e67fc05>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which requires more frequent reapplication: water for constipated babies or sunscreen for sun protection?","answer":"Sunscreen requires more frequent reapplication. For constipated babies, just 1-2 oz of cooled boiled water can be given between feeds. In contrast, sunscreen must be reapplied every 2-3 hours in normal conditions, and even more frequently - every 1-1.5 hours - when swimming or sweating.","context":["If you have an infant at home, you shouldn’t ever give them plain water. Water can interfere with a baby’s ability to receive proper nourishment or could even make them sick. Once your baby reaches six months, it’s okay for you to offer some water, but you should still give them breast milk or formula as well.\nHow much water can a 3 week old drink?\nIt’s acceptable to supplement with water at this time. However, assuming adequate formula or breast milk intake, your child may not need more than 2 to 4 ounces of water over a 24-hour period. Water is traditionally introduced through a sippy cup.\nWhat happens if you give a newborn water?\nGiving water to an infant can also cause water intoxication, a serious condition that happens when too much water dilutes the concentration of sodium in the body, upsetting the electrolyte balance and causing tissues to swell. It’s uncommon but serious, potentially causing seizures and even a coma.\nCan you give a newborn baby cooled boiled water?\nFully breastfed babies do not need any water until they’ve started eating solid foods. During hot weather they may want to breastfeed more than usual. If you’re bottle feeding, as well as their usual milk feeds, you can give your baby a little cooled boiled water.\nWhat age can baby have tap water?\nFor babies under 6 months, you should not use water straight from the mains tap in the kitchen as it is not sterile. You will need to boil the tap water first and then let it cool down. Water for babies over 6 months doesn’t need to be boiled.\nWhy do they give sugar water to newborns?\nWhy is sugar water used for babies? Some hospitals use sugar water to help babies with pain during a circumcision or other surgeries. At the pediatrician’s office, sugar water could be given to reduce pain when the baby is being given a shot, a foot prick, or having blood drawn.\nCan I give my baby water at night instead of milk?\nIf you are breast-feeding, try nursing from just one side at night, to decrease the amount of milk your baby gets from nighttime feedings. If you are bottle-feeding, consider giving your baby a bottle of water instead of formula at night. All babies (and adults) wake up at night.\nCan I give my 4 week old baby water?\n“Water is not recommended for infants under six months old because even small amounts will fill up their tiny bellies and can interfere with their body’s ability to absorb the nutrients in breast milk or formula,” Malkoff-Cohen said.\nCan I give my 3 week old baby water for constipation?\nIf you think your baby might be constipated, make an appointment to see the doctor, who may recommend some of the following remedies to help get things moving again: Water. If you’re formula feeding your baby, offering a little water between feeds may help, although you shouldn’t dilute the formula itself.\nHow long can newborns be in direct sunlight?\nWhen can your newborn baby be exposed to the sun? Babies should be kept out of direct sunlight until they’re 6 months old, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\nWill cooled boiled water help my baby poop?\nKeeping your baby hydrated is the key to avoiding constipation. Give your baby 1 – 2 oz (30-60ml) of cooled boiled water to help encourage bowel movements. Having plenty of fluid in their system makes the poo softer and easier to pass, whereas dehydration causes dry, hard poo which is more difficult to pass.\nHow can I cool down my newborn?\nTo keep them cool:\n- choose the coolest room in the house for sleeping. …\n- cool your child with damp cloths and place wet towels or sheets around the bassinette or cot to cool the air immediately near them. …\n- give your child a lukewarm bath or sponge them down with lukewarm water. …\n- use fans to keep the air circulating.","It’s summer time, which means it’s time to protect our family from the scorching sun.\nAccording to The American Academy of Dermatology, 80 percent of lifetime sun exposure occurs during childhood. It is our job as caregivers to teach our children about why repeated sun exposure and sunburns are harmful to our skin and what we should be doing for protection. Cumulative sun exposure over the years can causes basal cell carcinoma skin cancer. However, episodes of sunburns before the age of 18 are what place you at risk for melanoma later in life. Skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and melanoma, is the most common type of cancer. New cases and deaths from melanoma, the deadliest form, have been increasing dramatically. All it takes is one or two severe burns to develop moles that increase a child’ s risk. Statistics show that approximately one-third of our youth are practicing effective sun protection. This is just not good enough.\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention is making an attempt to promote programs aimed at skin health and safety in schools. They have recommended that skin health be included in comprehensive health education classes. West Virginia has also recently passed laws prohibiting anyone under the age of 18 to participate in indoor UV tanning. Salons could be fined if they allow minors even with adult permission to use tanning beds.\nPatients should be getting annual exams to check moles especially those with a family history of melanoma or those with many moles. There is strong evidence that the risk of melanoma increases for individuals who have atypical moles with irregular borders, vary in color, or are asymmetrical, meaning if you cut the mole in half, the two halves would not look the same. Other melanoma risk factors include previous melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancers, skin that burns readily and fails to tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, and once again a history of blistering sunburns.\nSome simple ways to protect you and your children this summer include:\n- Limiting outdoor play when the rays are at their strongest from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n- Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least 30 SPF, preferably 50 SPF, 30 minutes before you or your child go out in the sun. Reapply sunscreen every 2 to 3 hours. If you’re swimming or sweating, cut that reapply time in half.\n- Wearing protective clothing such as hats and using a dark-colored umbrella adds extra protection.\nA question I receive often is,“How can I protect my baby younger than 6 months? Is sun screen safe for him?” Here’s the answer. If using sunscreen on a baby newborn to 6 months of age, look for titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. These products stay on the surface of the skin and there is less absorption. The best way to protect your baby, though, is with protective clothing.\nWe do all kinds of safety prevention on a daily basis to protect our families. However, skin cancer prevention often gets pushed aside. I consistently hear parents say, “My child and I do not burn,” Please know, however, that all skin gets damaged by the sun and should be protected.\nThe bottom line is this. Education is always key. Teach your children why it is important to protect their skin. Set a good example and protect yourself because kids tend to follow the lead from their parents. If you notice any suspicious spots on your skin or a family member’s skin, or notice anything changing, itching or bleeding, see your primary care provider or a board-certified dermatologist.\nHave fun and stay safe this summer!

{"question":"What role does proper lighting and footwear selection play in preventing workplace slip accidents, and what are the regulatory requirements for safety shoes in hazardous environments?","answer":"Proper lighting is crucial in preventing workplace accidents, requiring well-lit walkways, staircases, ramps, hallways, and work areas, with immediate repair of malfunctioning fixtures and switches. Regarding footwear, appropriate shoes with proper soles and correctly tied laces are essential for preventing slips and falls. From a regulatory standpoint, employers must follow the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992, which mandates providing safety footwear meeting European standards. In hazardous environments, specific requirements apply - such as metal toecaps for areas with falling object hazards, and steel-toe Wellingtons resistant to oils, acid, alkali, and fats for food industry workers.","context":["It’s probably happened to most of us. That momentary lapse of inattention thinking about a personal problem or distracted by an activity that ends in a slip, trip or fall. A stumble down a stairway. A trip over an uneven surface. Slipping on the ice. It can lead to a variety of regrettable events ranging from a simple bruised shin to an extremely serious injury. It’s just one of a variety of conditions and situations that set the stage for slips, trips and falls in the workplace.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, slips, trips and falls make up the majority of general industry accidents, which account for:\n- 15 percent of all accidental deaths per year, the second-leading cause behind motor vehicles\n- About 25 percent of all reported injury claims per fiscal year\n- More than 95 million lost work days per year – about 65 percent of all work days lost\nIn general, slips and trips occur due to a loss of traction between the shoe and the walking surface or an inadvertent contact with a fixed or moveable object which may lead to a fall. There are a variety of situations that may cause slips, trips and falls.\n- Wet or greasy floors\n- Dry floors with wood dust or powder\n- Uneven walking surfaces\n- Polished or freshly waxed floors\n- Loose flooring, carpeting or mats\n- Transition from one floor type to another\n- Missing or uneven floor tiles and bricks\n- Damaged or irregular steps; no handrails\n- Sloped walking surfaces\n- Shoes with wet, muddy, greasy or oily soles\n- Electrical cords or cables\n- Open desk or file cabinet drawers\n- Damaged ladder steps\n- Ramps and gang planks without skid-resistant surfaces\n- Metal surfaces – dock plates, construction plates\n- Weather hazards – rain, sleet, ice, snow, hail, frost\n- Wet leaves or pine needles\nHere are six guidelines to help you create a safer working environment for you and your employees.\n(1) Create Good Housekeeping Practices\nGood housekeeping is critical. Safety and housekeeping go hand-in-hand. If your facility’s housekeeping habits are poor, the result may be a higher incidence of employee injuries, ever-increasing insurance costs and regulatory citations. If an organization’s facilities are noticeably clean and well organized, it is a good indication that its overall safety program is effective as well.\nProper housekeeping is a routine. It is an ongoing procedure that is simply done as a part of each worker’s daily performance. To create an effective housekeeping program, there are three simple steps to get you started\n- Plan ahead– Know what needs to be done, who’s going to do it and what the particular work area should look like when you are done.\n- Assign responsibilities– It may be necessary to assign a specific person or group of workers to clean up, although personal responsibility for cleaning up after himself/herself is preferred.\n- Implement a program– Establish housekeeping procedures as a part of the daily routine.\n(2) Reduce Wet or Slippery Surfaces\nWalking surfaces account for a significant portion of injuries reported by state agencies. The most frequently reported types of surfaces where these injuries occur include\n- Parking lots\n- Sidewalks (or lack of)\n- Food preparation areas\n- Shower stalls in residential dorms\n- Floors in general\nTraction on outdoor surfaces can change considerably when weather conditions change. Those conditions can then affect indoor surfaces as moisture is tracked in by pedestrian traffic. Traction control procedures should be constantly monitored for their effectiveness.\n- Keep parking lots and sidewalks clean and in good repair condition.\n- When snow and ice are present, remove or treat these elements. In some extreme cases, it may be necessary to suspend use of the area.\n- Use adhesive striping material or anti-skid paint whenever possible.\nIndoor control measures can help reduce the incidence of slips and falls.\n- Use moisture-absorbent mats with beveled edges in entrance areas. Make sure they have backing material that will not slide on the floor.\n- Display “Wet Floor” signs as needed.\n- Use anti-skid adhesive tape in troublesome areas.\n- Clean up spills immediately. Create a procedure for taking the appropriate action when someone causes or comes across a food or drink spill.\n- Use proper area rugs or mats for food preparation areas.\n(3) Avoid Creating Obstacles in Aisles and Walkways\nInjuries can also result in from trips caused by obstacles, clutter, materials and equipment in aisles, corridors, entranceways and stairwells. Proper housekeeping in work and traffic areas is still the most effective control measure in avoiding the proliferation of these types of hazards. This means having policies or procedures in place and allowing time for cleaning the area, especially where scrap material or waste is a by-product of the work operation.\n- Keep all work areas, passageways, storerooms and service areas clean and orderly.\n- Avoid stringing cords, cables or air hoses across hallways or in any designated aisle.\n- In office areas, avoid leaving boxes, files or briefcases in the aisles.\n- Encourage safe work practices such as closing file cabinet drawers after use and picking up loose items from the floor.\n- Conduct periodic inspections for slip and trip hazards.\n(4) Create and Maintain Proper Lighting\nPoor lighting in the workplace is associated with an increase in accidents.\n- Use proper illumination in walkways, staircases, ramps, hallways, basements, construction areas and dock areas.\n- Keep work areas well lit and clean.\n- Upon entering a darkened room, always turn on the light first.\n- Keep poorly lit walkways clear of clutter and obstructions.\n- Keep areas around light switches clear and accessible.\n- Repair fixtures, switches and cords immediately if they malfunction.\n(5) Wear Proper Shoes\nThe shoes we wear can play a big part in preventing falls. The slickness of the soles and the type of heels worn need to be evaluated to avoid slips, trips and falls. Shoelaces need to be tied correctly. Whenever a fall-related injury is investigated, the footwear needs to be evaluated to see if it contributed to the incident. Employees are expected to wear footwear appropriate for the duties of their work task.\n(6) Control Individual Behavior\nThis condition is the toughest to control. It is human nature to let our guard down for two seconds and be distracted by random thoughts or doing multiple activities. Being in a hurry will result in walking too fast or running which increases the chances of a slip, trip or fall. Taking shortcuts, not watching where one is going, using a cell phone, carrying materials which obstructs the vision, wearing sunglasses in low-light areas, not using designated walkways and speed are common elements in many on-the-job injuries.\nIt’s ultimately up to each individual to plan, stay alert and pay attention.","Choosing Workplace Footwear\nSafety in the workplace is a prime consideration for any employer, so it is important to be aware of relevant legislation to ensure your workers are protected.\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE) at work\nAs an employer, you must meet the requirements of the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992 (as amended). The legislation includes an obligation to provide equipment that protects the user’s health and safety in the workplace. That will include, where appropriate, high-visibility clothing, safety helmets, hard hats and safety footwear, eye protection and gloves.\nRisk assessments should be carried out regularly to ensure your employees are properly equipped and protected when in the workplace.\nThe right type of footwear for your employees will depend on what jobs they do and the environment in which the work is carried out. Feet can often be at risk in the workplace, so the appropriate workplace footwear is an essential part of PPE.\nAn employee’s feet can suffer in his or her daily working life, especially if wrongly fitting footwear is worn or standing for lengthy periods is involved. Besides dealing with pain or stress caused to their feet and legs, employees can also face slip hazards, so a risk assessment should include areas where this could occur.\nWhen selecting safety footwear, you should bear in mind that your choice of product needs to be appropriate for the tasks to be carried out by the wearer. All protective equipment, including shoes that you provide as an employer, must meet European standards. That includes occupational footwear, protective footwear and safety footwear. You should also check that safety footwear is slip resistant, as this is not currently covered by European standards.\nEnvironments where safety footwear is necessary\nMany work sites, especially in the construction industry, have falling object hazards that can cause injury. Safety footwear with metal toecaps helps prevent toes being crushed upon impact with a heavy object. A strong midsole can also protect feet against being pierced by objects underfoot. Safety shoes or boots are essential when working in such environments.\nWorking in an area where spillages occur can be very dangerous and employees can easily slip. This often causes severe bruising or even a limb can be broken or serious damage to the spine can occur; so good quality safety shoes with slip resistance will help mitigate the problem. As it’s almost impossible to prevent spillages in some factory environments, workers should be well protected from the possible consequences of slipping and falling.\nUsing steel-toe safety Wellingtons made of materials resistant to oils, acid, alkali and fats can significantly reduce the slip hazard and are particularly suited for use by employees in the food industry.\nKeeping the workforce safe\nIt’s vital that you keep your workforce as safe as possible and provide the relevant PPE for employees to do their jobs without having to worry about their safety.

{"question":"Hi there! I'm managing both a large corporate site and a small business website 💼 Can you compare how vulnerable these different types of websites are to cyber attacks? 大企业和小企业网站哪个更容易受到黑客攻击？","answer":"Recent statistics show that small and medium websites are actually hackers' prime targets, rather than large corporate sites. While one might assume that hackers mainly target large corporate and government websites, the reality is that cybercriminals frequently focus on smaller sites. This targeting occurs because smaller sites may overlook strict security protocols, believing they don't have anything valuable enough to warrant an attack. Both 2019 research and recent statistics confirm that organizations of all sizes offering online services are vulnerable to cyber attacks, with almost half of all web applications being vulnerable to unauthorized access.","context":["With around 2 billion websites online in 2020, it’s easy to see why the internet has turned to be a goldmine for malicious actors in recent times. With tons of transactions and valuable information taking place online each day, hackers are always trying to come up with clever hacks to bypass any security measures you may have in place to protect your website. Although small website owners can overlook strict security protocols arguing that they may not have anything valuable on their sites to warrant a cyberattack, it’s important to note that hackers don’t just target large corporate and government websites. Recent statistics indicate that small and medium websites are hacker’s prime target.\nThat is why implementing website security best practices should not be optional for any webmaster. It is mandatory. Website security refers to the steps a website owner undertakes to guard their site against cyber-attacks. It might involve employee training on safety practices or acquiring the right protection tools such as an SSL certificate. Below we look at website security more comprehensively and how you can secure and protect your website.\nTop Tips to Protect Your Site from Cyberattacks\nProper Password Management\nAlthough proper password management has been addressed for like forever, it is worrying how many people still fall prey to cyberattacks due to the use of weak passwords or using the same password for all your accounts. As a website administrator, you need to enforce the use of strong passwords on your website. Strong passwords should contain at least eight characters and have a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers and symbols. It’s also inadvisable to use obvious password details like your birthday or the school you went to because it is easy to nail you using brute force attacks. It would help if you used a new password for every new account you set up, and you can use password managers to create and save strong passwords. It’s also a good idea to add an extra layer of security to your passwords by enabling two-factor authentication.\nUse a Secure Hosting Plan\nThe hosting plan that you use for your website will determine your success in a very significant way. An excellent hosting company should offer you comprehensive security features like protection from DDoS attacks and SQL injections, as well as malware scanning and removal. Whether you are using shared content management systems like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal or are going about it solo, you should always consider quality and security over price when choosing a hosting plan.\nUse an SSL Certificate\nThe HTTPS protocol is the new normal on the internet. If you do not want to run into the trouble of having the leading search engines mark your site as ‘Not Secure’ and discriminate against your site on search results, you need to acquire a SSL Certificate for your website. When this data in transit is encrypted, any third party trying to intercept it will only see ambiguous characters as they do not have the decryption key. This ensures the integrity, privacy, and authentication of online communications.\nKeep Your Website Up-to-date\nHackers are not stupid. They are always checking for any vulnerabilities within websites that they can use to gain entry. That’s why you need to ensure that any software, applications, and plugins on your website are kept updated at all times. CMS platforms like WordPress offer an option for automatic updates where any new patches will be installed right after release to fix any bugs and security vulnerabilities.\nFirewalls are essential because they identify any malicious traffic before it can hit a website. There are two kinds of firewalls; network firewalls and web application firewalls. Network firewalls are usually used by web hosting companies and large organizations to identify and block any malicious traffic trying to hit webservers within a network. A web application firewall is used to protect a specific website and ensure that any malicious traffic is kept at bay.\nChange Default Security Configurations\nOne crucial step that many new website owners may forget is to change default configurations once the site goes live. You need to change details like user permissions, file sharing, account name, and password, and so on to avoid falling prey to hackers who target the default security configurations of content management systems like WordPress.\nKeep Your Website Clean\nAn adequately organized website will be easier to run, manage, and protect. You need to have an organized file structure so that you can quickly locate specific files. It would help if you also formed a habit of deleting any unused files, applications, and plugins because they can easily be used as a backdoor for hackers to gain entry into your site.\nAutomate Regular Backups\nAlthough you can work day and night to set up layers and layers of security around your website, it is good to be prepared for the eventuality that you may be a victim of a cyberattack one day. The only way you can be prepared for such an occurrence is by keeping a regular backup of your site’s database, content, files, and so on. This way, if an attack happens, you can restore your site to a previous working version easily and fast.\nWebsites form the backbone of our online existence, and as such, we cannot live without them. However, as hackers grow smarter by the day and discover witty methods to make a quick buck online, we have to step up our guard and implement website security best practices. Installing a SSL certificate is an excellent place to start because it will encrypt all information shared between your web server and client browsers, thus keeping the data safe.","Six ways to improve the security of your website and web applications\nBusiness websites and applications need to be as accessible yet robust as possible, but this presents a huge range of security challenges, find out what you need to protect them.\nIn 2019, more businesses than ever before are offering online services. This is due to the fact that customer needs have changed and there is a greater demand for access to information and services around the clock.\nWhile this is certainly good news for customers, an unwanted impact for businesses is that these services are frequently targeted by cyber criminals. Businesses in the financial sector are a common target but any organization that offers online services can be vulnerable.\nBusiness websites and applications need to be as accessible yet robust as possible, but this presents a huge range of security challenges. For instance, recent research has revealed that almost half of all web applications are vulnerable to unauthorised access – while 44 per cent place users at risk of personal data theft.\nTo help improve your organizations’ online security, here are six ways to protect your business’ website and web applications.\n1. Use a web application firewall\nA web application firewall (WAF) analyses both HTTP and HTTPS web traffic in order to identify attacks. When the firewall notices malicious activity, such as a someone attempting to exploit a known vulnerability, it blocks the connection.\nA WAF is very useful but does not leave you completely protected. For example, the firewall can only defend against attacks that have known signatures. WAFS offers no defense against new types of threats, nor can it fix any identified vulnerabilities.\n2. Perform regular network vulnerability scanning\nTo uncover cyber security risks that exist across your website and web applications, it is important to take proactive steps to uncover vulnerabilities. One of the best ways to do this is to perform network vulnerability scanning on a regular basis. This form of assessment relies on the use of automated software tools and can help to uncover issues such insecure server and network configurations, open ports, unpatched systems and use of weak user credentials.\n3. Commission penetration testing\nAs an automated form of assessment, network vulnerability scanning can only go so far, which is why it’s important to take additional steps to identify and address hidden exposures. Web application testing is performed by an experienced ethical hacker and can discover potential flaws in your systems that could be exploited. Penetration testing utilises a range of manual testing techniques to identify, safely exploit and remediate vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and authentication problems. Web app testing can also help to identify the presence of rogue applications and plug-ins, such as the type that led to recent breaches at Ticketmaster and British Airways.\n4. Manage user permissions and privileges\nIn the event of a breach, limiting the amount of damage that a hacker could inflict by ensuring that users only have the minimum rights necessary to perform their role is another important way to improve the security of your website and web applications.\nFailing to take this sort of action could result in your business experience something similar to Ticketfly – an event ticketing site that suffered the loss of data relating to 26 million customers. During the breach a hacker was able to gain access to the webmaster’s account, which provided all the privileges and access needed to steal the data.\nIt is a good idea to manage user permissions and privileges very carefully, perhaps splitting them up across a variety of different accounts. The key here is finding a balance between security and the ability of administrators to do their job effectively.\n5. Segregate your networks and data\nAs well as managing privileges, you can take steps to mitigate attacks by segregating systems across multiple isolated networks and databases. This can help to limit the scope of attacks by slowing down hacker progress and ensuring that if a database, for example, is compromised, attackers aren’t able to access a complete set of data.\nSegregation of cardholder data is an important requirement of the Payment Card Industries’ Data Security Standard (PC DSS).\n6. Monitor web servers and logs\nFinally, it is a good idea to regularly monitor web servers and relevant log files in order to identify suspicious behavior such as unauthorized connections and policy violations. This is a task that be performed manually by an administrator or automatically through the use of network monitoring technologies such as SIEM. Identifying attacks early means you’ll be able to respond to them before they cause widespread damage and disruption."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f24d76a2-956a-49d1-a900-57b80d0754c0>","<urn:uuid:dab3d3d6-8d3f-4c7b-845a-6721dd5c36de>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying thermodynamics and I'm confused about the similarities and differences between closed and isolated systems. Could you explain how these two types of systems differ in terms of their ability to exchange matter and energy with their surroundings?","answer":"Closed and isolated systems differ primarily in their ability to exchange energy with their surroundings. A closed system allows for the exchange of energy (heat or work) with its surroundings, but prevents matter from entering or leaving the system. For example, a water bottle with a lid demonstrates this - while the liquid inside cannot escape, the bottle can still gain or lose heat energy when placed in different temperature environments. An isolated system, on the other hand, is completely closed off from outside interference and allows neither matter nor energy to be exchanged. A good example is an insulated thermos, which not only prevents liquid from spilling thanks to its lid but also has an insulated layer that prevents energy exchange with the outside environment, keeping the contents at a constant temperature.","context":["What is a Closed System?\nIn science, a closed system is a system that doesn’t allow matter from outside environments to enter its space. It does not have interactions with other systems – though it may be influenced by outside energy depending on its environment. A closed system falls in between an open system and an isolated system in terms of outside influence. Although it is controlled in terms of matter that may pass in and outside of its boundaries, it is not protected from influence from temperature and similar types of energy.\nYou are watching: What is an example of a closed system\nHow is a Closed System Different from Open and Isolated Systems?\nThere are many different types of systems that work in tandem with one another. These systems all have different defining characteristics that help to determine how they operate and which settings they are most useful in. There are three main types of systems – open systems, closed systems, and isolated systems.\nOpen systems are systems in which there are no boundaries to prevent the system from being affected by outside matter or energy. This means that there is nothing to prevent the system from losing or gaining additional matter or energy and they freely exchange both of these things with the variables in their surroundings.\nAn example of an open system can be seen above with the coffee mug. The mug is an open system because it has nothing to prevent the loss or gain of matter, as seen with the open top. An example of the loss of matter could be an accidental spill or (if the conditions were right) evaporation of some of the liquid. Gain in matter could occur if someone were to pour more liquid into the mug, or if an insect were to inadvertently fly into the mug.\nBy examining the coffee mug we can also see that the temperature of the system isn’t controlled. The steam in the mug is free to escape into the surrounding environment, therefore releasing energy. The mug is also susceptible to its surrounding environment in terms of absorbing energy. For example, if the coffee mug was sitting outside on a hot summer day, it would be susceptible to absorbing sunlight which would increase its temperature.\nA closed system is a system in which matter cannot escape or be added to an environment due to some type of boundary. Although a closed system is more controlled than an open system, however, it is still susceptible to outside heat and energy. This means that it can both absorb energy and have energy escape from its boundaries.\nAn example of a closed system can be seen by looking at the water bottle above. Like the coffee mug, the water bottle is able to hold liquid inside its ‘system.’ Unlike the coffee mug, however, the water bottle has a lid to help ensure that the matter inside its system will remain constant. This is the major difference between a closed system and an open system.\nAlthough the closed system is more controlled than the open system, it isn’t able to account for energy that can be both lost and gained. For instance, if a water bottle is left outside on a hot summer day, it will gain heat energy. Likewise, if a water bottle is left inside a refrigerator, the heat that was maintained inside the bottle will be lost.\nLastly, an isolated system is a system that is completely closed off from outside interference. In these systems, there is no way for matter or energy to be gained or lost. Instead, everything is kept constant.\nAn example of an isolated system can be seen by looking at the insulated thermos above. The isolated system is the most controlled of the three systems because it protects its contents from both the gain and loss of energy and matter. This means that the contents of the system are completely isolated from everything in the outside environment. Whatever liquid may be inside is ensured not to spill thanks to the lid, and the insulated layer inside the thermos prevents the liquid contents from being affected by the outside environment. Likewise, the insulated layer also ensures that the energy inside the system doesn’t escape into the outside environment.\nClosed System Examples\nThere are many examples of closed systems, both in chemistry and in the natural world. It is common to see closed systems being used in experiments where temperature is not a factor. These systems help to make sure that an experiment is properly conducted and isn’t unintentionally influenced by an outside variable.\nClosed systems are a key part of experimentation in science, but they can be found in more than just man-made environments. There are hundreds of examples of closed systems that can be observed – including the entirety of the earth itself!\nBecause the earth is protected from outside interference (space) by its atmosphere, it can easily be classified as a closed system. This is also an excellent example of how a closed system can still be influenced by outside energy like heat and UV rays. Although outside matter from space is mostly eliminated by the earth’s atmosphere, the planet is still largely influenced by the sun’s energy and heat.","There is no chemical reaction in which the energy is not involved. In the procedure of reacting substances, you either supply energy to the system or the reaction takes place on its own. However then, why and how do chemical reactions take place? What actually is thermodynamics? Why do certain chemical reactions take place devoid of the supply of external energy? All such questions will be answered in this chapter.\nIn this part, a number of generally used terms in thermodynamics are defined and illustrated. These terms must be comprehended clearly before you carry on further.\nIn respect of chemical reactions, we are not just concerned regarding how and why reactions occur however as well why certain substances are even more reactive than the others. There is no doubt that before a chemical reaction can take place, energy is needed. The energy needed might be associated to the substances undergoing the reaction. Though, where the quantities of energy possessed via the reacting species are not enough to initiate the reaction or take the reaction to completion, energy might be supplied. In short, the chemical reaction in a system needs certain level of energy transformation. We are familiar that the heat is a form of energy.\nThermodynamics is a compound term. Thermo means transfer of heat or mainly concerned with heat and dynamics implies of physical power and forces producing the motion. Thermodynamics can therefore be stated as the science of heat motion. However, you must consider it as the science of heat flow or transfer or disappearance of work attending the physical and chemical processes.\nLet us consider some illustrations of thermodynamics, as shown:\n1) Natural process: The water flowing down from a hill-top. An illustration is Erin -Ijesha water fall in OsunState.\n2) Controlled chemical reactions: We can find out the dissociation constant (pKa), example acetic acid.\n3) Performance of engines: Any engine can be considered here, for example, whenever you are evaluating the efficiency of the blender engine. We must draw our attention to one fact that thermodynamics can't answer all the questions due to its ample applicability. For example, it can't:\nThough, it can state us whether a reaction will take place or not.\nIn short, the word thermodynamics is stated as the study of energy transformation in a system. However, thermodynamics mainly deals with the systems. The system under consideration in this note is a chemical one, therefore, our main consideration of the concept of the chemical thermodynamics. What then is a system?\nAny part of the universe which is under study is termed as a system. The systems can be in different states. A system can be as simple as a gas contained in the closed vessel, or as complicated as the rocket shooting towards the moon.\nA system might be homogenous or heterogeneous, based on its contents and conditions. A system is homogenous if physical properties and chemical composition are similar all through the system. Such a system is as well termed as a single phase system. A heterogeneous system comprises of two or more phases separated via mechanical boundaries. Now, let us consider the surroundings of the reaction.\nThe rest of the universe around the system is taken as its surroundings. A system and its surroundings are for all time separated via boundaries across which matter and energy might be exchanged. The boundaries can be real (that is, fixed or movable) or imaginary.\nBased on the exchange of matter and energy between the system and these founding, a system can be categorized into the given three types:\nAn Isolated system is one which exchanges neither energy nor matter by its surroundings. There is no perfectly isolated system, however a system which is thermally well-insulated (that is, doesn't let heat flow) and is sealed to inflow or outflow of matter can be taken as an isolated system. A sealed thermos flask containing some matter might be regarded as the isolated system.\nA closed system allows for exchange of energy (that is, heat or work) by the surroundings; however matter is not allowed to enter or leave it. A correctly sealed system (to prevent the passage of matter across its boundary) can be taken as the closed system.\nAn open system permits exchange of both matter and energy with its surroundings. This is the most general system encountered in our everyday life. All living things are illustrations of an open system, as they are capable of exchanging matter and energy freely with their surroundings.\nAs well, reaction vessels having permeable membranes are the open systems.\nAny thermodynamic system should be macroscopic, that is, must have adequately big size. This facilitates the measurement of its properties like volume, pressure, temperature, composition and density. These properties are, thus, termed as macroscopic or bulk properties. These are as well termed as state or thermodynamic variables. These don't base on the past history of the system.\nA state variable that fully depends on other variables is termed as a dependant variable. Others, on which it is based, are termed as independent variables. For instance, if you write down the ideal gas equation as:\nV/P = nRT\nThen, 'V' is the dependent variable, while n, T and P are independent variables. We are familiar that 'R' is the gas constant. On the other hand, if you write this equation as,\nP = nRT/V\nThen, 'P' is the dependent variable, while n, T and V are independent variables. The choice of dependent and independent variables is a matter of ease.\nState of a system:\nThe state of a system can be stated in thermodynamics once you set up a small set of measurable parameters. For illustration, whenever you have a gas confined in the container, the measurable parameters there will comprise volume, pressure, temperature and composition.\nIn essence, the state of a system is stated if the state variables encompass definite values. It is not essential to specify all the state variables as these are interdependent. For illustration: if the system is an ideal gas, then its volume, pressure, temperature and the amount of gas (that is, number of moles) are associated by the gas equation. Therefore, if we specify three of these, the fourth variable is automatically fixed. Likewise, most of its other properties, like heat capacity, density and so on are as well fixed, however via more complex relations.\nWe can change the state of a system by modifying either the pressure or the volume.\nThe Zeroth law of thermodynamics:\nThe Zeroth law of thermodynamics is mainly based on the concept of thermal equilibrium. This helps us in defining the temperature. If two closed systems are brought altogether in such a way that they are in thermal contact, changes occur in the properties of both systems. However, ultimately a state is reached whenever there is no further change in either of the systems. This is the state of thermal equilibrium. Both the systems are at similar temperature. In order to find out if two systems are at similar temperature, the two can be brought into the thermal contact, and then the changes in their properties noticed. If no changes take place, they are at the similar temperature.\nThe Zeroth law of thermodynamics defines that if a system 'A' is in thermal equilibrium with system 'C', and system 'B' is as well in thermal equilibrium with 'C', then A and B are as well in the thermal equilibrium with one other. This is an experimental fact, which might be described by supposing that systems 'A' and 'B' are the two vessels having different liquids, and 'C' is an ordinary mercury thermometer. If 'A' is in thermal equilibrium with 'C', then the mercury level in the thermometer will illustrate a constant reading.\nThis points out the temperature of system 'A' and also that of 'C'. Now, if 'A' is as well in thermal equilibrium with the 'B', then the height of mercury level in the thermometer (that is, in contact with the B) is the similar as before; 'B' as well consists of the similar temperature as 'A'. There is thermal equilibrium in both 'A' and 'B' or these are at similar temperature.\nExtensive and intensive variables:\nWe are familiar with the homogenous and heterogeneous systems. Let us now illustrate the difference between the two, with respect to the value of certain variables. The parameters illustrated earlier are as well termed as variables. There are two kinds of variables, namely Extensive and Intensive variables.\nAn Extensive property of the homogenous system is one which is dependent on the amount or quantity of a phase in the system or the mass of the system. For a heterogeneous system made up of some phases, the net value of an extensive property is equivalent to the sum of the contributions from its different phases. Mass, volume, and energy are the illustrations of extensive properties. Therefore, if a system at equilibrium comprises of 0.100 kg of ice and 0.100 kg of liquid water at 273.15K, the total volume of the system is the sum of the two volumes, each of which is directly proportional to the mass.\nVolume of 0.100 kg of ice = Mass of ice/Density of ice\n= 0.100 kg/917kgm- 3\n= 1.09 x 10-4 m3\nLikewise, the volume of 0.100 kg of water = Mass of water/Density of water\n= 0.100 kg/1.00 x 103 kg m-3\n= 1.00 x 10-4 m3\nTotal volume = (1.09 + 1.00) x 10-4 m3\n= 2.09 x 10-4 m3\nThe property that based only on the nature of the substance and not on the amount(s) of the substance(s) present in the system is termed as intensity or intensive property. The general examples of such properties are pressure, temperature, concentration, viscosity, refractive index, density, specific heat, surface tension and so on. The quotient obtained via dividing any extensive variable by the other extensive variable provides an intensive variable. For illustration: density (mass/volume), concentration (moles/liter), mole fraction (n/N) and specific heat (heat capacity per unit mass).\nTutorsglobe: A way to secure high grade in your curriculum (Online Tutoring)\nExpand your confidence, grow study skills and improve your grades.\nSince 2009, Tutorsglobe has proactively helped millions of students to get better grades in school, college or university and score well in competitive tests with live, one-on-one online tutoring.\nUsing an advanced developed tutoring system providing little or no wait time, the students are connected on-demand with a tutor at www.tutorsglobe.com.

This process is effective because the Product Backlog Items become smaller and everyone understands their functional requirements.","context":["Scrum is easy to understand.\nIt can be the hardest thing to actually do.\nBelow are some of the most common questions we see in ScrumMaster and Scrum Product Owner courses.\nBefore you go through this, it may be very helpful to first understand the following:\n- FAQ on Top ScrumMaster Questions\n- FAQ on Top ScrumMaster Career Paths\n- FAQ for Scrum Product Owners\n- FAQ for Scrum Product Owner Career Paths\nFAQ on Most Common and Top Questions from ScrumMaster or Scrum Product Owner Training\nHow can Agile/Scrum be applied to Hardware or Solution projects?\nScrum Development doesn’t really work well in hardware development except in the aspects of hardware development that are done using software. Agile as a philosophy, though, works EVERYWHERE.\nFor example, the modeling and planning of the hardware can be done iteratively. The creation of simulation software (if applicable) can be done iteratively. Beyond this, however, much of hardware development is a task flow that must be followed and can be easily mapped out.\nScrum, however, can be used by people creating hardware. There’s still a Product Backlog. People can still commit to a certain amount of work in the Sprint. Daily Scrums can still be done to improve synchronization and communication.\nDoes Scrum conform to PMI standards? If so, how?\nBy definition, Scrum can’t confirm to PMI. PMI is a project management method. Scrum is a framework for managing people and workflow. It’s kinda like asking about the difference between apples and oranges. They’re just two different things. Not much else can be said.\nWhat is a typical implementation of change from waterfall to Scrum?\n- Start with understanding your culture. Period.\n- Create a transition team to set vision, milestones, goals.\n- Pick a pilot project —OR — a piece of a larger project\n- Provide the proper training for the proper personnel\n- Run several Sprints — adjust as needed\n- Evaluate your results, adjust as needed\n- Move on to a larger group (e.g., another product development group) and repeat steps 3-6.\nIn Agile/Scrum, how do we deal with people working across multiple projects in parallel?\nWell, pretty much the same as you do now. The detrimental impact to your projects before Agile/Scrum will still be there after. Working on projects in parallel is not an issue of development method. This is not a question of looking for the development method that WILL allow you to work on multiple projects at the same time. The answer we’re looking for is to find a way to work on one project at a time in such a way that all projects get done faster and with higher quality.\nHow many Scrum teams can a Scrum Master realistically run?\nThat has everything to do with the ScrumMaster, the teams, and the product. Experienced teams don’t need ScrumMasters as much. Experienced ScrumMasters can work with more teams efficiently. Difficult products can make both teams and ScrumMasters work harder to accomplish the same thing. In my experience, I’ve never seen a ScrumMaster work with more than three teams at one time (and not very successfully).\nDriving efficient and simple solutions in Sprints – can Scrum design and work complex solutions effectively?\nI frequently hear concern that Agile Development can handle complex problems because it doesn’t try to solve the entire thing up front before building it. The reality that I’ve experienced shows that complex problems cannot be solved in detail up front because there are too many variables and too many assumptions made about the complex problem when working out a solution. Thus, we end up spending a bunch of time up front to build a solution that ends up changing in large ways during the development effort. Agile Development, on the other hand, encourages looking at a complex problem at a high level and then solving the parts one at a time. Does this mean that Agile Development might make some mistakes in solution during the development effort? No. However, because you will spend so much less time up-front trying to create a solution, you will have some time during development to build a solution and even some time to make mistakes.\nSo, Agile Development solves complex problems “efficiently,” if not “effectively.”\nRole of wikis or collaboration tools in Scrum?\nCan be useful in allowing Scrum teams that are non-co-located to communicate. They don’t replace face-to-face communication, however, and should not be used as a complete replacement.\nWhere does Scrum track risks and major impediments?\nImpediments are generally tracked, per Scrum, in the organizational or team impediment list. Beyond Scrum, project risks are generally handled in some form of project risk tracker or document. Backlog related risks are handled within each backlog item in the form of notes and other documentation and in larger story point estimates to account for the impact of the risk.\nDoes Scrum state that teams must use User Stories or are Use Cases acceptable as well?\nScrum does not make any assumption about the construction of a Product Backlog item (PBI). It can be anything from a task, to a feature, to a scenario, to a defect ID.\nHow to handle high priority fires/opportunities in the middle of a Sprint?\nPer Scrum, high priority fires (defects) may pass directly into the Sprint. The team should address the defect and then determine the impact to their commitment to the Product Owner and adjust accordingly. Per Scrum, high priority opportunities either wait until the next Sprint or cause an injection of change so that a new Sprint can be planned around the high priority. In reality, teams and Product Owners will often remove a lower priority PBI in favor of a new, high priority PBI (the catch is to remember to solve and plan the new PBI — that’s why Scrum measures the change, to force the replan and conversation that must take place when (not if) change happens).\nAre key decisions in Scrum tracked in non-functional requirements & stories?\nThat depends on the nature of the decision. Decisions that affect NFRs are frequently captured in PBIs or as a separate part of the DONEness definition.\nWhen do you do functional testing, performance testing, volume testing, ADA testings, and deployments to test environments?\nAs often as possible. Daily if you can (which means that the testing needs to be automated). Deployments to test environments are completely dependent on your frequency of testing. Deferring testing creates technical debt.\nAt what point do you plan for the next Sprint since planning will take away team time from the current Sprint?\nYes, its true that planning takes time away from building, but we have to do it anyway, so NOT doing it isn’t the solution (nor is only having certain individuals do the planning — that just takes your developers out of the loop at a critical juncture). I use backlog grooming workshops scheduled for 60-90 minutes once or twice a week to allow the team to discuss what’s coming up in the next Sprint (and get it ready for solving). This allows the team to think about what’s next without being interrupted too often to do it. Teams that do this can accomplish more and more preparation in less and less time. Then, when Sprint Planning comes along, we spend the proper amount of time (1 day for a 4 week Sprint, 1/2 day for a 2 week Sprint) doing an effective job of planning because the PBIs are now nice and small and everyone understands much of the functional requirement of the PBI.\nAny pointers to good books or websites about QA within Scrum?\nLisa Crispin, Brian Marick, Janet Gregory. Lisa and Janet have a good book out there called, Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams.\nIn your experience, what techniques have you used to recognize top performers? Is it recommended?\nThis is a loaded question at best. Scrum is all about teams and teamwork. Going out of your way to identify individuals could hurt those who are really trying, but aren’t the ones recognized. I think the question you have to ask yourself is, “why are you looking for top performers?” What is it you want to do? Do you want to recognize them for high performance? Yes? But why would you want to do that in an organization that is looking for high performing teams, not high performing individuals. See, the trap you can easily fall into is the setting of individual performance over that of your team. This is counter-productive. Individuals that have their eyes set on that particular trophy start setting their own agenda and worry less about their teammates.\nIf you want to recognize high performers, make it a peer-recognition. Let the team members identify that one person who really made it happen, but don’t get carried away with the award. Make it a lunch, honoring the individual. Something relatively small in cost.\nThe real awards should be based around high performing teams.\nShould team members provide estimates on tasks they have no or limited expertise with?\nThey should be involved in the discussion, even if they can’t provide a realistic estimate.\nWhat metrics are generally used to assess a ScrumMaster’s performance?\nI can’t speak to “generally used,” but I can tell you how I would do it as a 23-year manager. When you are trying to evaluate an employee’s performance (not something I recommend getting carried away with — performance evaluation should be part of the normal coaching, not part of the compensation package), I look at it in terms of the roles that the individual plays. For example, a ScrumMaster can be described as:\n- Scrum Team Member\n- Software Engineer (or perhaps, Software Analyst, Systems Analyst, etc.)\n- Individual – career aspirations, goals\nNow, what are this individual’s responsibilities with regard to each role?\n- ScrumMaster – e.g., Keep the team fully functional and productive. Did she do that? How does the team see it?\n- Scrum Team Member — e.g., Stay focused, get PBIs to DONE. Did she help with that? How? How does the team see it?\n- Software Engineer – e.g., learn new techniques, stay technically current, etc. Did she do that? How? How does the team see it?\n- Individual — e.g., is she trying to achieve a new role? Was there something specific she wanted to do this year? Did she do it? Was she effective?\n- Employee – e.g., did she follow company policies? Is she a contributing member of the organization? How? How does the organization see it?\nIf you do what most organizations do and claim this is linked to compensation, you will likely garner excessive disappointment when compensation and salary grades do not truly line up with the level of the performance offered by the employee. Instead, we need to keep our focus simply on being the best that we can be and profiting from the organization’s success in whatever way the organization can realistically afford to do so. The organization that skimps on sharing their success will end up with people who aren’t interested in success, just employment. The organization that shares their success with their employees ends up with people banging on their doors trying to get in. These are two separate issues and should be kept that way.\nHow to project a final product picture to customer if the project requirements keep changing?\nThe question answers itself. If the requirements keep changing, the final product picture will change as well. The best you can do is base your picture on what you know and change it as the product requirements change. If your customer is the one suggesting the changes, that should be enough.\nIf a team is running well with no obstacles, does the ScrumMaster run out of things to do?\nUnlikely. Even with everything is beautiful for the team, there’s still the organizational impediment list that needs to be addressed. Beyond that, there’s the question, “Can my team’s performance be raised? How?”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:06c374c8-8d05-43f4-be1c-a9ba8a4ec856>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my food service establishment's compliance: How should we handle different types of grease waste, and what are the proper disposal methods for each?","answer":"There are two main types of grease waste requiring different handling methods: Yellow grease (like fryer oil) should be collected in designated recycling containers placed outside and can be recycled into products like animal feed, cosmetics, and alternative fuel. Brown grease (FOG recovered from grease traps/interceptors) must be properly disposed of at wastewater treatment facilities. For kitchen cleanup, use paper towels to wipe greasy pans before washing, never pour grease down drains, and don't use detergents to wash grease away as this only moves the problem downstream. For large operations, it's recommended to work with approved grease haulers for proper disposal, while smaller kitchens might use methods like mixing with clay cat litter, though professional disposal is preferred.","context":["Commercial food service establishments, including Portland’s restaurants, are required to have grease traps. Grease management areas must have hard plumbing from areas like sinks, dishwashers, and drains that lead directly to a grease trap. Owners have to keep maintenance records on file.\nGrease traps are necessary to prevent FOG from getting into sewer lines where they can cause blockages and damage. Even with a working grease trap, it can’t be installed and ignored. Check out the most common grease trap cleaning mistakes and what you can do to avoid them.\nFailing to Clean Your Traps Between Inspections\nGrease traps must be cleaned regularly, or they will become clogged and fail to work properly. How often should you clean it? It depends on how much oil you use when cooking. You can also talk to the city’s sewer staff for guidance.\nA good rule of thumb is to have your trap cleaned and inspected every month. This is a general guideline, however, as a restaurant that only serves fried foods, such as a fish and chips shop, may need more frequent cleanings.\nWhen you clean your grease traps, gather several buckets. Turn off the water to the sinks or dishwasher that feeds into the trap Disconnect the grease trap from the sewer lines to prevent FOG from going into the sewers where you could end up paying costly fines. Use a wet vac to suction out any FOG and gray water. As you fill the wet vac, empty the wastewater into buckets.\nUse the recommended cleaning solution and scrub all surfaces, including baffles. Once it’s clean, reconnect the trap to the sewer line and turn on the water. Make sure everything is flowing properly. You then have to get rid of the FOG and gray water.\nFailing to Properly Dispose of Cooking Oils and Grease\nIn addition to cleaning your traps regularly, you also need to dispose of the wastewater properly. You can’t just pour it down the drain, as you’ll just be refilling your grease trap. In a small kitchen, you could mix it with clay cat litter, but it’s best to have it trucked to a wastewater treatment plant.\nOils from cooking fryers go into cooking oil recycling containers. They should be placed outside the door. If oil is spilled, clean it up instantly. Don’t leave it for the rain to wash away to stormwater drains. It will end up in rivers and the ocean where it harms plants and animals.\nBefore washing pans or pots that contain oily ingredients, use paper towels to wipe them as clean as you can. This keeps grease from going down the drain.\nFailing to Train Your Employees on How the Grease Trap Works and Is Cleaned\nAny of your employees who work in the kitchen need to be trained to understand how the grease trap works and what to do if it’s not working properly. They need to know that putting grease from fryers into the drains is a massive mistake that can be costly to your business.\nAll new hires need to be shown where cooking oil recycling bins are located and how to safely pour oil into the recycling containers for cooking oil. Go over how to clean a grease trap and show them where the supplies needed for cleaning it are located.\nEven if you have a small kitchen staff and can’t easily pull someone off a line, never leave a newbie alone to clean the trap without supervision for the first few weeks. Make sure they’re getting adequate training to avoid mistakes.\nCreate a printout that covers the steps needed during the cleaning process. Once you’ve finalized it and know it’s perfect, have it laminated. Hang it near the grease trap for easy reference.\nChoosing the Wrong Type of Grease Trap\nMake sure you’re using the right type of grease trap. In a small deli, a big grease trap isn’t necessary. In a pub that serves fries all day and night, a larger grease trap is essential. You might want a grease interceptor if your establishment works long hours with a lot of greasy foods, such as a doughnut shop.\nA grease trap usually works best with lower flow rates. Grease interceptors handle high flow rates, often more than 50 gallons per minute. If you have high flow rates, consider talking to a grease trap repair and cleaning service to determine the best option for your needs.\nAs you decide which grease trap is best, think about where it will be placed. Is it going to be under a sink, in another room, or in the ground? How often do you want to clean it? If you don’t have time to clean it each month or every couple of weeks, a grease interceptor may be the best choice.\nUsing the Wrong Cleaning Agents\nThe wrong cleaning agents can damage pipes and seals. Homemade mixtures are always a bad idea as some people don’t realize that certain ingredients create toxic fumes. It might seem cheaper, but it’s not if your employer is harmed in the process. Bleach and ammonia are two that can be extremely dangerous if mixed.\nHow do you know which cleaning agent is best? You might get answers by looking at the company’s website. Find out who made your grease trap and look at their guides. If that doesn’t help you, call a grease trap specialist for advice.\nFailing to Protect Your Employees When They’re Cleaning\nWhen working with heavy-duty degreasers and cleaners, make sure your employees are equipped with masks, safety glasses, and gloves that protect the eyes, skin, and nasal passage.\nA commercial grease trap cleaning solution contains warnings against eye and skin contact. Most cleaning solutions use biodegradable enzymes, but others have harsher ingredients like sodium hydroxide that your employees need to use with care.\nRead labels on cleaning products and make sure the necessary steps are taken to protect your employees during the cleaning process. When cleaners are not being used, have a safe place to store them that’s away from foods and cooking utensils.\nFailing to Have Your Trap Cleaned and Inspected Regularly\nRegular cleaning by your kitchen staff is important, but so is regular cleaning and inspection. Hire Northwest Biofuel to clean and inspect your grease trap. As an added benefit, you’ll get cooking oil recycling that offsets some of the cost of the cleaning and inspection.\nWith Northwest Biofuel, you have your grease trap inspected and cleaned regularly, and you have proof to provide to the city. We also file the paperwork so you’re in compliance with the city. With regular cleanings and inspections, you’ll know if there are problems before they arise. You avoid costly fines and penalties that can eat into your profits.\nWe offer several other ways to save money on grease trap cleanings and repairs. Arrange to have us stop by outside of your restaurant’s business hours and leave us a key. That’s an instant discount when you arrange grease trap cleanings with Northwest Biofuel.","FOG Control Program\nFOG stands for Fats, Oils and Greases. FOG is animal and vegetable fats, oils and greases as extracted from a wastewater sample by select solvents in a laboratory. Fats, oils and greases are natural by-products of the cooking and food preparation process.\nThe FOG control program is being implemented by the Buena Park Department of Public Works in order to monitor and reduce the amount of Fats, Oils and Grease that Enters our sanitary sewer system.\nFAQs on FOG\nWhy shouldn’t FOG go down the drain?\nWhen FOG is released into the sewer lines in any amounts, it poses a serious threat to the city's sanitary sewer collection system's ability to remove waste from our community. FOG sticks to the sides of pipes decreasing the pipe's capacity and eventually blocking the pipe entirely. This requires our sewer piping to be cleaned more often and equipment replacement due to grease related damages.\nWhat are the sources of FOG? Who produces FOG?\nCommon sources of FOG include meat fats, dairy products, food scraps, cooking oils, baked goods, sauces, dressings, sandwich spreads, gravies, marinades, dairy products, shortening, lard, butter and margarine.\nFOG is produced by restaurants, cafeterias, delis, bakeries, daycares, assisted living, social halls and residential homeowners – basically, anyone who deals with food, especially while cooking.\nWhy is the issue of SSOs (Sanitary Sewer Overflows) important?\nOverflowing sewers release bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that may be hazardous to human health. The sewage may be released into your business or home, or into our waterways, streets and parks. SSOs are unpleasant and expensive to clean up, and if they occur on your property, it is you, the property owner, who is responsible for the clean-up. Having an SSO occur in your establishment may also lower the number of customers.\nIf the City is responsible for a clean-up, manpower and money are wasted on something that could have been avoided. The costs associated with SSOs are not limited to the Public Utilities clean up costs of containment, removal, and disposal of contaminated materials, emergency line cleaning, disinfectants, sampling and testing, record keeping and documentation, public notification, and OCHCA, EPA & RWQCB enforcement actions. The non-direct costs may include media related costs, property damages, public relations, insurance, worker and public exposure to untreated wastewater (pathogens and viruses) and decreased tourism. These costs will, most likely, trickle down into customers’ sewer bills.\nAre there requirements to control my grease output?\nCurrent California Uniform Plumbing Code (CUPC), which the City of Buena Park adheres to, requires any food service establishment that produces grease laden wastes to install a grease control device.\nWhat type of grease control device do I have and where is it located?\nThere are three types of grease removal devices. One is a large outdoor underground grease interceptor. This is generally made out of concrete and located under manholes outside the restaurant. Another is a smaller indoor grease trap. This is a box which is generally located in the sink area, either above ground or in the floor. The third device is an automatic grease recovery device. This device is a box that separates grease from the water coming out of your kitchen fixtures. The grease is then heated, so that it can be pumped easily to another container, which makes it easy to recycle. This device will most likely be located under a sink or table in your kitchen. If you are unsure of what type of device you have, for your establishment or having problems locating your grease control device, you may contact the FOG Program Officer at (714) 562-3653 or email email@example.com.\nWhat is a grease trap verses a grease interceptor?\nA grease trap is an interior small reservoir built into the wastewater piping closed to the grease producing area. This is normally under the sink but also can be located in the floor. The grease trap is used for conditions where space is limited for an external interceptor. Baffles retain the waste water long enough to separate allowing the grease to rise to the surface. The grease and settled solids can be removed and disposed of properly, either in an exterior grease collection tub or in the garbage. The city recommends grease traps to be cleaned nightly but no less than every two weeks.\nA grease interceptor is an exterior in-ground vault. The vault includes minimum of two compartments with floor between each compartment. These are for larger food service establishments. Interceptors have a minimum capacity of 500 gallons but normally consist of 1000 gallons or more. The city recommends grease interceptors be cleaned monthly but no less than every three months. Click here to see illustrations of a typical plumbing layout and grease trap.\nWill my establishment be inspected?\nYes. In addition to the inspector’s initial inspection to ensure that your grease control device is installed and working properly, an inspector may come from the City of Buena Park to observe normal operations. The inspector has the right to come into your establishment at any reasonable hour.\nWhat will an inspector look for?\nDuring an inspection, they may ask for maintenance and manifest records from licensed grease haulers. These records along with assurance that Kitchen Best Management Practices (BMPs) are properly implemented, will verify compliance with proper waste disposal requirements. The inspector will look to make sure that you have a properly sized grease control device. Then, the inspector will check to make sure that the device is installed and working properly. This includes checking to make sure that it has not been installed backwards, that the baffles are in place and that the device is not leaking, etc. The inspector or city contractor may check to see what volume of grease you currently have in your grease control device and will ask to see your records of maintenance.\nWhat is the grease control device registration?\nFor whichever device you end up using (an interceptor or a trap), you must fill out a grease control device registration application. A city building inspector must come inspect the installation of the grease control device and approve it. The registration application is sent to the City so that a record can be made of your compliance.\nHow big does my grease interceptor have to be?\nThe minimum size for a grease interceptor is 500 gallons, in order to allow for a decent retention time (length of time a drop of water will stay in the tank). The maximum size is 2500 gallons, special approval is required for sizes larger than 2500 gallons by the Building Department.\nHow often should I have my outdoor, in-ground grease interceptor cleaned?\nAs often as it takes to keep below 25% of grease and settled solids. A sludge sampler can be used to determine this volume. A recommended time period is monthly, and the minimum time period between cleanings is three months. A grease interceptor won’t do its job if it isn’t properly maintained. All grease interceptors must be cleaned at least every three months, but some establishments may find it necessary to clean their traps more often. If the establishment has to clean its trap too often, the owner should consider installing a large trap or interceptor. Every interceptor should be cleaned as often as is necessary to avoid exceeding its rated capacity.\nHow often should I have my under-sink grease trap cleaned?\nThe frequency of cleaning for an under-sink grease trap depends upon its size. The City of Buena Park FOG regulations state that under-sink grease traps must be cleaned at least every two weeks. A recommended time period to clean grease traps is daily. A grease trap won’t do its job if it isn’t properly maintained. The trap must also be the proper size in order to work properly. Every trap should be cleaned as often as is necessary to avoid exceeding its rated capacity.\nHow do I clean my grease trap/interceptor?\nThe City of Buena Park requires that you hire an approved and permitted grease hauler to clean out your in-ground grease interceptors. After your device has been installed and inspected, you must maintain your grease control device on a regular basis. If you have an in-ground interceptor tank, the tank must be pumped out completely and sprayed down before it is more than 25% full of solids and grease. The grease hauler who cleans your tank will record this volume. Grease haulers may be retained on contract, and may give you a lower cost for cleaning to do so.\nIf you have a grease trap, you may clean it out yourself. Refer to grease control devise maintenance instructions linked from this website.\nCan I clean the grease interceptor at my food service establishment?\nNot the in-ground, large volume grease interceptor. You must hire a permitted grease hauler to clean it out. However, if you have a smaller indoor grease trap, you may have it cleaned by employees. Refer to the link for interior grease trap maintenance.\nHow do I choose a grease hauler?\nTo service your traps and interceptors, the city has provided a list of grease haulers the FSE may contact directly for service.\nYou have the right to watch the grease hauler and make sure that he or she has pumped out your grease tank fully and has sprayed down the sides. If the grease interceptor is cleaned out properly, that means that you will need it cleaned less frequently, and you are always responsible for the state of your grease control device – so make sure that you’re getting what you paid for. Be sure that you receive a manifest noting the volume of the tank pumped out. Keep the manifests and log sheets on site and accessible for periodic inspections by the City or OCHCA inspectors.\nWhat should I do if I experience a sewer blockage or overflow?\nFirst, call the Buena Park Department of Public Works, FOG Control Program (714) 562-3653. They will come and determine whether the blockage is on your property or City property. If the blockage is occurring on City property and cannot be traced exclusively back to you, then they will perform the clean up. If the blockage is on your property and is obviously due to your improper practices, you will have to hire a plumber to fix the problem.\nWhat do I do with the oil used in deep fryers?\nIf you are using deep fryers in your establishment, contact a rendering company to provide a bin or barrel for regular pick up. Refer to the link for fryer/ yellow grease rendering companies.\nWhat is the difference between yellow grease and brown grease?\nBrown grease means floatable fats, oils, greases and settled solids that are recovered from grease control devices. Brown Grease is composed of floatable FOG and settled solids recovered from grease traps and interceptors. Brown grease is difficult to reuse. The greasy content of the interceptor is known as \"brown\" grease and is generally disposed at a wastewater treatment facility but may become part of renewable energy sources in the future.\nYellow grease means fats, oils, and greases that have not been in contact or contaminated with other sources (water, wastewater, solid waste, etc). An example of yellow grease is fryer oil, which can be recycled into products such as animal feed, cosmetics and alternative fuel. Yellow grease is also referred to as render able FOG.\nShould I use large quantities of detergent to wash grease down the drain?\nProducts such as detergents that claim to dissolve grease may pass the grease down the pipeline and cause problems elsewhere. In short, you remove it from your immediate vicinity only to help create a larger problem downstream.\nShould I use additives to wash grease down the drain?\nAdditives are generally prohibited, as many tend to pass grease down the pipeline and cause problems elsewhere."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b0fe5982-95ce-451c-b838-5034abfb4a64>","<urn:uuid:a70c7a74-a326-4be0-9660-ce4b00acd271>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál es la principal diferencia en el enfoque de validación entre DeFacto y la metodología de validación de especies marinas profundas como el pulpo 'Casper'? Me interesa entender los estándares de verificación en ambos campos científicos! 🤔","answer":"The key difference is that DeFacto validates facts through web searches and natural language processing, providing a confidence score of 0-100% based on trustworthy web sources, while deep-sea species validation like the 'Casper' octopod requires physical specimens for formal description. As explained by Vecchione, even though species can be described based on photographic evidence, proper scientific validation needs at least one physical specimen to assess variability and obtain DNA sequences, making specimen collection essential for formal species description.","context":["Deep Fact Validation\nDeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) is an algorithm for validating statements by finding confirming sources for it on the web. It takes a statement (such as “Jamaica Inn was directed by Alfred Hitchcock”) as input and then tries to find evidence for the truth of that statement by searching for information in the web.\nDeFacto (Deep Fact Validation) is an algorithm for validating statements by finding confirming sources for it on the web. It takes a statement (such as \"Jamaica Inn was directed by Alfred Hitchcock\") as input and then tries to find evidence for the truth of that statement by searching for information in the web. In contrast to typical search engines, it does not just search for textual occurences of parts of the statement, but tries to find web pages, which contain the statement phrased in natural language. It presents the user with a confidence score for the input statement as well as a set of excerpts of relevant web pages, which allows the user to manually look at the evidence.\nThe project has two use cases: * given a statement it can be used to find provenance information for the statement * it can directly try to check whether a statement is likely to be true\nArchitecture and Approach\nThe DeFacto system consists of the components depicted above. The system takes an RDF triple as input and returns a confidence value for this triple as well as possible evidence for the fact. The evidence consists of a set of webpages, textual excerpts from those pages and meta-information on the pages. The text excerpts and the associated meta information allow the user to quickly get an overview over possible credible sources for the input statement: Instead of having to use search engines, browsing several webpages and looking for relevant pieces of information, the user can more efficiently review the presented information. Moreover, the system uses techniques which are adapted specifically for fact validation instead of only having to rely on generic information retrieval techniques of search engines.\nRetrieving Webpages: The first task of the DeFacto system is to retrieve webpages which are relevant for the given task. The retrieval is carried out by issuing several queries to a regular search engine. These queries are computed by verbalizing the RDF triple using natural-language patterns extracted by the BOA framework. As a next step, the highest ranked webpages for each query are retrieved. Those webpages are candidates for being sources for the input fact. Both the search engine queries as well as the retrieval of webpages are executed in parallel to keep the response time for users within a reasonable limit. Note that usually this does not put a high load on particular web servers as webpages are usually derived from several domains.\nEvaluating Webpages: Once all webpages have been retrieved, they undergo several further processing steps. First, plain text is extracted from each webpage by removing most HTML markup. We can then apply our fact confirmation approach on this text. In essence, the algorithm decides whether the web page contains a natural language formulation of the input fact. This step distinguishes DeFacto from information retrieval methods. If no webpage confirms a fact according to DeFacto, then the system falls back on light-weight NLP techniques and computes whether the webpage does at least provide useful evidence. In addition to fact confirmation checking, the system computes different indicators for the trustworthiness of a webpage. These indicators are of central importance because a single trustworthy webpage confirming a fact may be a more useful source than several webpages with low trustworthiness. The fact confirmation and the trustworthiness indicators of the most relevant webpages are presented to the user.\nConfidence Measurement: In addition to finding and displaying useful sources, DeFacto also outputs a general confidence value for the input fact. This confidence value ranges between 0% and 100% and serves as an indicator for the user: Higher values indicate that the found sources appear to confirm the fact and can be trusted. Low values mean that not much evidence for the fact could be found on the Web and that the websites that do confirm the fact (if such exist) only display low trustworthiness. The training data for this step is available ((https://github.com/AKSW/DeFacto/blob/master/core/resources/training/data.zip?raw=true here)). Naturally, DeFacto is a (semi-)automatic approach: We do assume that users will not blindly trust the system, but additionally analyze the provided evidence.\nDeFacto - A Multilingual Fact Validation Interface\nNote: Semantic Web Challenge, International Semantic Web Conference 2015.","By John Barrat\nA social media celebrity was born last week when the bright lights and camera of NOAA’s remotely operated vehicle Deep Discoverer zoomed in on a ghostly white octopod alone on a sediment-covered rock some 2½ miles deep in the ocean near the Hawaiian Archipelago. Its lack of pigment cells—called chromatophores—led internet viewers to suggest naming it Casper, after the friendly cartoon ghost. Internet blogs and news pages turned the octopus into an overnight cephalopod sensation.\n“What’s really remarkable is that this is a fairly charismatic organism that we didn’t even know it existed until less than a week ago,” says Michael Vecchione, Zoologist at NOAA Fisheries’ National Systematics Laboratory and Curator of Cephalopods at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. “It’s a really good example of how little we know about life in the deep sea. And of course, the deep sea is most of the living space on our planet. So it’s a good illustration of how little we know about life on our own planet.”\nWhile the octopod is almost certainly an undescribed species, Vecchione says, truth be told, “new species in the deep sea are a dime a dozen.” What’s most notable is that “it is the deepest record for this type of animal—an incirrate octopod.” Incirrate octopods, unlike deep-sea “dumbo” octopods, have no fins on the sides of their bodies and no finger-like structures near the suckers on their arms. Incirrates are common in shallow water.\nHere, Vecchione answers a few more questions about “Casper” for Smithsonian Science:\nQ: Is lack of body pigment unusual in deep ocean animals?\nVecchione: No. Lack of pigment is one of the patterns that you see in deep sea animals. There are several groups of deep dwelling animals that are less pigmented than their shallow dwelling relatives. While there is no sunlight at that depth there is light that is produced by bioluminescence, which is why deep dwelling animals still have functional eyes.\nQ: In your blog you mention that cirrate, or finned, octopods are more common at lower depths. Do fins somehow facilitate life at lower depths?\nVecchione: Fins are hydro-dynamically more efficient than jet propulsion for swimming [a standard locomotion for shallow-water octopods]. Because the deep sea is a low-food environment, having low-energy locomotion makes sense.\nQ: Any idea how large this new octopod is?\nVecchione: Deep Discoverer has a laser measurement system that uses two parallel lasers 10 centimeters apart and it was turned on during part of the video. Based on that I think the total length of the animal was a little over 10 centimeters maybe 12. Its mantle length [the part of the body above the head, a standard cephalopod measurement] was maybe 5 centimeters.\nQ: Care to guess how old it is?\nVecchione: There’s no way of knowing. We used to assume that all cephalopods basically live very short lives but it turns out that this is not necessarily true for deep sea stuff.\nQ: What do they eat?\nVecchione: What you saw in that video is everything we know about that species. I could speculate it probably was looking for some food or might be looking for a mate, standard biological stuff….\nQ: At 2½ miles deep how does this animal survive the crushing water pressure?\nVecchione: From our experience the water pressure is high but it is normal for an animal that lives there. Usually people think in terms of water pressure crushing something, but this animal has no gas spaces inside it to be compressed, so the pressure inside the animal is the same as the pressure outside the animal. It does have three hearts that pump blood around in its body by creating pressure in the circulatory system that is independent of the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of its body. It has one systemic heart in the center of its body and one auxiliary heart associated with each of its two gills.\nQ: Can scientist describe a new species like this from just a video?\nVecchione: Even though there have been species described based on photographic evidence, it is not the best way to go. You pretty much need at least one specimen in hand and preferably several so you can assess variability. And a modern description usually includes a DNA sequence generated from the animal’s tissue. I am not planning on formally describing and naming this octopod until I get my hands on a specimen.\nQ: How do you know it’s not an albino?\nVecchione: The eyes are pigmented, so it is unlikely to be an albino.\nQ: Deep Discover was launched from the NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer. What is the aim of these deep sea explorations?\nVecchione: Despite the role that the ocean plays in supporting our wellbeing, 95 percent of the world’s ocean remains unexplored. Increasing baseline knowledge of ocean habitats is critical to the conservation and preservation of these ecosystems. Exploratory missions, such as those conducted on the Okeanos Explorer, are necessary to expand our knowledge of the unknown and to provide baseline data for resource managers.\nA few of the objectives for this current expedition in Hawaii include: Mapping; acquire data to support monument and sanctuary science and management needs; discover and characterize vulnerable marine habitats, particularly high-density deep-sea coral and sponge communities, and to collect data and geologic samples to characterize seamounts within the Prime Crust Zone."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9854848a-f99c-49e3-bba3-0efcfd40f1d7>","<urn:uuid:5ddc17d7-70f4-43ca-957e-2614420a1cf4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do Buddhist and Dooyeweerdian philosophies agree on the existence of an eternal individual soul?","answer":"Both philosophies reject the concept of an independent, eternal individual soul. Buddhism maintains that any sense of having an individual eternal soul is illusory, and realizing this brings enlightenment. Similarly, Dooyeweerd's school argues that we cannot view man's essence 'in itself' separate from its relation to God, rejecting the idea of a naturally immortal soul based on an essence abstracted from its relation to God.","context":["Berkouwer notes “Scripture doesn’t talk about man in the abstract, but man in his relation to God” (195).\nBiblical use of the word “soul.”\nSometimes it is “nefesh,” meaning life and can refer to man himself. Berkouwer rejects that “soul” is a “localized religious part of man” (201). The Bible’s interchangeable usage between soul and life should draw attention to the fact that the “heart” is of primary importance: “The heart shows forth the deeper aspect of the whole humanness of man, not some functional localization in a part of man which would be the most important part” (202-203).\nConcerning anthropological dualisms\nSuch a view sees the soul as the “higher” part, closer to God. Leads to ascetism. However, evil in the bible is never localized in a part of man.\nBavinck attacks trichotomy because Scripture knows of no original dualism between spirit and matter (209). The trichotomist sees the soul as mediating between body and spirit (find Damascene’s comment that the soul is higher point, cf Bruce McCormack, Engaging the Doctrine of God).\nDualism and duality are not identical (211). We can speak of a duality in God’s creation man and woman, without positing an ontological dualism between them (this is where Maximus and Jakob Boehme err). “Duality within created reality does not exclude harmony and unity, but is exactly oriented towards it” (211).\nDoes soul and body involve a tension, and if so that would make it a dualism? If it does involve a tension, we must reject not only trichotomy, but dichotomy.\nPer the confessions and creeds, “there is a great difference between non-scientific references to a dual aspect of human nature and a thesis that man is composed of two substances, body and soul” (213-214).\nThey oppose the idea that all the rich variation of humanness can be forced into two substantial categories.\nHendrik Gerhardus Stoker defines substance as the “systatic core of man, that which functions in all spheres” (H.G. Stoker, Die nuwere Wijsbegeerte aan die Vrije Universiteit, 1933, 40ff.).\nFor the Dooyeweerdian critique, matter can never be an independent counter-pole to form.\nImmortality of the Soul\nGenuine and real life in Scripture is life in communion with God. The philosophical notion of “immortality of the soul” calls death a lie and misunderstands the judgment of God (250).\nThe main contention of Vollenhoven and Dooyeweerd whether there was a natural immortality based on an essence abstracted from its relation to God, from which we can draw further conclusions, such as the soul’s “indestructibility” (249).\nPer Van der Leuw, there is no continued existence of the soul as such after death, “but a continuation of the contact point by God even though death” (Onsterfelijkheid of Opstanding, 25 quoted in Berkouwer 252).\n- The problem of what happens when we die does not involve a purely spiritual salvation but can only be answered in the context of death and the Day of Judgment (Althaus).\nIs immortality of the soul correlative with the substantial dualism of mind-body? This dichotomy raises substantial (pun?) problems and questions (255):\n- When the “soul” is separated from the body, what activities is it still able to carry out?\n- If the body is the organ of the soul (as in Aquinas), and the soul needs the body to carry out its functions, how can the soul know or do anything after death?\n- Dooyeweerd notes that the psychic functions are indissolubly connected with the total temporal-cosmic relationship of all modal functions and cannot be abstracted from this relationship.\n- Thus, we have a “living soul” which does not live.\n- Rather, with Dooyeweerd we should speak of a duality which is supra-temporal in the religious center of man (heart) and the whole temporal-functional complex.\n- Dooyeweerd does say that the soul continues as a form of existence with an individuality structure (Berkouwer 257n. 33).\nDoes Dooyeweerd’s school give us a “psychology without a soul?”\n- No, for Dooyeweerd says we cannot view man’s essence “in itself” and then tack it onto a relation with God.","Humans have long known that we somehow exist as a separate entity other than our physical selves. The ethereal concept of the soul is present throughout ancient religious, philosophical, and mythological traditions. Composed of the incorporeal essence of a living human being, the soul is considered to be the divinity of an individual’s highest being, often synonymous with the mind or self.\nOur modern-day conception of the soul stems from thousands of years of various theories about the origin and mortality of the soul and its relationship to the body. There is evidence even among prehistoric people that there was a belief of a separate spirit from the body that resides in it and exists after death. These theories, ideas, and beliefs have paved our present understanding that we have of our existence in this life.\nEarly Conceptions of The Soul\nMany cultures have acknowledged the existence of an immaterial energy of human life that is analogous to the soul. The essence of a soul has been attributed to all living things since the concept of the soul was discovered. While there is a collective belief of the soul’s presence, there have been various perspectives on the simplicity and immortality of the soul throughout ancient history.\nAncient Egyptians and Chinese peoples conceived the idea of a dual soul.\nFor the ancient Egyptians, an individual’s life on earth was considered only one part of an eternal journey. The personality was created at the moment of one’s birth, but the soul was an immortal entity inhabiting a mortal vessel. When that vessel failed and the person’s body died, the soul went on to another plane of existence. If it was justified by the gods, the soul would live forever in a paradise which was a mirror image of one’s earthly existence. The Egyptian ka (breath) was thought to survive death and remain near the body, while the spiritual ba (soul) was thought to proceed to the region of the dead.\nThe ancient Chinese theory of the soul has two components as well. The earthly aspect of the soul po comes into existence as human life begins. Po is the spirit of a person’s physical nature that is expressed in bodily strength and movements. After it emerges, the heavenly aspect of the soul hun is created. Hun is the spirit of a person’s vital force that is expressed in consciousness and intelligence, which survives the grave and is the object of ancestor worship.\nThe early Hebrews had a different concept of the soul, one that did not separate it from the body but rather connected it through the breath. Biblical references to the soul are related to the concept of Hebrew nefesh (soul) which refers to the breath and establishes no distinction between the ethereal soul and the corporeal body.\nAncient Greek concepts of the soul noticeably varied according to the particular era and philosophical school. As their ideas evolved, they influenced how we perceive the soul today. The presence of the Greek word psuchē (soul) in concepts such as psychiatry and psychology suggests that the Greeks viewed the soul in the modern way. However, the absence of any psychological connotations in the earliest extant practices of psuchē shows that the early Greek concepts of the soul were different from later beliefs. Pythagoras believed that the soul was of divine creation and existed before and after death. Plato and Socrates also accepted this idea that the soul was immortal, while Aristotle regarded only part of the soul, the noûs (intellect), to be immortal. Epicurus believed that both the body and soul ended at death.\nThe early Christian philosophers adopted the Greek concept of the soul’s immortality and believed that the soul was created by God and imbued into the body at conception. In Christian theology St. Augustine regarded the soul as a “rider” on the body, emphasizing the divide between the material and the immaterial, with the soul capturing the true essence of a person. However, although body and soul were separate, it was not possible to conceive a soul without its body.\nThe soul was thought to be a universal and eternal self in Hinduism, referred to as the atman (breath). Individual souls were believed to be imprisoned in the body at birth and at death the atman was passed into a new existence determined by karma, which is the sum of the consequences of actions in all states of existence, and decide the fate of a person in future existences. On the other hand, Buddhism counters this idea of the atman, maintaining the view that any sense of having an individual eternal soul or believing in a continuous universal self is illusory, and realizing this brings true enlightenment.\nThe existence of the soul onwards evolved as the world did. Through ancient history there have been various concepts of the relation of the soul to the body, and there have been numerous ideas about when the soul comes into existence and if it dies. Ancient Greek beliefs varied and evolved over time, and they pushed through to Western ideology. The soul is standardly thought to be a distinguishing mark between living things, and encapsulates the essence of who we are. It is thought to have eschatological and psychological attributes. This immaterial aspect or essence of a human being provides individuality and humanity, and is the bridge between us and the divine. It is thought to be the energy of life and the source of our deep connection to the Universe, transcending all spiritual beliefs.\nAroche, C. (2017, April 17). The Body, Mind, Soul Connection.

{"question":"¿Cuáles son las amenazas to blue carbon ecosystems, and how does climate change affect seagrass resilience?","answer":"The main threats to blue carbon ecosystems include coastal development, pollution from nutrient runoff, and climate change impacts. Regarding seagrass resilience to climate change specifically, research has shown that seagrass meadows' response to marine heatwaves varies both spatially and temporally. While some seagrass meadows can recover within 3 years from heatwave-induced die-offs, their recovery rates are modulated by water depth. During die-offs, high temperatures cause a shift in trophic status from balanced to net heterotrophy, then returning to net autotrophy as the meadow recovers. Scientific measurements suggest that seagrasses will not be 'winners' in more acidic, warmer oceans.","context":["When we think about carbon and climate change, our minds often go to fossil fuels, deforestation, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, there’s another side to the carbon story that’s just as important – the role of coastal ecosystems in storing and sequestering carbon. This is where the concept of “Blue Carbon” comes into play.\nThe Role of Blue Carbon in Climate Change\nCarbon Sequestration in Coastal Ecosystems\nBlue carbon refers to the carbon captured and stored by the world’s coastal and marine ecosystems. These ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, act as carbon sinks, capturing and storing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In fact, they can sequester carbon at a rate up to 35 times faster than tropical rainforests.\nThe Blue Carbon Initiative\nRecognizing the importance of these ecosystems, the Blue Carbon Initiative was launched to promote their conservation and restoration. The initiative brings together governments, research institutions, NGOs, and communities to protect and restore these vital ecosystems, which not only help in climate change mitigation but also provide numerous other ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation, water purification, and coastal protection.\nCoastal Ecosystems and Blue Carbon\nMangroves are one of the most important blue carbon ecosystems. These unique trees, which grow in intertidal zones, have complex root systems that trap sediments, slowing down water flow and allowing organic material to settle. This creates a carbon-rich soil that can store significant amounts of carbon.\nSeagrasses, another vital blue carbon ecosystem, are flowering plants that grow in shallow coastal waters. They have the ability to capture and store large amounts of carbon in their roots and sediment, making them highly efficient carbon sinks.\nSalt marshes, found in the intertidal zone of coastal areas, are another important blue carbon ecosystem. These marshes are highly productive, with plants that capture and store carbon in their biomass and soil.\nThreats to Blue Carbon Ecosystems\nOne of the main threats to blue carbon ecosystems is coastal development. As coastal areas become more developed, these ecosystems are often destroyed or degraded, leading to the release of stored carbon back into the atmosphere.\nPollution, especially nutrient runoff from agriculture and sewage, can also harm blue carbon ecosystems. Excess nutrients can lead to algal blooms, which deplete oxygen levels in the water, harming seagrasses, mangroves, and other organisms.\nClimate change poses a significant threat to blue carbon ecosystems. Rising sea levels and temperatures can lead to the loss of these ecosystems, while increased storm intensity can cause physical damage.\nConservation Efforts for Blue Carbon Ecosystems\nTo counter these threats, various restoration projects are underway to bring back lost or degraded blue carbon ecosystems. These projects involve planting mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, and are often done in collaboration with local communities.\nPolicy measures, such as designating protected areas and creating incentives for conservation and restoration, are also crucial in protecting blue carbon ecosystems. By recognizing the value of these ecosystems, we can ensure their conservation and restoration, leading to long-term benefits for the climate and biodiversity.\nThe Future of Blue Carbon\nThe concept of blue carbon is still relatively new, but it’s gaining recognition and momentum. As we continue to understand the importance of these ecosystems in climate change mitigation, we can expect more efforts to conserve and restore them. With collaboration between governments, researchers, NGOs, and communities, we can protect and enhance these vital ecosystems for future generations.\n- Biology Niche: Exploring the Fascinating World\n- Biofuels: The Future of Sustainable Energy\n- Biodiversity: Exploring Nature’s Tapestry\nIn conclusion, blue carbon is a crucial part of the global carbon cycle, with coastal ecosystems playing a key role in capturing and storing carbon. By conserving and restoring these ecosystems, we can mitigate climate change while also enjoying other ecosystem services. The future of blue carbon is promising, and with continued efforts, we can ensure these ecosystems are protected for generations to come.\nWhat is blue carbon?\nBlue carbon refers to the carbon captured and stored by the world’s coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes. These ecosystems act as carbon sinks, helping to mitigate climate change by sequestering large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nWhy are coastal ecosystems important in capturing carbon?\nCoastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, are crucial for capturing carbon because they have unique properties that allow them to trap and store carbon in their biomass and sediments. These ecosystems can sequester carbon at a rate up to 35 times faster than tropical rainforests, making them highly efficient carbon sinks.\nWhat is the Blue Carbon Initiative?\nThe Blue Carbon Initiative is a global program that aims to promote the conservation and restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems to enhance their capacity to capture and store carbon. The initiative brings together governments, research institutions, NGOs, and communities to work towards protecting and restoring these vital ecosystems for climate change mitigation and other ecosystem services.\nWhat are some threats to blue carbon ecosystems?\nCoastal development, pollution, and climate change are the primary threats to blue carbon ecosystems. Coastal development can lead to the destruction or degradation of these ecosystems, while pollution, especially nutrient runoff, can harm their health. Climate change, with rising sea levels and temperatures, can also result in the loss of these ecosystems and increased storm intensity can cause physical damage.\nHow can we protect and restore blue carbon ecosystems?\nTo protect and restore blue carbon ecosystems, conservation efforts include restoration projects, policy measures, and community involvement. Restoration projects involve planting mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, often in collaboration with local communities. Policy measures, such as designating protected areas and creating incentives for conservation and restoration, are crucial in protecting these ecosystems. Additionally, raising awareness and involving local communities in conservation efforts are essential for the long-term success of these initiatives.","Loss of seagrass ecosystems is accelerating globally, making large-scale restoration efforts more important than ever. Successful restoration and the return of ecosystem services provided by these habitats give reasons to be optimistic. Our research focuses on the largest seagrass restoration in the world: a 36 km2 restoration of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in the Virginia Coast Reserve coastal bays. Long-term data collected over the last 20 years gives us a unique opportunity to study both the mechanisms and feedbacks of restoration and the resilience of seagrass meadows, especially to marine heatwaves that are increasingly in frequency and duration.\nPositive feedbacks enhance ecosystem state change\n• Trajectories of seagrass restoration are non-linear (McGlathery et al. 2012)\n• A positive feedback of the seagrass canopy on sediment stabilization improves light availability and enhances habitat suitability for seagrass growth (Carr et al. 2010, 2012a,b, 2016; Hansen & Reidenbach 2012, 2013; Reidenbach & Timmerman 2019)\n• Restoration by seeds promotes genetic diversity and population structure, especially where barriers to natural recruitment exist (Reynolds et al. 2012a,b, 2013)\nRestoration reinstates ecosystem services\n• Key ecosystem services are reinstated within a decade of restoration by seeding and are enhanced by genetic diversity (McGlathery et al. 2012, Reynolds et al. 2012, Orth et al. in review)\n• Primary productivity measured by aquatic eddy covariance is enhanced 10-25 fold in seagrass meadows compared to unvegetated sediments (Hume et al. 2011, Rheuban et al. 2014a,b)\n• Seagrass restoration reestablishes the coastal nitrogen filter through enhanced nitrogen burial (10x) and denitrification (4x) (Aoki & McGlathery 2017, 2018, Aoki et al. 2019)\n• Carbon sequestration in plant biomass and burial in sediments at the meadow scale is on par with natural meadows (Greiner et al. 2013, Oreska et al. 2017a, Berger et al. 2020)\nResilience to ocean warming varies both spatially and temporally\n• Seagrass meadows recovered in some regions within 3 years from a heatwave-induced die-off\n• High temperatures caused a shift in trophic status from balanced to net heterotrophy during the die-off to net autotrophy as the meadow recovered (Berger et al. 2020)\n• Water depth modulates rates of recovery following a marine heatwave (Aoki et al. 2020)\n• Aquatic eddy covariance measurements suggest seagrass will not be ‘winners’ in more acidic warmer oceans (Berg et al. 2019)\nConnectivity is central to carbon and sediment dynamics\n• Up to half the carbon buried in seagrass sediments comes from adjacent ecosystems (Greiner et al. 2016, Oreska et al. 2017b)\n• Seagrass meadows reduce sediment fluxes and wave energy at the salt marsh edge (Carr et al. 2018)\n• Long-term aquatic eddy covariance measurements (11 years) suggest that carbon burial matches net external carbon inputs to the seagrass meadow (Berger et al. 2020)\nOreska, M.P.J., K.J.

Orphaned young, he was brought up in the household of one of the richest and most venerable aristocrats of the time, Symmachus. He married Symmachus’s daughter and pursued a typical career for a senatorial scion of the time, alternating between ceremonial public office and private leisure.\nIn two ways, however, Boethius was unique. He was far and away the best educated Roman of his age: indeed, there had been no one like him for a century, and there would never be another (the senate, long since ceremoniously inane, disappeared forever by the end of the sixth century). He had a command of the Greek language adequate to make him a student, translator, and commentator of the Platonic philosophies of his age (to which we give the name neo-Platonism, to distinguish their opinions from the original doctrines of Plato himself).\nBoethius may in fact have studied in the Greek east, perhaps at Athens, perhaps at Alexandria, but we cannot be sure. At any rate, he undertook an ambitious project of translating and interpreting all the works of both Plato and Aristotle and then – he opined – demonstrating the essential agreement of the two. Only a few pieces of this large undertaking were completed before Boethius’s life was cut short.\nFor the other unique facet of Boethius’s character was that he took public affairs so seriously that he lost his life at the hands of an authoritarian monarch: such complete devotion to the public weal had long since faded from aristocratic fashion. Little is to be made of his term as consul in 510, or of his doting presence at the consular celebrations of 522 when his two sons held the office simultaneously. But in the early 520’s, he served as magister officiorum in the half-Roman regime of the Ostrogothic king Theoderic. Theoderic had taken Italy at the behest of the emperors in Constantinople; but political and theological fashions had changed in the thirty years since Theoderic entered Italy. In the reign of the emperor Justin (519-527), the aging Theoderic fell out with Constantinople; somehow, in ways that remain hotly controversial, Boethius came to be suspected by his monarch of disloyal sympathies; the suspicion may indeed have been well-placed, but the sympathies may have been well-grounded.\nIn 525 Boethius was executed. His father-in-law Symmachus went to the block not long after. When Theoderic died in August 526, legend quickly but implausibly had it that he was haunted at the end by his crimes.\nThe philosophical works of Boethius have been identified as the most influential bridge between classic and medieval philosophy. His translations of Aristotle’s logic are single handedly responsible for their survival. Boethius also wrote treatises on the liberal arts that were used extensively in the creation of medieval education. It is his last and most influential work, the Consolation of Philosophy, which has left the most lasting mark on philosophy. Through this work, Boethius discusses both theological as well as philosophical issues. Though it is Platonic in origin, it draws form Aristotelian and Stoic teachings.\nThe Consolation of Philosophy has been published in every European language, and was one of the most popular books of the medieval period. It is an instrumental work in understanding the transition from classical philosophy to medieval philosophy.\nThe Consolation of Philosophy is apparently the fruit of Boethius’s spell of imprisonment awaiting trial and execution. Its literary genre, with a regular alternation of prose and verse sections, is called Menippean Satire, after Roman models of which fragments and analogues survive. The dialogue between two characters (one of whom we may call Boethius, but only on condition that we distinguish Boethius the character from Boethius the author, who surely manipulated his self-representation for literary and philosophical effect) is carefully structured according to the best classical models. Its language is classical in intent, but some of the qualities that would characterize medieval Latin are already discernible.\nMajor Works of Boethius\n– The Consolation of Philosophy\n– Translations from the Greek (e.g. Aristotle’s ‘logical treatises’, Porphyry’s ‘Isagogue’)\n– Commentaries on the works of Plato and Aristotle"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:10d5704d-767e-46f8-92a3-2b5b218676ad>","<urn:uuid:1c733bc1-73b3-4c8d-8860-ec4141f0fc21>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the collaborative approaches differ between Waymo and ZF in developing autonomous vehicle technology?","answer":"ZF and Waymo exhibit different collaborative approaches in developing autonomous vehicle technology. ZF emphasizes wide-ranging partnerships, working with companies like Nvidia, Mobileye/Intel, Faurecia, Hella, and vehicle manufacturers like Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover, recognizing that no single company can tackle vehicle autonomy alone. They also engage with government and academia. Waymo, on the other hand, primarily focuses on internal development and testing, using their own driver technology across multiple vehicle classes, from robotaxis to Class 8 tractor-trailer trucks, while utilizing photo-realistic simulations for testing rather than emphasizing external partnerships.","context":["ZF is a global technology company and tier one supplier to the automotive industry, with over 160,000 employees globally in 41 countries. Its UK footprint consists of 10 key facilities and almost 3,000 staff, a third of which are engineers engaged in research and development.\nWe spoke to ZF’s Peter Lakie, Senior Vice President of Customer and Business Development, on connected and automated mobility (CAM), industry collaboration and Covid-19’s impact on the future of transport.\nTell us about your role at ZF…\nI lead ZF’s Sales and Customer Development function within the UK. Automated and autonomous driving is a key technology field for ZF. As a leading developer of self-driving hardware and software, from sensors to complete autonomous shuttles, ZF is making substantial investments in the autonomous game. Our goal of zero accidents and zero emissions has led to the planned investment of some 12 billion euros over a five-year period as we look to be a key contributor for a clean, safe and sustainable mobility landscape. ZF also specialises in advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) as well as passive safety technology, making us one of few market actors to support all automation levels from L0 – L5.\nWhat are the main CAM priorities for ZF in the short and long term, and how do these align with the UK Connected and Automated Mobility Roadmap to 2030?\nFor ZF, many of the focus areas of the Roadmap are of great interest, and there are a number where we can be potential contributors. For example, ZF has been developing ADAS sensors and systems in the UK for over 40 years, and as the world’s largest automotive safety camera supplier and a leading developer of radar and lidar systems, we can have input into the sensor development area and the test development area in which system validation is a key to safe operation. This is something we are deeply involved in and could be a partner in a suggested UK testbed for autonomous operation. The use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in achieving higher levels of autonomy and the Operational Design Domains taxonomy are also of keen interest.\nIn your opinion, what role does collaboration play in the ongoing development of CAM?\nOne thing we have understood from early on is that no single company or entity can attempt to tackle the vehicle autonomy challenge alone. We have built a strong network of technology partners with companies like Nvidia, Mobileye/Intel, Faurecia, Hella and others that are working collaboratively on the many facets of autonomy while engaging with other stakeholders in government, academia and beyond to unravel the complexities of autonomy. And, of course, we are collaborating with our UK-based vehicle manufacturer customers like Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover, and many others to supply or develop leading-edge systems and functions.\nCan you tell us a little bit about why you became a CAM Creator in the UK Connected and Automated Mobility Roadmap to 2030: CAM Creators Update?\nThe pursuit of autonomous driving is a monumental task and laying out the steps in an organised and logical roadmap is essential to approaching this challenge. We are very fortunate to have the Zenzic organisation who are working with all of the key stakeholders to help create the path to connected and automated mobility in the UK, with its unique requirements [e.g. right hand drive].\nThe governmental role in bringing forth clear rules and regulations overseeing the implementation of autonomy in a safe manner is a critical element. Meanwhile the foundational technologies of sensors, control units and vehicle motion control actuators working in concert in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems form the foundation for automated driving and can save countless lives along the way. As we seek to significantly reduce the number of road accidents and fatalities and increase the efficiency of our transportation systems in the UK, the Roadmap will be an important contributor to public safety and environmental goals and ZF looks forward to partnering in these future endeavours.\nWe have seen a big shift in the use of transport this year with the effects of Covid-19, how do you think this will impact the future of transport?\nWhile it is true that the terrible consequences of the global coronavirus pandemic have caused in some cases a slowing of progress, we also see opportunities. Green recovery programmes can help cities invest in modernising their public transport system. Advanced CAM technology such as electrified autonomous shuttles have the potential to render urban transport cleaner, more efficient and inclusive, creating closer and more frequent connections between suburban areas and inner cities. Together with its wholly owned subsidiary 2getthere, ZF is the market leader in L4 driverless shuttle technology, having completed more than 100 million kilometers and carried over 14 million passengers since 1997. Building a type-approval framework for L4 autonomous shuttles in the UK should be in our view be a key part of the road-mapping exercise.","When it comes to convenience and providing freedom, the automobile is one of the most important inventions ever made. This is especially true for people in countries with large expanses, like the U.S., that practically demands to be driven over. We didn’t see a great number of changes in the general design, however, until the past 25 years or so. Now, automakers provide cars with Bluetooth connectivity, keyless ignition, electric engines for environmental safety, and much more. The autonomous vehicle (AV) has even been a goal for many automakers and dreamers as far back as the 1930s. Today, the self-driving car is a reality, and it’s closer to becoming commonplace than you may think.\nThanks to technological advancements in artificial intelligence, 3D imaging, LIDAR, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, driverless cars have taken to public roads for the first time in a variety of experiments, and they’ve even made it into the hands of human drivers. Of course, these autonomous cars offer much more than greater personal convenience (who wouldn’t love to be able to get some work done as your futuristic car chauffeurs you around?). They’ll change the way the automotive industry makes cars, and they’re bound to have a tremendous impact on the transportation industry. In fact, one of the greatest fears surrounding autonomous vehicles is that they’ll put human drivers in the transportation industry out of work.\nSuch concerns are a bit premature, however. Regulations regarding these vehicles are still up in the air, but it’s quite possible that autonomous trucks used in shipping and other passenger jobs would require a human driver to be seated in the driver’s seat and to actively maintain speeds using adaptive cruise control while also taking periodic control of the steering wheel. Such regulations have already been proposed, but concerns about producing barriers to autonomous technology have kept them from being a sure thing.\nNo matter how anyone feels about autopilot cars, test vehicles have been on the road for the last decade, and car companies are working extremely hard to make these builds an everyday reality. Here are some of the main self-driving car companies that are worth watching as innovators continue to push the technology in the United States and beyond.\nTesla, Inc. is an electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California. The current CEO, Elon Musk, has been a long-time supporter of driverless cars, arguably to a fault. In June, he admitted that he underestimated the difficulty of designing a completely safe and reliable self-driven car. This comes after disappointments last year, and in previous years, about the pace of development for full self-driving technology (which would still require regular input from a human driver). Still, this hasn’t stopped fans from adolescence and well into adulthood from believing in Tesla and an autonomous driving system with automatic startup, brakes, driver-facing cameras, and more.\nIt remains to be seen if Tesla can truly live up to the ambitious promises that have been made regarding its robot car technology, but it’s certainly a company worth keeping up with, if only for the fact that it’s encouraged the public to accept the idea of autonomous vehicles and has even built hype around the search for the best self-driving car.\nFormerly known as the Google self-driving car project, Waymo currently runs a self-driving taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, and has Chandler, Arizona fully mapped. Their goal is to make it safer and easier for everyone in North America and beyond to get around without the need for anyone in the driver’s seat. Google has always been a leader in machine learning, computer algorithms, and AI advancements, and with the Waymo Driver, they’re looking to create an unmatched autonomous driving experience with a fully automated vehicle.\nThe tech company has been working on this project in some form since 2009, and they currently boast “the most experienced driver in the world.” Waymo has been tested in over 10 states, and it’s driven literally billions of miles in simulations. The use of photo-realistic simulations is becoming a common method for testing autonomous car technology, and it helps cars learn to navigate streets in difficult scenarios with infinite steering possibilities. These simulations go far beyond the video games that high school students and young adults often play with NVIDIA and other GPU support. These simulations test cars on real-world streets and replicate everything from realistic acceleration and motion to a variety of worst-case scenarios. Ultimately, the goal is to create a car company that can eliminate the frustrations normally associated with driving.\nWaymo has also tested with multiple classes of vehicles to make sure their driver is safe with anything. Waymo One is the robotaxi service that moves people, but the technology company also has such systems active in Waymo Via for transporting goods. Waymo technology has been applied to vehicles as difficult as Class 8 tractor-trailer trucks, including safe automatic braking, lane keeps assist, and other safety features. Dynamic motion sensors give Waymo’s self-driving tech a better sense of control compared to other technologies, and it’s one of the best examples of an autonomous car project that ranks high in the present day.\nThe ride-hailing service Uber was working on similar systems for self-driving features, but it recently sold its autonomous ride subsidiary to the startup Aurora Technologies, despite claiming that it was a significant part of Uber’s future. The relatively new company, Aurora, has stated in the past year that it seeks to build the next generation of self-driving cars and make them a reality in the near future. They’ve formed partnerships with big names in the automotive industry, including Paccar and Volvo, to make the dream a reality.\nThey seek to transform mobility with their new technology in ways that will promote safety, improve access to transportation (such as helping people with disabilities drive with assistance systems), and help small businesses by making driving tasks like moving goods safer. We’ll see if their collaborations bear fruit when their first commercial product is revealed.\nThis luxury vehicle company isn’t just talking about autonomous driving in theory—its new model year cars all support at least level one automation, and some even support level two. There are basically five levels of autonomous driving, with level one being driver assistance. This is the technology that assists drivers without taking full control. Examples of an advanced driver assistance system could be warnings that display when another vehicle is in your blind spot or built-in GPS systems that load map data. This level of technology also covers automatic braking systems that prevent collisions and traffic jams, as well as adaptive cruise control, which can automatically adjust your speed based on distance from the leading vehicle.\nLevel two is referred to as partially automated driving. This includes things like lane control systems and automatic acceleration and braking, and these systems can even take control of steering in certain situations, such as if you’re about to hit a pedestrian. It’s important to keep in mind, though, that level two automation for BMW vehicles still requires a human in the driver’s seat, and you’ll still need to pay full attention to the road.\nGM has been speaking out about its commitment to the future in recent years, including its intention to support an all-electric future. This includes their plans for autonomous vehicles, all of which will be electric. They’re dedicated to pushing safety technology more than ever before in order to eliminate car crashes by eliminating the human error that’s responsible for well over 90 percent of them.\nWhile they’re not ready to present a commercial product as yet, their test vehicles are taking to the freeways and dense urban environments under the guidance of human drivers known as Autonomous Vehicle Trainers, who remain in the driver’s seat. The previous test runs from other manufacturers of new cars with lane-keeping assist systems, supercruise, and autonomous capabilities have been run out of Silicon Valley in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, so it will be interesting to see how these tests improve vehicles under human intervention.\nIt’s impossible to complete a technology list without returning to the top of the alphabet with Apple. It’s no secret that Project Titan is another name for Apple’s electric car project, and it’s now suspected that Project Titan has evolved into an autonomous car project. There’s only a little bit of certain information for now, but the project has received a permit for autonomous car testing, and it seems that hundreds of employees are working on a self-driving car project aimed at Apple consumers. While deep integrations with iOS are expected, there’s no way to confirm as of now. The tech company is known for taking new technology further than anyone else, and it’s expected that their car will be a high-end model.\nNaturally, these aren’t the only manufacturers and brands working on autonomous cars and other advanced driving technology. Carmakers like Honda, Toyota, Audi, Cadillac, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Kia, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and the rest are all looking to take advantage of new technology and impress consumers with newer, better products. Lyft is even partnering with the world’s leading self-driving car brands to provide a completely automated ride-hailing service.\nSafety has to be the biggest concern with these technologies, both to prevent collisions and jams and to ensure pedestrians and cyclists will remain unharmed. The U.S. Department of Transportation is committed to ensuring that autonomous vehicles can become a safe and reliable part of our daily lives and works with its collaborators to ensure this reality. Cybersecurity will also need to be a top concern before the widespread adoption of truly autonomous cars as support continues to rise."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4783c021-822c-45be-b1a0-310e63a65125>","<urn:uuid:43ad3238-e2cb-4145-ae99-22eb74af468a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the long-term solutions being proposed to address food security challenges in Syria and the Middle East region that have been highlighted by the Ukraine conflict?","answer":"The proposed long-term solutions include: 1) Drastically increasing local food production instead of relying on imports, 2) Shifting the region's political economy to focus more on food production and other productive sectors, 3) Developing agricultural infrastructure, which has been neglected since the 2000s, 4) Implementing immediate response mechanisms while building long-term infrastructure, 5) Coupling agricultural support with livelihood programs to reduce import dependence, and 6) Building technical capacity through development programs rather than just providing humanitarian aid. These changes are especially crucial given the approaching climate crisis and issues of drought and water scarcity that will affect the region in the mid-term.","context":["- This event has passed.\nSummary Report | Self-recovery? Towards a strategic response to the humanitarian and economic impacts of the Ukrainian conflict on Syria\n05/05/2022 @ 4:00 pm - 6:00 pm\nAs part of the Brussels VI Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region, IMPACT Research hosted a panel discussion on the links between the wars in Ukraine and Syria, the impacts of recent developments on Syria, and possible roads to recovery.\nListen to the panel discussion\nModerator: Abdulla Ibrahim, Senior Researcher, adjunct fellow at CSIS and non-resident fellow at The Stimson Center\nKeynote: Dr. Basel Termanin, Chairman of Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS)\nEric Mohns, Program Manager, Qualification Initiative for Syrian Civil Society Rural Rehabilitation Initiative in Syria GIZ\nJoseph Daher, Researcher, University of Lausanne, European University Institute, IMPACT\nMohamed Shikh Ayoub, Director of Middle East Consulting Solutions (MECS)\nHoward Shatz, Senior economist, RAND Corporation\nHand in hand: What the Ukraine war means for Syria\n“Syria will not be forgotten because of Ukraine”, says security expert Abdulla Ibrahim. Rather, Ukraine will remind us of the importance of Syria. As the effects of the Ukraine conflict sweep across the globe, the implications for Syria will be severe. Based on a discussion among experts at a side event to the Brussels VI Conference on Supporting the Future of Syria and the Region, this report will outline the interlinks between the Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts, the expected humanitarian and economic reverberations of the war, and provide recommendations to mitigate the worst of the effects on the Syrian people.\nUkraine and Syria: Intersections and divergences in healthcare\nSince the beginning of the war in 2011, there have been more than 600 offenses on Syrian healthcare facilities. In 2018 alone, 143 people died during attacks on healthcare facilities with 259 more injured. In Ukraine, the targeting of healthcare facilities has already been documented just two months into the conflict. This is a major point of convergence between both conflicts, observes Basel Termanini, Chairman of the Syrian American Medical Society. For starters, the perpetrators of these attacks are often the same, with tactics reproduced under different guises in situations that recur across borders. Russia has a long history of targeting hospitals and other healthcare infrastructures in Syria and is now re-deploying these methods in Ukraine. If its strategic trajectory continues to mirror that of Syria, this could entail the use of chemical weapons on civilians.\nPrior to the war, Ukraine’s healthcare system was extremely outdated. While healthcare professionals are highly competent, much equipment is from the Soviet era. In particular, ICUs are “primitive,” with outdated ventilators and other shortfalls. In Syria, the health system benefited hugely from international support, developing facilities to surpass Ukraine’s. However, one potential obstacle to a similar intervention in Ukraine is that the Ukrainian health system has a clear central command, unlike in Syria, meaning it could be more difficult for donors to implement change.\nThat being said, the international community can contribute to progress in healthcare on a number of fronts. Firstly, improving the transport of supplies around the country would be of enormous benefit, as would updating equipment in hospitals, and providing online training for personnel. Health systems would be prudent to consider preparations for the use of chemical weapons.\nWhile lessons learned in Syria can be implemented in Ukraine, Syria is still in need of a high level of support to combat ongoing difficulties. The reconfiguration of international priorities has diverted attention (and critically, funds) from Syria and other conflicts to Ukraine. In terms of healthcare, promised funding for pediatric care in Idlib was recently retracted as a result of the Russian invasion. Funds were being aggressively cut before the crisis. Now, there are even fewer resources available to Syria to mitigate the ongoing threat.\nExports and food insecurity\nIn 2020, Russia and Ukraine combined amounted to a quarter of global wheat and barley exports, notes Howard Shatz from the RAND Corporation. Since 2016, Russia has been sending between 1 and 1.5 million tons of wheat to Syria, a third of the wheat that Syria needs per year. 3.5 out of the 4.5 million tons of the necessary wheat stock in Syria is for food use. As Joseph Daher notes, most of this has been going to the SDF-controlled areas in the northeast, where control of wheat production is a consistent point of tension among groups.\nThese complications are not unique to the northeast, nor Syria more generally. Daher points out that we are seeing the mass land reform policies of governments across the Middle East in the mid-twentieth century come to a head today. These reforms made agriculture fairer, more liberalized, and productive but also contributed to an overreliance on export systems. For example, Egypt imports 70% of its wheat with Lebanon also importing vast quantities of wheat from Russia and Ukraine. During the 2000s, agricultural infrastructure was neglected by many governments in the region, creating a cycle that rendered it more difficult for Middle Eastern economies to produce domestically over time. In Syria, exports usually account for approximately 1-1.5 billion dollars, with imports amounting to 6 billion. Now, with Russia’s prohibition of exports, Syrians are going to feel the effects of these administrative oversights.\nThe precise implications on the population will be difficult to assess, observes Mohamad Sheikh Ayoub from MICS. Food insecurity and other non-combat mortalities are not being documented in Syria, unlike in other conflicts. In Yemen, for example, deaths due to starvation are being quantified. However, given that 90% of the Syrian population are currently living below the poverty line, the 50-60% price rise in fresh produce in the weeks following the invasion can be expected to have far-reaching, fatal consequences.\nFor Syria and its neighboring countries, the coming wheat crisis as a result of the Ukraine war should serve as a wake-up call to drastically ramp up local production. The political economy of the region must shift to focus on food production and other productive sectors of the economy. This is even more crucial given the looming climate crisis, which will have far deeper, wide-reaching ramifications for the region’s food security in the years to come. Mohns notes that drought and severe water scarcity are not issues restricted to the distant future, but are coming in the mid-term and will exacerbate displacement. Immediate response mechanisms are needed to combat the looming food crisis, but long-term development of infrastructure is necessary to sustain this overhaul over time. These changes will require time-intensive investments. Up until this point, programs have largely been humanitarian, with the neglect of development programs preventing technical capacity building. This is exacerbated by the pervading perception in the international community of local populations as aid recipients, rather than active participants in their economy. Agricultural support should be coupled with livelihoods, argues Mohns. This could reduce dependence on imports.\nDonors and funding gaps\nExperts disagreed on the potential funding fallout due to the Ukrainian conflict. With most mentioning the coming cuts for Syrian funds, Erik Mohns from the GIZ stated that there is no evidence yet that resources will be redirected from Syria to Ukraine. However, he also pointed out that there is no evidence that funding will increase.\nThe international community has pledged €6.4 billion to Syria in 2022, more than last year, but it remains to be seen what the final contributions will amount to. In 2021, for example, the required funding was estimated at 10 billion USD, with just 3.6 billion granted. This figure includes overhead costs of large organizations and cannot be assumed to reach people on the ground. Whether or not the funding pool will remain static, it is certain that prices will soar due to the Ukrainian conflict. This will mean that purchasing power will decrease regardless of whether direct funds are cut. Humanitarian organizations will have to contend with both increased programming costs due to global market fluctuations as well as less funding for Syrian causes. However, as Mohns notes, no amount of external support will be sufficient to satisfy the needs of the Syrian people.\nRather than continuing to alleviate poverty through emergency aid, developing local capacities is recommended. This is even more prudent given the difficulties in delivering the necessary funds and supplies to the population with the barrage of sanctions on the Assad regime. Now, the U.S. is considering a general license for North Syria (excluding Afrin and Idlib). This could be an area in which to begin building infrastructure and investing in sustainable food security systems. However, as Shatz warns, the AANES will find it very difficult to attract private investors to the region regardless of whether or not sanctions are eased. In such a fragile environment, the potential for profit is not secure enough to tempt stable investors to set up in the northeast. To raise the necessary funds, he recommends stabilizing the taxation system and working towards the granting of an import/export license, potentially from Iraq. Moreover, the lifting of U.S. sanctions on the north of Syria cannot even be depended on. Indeed, the U.S.-administration is rethinking how its sanctions are hurting people without achieving political aims but it also wants to deprioritize Syria on the national agenda. In this unstable environment, the AANES could well be left to combat the effects of the invasion without further international funds. Matters are even more challenging in the northwest. With no state viewing the HTS as anything other than a terrorist group, the capacity for trade is virtually non-existent.\nImmediate measures the international community can take\nWhile the Ukraine war poses monumental challenges for Syria, the Syrian population has shown extreme resilience across the eleven years of war, Mohns notes. For this to continue, measures must be taken by the international community. Firstly, a renewed commitment to the Syrian crisis is necessary. Europe and the U.S. should not deprioritize Syria as other conflicts emerge and a re-engagement from Gulf states is also recommended. The international community needs to overcome its fear of committing to longer term strategies on Syria. The U.S. in particular should take this on board and decide on a position on sanctions so the humanitarian sector can plan its activities sustainably.\nNeedless to say, food assistance should be increased to prevent further fatalities. As well as this, the opening of cross-border operations would simplify humanitarian work, and enable necessary coordination. Joint efforts could also be fruitful at the state level, potentially increasing synergies. Engagement with the private sector should also be prioritized.\nAt a later event, human rights expert Fadel Abdul Ghany noted that the lack of accountability Russia encountered in Syria paved the way for its invasion of Ukraine. Now, it is clear that the international community must refrain from deploying a zero-sum logic to these crises. Funds for Ukraine should not detract from those for Syria. Support should be framed as part of a larger strategy that serves the interests of Syrians, Ukrainians, and democratic values at large."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:118bce42-765a-48e0-9f20-4db45849ea05>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does an aquaponics system clean itself?","answer":"In an aquaponics system, there is a natural self-cleaning balance between fish and plants. The waste products made by the fish are used by the plants for nutrients and growth. In return, the plants continuously clean the fish tank, ensuring the fish have a clean environment to live in.","context":["For the nature lovers out there, owning an aquaponics fish tank is the ultimate way to combine two of your more favorite hobbies: growing and caring for plant life while simultaneously caring for animal life as well. Aquaponic fish tanks are an amazing example of how nature can seamlessly balance it’s self out and help each other thrive.\nBefore buying pet fish supplies and setting up an aquaponics fish tank it’s important that you understand what they are and the kind of upkeep that they require in order to be successful.\nWhat is an Aquaponics Fish Tank?\nPut simply, an aquaponics fish tank is an especially made tank that is built to house your pet fish while simultaneously growing plant life. Scientifically speaking, an aquaponics aquarium is a combination of aquaculture (growing and caring for fish) and hydroponics (growing plants without the use of soil and other growing mediums. Just water.) You can use a variety of fish to grow different plants or even vegetables in your aquaponics system.\nTheir sizes vary from small enough to keep in your home on a shelf, to large crops of plants and vegetables being grown using the byproducts from fish.\nHow Does an Aquaponics Fish Tank Work?\nIn an aquaponics tank, the plants depend on the fish just as much as the fish depend on the plants. This is nature balancing itself right within your home. The waste products made by the fish are used by the plant for nutrients and growth. In turn, the plants continuously clean the fish tank so that the fish have a clean home to live in.\nThe plants in your aquaponics system will still require a light source such as the sun. If you decide that you want to keep your system indoors all you would need to do is purchase a heat lamp that is made specifically for indoor plants.\nBenefits of Using Aquaponics to Grow Your Own Food\nThere are a surprising number of benefits that come with using an aquaponics system to grow your own vegetables for you and your family. Aside from how nice a little fish tank with tomatoes growing on top might look there are also a handful of health, economic, and ecologic benefits to using aquaponics.\n- Aquaponics gardening uses up to 90% less water than regular garden methods.\n- Science tells us that aquaponic gardens are nearly 4-6x more prolific than your average soil-based garden.\n- With aquaponic gardening, you don’t need to worry about daily garden hassles such as weeding, watering, and keeping the soil full of nutrients.\n- Aquaponic gardening is completely organic, saving you and your family from ingesting harmful pesticides and other chemicals used in traditional gardening.\nWhat Kind of Fish Can I Use and What Plants Can I Grow?\nDepending on your intentions for the fish being used in your aquaponics garden, the fish you choose can range from large edible fish like Tilapia or Catfish, to aesthetically pleasing fish like goldfish or Koi fish.\nAs for plants and vegetables, you might be surprised by the variety that can be grown using an aquaponics system. Some of the more popular plants and vegetables include leafy lettuce plants, broccoli, carrots, and beets just to name a few.\nAn aquaponics garden can be created for home hobby purposes as well as commercial use. The only real difference between the two is the size of the system that you create in addition to certain limitations on what crops can be grown and what fish work best in a commercial setting.\nMost often in a commercial setting aquaponic gardeners have had the best results when they use larger fish like Tilapia and Bluegill. Plants that can be grown are somewhat limited but still can be lucrative. Some of these plants include microgreens, swiss chard, and hemp.\nCreating an aquaponics garden in your home is a fun and environmentally friendly way to take care of fish while also growing your own organic garden at home. The setup process if by far the most strenuous. After you have a good system running, it takes care of itself more or less. The fish will provide the essential nutrients your plants need while your plants help keep your fishes home nice and clean.

No natural fresh water source.|\nThe watermaker was purchased by a fisherman’s trade union in Pan de Azucar, a very small fishing village on Chile’s Atacama Desert Coast. The village consists of 22 homes and 3 seafood restaurants and is located in the Pan de Azucar national park, which is home to unique marine flora and fauna. There are no public utilities that reach this village, therefore it solely relies on its own electricity production through photovoltaic generation. Lack of potable water has long been an issue and the town has struggled to survive on water trucked in from the city of Chanaral.\nThe original requirements were to supply potable water to the seafood restaurants and allow fishing activities to thrive. The project was financed by INDESPA (Instituo de Desarrollo Sustentable de la Pesca Artesanal), a Government Institute for the development of sustainable fishing and small-scale aquaculture. INDESPA worked with the fisherman’s trade union to purchase the watermaker and define the fundamental purposes of the project. The goals are to support Pan de Azucar’s economy and diversify its fishing industry, as well as aid in future community development. The watermaker will improve the health of the fishermen’s families and strengthen their livelihood by providing water for their seafood restaurants and overall village hygiene.\nFor over 35 years, Sea Line and Nauticentro have had a strong presence in the area and have been leaders in providing products and services to the small fishing communities in Chile. Developed within the framework of a government project, INDESPA, Sea Line, and Nauticentro worked together to carry out the installation of the renewable energy-powered watermaker.\nConstruction began in December of 2019. The entire installation is contained in a 16ft-long fiberglass shed built by Sea Line. One side houses the batteries, inverter, charge controllers, and spare parts while the other side is dedicated solely to the Spectra LB 2800F unit and related components such as the large prefilter, boost pump, and chlorinator tank. A 3-HP electric pump was installed at the pier to capture seawater and move it uphill into two 15000 liter seawater tanks. Two additional 15000 liter tanks were also installed for storing the potable water produced by the LB-2800F. Sea Line provided remote monitoring of the watermaker and on-site training for the fishermen's trade union, who were very satisfied with the installation and the high-quality water produced by the LB-2800F.\nAbout the Watermaker\nThe LB 2800F is a reverse osmosis watermaker that utilizes the Pearson Pump energy-recovery device. These durable systems are highly energy-efficient, making them a perfect match for solar power. A fixed recovery ratio means membranes last many years and are not considered consumables. Due to the system's simplicity, a highly trained operator is not required.

{"question":"Did William Allen White and Kevin Sloan both have early connections to newspaper work?","answer":"No. While William Allen White entered the newspaper field through learning the printing trade in his teens and later worked as an editorial writer for the Kansas City Star, Kevin Sloan had no early connection to newspaper work. Though Sloan later became a writer for the Dallas Morning News, his early interests were in drawing, painting, furniture making, athletics, and music.","context":["Today we’d like to introduce you to Kevin W. Sloan.\nSo, before we jump into specific questions about the business, why don’t you give us some details about you and your story.\nIt is an interesting and important time to be a city planner, landscape architect and a professor of architecture.\nNever before in human history have cities existed at the scale of geographical regions. Their unprecedented form and colossal size are producing an unprecedented set of consequences to the environment, civilization and to the future of the planet.\nMy professional work and teaching is dedicated to developing new solutions, planning prototypes and landscape methods to make places that can humanize and transform a suburban mega city like the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, into a positive environment that is delightful, resilient and enduring.\nA master in architecture degree from Syracuse University, including a fellowship in Florence Italy, fostered an awareness that architecture is much more than the design of individual’s buildings, but rather, the embodiment of principles for how to make new buildings, public spaces and parks that add to the cumulative life of a city.\nThe DFW Metroplex is a textbook demonstration of the issues and challenges of the suburban mega city. Upon completing my graduate work and two years of teaching architecture at Syracuse University, I deliberately selected DFW as a city that demonstrated the problems and, in addition, a culture open to change and new ideas. The discovery of seeing landscape as living fabric to heal and mend a diffuse suburban pattern like DFW has produced a set of built and award-winning projects that have revealed new possibilities.\nThe Dallas Urban Reserve knitted a modernist housing enclave into a community with a continuous bio-filtering street and the wild nature center-like landscape produced a new kind of common ground. The 112-acre mixed-use urban plan for Vitruvian Park in Addison, transformed the spring waters of an otherwise featureless ravine into a 17-acre public park that gathers high-density buildings to the nature it offers. The Airfield Falls Conservation Park in Fort Worth, Texas highlights the conservation of both water and history, the park design emphasizing ecological practices while also calling attention to the history of the site when it was part of Carswell Air Force Base.\nAfter 15 years of use, the billion-dollar Sprint World Headquarters Campus in Kansas City has never had to buy one gallon of water to irrigate the seven garden quadrangles that organize twenty-one mixed-use office buildings. The perimeter of the site is planted with native Konza prairie grasses and forbs, long before this was being commonly discussed as a method to conserve water, and to clean storm water and improve air quality.\nWhere Florence and the great lessons of the Renaissance taught me that skillfully designed buildings form the cohesive fabric of a city, designing Urban Reserve and Sprint taught me that in America, landscape and nature can be seen in the same way. The cultural affinity for landscape values living along belts of trees, lakeshores, rivers, even golf courses. Nature can be the attraction to restructure cities in the 21st century and what is beginning to unfold in Dallas can be a useful metaphor for the world.\nThe Branch Waters Network™ is a concept to use the nature of the entire watershed network in DFW as an attraction and trademark to form and gather walkable mixed-use patterns that are sustainable. In spite of the recent examples of my work, this is not a “new” idea.\nAs the only realized part of the 1911 Dallas City Plan by George Kessler is the Turtle Creek corridor in Dallas, a one-hundred-year long demonstration that nature could form a high-rise cosmopolitan urbanism that included a rich and green brocade of lakes, waterfalls, recreational parks and public institutions, which now includes a Frank Lloyd Wright designed theater. Ingots of cultural and economic value flow from Turtle Creek.\nAt this point less than 3 % of the watershed system has been engage or enhanced in any way. Undergirded by a vast network of sheet springs, there is somewhere between 600 to 1000 miles of rivers, creeks, greenbelts, bayous and ravines that traverse the DFW metropolis.\nRe-wilding is a new approach to landscape space that grew out of the thought project for the Branch Waters Network. It is an approach that marshals millions of acres of underutilized open space and the watershed network of the Branch Waters to form a return to nature project, reconstituting the original landscape of the Blackland Prairie and its attendant wetlands, as close to the original as it is practical.\nRe-wilding acknowledges that historic cities like Rome, London, Paris and New York have always contained vermin that parasitically thrived from human activity. However, the contemporary American megacity is filled with wildlife and living ecologies. Bobcats, wild turkey, coyotes, foxes, waterfowl, migratory birds and raptors, are seen with such documented frequency that enthusiasts have formed clubs and websites to follow and appreciate them. As evidence, a recent film made by the Texas Parks and Wildlife coined the term “Bobcat City” to describe our home.\nLetting nature take its course, especially along the vast watershed network, is safe, economical and, with time, can marshal the vast resource offered by the watershed, providing the opportunity for nature, civilization and nature to co-exist. As demonstrated by Vitruvian Park, a mixed-use development and city park that my firm designed in 2012, individuals can walk out of one side of their block into woods and prairie, and out the other side into a delightful and shaded network of streets and squares.\nWhile there might not seem to be any logical connection between architecture and cultivating an entire watershed network to gather urban density, they are linked for me though my family.\nI never knew my father’s father, but when I heard that he used to draft plans for his family’s “dream house” onto cardboard that he taped to the dining room table, I wanted to become an architect. My mother’s father was a farmer with a soul-deep connection to his piece of earth in southeastern Kansas that he passed onto his descendants. He once said seeing either a bobcat or a hummingbird constituted a bona fide religious experience.\nSomehow I think they would have appreciated knowing their grandson became a professor of architecture, a landscape architect, a writer for the Dallas Morning News and an explicator on city-planning, sustainability and a new area of urban landscape thinking, called The Branch Waters Network and “Re-wilding” that is sweeping the globe.\nWe’re always bombarded by how great it is to pursue your passion, etc – but we’ve spoken with enough people to know that it’s not always easy. Overall, would you say things have been easy for you?\nEverything seemed like a “push” in the beginning. Create good ideas and beneficial solutions, then “push” them onto audiences and clients with arguments and attempts at persuasion.\nThe realization that nature could be catalyst to attract denser urban formations along the Branch Waters Network, turned the “push” into a “pull” the potential to draw people to the nature of the Branch Waters and create density was already demonstrated by century-old examples such as Turtle Creek in Dallas, and White Rock Lake in the East Dallas, Lakewood area.\nHeady theories and academic arguments about the benefits of city-living, suddenly gave way to simple and more intuitive messages such as “Go with the flow” for the Branch Waters Network. “Return to Nature” or “Let nature takes its course,” for Re-wilding.\nThere is something about nature that seems to make a largely suburban culture accept living in more knitted and walkable urban formations.\nWe’d love to hear more about your business.\nKevin Sloan Studio is a multi-disciplinary design practice in landscape architecture, city planning, building design, branding, environmental graphics and urban wayfinding systems.\nAs the author of a book about Water Conservation thirty years ago, we are also known for our extensive track record for making beautiful and indestructible places that do not need nor threaten the water supply.\nWhile these are the professional disciplines our studio represents, the one thing we are known for is place-making. Place-making is objective. It is also the palliative to offset decades of cookie cut development that have left people bereft for meaningful places to live and enjoy.\nWe use design to transform what are otherwise, featureless areas and landscapes into magnets for people and economic activity. The places and social generators we make magnify cultural production and economic prosperity.\nThey also deliver for communities and cities, new trademarks and identities that go out into the world via referrals, the internet, Instagram and as the backdrop for countless selfies taken in places we’ve designed.\nTo reinforce the mission of our studio, we office in the storefront space of the historic Kessler Theater in North Oak Cliff. The Kessler Theater is culturally renowned for the live music acts it brings to Dallas and the urban energy it generates. It is also one of the only buildings in America named after a world famous landscape architect and city planner – George Kessler – that is also, coincidentally, two blocks from where my wife and business partner Diane and I live.\nWe “walk our talk” as an example to communities by living and officing in accord with the place-making ideas we advance.\nWhat were you like growing up?\nMy interests were restless, broad, but related, even from the beginning.\nDrawing, painting, making furniture and models went hand-in-hand with an early proclivity for music vis-a-vis the piano. It seemed like each activity provided a different way of looking at problems and creative activity, providing ways of re-seeing the others with new potential.\nPiano recitals and intense competitions gave way to athletics when, during my early teen age years, a talent for track and field emerged that lead to a 1975 national championship in my event and specialty, the long jump.\nEven today, many of my long jump records remain at the state high school and university level in the State of Kansas and at Kansas State University where I attended on a full athletic scholarship. The 1980 ban on the Olympics precipitated by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, coincided with my final year of athletic eligibility.\nEven though I had qualified for the Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, I opted to retire and turn my energies to my long term interest in architecture.\nWhile the family moved to Kansas City, the farm remains, offering valuable lessons in natural processes that shaped my youth. These lessons laid the groundwork for re-seeing the potential of sprawling mega cities like Dallas/Fort Worth as One Continuous Landscape.\nToday my most cherished possession is a 1914 Steinway O, that was completely restored. Some nine to ten thousand pages of my sketchbooks are filled with drawings, measurements and analysis of the great buildings and places of the world.\n- Address: Kevin Sloan Studio\n1218 North Davis Avenue\nDallas, Texas 75208\n- Website: www.kevinsloanstudio.com\n- Phone: 214.269.7650\n- Email: firstname.lastname@example.org\n- Facebook: Kevin Sloan Studio\n- Twitter: @kevinwsloan\n- Other: VIMEO: Spaces and Places by Kevin Sloan Studio\nVitruvian Park (Red Bridge) Photo, “Craig Blackmon FAIA”\nVirtruvian Park Amphitheater – Photo courtesy UDR, Inc\nAlpha Water Table – Photo courtesy UDR, Inc\nAll other photos – courtesy Kevin Sloan Studio, by Timothy Hursley…except the downtown Winspear Opera photo.\nThis photo – courtesy Kevin Sloan Studio","Two newspaper editors among 25 notable Kansans\nWilliam Allen White Arthur M. Capper\nWilliam Allen White, the \"Sage of Emporia,\" and Topeka publisher/politician/disability advocate Arthur Capper are among the 25 notable Kansans named in observance of the state's sesquicentennial celebration.\nBoth are members of the Kansas Newspaper Hall of Fame.\nThe selections were the work of a task force that scoured history books for an elite group of people who left an imprint on Kansas.\nWhite, who bought the Emporia Gazette newspaper in 1895, ultimately received two Pulitzer Prizes.\nWhen he died in January, 1944, he was eulogized as “one of the truly great Americans” of his age. Aside from his literary achievements, he had also become an influential figure in state and national Republican politics and confidant to several American presidents.\nWhite was born in Emporia on Feb. 10, 1868. He entered the newspaper field through the back shop, learning the printing trade in his teens. After attending the University of Kansas and working on the Kansas City Star as an editorial writer, he returned to Emporia and bought the Gazette with a borrowed $3,000.\nIn 1896, his editorial “What’s the Matter with Kansas?” threw him into national prominence. A lampoon of the Populist movement which arose in Kansas, it was used widely in the Republican national campaign of that year.\nWhite was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for his editorial “To An Anxious Friend,\" which defended the right of free speech after White was arrested for defiance of a provision in Gov. Henry Allen’s industrial court law.\nHis autobiography, published posthumously in 1946, also won the Pulitzer Prize.\nOn one occasion, President Franklin Roosevelt sent White a telegraph at the Gazette informing him that he had followed his advice and appointed Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme Court. President Herbert Hoover once visited the Whites' house in Emporia for dinner.\nLife magazine said of White: “He is the small-town boy who made good at home. To the small-town man who envies the glamour of the city, he is living assurance that small-town life may be preferable. To the city man who looks back with nostalgia on a small-town youth, he is a living symbol of small-town simplicity and kindliness and common sense.”\nCapper was born July 14, 1865, at Garnett. He was a two-term governor and served in the U.S. Senate for 30 years.\nThrough high school, he was a “printer’s devil” on the local newspaper. Following graduation, he obtained a job as typesetter on the Topeka Daily Capital.\nDuring the next nine years, he worked for the Capital as a printer, reporter, and city editor, and spent one year as a reporter for the New York Tribune and as a Washington correspondent for the Capital.\nIn 1901, Capper bought controlling interest in the Daily Capital, and in 1904 he purchased all outstanding shares in the publication.\nAt the time of his retirement from the Senate in 1949, he was owner and publisher of newspapers in Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\nExtremely fond of children, he founded the well-known Capper Foundation for Crippled Children.\nCapper died at age 86 on Dec. 19, 1951.\nThe list of 25 Notable Kansans includes:\n1.

{"question":"Could you explain the significance and components of the Haft Seen table in Persian New Year celebrations? What are the seven essential 'S' items and their meanings?","answer":"The Haft Seen is a deeply symbolic table arrangement featuring seven items beginning with 'S' that represent renewal and Spring. The seven essential items are: 1) Sabzeh (greens/sprouts) symbolizing rebirth, considered the most important element, 2) Seeb (apple) representing beauty and health, 3) Serkeh (vinegar) symbolizing age and patience, 4) Sekeh (coins) representing wealth and prosperity, 5) Sonbol (hyacinth flower) symbolizing the coming of Spring, 6) Shirin (sweets) symbolizing spreading sweetness for the year ahead, and 7) Sir (garlic) representing good health. The table is arranged symmetrically to symbolize harmony.","context":["My intention with this post is to share an aspect of my Persian culture in order to inspire you to seek out further knowledge either by asking me directly or using good old Google. I'm tremendously proud of my Persian heritage, please don't hesitate to reach out and ask questions!\nNowruz (The Persian New Year) is a celebration that survived the Muslim conquest in 650 CE of the area known today as Iran.\nIt is celebrated at the vernal (Spring) equinox (the exact moment the sun crosses the celestial equator equalizing night and day). In our year 2018 (Year 1397 in Iran) the Spring equinox occurred at 11:15am CST. This is also known as the first day of Spring.\nHowever, Persian New Year celebrations begin before the first day of Spring. Spring cleaning, purchasing new clothes, placing the Haft Seen, and Chaharshanbe soori (The Persian Festival of Fire) are some examples.\nCartoons of Chaharshanbe soori seem to be slim on the pickings. I need to go into illustration. Here is a picture of kids around a fire until my big illustrative break.\nChaharshanbe soori (Persian Festival of Fire) is celebrated on the evening of the last Wednesday before Nowruz. It involves celebrators jumping over a bonfire (symbol of purification) while singing: \"Sorkhi-ye to az man, Zardi-ye man az to\" meaning \"Your fiery red color to me, and my sickly yellow paleness to you.\" This is an ancient purification ritual symbolizing the jumper giving their sickness, paleness and problems to the fire and the fire in return giving you its energy, warmth and vigor.\nSophreh Haft Seen (Table of Seven S's)\nOne of my favorite elements of Nowruz is the setting of the Haft Seen (pictured above). A Haft Seen is a deeply symbolic table placement. Seven items symbolic of renewal and Spring are placed on a decorative tablecloth. Seven represents a lucky number. Also on the Haft Seen table are non-S items that have representations and meaning behind them.\nSome examples of the Seven S's are:\n1. Sabzeh (greens/sprouts): symbolic for rebirth. This is often placed at the center of the Haft Seen and seen as the most important element.\n2. Seeb (apple): symbolizing beauty and health\n3. Serkeh (vinegar): symbolizing age and patience\n4. Sekeh (coins, preferably gold): symbolizing wealth and prosperity\n5. Sonbol (hyacinth flower): symbolizing the coming of Spring\n6. Shirin (sweets): symbolizing spreading the sweetness for the year to come\n7. Sir (Garlic): symbolizing good health\nNon-S items on the table have cultural or historical significance. These items \"complete\" the Haft Seen table and can be seen placed around the Seven S's.\nExamples of these are:\n1. Sham (Candles): Technically an S, but I always see this in addition to the Seven S's. One for each child representing enlightenment and happiness.\n2. Ayyeneh (Mirror): For self reflection and introspection\n3. Tokhmeh Morgh (Decorated Eggs): One for each family member to represent fertility\n4. Mahi (A bowl with a goldfish): Representing life and the sign Pisces which the sun is leaving.\n5. A crystal bowl of water with an orange in it: Representing the earth floating in space\n6. Rose water: Placed on the table to represent its magical cleansing powers\n7. A Holy Book or Book of Poetry: We are non-denominational Christian so this book would be the Bible in our family.\nYou'll also notice a Haft Seen is symmetrical. Symmetry is incredibly important as it symbolizes harmony. I find the Haft Seen to be my favorite element of Nowruz for its elegance, intricate designs and deep symbolic nature. I believe this to be the heart of Nowruz with the making of the Sophreh Haft Seen surrounded in a beautiful poetry.\nNext year on the first day of Spring, what will your Haft Seen look like?\nEide Shoma Mobarak!

{"question":"¿Qué buscan principalmente las personas no religiosas cuando consideran visitar una iglesia en términos de experiencia espiritual?","answer":"According to research, non-religious people primarily seek inner peace when considering spiritual beliefs and experiences, with 37% identifying this as their main spiritual goal. They also look for hope (35%), and healing and forgiveness (30%). Additionally, 53% of unchurched adults view churches as 'sacred spaces' rather than just buildings, and they associate transcendent places with a sense of peace and calm. However, only 14% of unchurched adults regularly visit places they consider transcendent.","context":["Churches want to be places that are open for people outside the congregation to visit. But are they perceived as such by those who aren’t Christian or who don’t currently have a church home? Understanding the external perceptions and expectations of church buildings can be key to outreach and mission.\nIn Making Space for Church Visitors, a Barna briefing produced in partnership with Aspen Group, we look at seven insights that shine light on the significance of the design and function of today’s churches, and how this impacts a church community’s ability to welcome visitors.\nIn this excerpt, we’ll highlight two of the seven insights featured in the briefing. Be sure to subscribe to Barna Access Plus so you can be one of the first to read the full release.\nVisitors to Your Church Might Feel More Comfortable in Honest, Safe Spaces\nTo make space for potential church visitors is to make space for trust, transparency and safety. Barna’s Spiritually Open project repeatedly highlights how the general population today, including those outside the Church, are eager for honest faith. In fact, nearly one in three unchurched teens and adults (31%) tells Barna they would be “very comfortable” attending a Christian church where the pastor or priest openly discusses their doubts about Christianity as a manifestation of authenticity. In Making Space research, we also see that U.S. adults, including the churched and unchurched, seem to gravitate to what feels “authentic” versus “professional,” by wide margins.\nAt the same time, the unchurched may initially be hesitant to personally embrace authentic, vulnerable conversations within a church. When it comes to topics concerning daily life—such as loneliness, depression, anxiety, relationships and career—unchurched respondents in the Making Space survey rarely choose a Christian church as a comfortable environment for meaningful conversation. Respondents in this group also say they rarely visit a church if they are feeling lonely, depressed, introspective or even social.\nChurch buildings don’t appear to be inviting to outsiders for holistic, whole-life conversations and growth, except as it concerns specific and explicitly spiritual aims. Unchurched adults desire authentic dialogue, but they don’t see church as a place where this can happen. Why? How “safe” an unchurched person feels may play a role.\nThinking about Christian churches, close to half of unchurched adults (45%) strongly agree churches should be a safe place for hurting people. Additionally, when asked the purpose of a church building, second on the list among unchurched adults is providing safety and security (36%).\nChurch Visitors May Be Looking for Inner Peace\nBeyond the physical aspects of the church, just over half of unchurched adults (53%) tell Barna they believe that church is “a sacred space” rather than “just a building” (30%). This group also points to nature (69%), memorial sites (50%), churches (48%) and cathedrals (46%) as being transcendent or “a place that brings a person closer to experiencing connection with something beyond the physical world.” U.S. adults, across all demographics, associate this transcendence with “a sense of peace or calm.”\nAlthough they are aware of transcendent places, most U.S. adults fail to visit these types of spaces. For unchurched adults, this is even more true (just 14% of unchurched adults regularly visit places they would consider transcendent). For the unchurched, what could be missing because they tend to occupy less-than-transcendent environments? Perhaps it may contribute to a deficit of the very feeling they report makes a place transcendent: peace.\nWhen people experience a lack of calm in daily living, its presence can signify something otherworldly. Here the Church is uniquely positioned to offer something the world cannot. As C.S. Lewis put it, “God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing.”1\nThis peace is something potential church visitors—especially those who are spiritually open—may be seeking. Research from Spiritually Open hints at this: When Barna asked U.S. teens and adults to share what, specifically, they are looking for in their spiritual beliefs, the plurality chooses inner peace (37%), followed by hope (35%), healing and forgiveness (30% each).\nChurches have a special opportunity to draw in visitors with spaces that provide a feeling of peace, purpose, safety and more. How might your church do this? Consider emphasizing church design and use that evokes characteristics of the places, feelings and experiences we’ve described.\nAbout the Research\nResearch for Making Space consists of data and analysis based on an online quantitative survey of 2,000 U.S. adults, conducted from February 28–March 9, 2022. The margin of error for the sample is +/- 2.0 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. For this survey, researchers used an online panel for data collection and observed a quota random sampling methodology. Quotas were set to obtain a minimum readable sample by a variety of demographic factors, and samples were weighted by region, ethnicity, education, age and gender to reflect their natural presence in the United States population (using U.S. Census Bureau data for comparison).\nThe Spiritually Open project is based on a survey of 2,005 U.S. adults and teenagers (ages 13-17) conducted online from December 13–22, 2022 via a consumer research panel. The margin of error for the sample is +/- 2.0 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. Quotas were set to representation by region, race / ethnicity, education, age and gender based on the U.S. Census Bureau. Minimal statistical weighting has been applied to maximize sample representation.\nAdditionally, a survey among 511 U.S. Protestant senior pastors was conducted online from December 13, 2021–January 3, 2023. Participants are all members of Barna Group’s Proprietary Pastor Panel. Minimal weighting has been used to ensure the sample is representative based on denomination, region and church size.\n1. C.S.

{"question":"What are some key conservation challenges facing sharks today, and what practical actions can individuals take to protect them?","answer":"Sharks face several major conservation challenges, including unsustainable fishing practices that kill up to 73 million sharks annually for shark fin soup, and significant bycatch in fisheries like shrimp trawling, tuna purse seine, and billfish longline. About 1/3 of open-ocean shark species are at risk of extinction in coming decades, with many species experiencing 90% population declines. Their slow reproduction rate makes them especially vulnerable - some species don't reproduce until age 10 and have few offspring. To help protect sharks, individuals can take several actions: reduce single-use plastic consumption, make sustainable seafood choices using tools like Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch, participate in coastal cleanups, report mistreatment of sharks to authorities, and support ocean acidification research since it threatens shark habitats like coral reefs. Additionally, people can help by educating others about sharks' ecological importance and supporting conservation organizations working to protect them.","context":["It’s that time again…the best week of the year has finally arrived! One of the most common questions we get from our community during Shark Week is “What can I do to help?” Well, friend, look no further. From decreasing your single-use plastic usage to supporting scientific research that promotes shark habitat conservation, you don’t have to be a scientist, policy wonk or ocean expert to help save sharks this year. Here are nine key ways you can help give back and protect our ocean’s sharks this Shark Week.\nTake action to help protect sharks from marine debris\nFrom the depths of the Mariana Trench to the most remote ice in the Arctic, plastic pollution has been found everywhere on Earth and threatens marine life on a daily basis. Now, Congress is taking on the marine debris issue, with the recent introduction of the Save Our Seas Act 2.0 . This bill is critical in the fight against marine debris, because it not only outlines new ways to support cooperative initiatives on the global stage, but also commits resources to scientific research and suggests new efforts across the country to improve our waste management infrastructure. By taking action today, you can help our nation take a step forward to make sure our ocean is protected against the ever-growing threat of plastic pollution.\nKeep an eye out for sharks\nAnd no, we don’t just mean keep an eye out in case you see one. What we mean is to keep an eye out for them like you might for a friend, always keeping their wellbeing at top of mind (because these days, they truly need it). Many people have a negative opinion of sharks because of the way these animals have been portrayed in popular culture. As a result, it’s all the more important that we do everything we can to protect sharks when we see them in trouble. If you see sharks being treated poorly at the beach or on a boat, report it to local authorities. If you see a stranded shark, remember, don’t touch it: the best thing you can do to ensure its survival is to call in the experts who are skilled in marine wildlife stranding response. And, if you hear people spreading stories about how scary and dangerous sharks are, remind them that we are much more of a threat to sharks than these animals have ever been to us!\nTake the pledge to decrease your single-use plastic usage\nSpeaking of plastics, there are things you can do to help in the fight against marine debris in your daily life, too! The choices that we make each and every day are ones that can help stem the tide of plastic pollution, and by taking baby steps to decrease our use of single-use plastic products, our mindful choices can translate into game-changers for sharks and other marine wildlife. From opting from reusable straws to carrying a reusable water bottle, there are so many simple, easy ways to make more sustainable adjustments to your daily life. Take the pledge today and commit to making small changes that make a big difference for sharks around the world.\nVolunteer at the International Coastal Cleanup\nWorking toward a cleaner ocean means not only decreasing our use of single-use plastics, but also cleaning up the marine debris that’s already polluting our ocean and shorelines. That’s why on the third weekend of every September, Ocean Conservancy hosts the world’s largest volunteer effort on behalf of ocean health: the International Coastal Cleanup (ICC). Now mobilizing hundreds of thousands of volunteers in more than 100 countries each year, the ICC is a single-day event where tens of millions of pieces of marine debris are removed from coastlines in a unified effort to keep marine and coastal ecosystems clean and protected. Are you ready? Find a location near you and get ready to join the cleanup in less than two months!\nMake smart choices when it comes to seafood\nThe fish in our ocean are not only critical to vibrant marine ecosystems—they also are important players when it comes to supporting coastal economies and communities around the world! Given how important fish are to so many people worldwide, it’s imperative that we make smart decisions when it comes to our consumption of seafood. For example, some fishing practices can result in high levels of bycatch, where sharks become trapped in fishing gear. To make sure that the seafood you purchase in markets and restaurants comes from sustainable sources, give your restaurant patronage to restaurants that are committed to sustainability, and make use of tools like Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch, where you can learn all about how to make smart seafood choices, no matter where you are. Plus, stay up-to-date about the latest information on sustainable fisheries by following along on our website’s fisheries program page!\nAsk Congress to support ocean acidification research\nDid you know that ocean acidification is a growing threat for sharks? Species like the blacktip reef shark live amidst our ocean’s beautiful coral reefs, but across the globe, these reefs are being damaged (big time). As the ocean absorbs more carbon, it becomes more acidified, degrading and harming not only the physical structures of the reefs, but also the food supplies for sharks that thrive within these ecosystems. By taking action and supporting federal funding for ocean acidification research, you can urge our nation’s leaders to work to protect the ecosystems that sharks like blacktips depend on.\nLearn all you can about sharks\nWhen it comes to both sharks and all other wildlife that call our ocean home, the first and foremost thing you can do to protect them is to learn all about them. When you know the facts, you know not only how spectacular these creatures are, but also what the biggest threats to their survival are…and how to protect them from those threats. Visit our Wildlife Fact Sheets and recent wildlife blogs, including this one, to read up on your shark facts.\nShare your love for sharks on social\nThey say that when people love something, they want to protect it…and when you love something and want to protect it, you want other people to do the same thing, too! Share the latest shark-related content from our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages, and always feel free to share most recent blog articles to your own social channels to keep your friends and family up-to-date. Plus, encourage them to make sure they’re following us on social media, too, for the absolute best in shark and wildlife content all year ‘round (and a few jaw-some shark puns mixed in, of course).\nDonate to conservation initiatives that help sharks\nHere at Ocean Conservancy, we’re constantly engaging in conservation initiatives that help protect vulnerable species like our ocean’s sharks. From committing to developing programs that keep our ocean trash-free to protecting endangered species and beyond, our work to save wildlife like sharks never stops. Most of the threats facing sharks today are man-made, but if we all work together to turn the tide for sharks’ future, the solutions can be, too. Donating to support sharks this Shark Week gives you a direct impact on the growth and development of our conservation programs. Donate today, or start your own fundraiser on Facebook by clicking the “Create Fundraiser” button at the top of our Facebook page to get your friends and family involved, too!\nAt the end of the day, it’s the little things we do, repeated day in and day out, that have the potential to make the greatest impact when it comes to saving sharks. Together, we can change the future for our ocean’s sharks and make sure their home is safe and thriving for years to come.\nSign up for emails from Ocean Conservancy\nHelp Us Protect Sharks\nSign up for emails from Ocean Conservancy","Sharks consistently rank near the top of lists of American’s greatest fears. In reality, they have much more to fear from us than we do from them. Because of our actions, many species of sharks are on the verge of extinction. A recent International Union for the Conservation of Nature Shark Specialist Group report shows that fully 1/3 of open-ocean species of sharks are in danger of extinction in the next few decades. Many shark species have had population declines of over 90% in the last few decades.\nThe life history strategy of sharks is very different from that of other commercially exploited fishes, and this makes them more vulnerable to overexploitation. Several species of sharks don’t reproduce until they are older than ten years old, and some only have a few young every other year (or in some cases, every three years). It’s easy to see how this inability to rapidly replace themselves could become an existential problem when modern industrial fishing techniques are involved.\nWhile few sharks are targeted for their flesh, which is considered unpalatable except for a few species, most species are targeted for their fins. The fins, which have absolutely no meat, flavor, or nutritional value whatsoever, are made into an Asian delicacy called shark fin soup. They provide only texture to the spiced chicken broth. While it is impossible to know exactly how many sharks are killed in this global, largely unregulated fishery, the best scientific estimates we have say that the number is as high as 73 million each year.\nBeing targeted isn’t the only thing problem facing sharks-bycatch is another major threat to many shark species. Millions of sharks each year are killed by fishing gear simply because they are swimming near what fishermen are trying to catch- the ultimate example of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Though few fisheries are blameless from a bycatch perspective, particular culprits include the shrimp trawling fishery, the tuna purse seine fishery, and the billfish longline fishery.\nSince sharks serve as apex predators in most marine ecosystems, their declines pose major troubles both to the environment and to the countless humans who depend on that environment for food and to make a living.\nThe problem is a major one, and we need to solve it.\nIt’s easy to become discouraged when considering the enormity of the problem, but we must not give up. We must focus on the goal, and work towards it!\nTo paraphrase an old joke about my fellow Jews, if you ask three conservationists what their goal is, you’ll likely get four answers. This post is about my goal, which isn’t necessarily the goal of the entire ‘save the sharks’ movement. I expect that many of my conservationist friends will disagree with parts of it, and I look forward to a lively discussion.\nSharks are being harvested (or killed accidentally as bycatch) at wildly unsustainable rates. This needs to stop, and sharks need some strong legal protections to ensure this.\nThe form that these legal protections will take is the subject of much debate. A (very) few countries like Palau make fishing for sharks in any form illegal in their territorial waters. Hawaii now bans the selling, purchasing, or possession of shark fins within state boundaries. U.S. fisheries management policy presently makes it illegal to kill some species of shark and sets size limits on some other species. However, most countries have no legal protection at all for sharks, and the number of species with worldwide protection (at least on paper, since these are difficult to enforce in the middle of the ocean) can be counted on one hand.\nThough this may shock some of my readers, I do not think that global shark conservation policy needs to be as extreme as Palau’s “you can’t kill any sharks ever” law. I do not object to the sustainable harvest of sharks for food. Sustainably harvesting animals that have so few young so late in life is extremely difficult, and most times that it has been tried, the fishery has collapsed within a few decades. That doesn’t mean that it is impossible and it doesn’t mean that we should ban all shark fishing. However, for me to be satisfied, the world of commercial fishing is going to need to undergo some drastic changes.\nThe goal for finning\nWhile I can accept sustainable fishing for some shark meat, I object to the shark fin soup fishery. In most parts of the world, this fishery is brutal, wasteful, and unsustainable. Sharks of any species and size have their fins cut off, and the rest of the animal is dumped overboard to bleed to death or drown- all to provide texture to a delicacy for the rich. The few countries that have shark finning regulations at all have different strategies to manage it.\nSome, like Canada, require that fishermen land the rest of the shark in addition to the fins (not attached to each other), and they enforce this by weighing total fins and total shark carcasses. This is silly, because different shark species can have a drastically different fin-to-body weight ratio. Other countries require that fishermen land sharks with the fins still attached, which is better and is starting to become the standard.\nI would feel differently about shark finning if it provided a staple food item for the world’s poor instead of a delicacy for the rich. I would feel differently about shark finning if the shark’s meat was used, instead of just cartilage for texture. I would feel differently if fishermen targeted only certain species of a certain size instead of every shark they find. As it stands, though, my goal for the shark finning fishery is its complete abolition.\nUpdated 7/8/12 To clarify, this personal opinion applies to fins that are provided to the market via the wasteful practice of finning. Fins that are provided to the marketplace via well-regulated comprehensive shark fisheries are a separate issue.\nThe goal for bycatch\nThe threat sharks face from bycatch is harder to regulate. In some cases, simple gear modifications can minimize the amount of sharks caught without greatly influencing the catch of target species. In other cases, simply placing gear in slightly different locations or depths can greatly reduce the number of sharks caught accidentally. Some of these changes have been made already, most have not been. Conservationists who fight for long-term large-scale goals should sometimes fight for easy fixes that will still make a lot of difference. My goal is for every single known and feasible bycatch reduction strategy to be implemented. This won’t eliminate bycatch, but it will reduce it significantly.\nSome fishing gear is so destructive (to sharks and many other ocean animals) that simple fixes just won’t help. In these cases, my goal is for that gear to be banned entirely. This is not unprecedented- the U.N. banned large drift nets almost 20 years ago because of the huge amount of bycatch they caused.\nThe goal for marine protected areas\nWhile I don’t think that we need a global ban on shark fishing modeled after Palau’s policy, some small-scale areas where shark fishing is banned would be very helpful. Research performed on a marine protected area in Belize has shown that many species of shark remain in a small area for much of their lives, showing that a small region where shark fishing is illegal can have an effect. However, some species, like the Great White shark, can swim thousands of miles in a year and wouldn’t stay in a small protected area very long. Although they won’t help all shark species, marine protected areas will protect many. My goal is a large worldwide network of marine protected areas that protect sharks and other marine animals.\nMy goal for fishermen\nThe global commercial fisheries industry is at a crossroads. There are too many fisherman chasing too few fish, and overfishing is rampant. However, contrary to the claims and insinuations of some conservationists, fishermen are not evil people trying to destroy the environment. They are hardworking people who are just trying to provide for their families, and they are correct when the point out that most policies that will protect marine life will harm them financially. However, if nothing is done, there will be no fish to catch and fishermen will be harmed financially anyway. My goal is for there to be fewer commercial fishing vessels and a much lower global catch, and I am open to suggestions on how to help the fishermen that this policy would negatively impact.\nMy goal is for an end to unsustainable shark fishing, a ban on the shark fin soup fishery, the implementation of bycatch reduction policies, a global network of marine protected areas, and some form of incentive or regulation to encourage fishermen to catch fewer fish overall. Some parts of this goal would be more effective for protecting sharks than others. Some are more achievable than others. I believe that all are worth fighting for.\nHow to get there\nIt’s easy to dream big and come up with impossible goals. It’s much harder to draw a realistic map showing how to get from where we are to where we want to be.\nMost of you reading this already don’t eat shark fin soup, and many of you don’t eat foods with high shark bycatch. That’s great, but while I have a pretty high opinion of myself, even I don’t believe that I reach enough people through my writing to make a difference in a major global issue. Not directly, at least.\nThe key to achieving the goals of the shark conservation movement (and the conservation movement in general) is education. Maybe I’m too much of an optimist, but I fervently believe that sharks aren’t in trouble because no one cares what is happening to them. I believe that sharks are in trouble because no one knows that sharks are important to a healthy ecosystem, and no one knows that sharks are in trouble.\nThe absolute best thing you can do is to learn about sharks and tell others. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your classmates or tell your co-workers. Tell them that sharks matter, and tell them that sharks are in trouble. Tell them not to eat shark fin soup, and not to eat seafood with high shark bycatch. Tell them to support shark conservation legislation by calling their elected officials.\nWhat you should NOT do is support violent groups that claim to “fight for the sharks” through “direct action”. These groups are not only ineffective, but they are counterproductive to the cause of conservation. The conservation movement is a PR war, and we will win through facts and persuasive argument- NOT through trying to hurt people who disagree with us.\nAnother common (and flawed) solution is to not eat seafood at all because of environmental concerns. If all of the people who care about the oceans stop eating seafood, it’s impossible for conservation-minded folks to “vote with their wallets” and support more environmentally friendly methods of catching fish. I instead recommend eating Marine Stewardship Council certified sustainable seafood.\nGraduate students such as myself lack the resources to donate significant amounts of money to conservation NGO’s, but if any readers are looking for my opinion on what NGO’s to trust, I have a few. Oceana doesn’t focus exclusively on sharks, but I love almost all of what they do. WildAid also has a broad focus, but their anti-finning campaigns are wonderful (they recruited Yao Ming, who is a huge celebrity in China, to be their spokesman). The Save Our Seas Foundation does a lot of inspiring work with educating children about the importance of sharks and other sea life. The Shark Research Institute is a small but great organization that focuses on both conservation and science. Sonja Fordham’s Shark Advocates International is a new organization, but Sonja is legendary within the shark conservation community and I know she’ll accomplish amazing things with SAI.\nIf you are looking for a source for shark-themed gifts that help sharks, I have a few suggestions. Iemanya Oceanica’s “Adopt a Shark” program makes a good gift, and promotes shark research. The American Elasmobranch Society student store raises money for young shark scientists to do important research. My own Southern Fried Science store sells “Sharks Matter/No finning gear”, which raises money for the charities I’ve listed above.\nMany people claim that it’s too late to save the planet. I couldn’t disagree more.\nThe problem is a big one. The goals are difficult, but they are achievable in some form. Now that you know what to do, get to it.\nTo paraphrase a famous Donella Meadows quote, we have exactly enough time to save sharks and save our oceans… starting now.\nBaum, J. (2003).

{"question":"As a marketing manager looking to optimize our email campaigns, I'd like to understand the relationship between email engagement metrics and web analytics data. How do click reach rates correlate with bounce rates, and what do these metrics tell us about campaign effectiveness?","answer":"Click reach measures campaign success over multiple emails by tracking the percentage of new customers clicking for the first time, beyond just click-through rates. This helps determine if you're expanding your reach to new potential clients versus engaging the same people repeatedly. When examining how this relates to website performance, bounce rates indicate how many visitors leave without viewing a second page. While high bounce rates might seem negative, they need to be interpreted in context - if your website is designed for visitors to find what they need on the entry page, a high bounce rate isn't necessarily bad. However, for sites with multi-step conversion processes, bounce rates can indicate conversion success. Together, these metrics help evaluate whether your email campaigns are not only reaching new audiences but also effectively engaging them once they reach your site.","context":["Determining the success of a marketing campaign always comes down to a collection of metrics. While some are overwhelmingly popular, others often go unnoticed, despite their clear value. If you’re struggling to pinpoint what makes your campaigns so successful or lackluster, you may be examining stale numbers that have nothing new to offer. Instead, try tracking these easily overlooked metrics for some insights that will lead you to a fresh new approach.\nMost marketing metrics focus on the success of a single email. While this is a great benchmark for communications that stand alone, these emails are usually part of an ongoing marketing campaign. To accurately understand how the campaign is operating as a whole, you need to look past the click-through rate and click-to-open rate. The click reach of a campaign measures its success over several emails. Depending on the frequency of your messages, this may mean gathering daily, weekly, or monthly metrics.\nTo accurately determine click reach, you look not only at your click-through rate, but at the percentage of people who are clicking for the first time. The more new customers you’re engaging, the higher your click reach is. While it’s great to keep your loyal customers interested, your reach won’t expand unless you’re netting new potential clients with each message in your campaign.\nA campaign that’s designed to engage the same people over and over will operate differently from one that’s reaching out to land new customers. Understanding your click reach will help you determine which type of campaign you have and adjust accordingly.\nNew Link Generation\nEvery well-rounded marketing strategy aspires to increase inbound links to a company’s web page. Authentic links pointing to your web page generally tell search engines that many people have deemed your site worthy of interest. While you should, and probably do, keep track of the total number of inbound links, it’s also important to closely examine the new links you’re generating each month.\nUse this information to look at both the quantity and quality of inbound links. Go beyond the number of links you have and take a closer look at where they’re coming from and what they’re related to. This will help you pinpoint major trends that you want to follow-up on. If a particular campaign spurred a new surge in links, follow through to figure out what it was that made this campaign so successful so you can generate the same type of buzz again.\nEngaged Time on Your Site\nIf you’re gauging your campaign success by the number of site visitors you have, you’re missing a more relevant metric: customer engagement. A customer that drops by your site for a few seconds and immediately clicks away has little to no value. Your link was interesting enough to draw them in briefly, but they immediately dismissed your content, moved on, and forgot all about you.\nThe longer a reader stays, the more likely he is to return to your site. It’s important to create content that engages your audience and gets them to stay on the site. Many developers and marketers rely on the three-click rule [http://www.uie.com/articles/three_click_rule/] stating that customers won’t stick with a site for more than three clicks if they can’t find what they’re looking for. Strive to get it right on the first time and provide them with valuable content as soon as they arrive.\nSocial Media Momentum\nSocial media momentum refers to the life span of a piece of content via social media sites. Feeds update so frequently that nearly everything has a shelf life in the world of social media. Content that generates a lot of attention and potentially goes viral, however, will gather much more momentum. You want to track this metric because a piece with more momentum is ultimately more valuable than one that’s extremely popular for only a short time.\nIf your content has gained real momentum, this indicates that it’s probably been shared many times, and even after several days, weeks, or months, those who see it for the first time still feel that it’s worth checking out and passing onto friends. Naturally, news topics will generate less momentum than evergreen content, but this metric is important to look at for everything you produce.\nLongevity is similar to momentum. When a piece of content generates momentum, however, interest goes up over time. When you’re examining longevity, you’ll see the content’s interest go down until it levels off to a trickle. Content longevity applies most heavily to social media posts. After a few days, a Facebook post will stop generating new views and interactions because it’s been buried by your newer posts along with everything else in the viewer’s feed.\nLongevity is something you can examine in any context, however. Readers may not open your emails immediately or act on the links as soon as they view them. If your campaign has a great deal of longevity, you’ve managed to create an email that hung around in the viewer’s inbox and piqued her interest enough for her to go back to it and follow-up on a message she saw earlier.\nEmail Address Value\nEmail address value is an important metric for any email campaign.

It takes constant monitoring and measurement of visitor data to optimize web usage. This is where Web Analytics comes in. Not only is web analytics useful for measuring website traffic but it is also an effective tool for both business and market research.\nBy tracking user behavior, we can begin to see how they are interacting with our website and how we can begin to communicate more effectively to our audiences. In this article we’ll take a closer look at how Web Analytics can be utilized and what effect this has on the design process.\nWhat is Web Analytics?\nEvery time a visitor reaches your site, the web server records this transaction. This data is then processed by Web Analytics software to produce detailed reports and charts. This software is most commonly available in web-based applications such as the popular Google Analytics, which allows you to see what’s going on with your website through cold hard data.\nWeb Measurement is the process by which Web Analytics is utilized. While hits were popular in the early days of the internet, analytics have become much more sophisticated over the years. Basic metrics – such as visits, bounce rate, referrers, and conversions can be measured after determining the outcome you want your website to accomplish.\n2. Bounce Rates and Exit Rates\nBounce Rates and Exit Rates are two metrics to analyze in determining whether or not you’ve grabbed the attention of your users successfully. Exit rates will tell you how many people left the website through a particular page, while bounce rates tell you how many people left the website without visiting a second page.\nThe potential drawback to measuring user behavior using bounce rate is when your website is intended to find what they are looking for on the entry page, as opposed to sites with well-defined conversion steps requiring multiple page views. In the latter case, bounce rate is a good metric to use in indicating conversion success.\nWhere the visitor came from is a good metric in understanding why some visitors convert. A referrer is a website that sends you traffic. In addition to search engines, referrers send you traffic as well. Seek out those in your industry or network to build positive, meaningful relationships – whether it be through social network activity, blog conversations, or even writing articles in your niche. More conversions may end up coming from human referrals than search engines, as these individuals are likely in your industry and can see the need for your product or service moreso than the rest.\n4. Call to Action Clicks\nYour design should appeal and inspire your target audience to take action. Does the design make them feel like they are getting value from your services and, more importantly, are they clicking on the call to action buttons? Crazy Egg provides heat map reports to easily understand what users do on your site and where they are clicking. Heat Map reports let you see what’s hot and what’s not so you can make changes that increase conversion. Alternately, you can use A/B testing to help test different designs and determine which is the most effective.\nIf you’ve gotten this far, you know you’ve satisfied most of your visitors and gotten their attention. The crucial step now is to get them to convert. A conversion is a term used by marketers to describe the final outcome of a site visit. Don’t thwart your visitors from completed the intended action. This means optimizing your web forms for your users and making the form submission or checkout process as user-friendly as possible.\nThe metric for measuring conversions is Funnels and/or Paths taken. Kiss Metrics allows you to track funnels and paths to conversions. If you’re on a tight budget, Google Analytics’ goal and funnel-tracking can also be used\nMany useful tools are available to help you monitor user behavior. Here are a few of the most popular:\nGoogle Analytics is an enterprise class web analytics tool. It’ll give you insight into your website’s traffic and marketing effectiveness through user session metrics, including bounce rate and keyword frequency, amongst others.\nKISS Insights is a tool that allows designers to place a small survey bar across the bottom of their websites. Curious visitors can take a peek and are then presented with a simple survey in which they can evaluate the experience design of your website.\nCrazy Egg tells you where people are clicking on your site and which areas on a site page could use improvement. Crazy Eggs creates reports that allow you to visualize where people are clicking on site pages. This information is valuable for increasing conversions, for example, people purchasing your products and services or subscribing to your newsletter.\nWith Web 2.0 and Analytics, a culture of improvement has been laid before us. We can gauge more accurately how visitors are interacting with your content. With these tools, the ability to improve the experience your online customers have is at your fingertips. In some cases, you no longer have to guess or wonder why your site is getting the results it is.

{"question":"Does state ownership exist in calculation in kind and socialism?","answer":"Yes, both are associated with state control. Calculation in kind was proposed as a basis for socialist economies to replace monetary calculation, particularly advocated by Otto Neurath for economic planning. Similarly, socialism is defined by public/state ownership of the means of production, with the state controlling the economy and means of production, as implemented in the Soviet Union under Lenin and other countries.","context":["Calculation in kind\nCalculation in kind or calculation in nature is a way of valuating resources and a system of accounting that uses disaggregated physical magnitudes as opposed to a common unit of calculation. As the basis for a socialist economy it was proposed to replace money and financial calculation. Calculation in kind would value each commodity based only on its use value, for purposes of economic accounting. By contrast, in money-based economies, a commodity's value includes an exchange value.\nCalculation in kind would quantify the utility of an object directly without recourse to a general unit of calculation. This differs from other proposed methods of socialist calculation, such as simultaneous equations, Taylor-Lange accounting prices, and the use of labor time as a measure of cost.\nCalculation in kind was strongly advocated by the positivist philosopher and political economist Otto Neurath when employed by the Bavarian Soviet Republic. This led to a discussion in the early 1920s, in which much of the discussion about socialism centered on whether economic planning should be based on physical quantities or monetary accounting. Neurath was the most forceful advocate of physical planning (economic planning using calculation-in-kind) in contrast to market socialist neoclassical economists who advocated use of notional prices computed by solving simultaneous equations. Austrian school critics of socialism, particularly Ludwig von Mises, based his critique of socialism on the calculation problem.\nProponents of in-kind calculation argue that the use of a common medium like money distorts information about the utility of an object. Socialists in favor of calculation in kind argued that, in a system of in-kind calculation, waste associated with the monetary system would be eliminated, and in particular objects would no longer be desired for functionally useless purposes like resale and speculation - they would only be desired for their use-value.\n- Economic planning\n- Economic calculation problem\n- Input-output planning\n- Material balances\n- Natural capital accounting\n- Post-scarcity economy\n- Production for use\n- Socialist calculation debate\n- Socialist economics\n- Socialist mode of production\n- Technological rationality\n- Time-based currency\n- Value (economics)\n- Steele, David (1992).

It is usually not taken to include cases where a general unit of calculation is arrived at without reference to money or markets. Thus it is not applied to Taylor-Lange accounting prices, nor to notional ‘prices’ ascribed to all commodities in an attempt to replace the market by solving a large number of simultaneous equations, nor to the use of labor time as a measure of cost.\n- Feinstein, C.H.

A commodity is, as we saw, a good which by virtue of being produced for sale has acquired in addition to its physical use value a socially-determined exchange value. Correspondingly, the process of production under capitalism is both a process of production of exchange values and a process of production of use values, involving two different kinds of calculation. For the former, the unit of calculation is money, but for the latter there is no single unit but a whole series of different units for measuring the quantity and quality of specific goods used in the process of producing other specific goods (tonnes of steel, kilowatt-hours of electricity, person-hours of work and so on). The disappearance of economic or value calculation in socialism would by no means involve the disappearance of all rational calculation, since the calculations in kind connected with producing specific quantities of goods as physical use values would continue.\"\n- Cockshott, Paul. \"Calculation in-Natura, from Neurath to Kantorovich\" University of Glasgow, 15 May 2008.\n- O'Neil, John (2002). \"Socialist Calculation and Environmental Valuation: Money, Markets and Ecology\".

The invention of the steam engine, mass production, and the industrial revolution in Britain meant a large-scale displacement of people from rural settings to cities where industries were established, making them work as wage earners. Capitalists that owned industries and mines attracted men and women from villages to cities where they were asked to work for long hours at low wages.\nThese events had a drastic effect on growing inequalities with rich becoming richer and poor becoming poorer. The Great Depression in the thirties prompted many countries to look for alternatives to capitalism. Thinkers like Karl Marx proposed state ownership of means of production (resources) and equal share of all. This appealed to many countries, especially the Eastern Bloc countries that adopted socialism, which appeared to them as being superior to capitalism.\nWhat is Socialism?\nSocialism is a political and economic system that exists with a controlled market and public ownership of the means of production. The proponents of socialism suggested that the problems of unemployment and financial crises would not arise as economy would be planned with means of production, and distribution remaining concentrated in the hands of the state. This would safeguard the interests of the individual, as he would be shielded from the unpredictable forces of the market-dominated economy.\nSocialists dreamt of a classless society as against the extremely rich and poor divide in capitalism, which was inevitable with individual property and ownership of means of production remaining in the hands of private people. Socialists argued that with wealth being equally distributed, there would be no poor, and all will be equal.\nIt was in 1917 that Soviet Union adopted socialism as state instrument of controlling the economy under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin. The initial success of the policies of the communist government attracted many other countries with China, Cuba, and many others following suit.\nWhat is Capitalism?\nCapitalism is a political and economic system that exists with a free market and private ownership of the means of production. Capitalism that is based upon the belief that competition brings out the best in people evolved in 15th century, and ruled supreme in the world till the 20th century, with the industrial revolution taking place in countries with capitalism in place. Capitalism encourages individual enterprise with the incentive of earning more and rising up the social ladder working to motivate people. Private ownership of property means, wealth remains concentrated in the hands of capitalists, and they gobble up most of the margins with a very small share going to those who work in factories and mines, to produce goods and services.\nWhat is the difference between Capitalism and Socialism?\nThe world has seen the rise and fall of socialism and the loopholes in capitalism. No one system is perfect and can be installed discarding the other. While there is no doubt that capitalism has survived the onslaught of all other ideologies like communism, socialism, etc., it is a fact that the great bubble of communism has burst with the breakup of Soviet Union and failing of other communist economies. The time has come to evolve and put into practice a system that takes up salient points of both ideologies, not only to encourage private enterprise but also to implement government control in resources to work for the good of the poor and the oppressed in the society.\n• Definitions of Capitalism and Socialism:\n• Capitalism is a political and economic system that exists with a free market and private ownership of the means of production.\n• Socialism is a political and economic system that exists with a controlled market and public ownership of the means of production.\n• Ownership of Means of Production:\n• In capitalism, means of production were owned by individuals.\n• In socialism, means of production were owned by the state.\n• Social Classes:\n• A society that followed capitalism had classes in it.\n• A society that followed socialism dreamt of a classless society.\n• In capitalism, those who owned the means of production had more of a share of the earnings while the workers got only a little share.\n• In socialism, everyone was given equal earnings as the state owned the means of productions.\n• Capitalism had a free market system.\n• Socialism had a government controlled market system.\n• Government Interference:\n• In capitalism, government interference is minimal.\n• In socialism, government decides everything."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:edcbabf7-566c-401c-9e2b-4fc625722d89>","<urn:uuid:cf87bb54-c20b-4138-ab90-c3c336d5e64a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As both a practicing attorney and medical professional, I'm curious about the differences between filing lawsuits against medical providers versus general contract disputes. Could you explain how the burden of proof and legal standards compare between medical malpractice cases and contractual breach cases?","answer":"Medical malpractice cases specifically require proving that a healthcare provider deviated from the appropriate standard of care in their specific practice area. It's not enough to simply show a bad result or suboptimal recovery. In contrast, contract disputes can be initiated with just a plausible legal theory, even if relatively weak. Any attorney with minimal skill can create some theory to sue for breach of contract. While medical cases require expert testimony from healthcare professionals to establish fault, contract cases focus more on the terms of the agreement and alleged breaches. Both types of cases can be expensive, but medical malpractice cases often involve more complex litigation costs due to the need for expert witnesses.","context":["What Attorneys Won’t Tell You\nBy Brian Taylor Goldstein\nI recently attended an arts conference where there was a panel discussion on music contracts. An attorney said that artists don’t really need to read or review contracts because you can always declare them null and void later and get a new contract. Is this true?\nThis is why 99% of most attorneys give the rest of us a bad name. No. It’s not true. That is, its bad advice. However, there are many attorneys out there who like to believe otherwise.\nYou may…or may not…be surprised to learn that any attorney with even the most minimal amount of skill can create some plausible “theory” on which to sue someone else. That’s all it takes to file a lawsuit in a US court: a plausible “theory.” Your theory might be the world’s dumbest theory, but everyone is entitled to his or her day in court. And, under what’s called the “American Rule”, unless there is a contract requiring the loser to pay for attorney’s fees and costs, everyone is responsible for their own attorney’s fees regardless of who wins or loses. So, unless you and I have a contract requiring the loser in a lawsuit to pay the winner’s attorney’s fees, I could technically file a lawsuit against you right now (assuming I knew who you were) and you would have to spend your own money to defend it. (If you don’t like the “American Rule”, blame George Washington. The “English Rule”, of course, is the exact opposite!)\nBecause of this situation, many attorneys believe that the answer to every conflict is to file a lawsuit and use that as leverage to get a better deal. The argument goes something like this: If an artist signs a contract and later wants to get out of it, just file a lawsuit claiming that the other side is in breach. Even if the artist has absolutely no legal basis for such a claim, the other side will need to hire their own attorney, file a motion, appear in court, and have the claim dismissed. As this will cost them thousands of dollars, the other side just might re-negotiate with rather than spend all that money. Here’s the catch: the artist will ALSO have to spend all that money hiring an attorney to file the lawsuit in the first place. And if you think that a large recording label, or a successful producer, or even a presenter with access to a free board attorney is simply going to roll over to avoid a lawsuit, think again. Why? Because their own attorneys will advise them to fight.\nThere’s another consideration, too: your reputation. One of my clients once received a letter from an attorney who represented an artist who was part of my client’s roster. Even though his contract was not up for another year, the artist wanted to be released early so he could negotiate a potentially lucrative deal directly with one of the producers we were already working with on his behalf. His lawyer raised several legally weak arguments and threatened a multi-million dollar lawsuit. After several efforts to resolve the matter ended in screaming phone calls and more threatened litigations, we decided to release the composer, even though, ultimately, I felt we would win in court. It simply wasn’t worth it. My client had other artists and business to focus on and could afford neither the money nor the time and distraction. While you may conclude that the artist got what he wanted and won, think again. There’s more: of course, we had to advise the producer that we no longer represented the artist and what had happened. As a result, the producer determined that the artist’s talents were not worth the risk of dealing with someone who sues their way out of a dispute and selected another artist for the project. It wasn’t long before word spread that this artist would sue anyone at anytime and other producers refused to work with him either. In the end, the artist’s lawyer wound up suing the artist for unpaid attorney’s fees. Not a happy ending.\nIf you haven’t figured out the game yet, an attorney will always advise you to file a lawsuit. However, regardless of the outcome, only the attorneys win. So, unless you have an endless supply of money, energy, time, and spirit do not play this game! Take the time to draft meaningful contracts, take the time to read them, and take the time to establish a relationship with the people you will be working with. You may not always get what you want in a negotiation, but at least you can make an informed decision by asking questions and evaluating the pros and cons of the deal before you. While there are many reasons you might agree to unfavorable terms, believing that you can sue your way out of a bad situation is not among them…unless you’re an attorney!\nFor additional information and resources on this and other legal and business issues for the performing arts, visit ggartslaw.com\nTo ask your own question, write to email@example.com.\nAll questions on any topic related to legal and business issues will be welcome.

HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO BRING A LAWSUIT FOR A PERSONAL INJURY?\nAs the term “personal injury” is used here we mean physical and emotional injury arising from a motor vehicle accident, a slip and fall, medical malpractice and from a dangerous product. Generally, the statute of limitations for a personal injury is two (2) years. The most notable exceptions to this arise where an infant or mental incompetent is involved. It may arise also in a situation where the victim does not reasonably discover that he has been harmed by another. Again, these are just general exceptions to the rule. The safest course of action is to consult with an attorney well within two (2) years of the date of injury so that you can receive proper advice, and give your attorney proper time to investigate and prepare the case prior to the expiration of two (2) years. PLEASE NOTE: Other types of incidents may have statutes of limitation which are longer, or shorter.\n2. DO I REALLY NEED AN ATTORNEY? WON’T THAT BE TOO EXPENSIVE, OR SLOW THINGS DOWN?\nMany of our clients have hired us after months of fruitless negotiations with an insurance company who had assured them that they would receive a fair settlement and that they should not retain a lawyer. It is true that many smaller claims, particularly those which involve only minor personal property loss, can be settled without the intervention of an attorney. Nevertheless, an individual who has experienced a personal injury where there are doctor bills, ongoing treatment, lost wages, significant pain and suffering, and the potential for future impairment and lost wages, should consult with an attorney who is experienced in litigation matters.\n3. HOW CAN I AFFORD A LAWYER TO REPRESENT ME?\nMost trial attorneys are willing to handle personal injury cases on a contingent fee basis. The hallmark of the contingent fee is that the attorney will not charge you for his time unless there is a recovery. If there is a recovery, then the attorney’s fee is based on a pre-agreed percentage of the gross amount recovered. Typically, HAMSTEAD, WILLIAMS & SHOOK PLLC charges a 33-1/3% – 40% contingent fee, depending on the complexity of the case. Many law firms are known to charge up to 50% contingent fees. The contingent fee to the attorney does not include costs of litigation which may be incurred. These may range from a few hundred dollars if the case can be settled out of court without suit being filed, to tens of thousands of dollars in complex actions such as medical malpractice and product liability. Incurred costs are payable separately, and not as part of the contingent fee.\n4. WILL MY CASE WIND UP IN COURT?\nMost legal claims are resolved by settlement, before suit is even filed. Of those cases where suit has to be filed, the overwhelming majority of those are eventually settled without having to go to trial before a Judge and jury. HAMSTEAD, WILLIAMS & SHOOK PLLC’s philosophy is to vigorously pursue settlement well in advance of trial so that the claims process is not made unduly difficult and burdensome for our clients. Our firm places great stock in mediation as a means to settle a case once suit has been filed, thereby possibly eliminating the need for appearing at trial. One of the ultimate considerations in resolving a case is fairness. If a client is satisfied with a fair settlement, then we consider that we have been successful and that our job is done. However, if the insurance company for the other side, for whatever reason, is unwilling to offer a fair sum in settlement, then we will explain the entire situation including risks and benefits so that the client, with the help of his/her attorney, can make an informed decision: a decision which is right for him or her.\n5. CAN I SUE MY DOCTOR BECAUSE I AM NOT PLEASED WITH MY TREATMENT?\nA doctor is not responsible simply because a patient experiences a bad result. The law recognizes that a doctor is not responsible simply because an untoward event occurred or an optimal recovery was not attained. West Virginia law specifically provides that a medical provider is only responsible for injuries which directly result from that medical provider’s deviation from the appropriate standard of care. Basically, this means that a doctor, hospital, nurse, dentist or other type of health provider is only responsible if they did something, or failed to do something, which would generally be perceived as wrong within their specific area of practice. HAMSTEAD, WILLIAMS & SHOOK PLLC has access to knowledgeable doctors, nurse, dentists, hospital administrators and other healthcare experts who can explain whether a medical provider was at fault or not.\n6. WHAT HAPPENS IF I GET HURT BY A HIT AND RUN DRIVER?\nAll insurance policies issued in West Virginia carry mandatory coverage for personal injury and property loss caused by an uninsured motorist. This includes a hit and run driver. In order to collect on a claim involving a hit and run driver it is necessary that the police or other appropriate authority investigate promptly and that your insurance carrier be notified within sixty (60) days. The minimum uninsured limits which accompany every policy are inadequate for serious injuries. Uninsured motorist coverage is relatively inexpensive and most people would be wise to contact their insurance agent to learn what amount of coverage is right for them.\n7. WHAT CAN A WORKER DO IF HE OR SHE IS WRONGLY TERMINATED?\nGenerally, the law in West Virginia is that employment is “at will”. This means that in the absence of a written contract, an employee’s work is at the will and pleasure of the employer and the employee can be fired for any reason which does not violate a substantial public policy goal or a specific statute. Examples of state statutes which provide safeguards and remedies to wrongfully terminated employees are the West Virginia Human Rights Act, West Virginia Worker’s Compensation Statute, and the Whistle-blower Act (for public employees). This list is by no means inclusive. Rights and remedies are often very case specific so that prompt consultation with an attorney can ensure that your rights are protected if you have been dealt with wrongfully at work.\n8. WHAT DOES THE LAW PROVIDE FOR INJURIES OCCURRING ON REAL ESTATE?\nVisitors to a business or commercial establishment are owed the duty to have the premises made reasonably safe for the visit. If that duty is breached, and an injury results, then the injured person may be able to recover damages from either the property owner or the business occupant. Tenants who are injured because of unsafe conditions or toxic substances on the premises such as lead paint can also pursue a claim for their injury.\n9. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DRUNK DRIVER WHO CAUSES INJURY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE?\nThis is precisely the type of situation where either uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage can be helpful. In addition, the law deals with the issue of drunk driving so strictly that, in addition to the impaired driver, liability might also attach to a business which sells alcohol to an underage or intoxicated person, and even passengers who have contributed to their driver being impaired.\n10. CAN I SUE MY EMPLOYER IF I GET HURT ON THE JOB?\nGenerally, employers who subscribe to Workers Compensation, and their employees, are immune from suit and the only remedy is through Workers Compensation. There is an important exception, however, and that occurs where the employer deliberately injures a worker. Deliberate intent can be established by proving that there was a dangerous condition at work that the employer knew about which violated a safety standard, regulation or practice, yet the worker was nevertheless deliberately exposed to the hazard and suffered injury. The employer is entitled to a credit for all sums that the worker will receive from Workers Compensation. Still, pursuing this type of claim will generally result in more fair compensation than what Workers Compensation alone can provide."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2b2b41cb-969e-4e1a-8612-500239edf383>","<urn:uuid:93ee4ef4-08f5-449f-afb6-09c1fc35fcdf>"],"error":null}

When introducing rhythm concepts, what's the main difference between teaching triplets in piano music versus teaching the basic three-count rhythm in waltz dancing? How do the counting methods compare?","answer":"Teaching triplets in piano music and the three-count rhythm in waltz dancing involve different approaches to similar timing concepts. In piano music, triplets are specifically marked in the sheet music and involve fitting three equal notes into the time normally taken by two notes, requiring precise finger coordination. In contrast, the waltz's three-count rhythm (3/4 time) is expressed through full body movement in a smooth, fluid dance pattern that moves counter-clockwise around the floor. While both involve counting in threes, the waltz rhythm is more consistently maintained throughout the piece and is physically expressed through box steps and turning patterns, whereas triplets in piano music may appear occasionally within a piece and require specific finger techniques to execute properly.","context":["Teaching Tools: Glossary\nTeaching Tools are provided in each Sheet Music product description to assist teachers, students, and parents in purchasing music.

The rumba is easy to learn as it is composed of a box step and a variety of break steps (rock steps).\nThe history of the rumba dance is elusive since it derives from a group of other dances that originated in different countries. The term “Rumba” (also Rhumba) is used to refer to a group of rhythmic dances of Spanish and African roots that originated in Cuba.

{"question":"Buenos días! As someone interested in spiritual traditions, I'd like to know what are the main differences between ancestor worship practices during New Year in Vietnam y en China?","answer":"Both countries practice ancestor worship during New Year celebrations, but with different emphases. In Vietnam, ancestor worship is deeply embedded in their cultural identity and spirituality - families maintain small altars in almost every house where they make offerings of food, wine, votive paper, candles, and incense to their ancestors, believing this will bring good fortune. During Tet (Vietnamese New Year), families also visit pagodas during the first three days to pray for health, fortune, and luck for themselves and their families, offering flowers, incense, and fruit. In China, ancestor worship during New Year is primarily expressed through the family feast and the Kitchen God tradition, where the god watches over the family and reports to the Jade Emperor about their behavior. Both cultures share the practice of giving 'lucky money' in red envelopes to children and paying respects to older relatives during the New Year period.","context":["BY MALU LAMBERT\nRECIPES BY MALU LAMBERT | PHOTOGRAPHY & STYLING C&D HEIERLI | FOOD ASSISTANT NELLEKE ELSTON\nIn Western culture, New Year means crates of champagne, silly hats and grown men dressed in diapers. Resolutions are made and hangovers endured.\nIn the East though, things are somewhat different.\nFood plays a significant role in celebrations, yes, but dishes are loaded with symbolism. Nothing is eaten just for sustenance. “Noodles symbolise longevity,” says Isabella Fang, owner of Red Tassel, in Sea Point, as she talks about Chinese beliefs. “If you cut a noodle in half, it’s said your life will also be cut in half.”\nCHINESE NEW YEAR began with a tale. “Nian is the word for year,” says Isabella. “And in Chinese mythology it’s a horned monster. Every New Year it terrorised the villages. The monster ate children and destroyed crops, until one day an old man waited for it armed with fireworks. The monster eventually returned to the sea, scared off by the flashes of light and noise. That’s why we celebrate the New Year with fireworks, drums and lanterns.”\nThis year, Chinese New Year is on 14 February and is celebrated for 15 days, the start date being determined by the cycle of the moon.\nSilk fans add a subtle, delicate, whimsical touch\n“On the first three days you’re not allowed to cook,” says Isabella. “So there’s a lot of preparation beforehand. My mom spends hours cooking the soup. She infuses it with ginseng and other Chinese medicines. Then we have a big feast on New Year’s Eve. In Chinese it’s called Chúx or Year-pass Eve. There’s always so much food. We eat pork, duck, beef, vegetables and fish. Fish is very important. The word for fish is yu, meaning abundance.\n“I loved New Year when I was younger. My parents would buy me new shoes and new clothes. Everything had to be new for the coming year.” The Chinese believe all creation is reborn at New Year. Houses are cleaned. Clutter is thrown away. The year must begin with a clean slate.\nLater, at Saigon restaurant in Cape Town, Chef My is describing VIETNAM’S NEW YEAR. “We call it Tet. It’s the same as the Chinese New Year,” he says. “Vietnam was a colony in the Ming Dynasty. So we’ve adopted Chinese traditions.\"\nThe Vietnamese are very picky about the people they invite into their houses on this auspicious day. It’s believed that a person who has been unlucky will bring bad luck into the home for the coming year. Sometimes, to avoid this, people leave their houses a few minutes before midnight and come back just as the clock strikes midnight.\n“For the New Year’s feast we roast a pig big enough to feed the family and the extended family,” says Chef My. “Also, on every table you will find the Five-Fruit Tray or Mam Ngu Qua. This symbolises gratitude for heaven and earth. It also symbolises family togetherness and the striving for prosperity.\n“The most symbolic food is the sticky rice cake,” says Chef My. “While the sticky rice represents the earth, the mung bean paste inside it represents the sun.” Called either banh chung or banh tet, these rice cakes are not the dry kind you’ll find in health shops. Instead, sticky rice is encased in banana leaves, and in the centre you’ll find mung bean sprouts or paste mixed in with bits of pork. The leaves impart a tea-like flavour to the rice and they also keep it fresh. This is important, as no cooking is traditionally allowed during the three-day celebration.\nServe sake either hot or cold. It's said that cheaper sake should always be served hot, to cover flaws\nIt’s custom during Tet to visit older relatives, pay off debts, return borrowed items and give away ‘lucky money’ in red envelopes to children. This is the same in China. The two cultures also have Tsao Chun, the Kitchen God, in common. All over South-East Asia families hang portraits of Tsao Chun above their stoves. The god apparently watches over the family. When the Lunar New Year rolls in, Tsao Chun is said to go to heaven and present a report to the Jade Emperor on the behaviour of each family member. This is where bribery comes in. Family members smear Tsao Chun’s mouth with honey so he will tell a sweeter version of events. After the honey smearing, the portrait is burnt and the rising smoke is said to represent his ascent to heaven. A new picture is then placed above the stove for the coming year.\nAcross the water from Vietnam is KOREA where they celebrate Seollal for their Lunar New Year. The focus is on family, ancestor worship and feasting. Traditionally a dduk-gook (broth with rice cakes) is eaten. It’s a bowl filled with symbolism. Cho Hee, a Korean expat living in Cape Town, explains, “The white rice cakes symbolise purity and their round shape represents money and prosperity.”\nAnother country with New Year customs is TIBET, where they celebrate Losar. People are given balls of dough with various ingredients hidden in them such as chillies, salt, wool, rice and coal. The ingredients are said to be a comment on a person’s character. If white ingredients are found, it’s a good sign. If chillies are found, it means the person is talkative. But if you find coal in the dough, it means you have a black heart.\nWatch Out for the Year of the Tiger\nTeeth like razor blades. A low purr rumbles from his throat. His black stripes undulate as he pads towards you. His gaze is fixed. It’s the Year of the Tiger and it’s coming right for you. According to Chinese astrology, 2010 promises to be fierce and will be a year filled with power, passion and daring. Chinese astrologists say that before the year begins, you should mend broken relationships and make peace with family members. This year will be one of extremes. Luckily, 2011 is the Year of the Rabbit, which astrologists say will be a time of peace.\nWhichever way you decide to indulge in lunar revelry, the message is the same—share in abundance with your family and friends. “There are a lot of festivities in China over the New Year,” says Isabella Fang, of the Red Tassel in Sea Point. “But none of that really matters. The most important part is spending time with your family.”\nMan with One Chopstick Go Hungry\nThe great Chinese philosopher, Confucius, was said to have had a hand in influencing widespread chopstick use. He believed a knife and fork indicated violence, and their use went against his peaceful teachings. But if you use chopsticks, bear in mind that over 100-billion disposable chopsticks are used and discarded every year. That adds up to a lot of trees. Confucius believed in good karma. Make sure yours is good, too. Next time you eat Asian fare take along your own re-useable chopsticks.","Vietnam is steeped in spirituality, superstitions, and old-age traditions. Throughout Vietnam’s rich and long history, a fascinating cultural heritage has been passed down through generations. The Vietnamese take their traditions seriously, which has contributed to their strong national identity – a blend of traditional and contemporary values. They strongly value family, respect for the community, respect for their ancestors, working hard, and living in harmony with nature. If you’re interested in some of the most unique traditions in Vietnam, this is for you!\n7 of the Most Unique Traditions in Vietnam\n1. Ancestor worship\nIn almost every house in Vietnam, You’ll find a small altar dedicated to the ancestors. That’s because Vietnamese ancestors are highly revered and respected. They’re also believed to continue living in another realm and the living is to provide them with they what they need. Offerings consist of food, wine, votive paper, candles, burning incense, and of course, prayer. In return, the ancestors bring good fortune to their loved ones.\n2. God of Wealth\nThần Tài, or the God of Wealth, is believed to bring good fortune to businesses. You’ll see the God of Wealth in many shops, restaurants, hotels, and other commercial businesses. Vietnam also celebrates God of Wealth Day, which is the tenth day of the lunar year. Buying gold to celebrate this day is said to bring good fortune and financial success.\n3. Visiting pagodas\nMany Vietnamese families will flock to pagodas to pray during the first three days of Lunar New Year celebrations. It’s become a valued custom for Vietnamese people. They visit pagodas to pray for the health, fortune, and luck of themselves, family, and loved ones. And in Vietnamese culture, delivering offerings is a way to increase the chances of their wishes coming true. Typical offerings include flowers, incense, and fruit. Not only do they wish for a successful year ahead, but they also reflect upon the year behind them while enjoying the calm and serene setting.\n4. Lunar New Year\nLunar New Year, or Tết as it’s known in Vietnam, is a nine-day celebration. Although not everyone celebrates for nine days, they will do it for at least three. It begins on the first day of the Lunisolar calendar, usually at the end of January or the start of February. There are several ancient traditions within Tết itself. New Year’s Day is a big affair, and one of the most important is whoever walks through the door first on the day. The first person to enter the house sets the benchmark for the year to come. If someone with a negative character or an unlucky astrological sign walks through first, it sets a precedent of misfortune for the whole year.\n5. Celebrating a baby’s first month\nNgay Day Thang is the day for celebrating a baby’s one-month birthday. The purpose of the celebration is to prepare a feast for twelve ‘fairies’. And according to Vietnamese mythology and folk religion, these fairies teach the baby various skills. Also, during the first month, or even 100 days, the mother is expected to rest indoors. So, it’s also a day to celebrate the baby and the mother. At the Ngay Day Thang, family and friends eat together and offer the mother and the baby money to bring good luck.\n6. Cooking a whole boiled chicken\nLike many cultures, Vietnamese celebrations strongly revolve around food. Boiling is a whole chicken, including the head and feet, is just one of them. The Vietnamese consider this to be good fortune, especially on Tết. Many people place the boiled chicken at the altar of their ancestors to bring good luck, worship their ancestors, and have a propitious start to the new year.\n7. Lucky numbers\nThis one’s more of a contemporary superstition, but many people in Vietnam customise their phone numbers based on lucky numbers. It’s actually advertised in almost any SIM card shop. While in western culture the number seven is considered lucky, in Vietnam it’s a deeply unlucky number. Therefore, many people choose to remove or exclude the number seven from their phone number. Instead, they add lucky numbers like nines and consecutive eights."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:47ddc777-9eff-48dc-89f6-bb74a2eed5d2>","<urn:uuid:a1c7b4ca-589a-4a3d-8687-2a231c837130>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How many performances per year did Louis Armstrong typically give during his later career, and until when did he maintain this schedule?","answer":"During the subsequent thirty years, Armstrong played more than three hundred gigs a year. He kept up this busy tour schedule until a few years before his death, continuing to play within the limitations of his failing health until the day he died.","context":["Louis Daniel Armstrong (usually pronounced 'Louee' in the French pronunciation with a silent s) (August 4, 19011 – July 6, 1971) (also known by the nicknames Satchmo and Pops) was an Americanjazzmusician. Armstrong was a charismatic, innovative performer whose musical skills and bright personality transformed jazz from a rough regional dance music into a popular art form. Probably the most famous jazz musician of the 20th century, he first achieved fame as a trumpeter, but towards the end of his career he was best known as a vocalist and was one of the most influential jazz singers.\nArmstrong was born to a poor family in New Orleans, Louisiana. The date of his birth is August 4, 1901. His youth was spent in poverty in a rough neighborhood of uptown New Orleans, as his father, William Armstrong, abandoned the family when Louis was an infant. He first learned to play the cornet (his first of which was bought with money loaned to him by the Karnofskys, a Russia-Jewishimmigrant family) in the band of the New Orleans Home for Colored Waifs, where he had been sent multiple times for general delinquency, most notably for a long term after (as police records show) firing a pistol into the air at a New Year's Eve celebration. He followed the city's frequent brass band parades and listened to older musicians every chance he got, learning from Bunk Johnson, Buddy Petit, and above all Joe 'King' Oliver, who acted as a mentor and almost a father figure to the young Armstrong. Armstrong later played in the brass bands and riverboats of New Orleans, and first started traveling with the well regarded band of Fate Marable which toured on a steamboat up and down the Mississippi River; he described his time with Marable as 'going to the University' since it gave him a much wider experience working with written arrangements. When Joe Oliver left town in 1919, Armstrong took Oliver's place in Kid Ory's band, regarded as the top hot jazz band in the city.\nIn 1922, Armstrong joined the exodus to Chicago, where he had been invited by Joe 'King' Oliver to join his Creole Jazz Band. Oliver's band was the best and most influential hot jazz band in Chicago in the early 1920s, at a time when Chicago was the center of jazz. Armstrong made his first recordings, including taking some solos and breaks, while playing second cornet in Oliver's band in 1923.\nArmstrong was happy working with Oliver, but his wife, pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, urged him to seek more prominent billing. He and Oliver parted amicably in 1924 and Armstrong moved to New York City to play with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the top African American band of the day. Armstrong switched to the trumpet to blend in better with the other musicians in his section. During this time, he also made many recordings on the side arranged by an old friend from New Orleans, pianist Clarence Williams; these included small jazz band sides (some of the best pairing Armstrong with one of Armstrong's few rivals in fiery technique and ideas, Sidney Bechet) and a series of accompaniments for Blues singers.\nHe returned to Chicago in 1925 and began recording under his own name with his famous Hot Five and Hot Seven with such hits as 'Potato Head Blues', 'Muggles' (a reference to marijuana, for which Armstrong had a lifelong fondness), and 'West End Blues', the music of which set the standard and the agenda for jazz for many years to come. Armstrong's trumpet introduction to 'West End Blues' remains one of the most famous and celebrated improvisations in jazz history.\nArmstrong returned to New York in 1929, then moved to Los Angeles in 1930, then toured Europe. After spending many years on the road, he settled permanently in Queens, New York in 1943. Although subject to the vicissitudes of Tin Pan Alley and the gangster-ridden music business, he continued to develop his playing.\nDuring the subsequent thirty years, Armstrong played more than three hundred gigs a year. Bookings for big bands tapered off during the 1940's due to changes in public tastes: ballrooms closed, and there was competition from television and from other types of music becoming more popular than big band music. It became impossible to support and finance a 16-piece touring band.\nArmstrong kept up his busy tour schedule until a few years before his death. While in his later years, he would sometimes play some of his numerous gigs by rote, but other times would enliven the most mundane gig with his vigorous playing, often to the astonishment of his band. He also toured Africa, Europe, and Asia under sponsorship of the US State Department with great success and become known as 'Ambassador Satch'. While failing health restricted his schedule in his last years, within those limitations he continued playing until the day he died.\nArmstrong died of a heart attack in 1971 at age 69, the night after playing a famous show at the Waldorf Astoria's Empire Room. He was interred in the Flushing Cemetery, Flushing, New York.\nWhat A Wonderful World \"By Louis Armstrong. By George David Weiss and Bob Thiele. For voice, piano and guitar chords. Piano Vocal.

{"question":"What is the maximum lifespan of honey bees compared to emperor penguins?","answer":"The lifespan of honey bees and emperor penguins differs significantly. Worker honey bees typically live only around 41 days, after which they either die during foraging or are removed from the hive by younger bees. In contrast, emperor penguins have a much longer lifespan of at least 20 years.","context":["Posted on May 3, 2019, 8:17 PM IST\nExtraordinary Life of Honey Bee\nOut of nearly 20,000 known varieties of bees, honey bees are the dearest. Honey bees are known for building highly sophisticated nests. In parlance, a bee is often referred to as a hive but in literal terms it is not so. A hive is actually man made whereas nests are built by the honey bees. The bees fiercely guard and protect the Queen bee, who is the mother of most of the bees in the nest.\nKeeping in mind the intricate order and design of the nest, each honeybee has a special duty to discharge. What might come to our mind is that the system for delegating all these duties to the honey bees must be a very cumbersome process, but the bee brain is just the size of a sesame seed.The honey bees are born with their skill set and work ethic already engraved inside them. The biggest deciding factor, for a honey bee’s job is its gender.\nMale bees simply lounge around and wait for an opportunity to mate, their entire lives. When the situation demands they compete with each other to mate with the queen bee. The most eligible suitor, who gets to do that, eventually ends up falling and dyeing after the work is done. The Queen bee mates with nearly twenty male bees. The male bees or drones constitute nearly 10 percent of the nest’s population.\nThe remaining population is held by the female bees who are the real workers of the nest. Some of them guide the hive, nurse the bees and do anything that is required to keep the nest functioning smoothly. The gender of a bee is not entirely nature’s call as the queen bee has the power to decide the gender of the bee. The queen bee lays up to 1500 eggs per and she does that incessantly for two to five years. The Queen bee then designates the gender depending on her desire to cultivate either worker bees or drones.\nTalking about female bees, it takes nearly 21 days for a bee to emerge out of her larval state. On the 21st day, she turns into an adult bee and starts cleaning her cell first. Three days prior that, her hormones turn her into a nurse too look after the young. The honey bees are very attached to their nests and their instincts are greatly affected by the requirements of the hive. After the bee has finished with her nursing duties, she shall move away from the centre of the hive and start building more cells and storing food for the fellow bees. As the bee nears her 41st day, she is almost sitting at the periphery of her own death. The old bees start foraging because that is the most dangerous and demanding job. The nectar and pollen is collected from the blooming plants and used for creation of bee.\nThe bee, senses her impending death and thus removes herself from the hive. If she doesn’t, the younger bees remove her corpse, so that the work doesn’t stop.","Emperor penguins are superlative birds. The largest penguin, they are the only bird that breeds in the depths of the Antarctic winter, and they can dive deeper (500 m) and survive longer without eating (4 months) than any other bird. Emperor penguins are also the only bird species that breeds on ice, and one of the few birds that doesn’t build a nest – the male balances the egg on top of his feet. When combined with their stunning good looks and ridiculously cute chicks, it is little wonder that emperor penguins command so much attention.\nEmperor penguins are very large penguins that could only be confused with the related, smaller king penguin. They are dark silver-grey on the back, and white on the breast and belly. The diagnostic broad pale patch on the side of the neck is yellow in adults and dull white in juveniles. Adults have a black head and chin, while juveniles have a chin colour that may vary from white to dark grey. The slender, decurved bill has a pink stripe on the lower mandible (paler in juveniles). Recently fledged chicks are about half the size of adults.\nVoice: a powerful, klaxon-like bray.\nSimilar species: king penguin is smaller and more brightly coloured, with a relatively longer bill. The pale neck patch is narrower (spoon-shaped) and dark orange in adults. When swimming, king penguins have smaller, brighter neck patches that do not reach the water, compared to the larger paler neck patch of the emperor penguin that extends to the water line.\nDistribution and habitat\nEmperor penguins are characteristic and abundant denizens of the Antarctic pack-ice. The 46 known colonies are scattered around the entire Antarctic continent, with almost all colonies located on fast ice (sea ice attached to the land) close to permanent openings (polynyas) in the sea ice. These polynyas, maintained by winds or currents, allow breeding adults to access feeding grounds during incubation and chick-rearing, including when the sea ice is at its annual maximum extent. The world population was estimated at 595,000 breeding pairs in 2009.\nAdults are rarely seen beyond the pack-ice, which extends to about 60° S at its maximum extent south of New Zealand. Juveniles tracked by satellite after leaving their natal colonies have been found to swim well north of the pack-ice, up to 54° S. Vagrants have occurred up to 40-41° S off Argentina and New Zealand.\nNew Zealand records\nThe two New Zealand records are contrasting tales. A bird in adult plumage came ashore on Oreti Beach, Southland, on 5 April 1967, and was released without fanfare off Dog Island, Foveaux Strait, the following day. The second record was an immature bird ashore on Peka Peka Beach, Kapiti coast, 20-24 June 2011, before being taken into care following excessive consumption of sand. This bird became a media sensation (widely known as ‘Happy Feet’), and was eventually released north-east of Campbell Island on 4 September 2011.\nBehaviour and ecology\nThe emperor penguin takes the generic penguin feed-and-fast lifestyle to extremes. They lay down extensive subdermal body fat, providing both insulation and energy reserves. This fat allows them to survive weeks or months without feeding during courting, incubation, chick care, moult, and the often lengthy transit between the sea and breeding colonies. As a result, the body weight of emperor penguins fluctuates greatly between about 23 and 45 kg. Males can lose up to 45% of their bodyweight during the 4 months that they are continuously at the colony from the start of courtship (March-April) through to after the egg hatches (July-August).\nThe single large egg is incubated entirely by the male for 62-67 days, with the female returning to the sea for 2 months until soon after the egg hatches. The egg, and later the young chick, is balanced on its parents’ feet during brooding. This mobile ‘nest’ allows the adults to move around, including forming their famous huddles during severe mid-winter blizzards. Both parents feed the chick through to fledging in December, timed to occur as the sea-ice breaks up in summer.\nBreeding adults moult in January-February, with juveniles and non-breeders moulting in November-December, either at colonies or elsewhere on Antarctic continent and sea ice. They first breed when about 5 years old, and have a life span of at least 20 years.\nEmperor penguins mainly consume fish, also squid and krill, captured by pursuit diving. Dives are of up to 18 min duration, typically to depths of 50 metres, exceptionally to over 500 metres. Chicks are fed by regurgitation by both parents.\nFretwell, P.T.; LaRue, M.A.; Morin, P.; Kooyman, G.L., Wienecke, B.; Ratcliffe, N.; Fox, A.J.; Fleming, A.H.; Porter, C.; Trathan, P.N. 2012.

{"question":"Hey, what's the difference between crying and bud break in vineyards? Keep hearing these terms but kinda confused.","answer":"Crying (also called weeping) happens when sap flows into the canes and appears as liquid drops at cut ends. Bud break occurs later - it's when the swollen buds on canes burst open, revealing tiny leaves, shoots, and flower formations that will become grape clusters.","context":["Bud break is truly a magical time in the vineyard. It occurs when grapevines that have been dormant all winter long awaken, and the new growth that will become leaves, shoots, and, most important, this year’s grapes, emerge.\nThe specific day that bud break occurs is dependent on the temperatures in the vineyard. Multiple days reaching fifty degrees will get the sap flowing from the roots and truck it up into to the canes (growth from the prior year). On those canes will be little bumps, called nodes. Those nodes will push out and become buds, so the prior year’s growth sets up for the next year’s crop.\nOver the winter, the vineyard staff will do winter pruning and will cut back the canes. In the context of vine maturity, a cane is a mature shoot from last year’s growth that has developed a layer of bark, and no longer has leaves. The vineyard manager and winemaker do not want all the nodes on all the canes to become buds, as it would take too much energy out of the vine, and not produce the best-quality grapes. At the time of pruning, the decision is made on how many canes to leave on each vine, and how many nodes per cane. The numbers vary by vineyard manager, and is based on past experience, the specific grape and how prodigious it is, and the climate in the particular vineyard.\nNow that winter pruning has been completed and the temperature has reached fifty or higher degrees many times, the sap starts flowing into the remaining canes and can be seen at the cut ends as a drop of liquid. This is called “weeping” or “crying.” Following that,, the nodes on the canes will become swollen and become known as buds. Inside that bud are all the structures for that year’s growth. There are different phases to bud development before they burst open, and when it does, it is truly spectacular. You see tiny leaves, shoots, and the flower formations that will become grape clusters.\nIt is during this time that the young growth is quite vulnerable to cold temperatures and frosts. If any of you have been watching the local Virginia news, as well as photos and reports coming out of Chablis, Burgundy, and other winegrowing regions around the world, you know that frosts have been hitting vineyards hard. Last year, we posted a blog about frost and frost mitigation. Late frosts in Virginia have occurred as late as Mother’s Day in past years.\nBarring lost bud growth to frosts, those shoots, leaves, and flower formations will push their way out and open wide. Growth occurs rapidly at this point. Depending on the way the vineyard allows the vines to grow, the shoots may be tucked in between wires. This allows flow of air, which helps reduce molds and mildews on the clusters and warmth from the sun to help ripen the grapes over the next few months.\nLet us all cheer to this magical time in the vineyard, and the birth of the next crop!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:373a79f5-61c8-4b48-857d-c5e00498391f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey there! As someone managing type 2 diabetes, what's the ideal mix of exercise types I need, and how does it affect my eye health?","answer":"The ideal exercise plan for diabetes should include both aerobic exercises (like walking, swimming, jogging, hiking, and dancing) and strength training with weights or resistance bands. You should aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week, or 60-90 minutes six days a week if weight loss is needed. However, start slowly and gradually increase your routine. Exercise helps control blood sugar and improves heart health, which is important because high blood sugar levels can damage eye structures, particularly the retina and its blood vessels. Before starting any exercise program, consult your doctor and get a comprehensive eye exam, as some eye conditions might require exercise modifications. Regular exercise helps manage blood glucose levels, which is crucial for preventing diabetic eye diseases.","context":["Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions worldwide. While many are aware of its impact on blood sugar levels and its potential complications related to the heart, kidneys, and nerves, our concierge doctors in Jupiter want you to understand its link to vision. In fact, diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in adults. But how does this condition affect the eyes, and what can you do to protect your vision?\nThe Connection Between Diabetes and Eyesight\nOur eyes are incredibly intricate and sensitive organs. The clear lens at the front and the retina, a thin layer of tissue lining the back of the eye, play vital roles in our ability to see. When blood sugar levels surge, as they often do in diabetes, these structures can be adversely affected.\nDiabetic Eye Diseases\nThere are several eye conditions tied to diabetes:\n- Diabetic Retinopathy: This is the most common diabetic eye disease. High blood sugar levels can cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina, making them leak or hemorrhage. Over time, this can lead to vision impairment or blindness.\n- Diabetic Macular Edema (DME): A consequence of diabetic retinopathy, DME involves swelling in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for clear, sharp vision.\n- Glaucoma: Diabetes doubles the risk of glaucoma, a condition where increased pressure inside the eye damages the optic nerve.\n- Cataracts: Those with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts at a younger age and the progression can be faster than in those without diabetes.\nPreventing Eye Complications\nThankfully, you’re not powerless against these potential complications. Here are steps you can take:\n- Regular Eye Check-ups: Schedule a comprehensive eye exam at least once a year. Early detection is the key to successful management and treatment.\n- Control Blood Sugar Levels: Monitor your blood sugar levels diligently and follow your doctor’s advice regarding medication, diet, and exercise.\n- Manage Blood Pressure and Cholesterol: High blood pressure and cholesterol can exacerbate eye problems in diabetics. Regular check-ups and medication can help keep these in check.\n- Avoid Smoking: Smoking can accelerate complications related to diabetes, including those that affect your eyes.\n- Protect Your Eyes: Use sunglasses with UV protection and avoid activities that risk eye injury.\n- Know the Symptoms: Be aware of vision changes such as blurry vision, floaters, frequent prescription changes, or any vision loss. Report these to your ophthalmologist immediately.\nIf you’re diagnosed with a diabetic eye disease, treatment options can vary based on the severity of the condition:\n- Laser Therapy: Used for diabetic retinopathy to reduce the leakage of abnormal blood vessels.\n- Vitrectomy: A procedure to remove the gel-like substance inside the eye, often used when there’s bleeding or significant scar tissue from diabetic retinopathy.\n- Injections: Medications can be injected into the eye to reduce swelling and improve vision.\n- Surgery: In advanced cases of glaucoma or cataracts, surgical interventions might be necessary.\nDiabetes doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have eye problems, but it does increase the risk. With proactive measures, regular check-ups, and early detection, many diabetic eye diseases can be managed or even prevented. Protecting your eyes starts with understanding the link between your health and your vision, and taking action to ensure both remain in optimal condition.","Exercise has many health benefits, and if you're living with type 2 diabetes, you know this is especially true for you. Create a regular exercise program, and it will help you control your blood sugar, improve your heart health, boost your mental health, and reach and maintain a healthy weight, says Jacqueline Shahar, CDE, MEd, RCEP, a diabetes educator and manager of exercise physiology at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. And yet, even if you know how important exercise is in managing diabetes, it can still be difficult to get started. Further, once you start exercising, it can be tough to stay motivated and continue exercising on a regular basis. Follow this guide to get and stay in the groove.\nHow to Start Exercising With Diabetes\nUse this step-by-step plan to create an exercise routine that’s suited to your current fitness level and that will help keep you motivated as you progress:\nTalk with your doctor. Before you begin an exercise program, get the go-ahead from your doctor. This is especially important if you’re taking medication for diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other health issue, as well as if you have joint or bone problems. “If you have diabetes complications and/or joint or bone problems, your doctor will explain which types of exercise are safe for you,” Shahar says. Also, make sure to have a dilated eye exam and let your eye doctor know about your physical activity plans. Some restrictions may occur if you have major changes in your retina or leakage, she adds.\nFind out how exercise could change your medication needs. Your muscles demand more glucose (sugar) when you’re exercising, and you need just the right amount of insulin to get glucose into your cells. “Glucose uptake by the active muscles increases, and insulin is working better when you are physically active,” Shahar says. “This process lasts 24 to 48 hours after exercise, which makes it a great way to manage blood glucose.”\nHowever, you may need to adjust your medication for your exercise routine to prevent low blood glucose (hypoglycemia). Also, ask your doctor if your exercise program will impact any other medications you’re taking, such as those for high blood pressure.\nLook at what’s stopping you from starting to exercise. Are you afraid your blood sugar will go too low if you start an exercise program? Or that you’re too out of shape and will be sore afterwards? You can work around any barrier, including these, Shahar says. You and your doctor may need to adjust your medication, or at least its timing, if you start an exercise program — which is another reason to talk to your doctor first. Keep in mind that if you start slowly and gradually increase your routine, you will be capable of exercise and won’t be sore, Shahar adds.\nKnow the different types of exercises in a comprehensive plan. The best exercise plan for diabetes, Shahar says, is one that includes a mix of aerobic and strength training. Aerobic exercises, such as walking, swimming, jogging, hiking, and dancing, can improve endurance. In addition, strength training — exercises that use weights or resistance bands — are essential to preserve or build muscle and increase your metabolism. To also improve flexibility, incorporate stretching exercises and yoga.\nDecide what’s realistic for you. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people with type 2 diabetes create an exercise plan that provides at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week. If you’re overweight and need to shed some pounds, aim for 60 to 90 minutes (divided into multiple bouts per day if necessary) of exercise six days a week.\nShahar notes that these guidelines can be overwhelming to some people: For instance, if you’ve been rather sedentary, trying to reach such a goal in the first week is unrealistic. Rather, set short-term goals — reaching each one will give you a sense of accomplishment and confidence.\nThen, find the time of day that is best for your schedule and an exercise style that fits your preferences. If you’re uncomfortable exercising in public, a plan that includes a group class at the gym probably isn’t the right choice for you — opt for home-based workouts instead. To create an exercise plan you can stick to, it should match your abilities, schedule, and likes and dislikes.\nFind your own motivation. Focus on the specific exercise benefits that mean something to you. Shahar suggests: “I am more positive. I sleep better at night. I have more energy. I feel less stressed at work. I take less insulin when I exercise.” It is important to have at least three positive thoughts related to exercise to be able to make a behavior change and stick with your new active lifestyle, she adds. Looking for a long-term goal? “Many people want to be there for their kids when they graduate from school or get married,” Shahar says. Identify a motivational goal like this to help you get started with exercise and improve your overall health, and you will, she says.\nAn exercise buddy can also provide motivation, keep you accountable, and make exercising more fun. Make a date to meet a friend at the gym or to go for a walk around your neighborhood after dinner.\nChoose an activity you enjoy. Pick something you find fun or interesting. Shahar also suggests starting with an activity that requires little financial investment — if you change your mind, you can easily switch to another activity to help manage your diabetes. That’s why brisk walking is often a good start, Shahar says. You can walk anywhere with just a pair of good sneakers. Another tip: Try online exercise videos or borrow DVDs from your public library to exercise right in your living room. Dance classes, yoga, and water workouts are other popular activities to consider.\nInk in exercise. Make the commitment by writing your workout time on your daily calendar just like you would a doctor’s appointment or a lunch date. If you can’t manage 30 minutes a day, shoot for 20, Shahar says. Another way to overcome the time obstacle is to break up your exercise into 10-minute intervals — research shows that these exercise “bites” may be just as beneficial as exercising for 30 minutes at once.\nStay hydrated. When you have diabetes and you exercise, getting enough fluids is a must. “If you become dehydrated, it can affect the concentration of glucose in your blood,” Shahar says. Also, you want to keep a source of quick sugar on hand — if your blood sugar goes too low (hypoglycemia) when you’re exercising, you'll need an instant boost.\nStart slow. Once you’ve created an exercise plan, take it one step at a time, the ADA suggests. If you overexert yourself, you could become exhausted or injured, as well as discouraged. Increase your endurance over time. If you’ve never been consistently active, start with just five minutes a day, and then gradually increase to 10, then 15, and so on until you reach your goal. An exercise plan should be challenging, but not overwhelming or impossible.\nListen to your body. If the exercise you’re doing is causing you discomfort, then stop. If the pain or discomfort continues to occur each time you do that exercise, try making modifications or talk with a personal trainer for suggestions. If you ever feel faint or experience shortness of breath or chest pain that doesn’t stop with rest, call 911.\nTrack your progress. Keep a log of your physical activity — how long you walked or how many miles you covered, or what you did at the gym each time you were there. Review the log weekly and monthly — seeing your progress will inspire you and help keep you motivated. Revamp your goals as needed, the ADA states.\nStart Exercising and Reap Rewards\nYou won’t see results overnight, but you’ll start to notice more energy and an improved sense of well-being within a few weeks of starting to exercise regularly. Be patient and you may even find yourself excited about your exercise routine. Who knows? It could become your favorite part of the day."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bfc3b9af-b64c-4177-b057-b4a846dd157b>","<urn:uuid:1751bb90-fd34-4955-98bd-e709476ca2f3>"],"error":null}

Alliant, formerly Hercules, Unique is about the most versatile powder going for Shotgun, handgun, and light rifle or cast bullet rifle loads.\nUnique works great in revolver or pistol loads. It won't provide magnum velocities but it will deliver high velocities in small capacity cases like the .45acp and smaller, and when used in magnum revolver cases with cast bullets or at moderate velocities, it performs with economy and excellence. The most useful velocity levels in magnum revolvers is between 900 and 1100 feet per second with a heavy bullet. Most guys can learn double-action shooting with moderate handloads. Being able to control your handgun and hit reliably with a heavy bullet will win the day over a miss with \"the most powerful handgun in the world\" as Dirty Harry liked to tout the .44rem mag... Usually a load from 8 to 11gr of Unique will deliver all the power you need. Even more functional is to load the heavy bullet in a .38 or .44 Special case, or a .45 Colt. The .454 Casull is primarily a hunter's cartridge so you don't load light loads in this one.\nUnique does it all. See the Lyman Cast Bullet Handbook, 3rd edition for all the cast bullet loads you could imagine. Most will include a recipe using Unique. Hard for me to imagine owning a magnum revolver without loading moderate power loads for it. Aside from Brown Bear defense loads, necessary in my backyard, what I want is 1000fps with a 200gr or much heavier bullet. My favorite Casull bullet is a 345gr cast Lyman design. With max loads it penetrates hardwood in terms of feet rather than inches. Huge knockdown power, but recoil prevents fast precision shooting; so the first shot usually must do the trick...\nIn terms of rifle powders IMR 3031 and 4198 are good choices for small capacity cases and use with cast bullets at fairly high velocities. Any of the 4350 powders is versatile for magnum or .30-06 series cases. I use XMR4350 for its just a bit faster burn rate. Some like the Hogdgons H4350 for its temperature stability. Years ago I bought a bunch of Accurate rifle powders for great price and am still using them. For .22-250 and .308 class cartridges, hard to beat Reloader 15 or Hogdgons Varget. Varget data is also compatible with many magnums, so there is that to consider.\nWhile the competitor or hobby-handloader will choose one powder for a given application, if the Survivalist does this, you run the risk of great variety but no depth of inventory. My basic powders are: Unique, Win 296 for magnum revolver max loads, RL-15 for .223, Varget for .308, and XMR4350 for magnum & 06 cases. Also use IMR/XMR4064. Own one of the super-magnums? You probably want another very slow burnrate powder.\nGearing up? My advice is to study the loading manuals and note the common powders that perform well with your cartridges. Buy those that you can interchange between different applications and you save money and can buy in quantity and save.\nIf you buy powder and primers over the net, be advised that US Mail won't deliver these materials, so you deal with UPS and they charge a stiff haz-mat fee. Your dealer might combine packaging of primers and powder or they may not. A deal might not be so good if you pay several haz-mat fees on top of freight.\nIf buying local, look at the lot #s and production dates on the packages. If buying a carton or case of primers, or several cannisters or jugs of powder; you want the lot numbers to match.\nLot numbers are also important if buying precision bullets and expect the same results. 500pk or larger batches of bullets might be important if your aim is utmost accuracy. Nice to match the lot numbers no matter what if buying 2 or more boxes of same bullet.\nAs far as bullet designs and component interchangeability, there are several rifle and handgun calibers (bore diameter) that allow interchanging handgun bullets for light loads in rifle ctgs. The .357mag and .358win, .35 Whelen and also .358 Norma Magnum are a case in point. Can shoot handgun cast bullets as well. There are lots of .358 rifle bullets in many designs from 200gr flatpoint to 250gr roundnose. For longrange and accuracy, there are 225gr spitzer boattail designs. If you could only own one revolver and rifle for wilderness usage (not self-defense) a heavy framed .357mag and Whelen or Norma magnum would be The Ticket...\nSimilar combos are the .32H&R magnum and any .30cal rifle. Both shoot .308 bullets. There are no 85gr rifle bullets produced that I'm aware of, but the 85gr .32(handgun) jacketed bullets are .308 dia and would be really explosive on varmints at close range.\nOther combos include the .40 cal rifles and either a .40/10mm pistol or .41 magnum. All depends on the bore of your rifle. The .44mag and .444marlin are another choice, but not such a good one in my book unless you go with a bolt rifle in .444Marlin and cast roundnose or pointed bullets which would take a custom mold.\nBest values in rifle bullets have always been Sierra BTSP designs, these are marketed under their GameKing and ProHunter label these days. The BTSP, Boat Tail Softpoint designs have very high Ballistic Coefficients and tough jackets. Sierra MatchKing have especially thick jackets. These bullets will out-penetrate hunting bullets on game or other targets. Where I live, I load the Hornady, Nosler, and Sierra BTHP match bullets (not really a hollowpoint, more a hollownose tip) for best ballistic performance and most rugged jacket material.\nHornady spire points offer a great value, as do the non-premium Remington Core-Lokt bullets. I have also favored the Remington BronzePoint bullets over the years along with Winchester Silvertips. The Speer line of Mag-Tip bullets are also very strongly constructed and perform well. Remington's 55gr softpoint is a good tough bullet for non-premium hunting applications in the .223rem. Probably a good choice for whitetail deer in your AR-15 if you can't hunt per regulations with a match bullet like the 75gr hornaday bthp.\nI am looking at my woods-walking rifle. A .338-06 loaded with 230gr Nosler Failsafe handloads to max. I am experimenting with a 290gr cast bullet at 2300fps for even better knockdown power and deeper penetration. For versatility the .338 bore offers huge range of bullet weights and highest ballistic performance at reasonable velocity. More bullet development has gone on in the past 15yrs for .338 bore because of the .338 Lapua Magnum and .338 Norma.\nWhen you have a high Ballistic Coefficient bullet, velocity isn't the paramount concern. The .300 and .338 Whisper are .221 Fireball based wildcats often used subsonic for suppressed long distance shooting."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:55dbcf7f-774a-4ed8-a78f-2f28a8923577>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the role of place-making in Renaissance Italian studies compare to its application in Roman archaeological research?","answer":"In Renaissance Italian studies, place-making focused primarily on private spaces, particularly the scholar's study, which served multiple purposes including displaying social identity, housing collections, and providing space for business and contemplation. In Roman archaeology, place-making theory is used more broadly to understand how spaces were inhabited, conceptually situated, and inherited across different contexts. While Renaissance studies examine material culture through post-mortem inventories and artwork, Roman archaeology employs place-making theory to analyze how built environments created social experiences and how archaeological sites continue to shape modern cultural and political identities.","context":["Dora Thornton. The Scholar in His Study: Ownership and Experience in Renaissance Italy. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1997. xi + 214 pp. $50.00 (cloth), ISBN 978-0-300-07389-8.\nReviewed by Georgen Gilliam (University of Wisconsin-Madison)\nPublished on H-LIS (January, 1999)\nThe Study Examined\nWithin the society of Renaissance Italy, politics and status informed all aspects of life. Dora Thornton, curator of the Renaissance collections in the Department of Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, shows that examining the material objects can reveal much about a culture. Her beautifully illustrated book, The Scholar in His Study, examines the study in Italy during the Renaissance. Their decor, the objects in them, and their place in Renaissance life is examined thoroughly and reveals significant features of Italian Renaissance culture, especially the society of the gentilezza--urbane sophisticates of the upper middle class.\nThe study in Renaissance Italy was a room of many purposes. It was a manifestation of social identity and a display of sophistication through decoration. It could serve as a repository of collections, a business office, and a family archive. It was often an indication of a desire for self-improvement and an appreciation of scholarship. The decorating of studies was an expensive business and supplied an entire subset of craftsmen with work to undertake the paneling, painting, specialized woodworking, furniture painting, etc. that such studies required. Markets thrived on selling the pouncepots, inkwells, storage boxes, and other items from the studies of deceased or bankrupt scholars. Artisans provided clever and beautiful examples of these objects, belying our notions of a separation between craft and fine art. The need for books to fill their shelves provided printers, binders, and papermakers a living. The studies of the gentilezza were an important part of the Renaissance economy.\nIt is clear from the letters and diaries excerpted in Thornton's book that the study was often a chesspiece in an extended game of courtiership. Someone wanting to flatter a patron would build a study using the same design, or perhaps even borrow statuary to grace its decor. A fine collection housed in the study could be visited by many admirers, gaining the owner status. However, before we become too cynical about the study, it is important to heed the many testaments to self-improvement gained through reading and private contemplation of texts. Many writers in the Renaissance era believed the study should be kept strictly private and provide a place of solitude. Thornton quotes Montaigne's essay \"On Solitude\": \"We should set aside a room, just for ourselves, at the back of the shop, keeping it entirely free and establishing there our true liberty, our principal solitude and asylum\" (p. 177).\nThornton's investigation of the studies of Renaissance Italy focuses on those of the urban elite, using post-mortem inventories made of household goods. She is scrupulous in detailing the sources of this information, and the book is the result of both clever deductions and much meticulous work. She provides a lengthy concordance of all primary source materials used in her work, and her detailed footnoting of secondary sources provides evidence for the thoroughness of her research. The text is accompanied by many well chosen images of paintings showing studies (many are those of St. Jerome), as well as pictures of objects from studies. Although the title would not suggest it, the book also details many women who owned studies, illustrating the topic with paintings showing women with their \"studies\" (then as now) often in the corners of their bedrooms, not in rooms of one's own.\nOver the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, the period of this historical investigation, there were changes in how the study was decorated and considered in Italian Renaissance society. Thornton notes that \"the study as collection was to become a much wider phenomenon in the sixteenth century\" (p. 8). However, the substance of these changes are not always clear, being only briefly noted and not detailed. Also, how these and other changes relate to other changing elements of Renaissance society is not elaborated. Shifts in scientific views certainly influenced the collecting activities of Renaissance individuals; the philosophical views or religious perspectives that an individual held may have influenced how the study was positioned in his (or her) life. Therefore, while this book illuminates many details of the lives of many individuals in the Renaissance, this lack of contextualizing makes it an excellent supplementary text on the period, but not a central one.\nFor those interested in library history, it must be pointed out that this book is oriented towards private libraries, not public ones. However, because it is an excellent example of the use of material culture as a source of cutural information, it may be useful to anyone interested in the library as an institution involved in a system of technology and economics. Thornton examines the ramifications of the items that were typically used in the study and makes perceptive points about that culture as a result. Perhaps a study of the vast array of gadgets that librarians use in their work would be as revealing. Instead of pouncepots, convex mirrors, red inkpots, and hourglasses, we were sold by Melvil Dewey, as Wayne Wiegand pointed out recently (American Libraries, August 1998, p. 112), \"the L.B. Perforating Stamp, Russell's Common-Sense Revolving Book Case, and the Reader's Readyrest Perfect Vacuum Inkstand\" (p. 112). Today we use computers, sensor strips, and automatically printed checkout notices. What kind of conclusions would an examination of our material items reveal about our own library history and the place of our libraries within the economic and cultural milieu of our time? Perhaps Thornton's book provides an example.\nCopyright (c) 1999 by H-Net, all rights reserved.

Journal of Roman archaeology supplementary series, 89. Portsmouth, RI: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 2012. Pp. 176. ISBN 9781887829892. $89.00.\nReviewed by James F. D. Frakes, University of North Carolina at Charlotte (firstname.lastname@example.org)\nThis volume collects several conference essays to illustrate the deployment of place-making theory in a variety of ancient archaeological fields. The first of two groups (five articles and summary) takes on place-making in the Roman past, while the second (four articles and summary) takes on place-making in the scholarly and political present. These two sections are preceded by a preface by David Mattingly (on which more later) and a guiding introductory essay by the editors, Marie Darian Totten and Kathryn Lafrenz Samuels. The volume maintains the expected high standards set by the Journal of Roman Archaeology series.\nThe editors position the volume within the evolving space/place debate, referring to (among others) seminal contributions of De Certeau, Bourdieu, Butler, and — of course — Lefebvre. Edward Casey’s work on “place” is also cited throughout the contributions. Casey’s synthetic Fate of Place may interest readers who are less familiar with this discourse (from philosophy, social geography, and architectural theory, among others), the main thrust of which guides this volume of critical archaeology. Regarding Roman Archaeology specifically, to this reviewer’s knowledge, some of the most sophisticated theory on place-making has been produced by Dutch archaeologist Ton Derks (whose work appears only once in the volume’s bibliographies).\nWhile both “space” and “place” are human constructs, “space” is rejected for its tendency to present the world as a totalizing abstraction, a theorization that may be useful to science, geography, or architecture, perhaps, but that otherwise tends to abstract or dehumanize our understanding of social experience. “Place”, on the other hand, highlights the material conditions of lived experience, producing “an embodied routine, defined by the movements of the body, with place even inscribed onto or extending the body itself” (p. 12). Totten and Samuels go on to describe specific ways in which place can be deployed by archaeologists to create more nuanced understanding of human social experience (both ancient and modern) as it intersects with a variety of conceptions of “the Roman Empire”: including how places are inhabited (p. 13ff.), for example as urban, as domestic, as rural (p. 13ff.); how places are conceptually situated (p. 18), for example, as proximate, liminal or distant; and how places are inherited and identified (p. 20ff.), for example, as markers of a group or individual past, as property or asset, or as communal heritage. Finally, given the goals of the second half of the volume, some time is also spent articulating how heritage politics have intersected with debates on property, tourism, and governmental power. The overall argument is not that ancient place-making somehow correlates neatly with modern place-making, but that both must be considered together to produce theoretically critical archaeology (p. 25). Beyond this unifying agenda, the contributions vary widely in location, time period, and topic. In the main, the articles taking up modern place-making practices are more successful at pursuing the volume’s agenda.\nThe volume begins with J. A. Baird’s solid contribution on the cultural sifting of excavated remains from Dura Europos. Baird asserts that the Greekness of this peripheral community is an artifact of twentieth-century archaeology, which gave primacy to textual remains from the site, and has been greatly overstated (p. 36). She writes persuasively; “What does it mean to be Greek…if a population is Greek despite its architecture, despite its art, and despite the presence of other languages?” Looking at material remains changes the overall picture significantly. The original excavation reports marginalize terracotta lamps, for example, and recent attention to these artifacts shows strong eastern connections. Baird’s essay uses place-making theory more successfully than some of the others in this section by being mindful of how the knowledge of a place has been generated by scholarship, as much as by being attentive to its material traces.\nNext, Cecilia Feldman Weiss revisits the processional route of Roman Ephesus, seeking to supplement Guy Rogers’s donor-focused interpretation of the civic event (funded in perpetuity by the estate of C. Vibius Salutaris) with greater attention to how the built environment itself created a social experience.1 In Weiss’s treatment, the buildings are given agency in the formation of culture, creating processional experience even at times when there was no parade. Perhaps she overstates the degree to which Rogers’s work neglects the general audience for this elaborate benefaction, but in any case it is good to be reminded of what makes the remains of Ephesus so compelling — in the language of this volume, such a “place”.\nWith Rob Collins’s essay, we find ourselves again at the limits of empire — this time with an analysis (using “occupational community theory”) of a poorly documented period (textually) at Hadrian’s Wall. Here again, it is by looking closely at patterns excavated widely in the built environment that we may theorize ancient place-making practices. The communities along the wall during the 4th century, Collins claims, saw continued prosperity, but with greater local production and shared identity than in earlier times when importation of goods and the free movement of peoples had dominated. The demolition of warehouses, and the installation of housing blocks and churches within garrison walls are adduced as evidence of changing social structures. If at times the theory used here reads as formalized common sense, we nevertheless benefit from the clear explanation of its interpretive modes.\nBradley M. Sekedat’s presentation of the Fasıllar Valley, Turkey, takes on a vast expanse of time (from the Hittite to the Byzantine!) in its perusal of modern interpretive possibilities for ancient place-making. Perhaps because of this breadth, Sekedat is unable to suggest anything specific here. Although this reviewer was in sympathy, for example, with attempts to read the quarry remains from one of the valley’s archaeological sites as suggesting the ancient production of cultural memory, there was not enough evidence to build a convincing case. Sekedat illustrates, rather, one of the perils of a priori theorization — specifically, that being able to identify ancient places does not necessarily allow a theoretical reconstruction of what those places were doing and when they were doing it.\nFinally, Dirk Booms’s analysis of imperial villas seems an odd fit here, not because he takes up an Italian rather than a provincial place, but because he is less interested in social experience than he is in understanding a specific ancient idea of privacy — the privacy desired by an emperor holding court. Booms analyzes the layout (at Hadrian’s villa in Tivoli, at Domitian’s in Albanum, and at Trajan’s in Arcinazzo) of crowd-management architecture intended for visitors during large entertainments. This reviewer wonders if security issues may have been more pressing in the minds of the villas’ architects (and residents) than privacy, and Booms’s reference to public-private debates from the study of Roman domestic architecture feels forced.\nThe four articles of the second section (benefitting from abundant modern source material) are better able to build a case for place-making theory, and might spur the field to grant greater scope to speculation when theorizing the ancient. In any case, they caution us to be attentive to the discursive agendas of our secondary sources before researching the primary.\nJody Michael Gordon looks at how the political division of Cypress has produced two different historical narratives from its archaeologists, and demonstrates how the political investment in tourism has shaped not only the situation on the ground at Cypriot sites, but also in the field more broadly. In Greek Cyprus the tourist is given a story of Mycenaean antiquity, Greek rootedness, and Romans as preservers of culture. In Turkish Cyprus, tourists learn of Phoenician and Hittite influences and are given an invasive Rome that suggests a history of frequent ethnic and political changes. Among the interesting observations offered here is how website knowledge is so rapidly destroyed, updated, or replaced — a digital whirlwind that at any one moment can give only “a didactic snapshot of how Roman material heritage has been, and continues to be, strategically marshaled to make places” (p. 112).\nDarian Marie Totten’s essay also takes up the ways that politics are invested in archaeological presentation, but in this case in the realm of cultural heritage rather than of tourism, and concerning the Etruscan sites of Cerveteri and Tarquinia. Totten sketches a fascinating history of how Etruscan archaeology has figured in various nationalist and localist agendas in Italian politics, including nineteenth-century attempts to unify the region of Bologna with Rome, separatist regional attempts to resist the narrative that Etruscans colonized northern Italy from a purer heartland, and early twentieth-century fascist narratives of renewed empire. Totten pays interesting attention to how the late 20th century’s unified Europe has developed a discourse of cultural heritage, and how the elevation of Tarquinia and Cerveteri to World Heritage Site status played out as an Italian argument for its unique contribution to Europe even as it argued for pan-European identity.\nThe following essay, by Carsten Paluden-Mueller, sketches a brief but familiar history of how the idea of the Roman Empire has been put to use by a variety of empires since, including the Ottoman, the British, the Spanish, and, most recently, the American hegemony. There is little to surprise us here, save for a tantalizing suggestion of how the European Union makes its own use of the Roman Empire (quite differently from the blunt and obvious American use of it). Is the European Union the first “empire” to recognize the networked nature of identification that characterizes our digital and globalized world? An empire less vulnerable to territorial warfare and in which the boundaries are less valuable for separating out the barbarians than is the access to nodes of power?\nFinally, Kathryn Lafrenz Samuels explores the social and political tensions created between Tunisian locals and tourists by global investment in tourist archaeology, particularly at the site of Dougga. Samuels recounts a brief history of French colonial and post-colonial dominance of Tunisian archaeology before touching on how the Ben Ali regime used tourist archaeology to foster an illusion of Tunisian democracy. The essays seems to have come together just after the Arab Spring began, and although Samuels anticipates interesting consequent changes in the local/global dynamic for Tunisia, she was unfortunately as yet unable to suggest what those will be. Samuels describes a Dougga in which the attempts to exclude locals have been thwarted by resistant pasturing of animals on the site itself, and where the living experience of locals is erased by tourist literature that describes visitors, rather than residents, as “breathing life into the sites” (p. 165). Samuels claims that the business of tourist archaeology is to create “heritage citizens” — and the bigger question highlighted by her essay is what exactly it means to be such a citizen, whether as a scholar, as a tourist, or both.\nTo end with the beginning, the preface by David Mattingly throws down a provocative gauntlet (perhaps reflecting a theme of the 2008 Critical Roman Archaeology Conference at Stanford), aimed at Roman archaeologists in the U.S., who he characterizes as abundantly supported but little engaged with recent British/European critical debates. He asserts that the U.S. “punches below its weight” in setting agendas for critical archaeology. Europe, he suggests, has moved productively beyond the traditional archaeological foci of “art, architecture, and the Roman army” towards emphasis of “landscape archaeology, economic themes, material culture and identity.” It strikes this reviewer that if the terms “art, architecture, and the Roman army” are changed to “visual culture, the built environment, and the material/institutional framework of the Roman military” there is not much separating the old from the new. After all, how could one ask questions about the landscape, the economy, the material culture, or the identity of ancient Romans without reference to visual culture and built environments? Indeed, in this very volume, wherever such attention has been given, a stronger theorization has resulted. Perhaps the difference is as much one of style than of a moving debate — but whatever the case, these essays carry the conversation.\n1.

The most reflective of all metals (excluding mercury), sterling silver looks stunning by itself and brings out the best hues in an array of colorful gemstones.\nSterling silver can be polished to a higher sheen than platinum. In fact, Ag, the chemical symbol for silver, comes from a word that means “white and shining.” The surface of silver can boast that shiny, polished appearance, or can be brushed, satin, matte, sandblasted, antiqued or oxidized (chemically blackened).\nIn order to be called sterling silver, a metal must be made up of a minimum of 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% alloy (meaning other metals), including but not limited to copper and nickel. The alloy is added to pure silver to make the metal more durable, tougher and harder.

It is called the “King of Gemstones” and known as the stone of love. The gem is the red variety of the mineral corundum, and while any other color of corundum is denominated as “sapphire,” only red corundum may be called “ruby.” Pure corundum is colorless, but slight traces of elements are responsible for ruby’s purplish bluish-red to orange-red color. In fact, the name “ruby” was derived from the Latin word “rubens,” meaning “red.”\nThe finest rubies are an intensely saturated pure red with no overtones of brown or blue. They are readily available in sizes up to 2.00ct and have incredible durability, ranking a 9.0 on the Mohs Scale (second only to diamonds in hardness). Rubies may show very different shades of red depending on their origin, and the range of these reds is quite considerable. The gem’s intense color was once thought to come from an undying flame inside the stone, while other legends say each stone is a piece of the planet Mars.\nSome rubies distinguish themselves with a wonderful silky shine, called the “silk” of the stone, which is created by fine rutile needles within the gem. The rutile mineral is also involved within very scarce “star” rubies. As can be found in sapphires, there is a translucent variety of ruby that displays a six-point star when cut into a smooth domed cabochon. Rutile is embedded in an asterisk-shape within the ruby, causing a captivating light effect called “asterism.” Six-ray stars appear to magically glide across the surface of the stones as they are moved. Star rubies are expensive rarities and should always display the stars exactly in the center of the gem. The star stone is said to be the home of each person’s angel, who lives there in contentment with the ruby’s spirit.\nRubies are found in many countries throughout the world, each location producing rubies of specific qualities and colors. Gemstone experts agree that the Burmese ruby is the most valuable and luxurious category of the stone. The former country of Burma, now Myanmar, is situated in a mountain valley surrounded by high summits. Rubies that are mined from this “Valley of Rubies” feature an exceptionally vivid red color with a slightly bluish hue. The stones display their unique brilliance in both natural and artificial light.\nRubies from Thailand, another classical supplier of the gem, are often dark red tending towards brown. This “Siam color” is considered almost as beautiful as the Burma color. Rare rubies from Ceylon are mainly light red, like ripe raspberries, while rubies of Vietnamese origin generally display a slightly purplish hue. Rubies are also produced in India, where relatively large ruby crystals have been discovered. These particular rubies, however, have many inclusions, but are excellently suited to be cut as beads or cabochons. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Russia have also produced occasional top-quality rubies, but the rough terrain in these areas has made mining difficult.\nTop-quality rubies are quite rare and are often considered even more valuable than colorless diamonds, particularly in sizes above 5.00ct. High prices tend to reflect their tremendous value. In 1988, a 16.00ct ruby sold at auction for $227,301 at Sotheby's in Geneva, Switzerland. A 27.37ct Burmese ruby ring sold for $4 million at Sotheby's in 1995, which was an astounding $146,145 per carat.\nIt is possible that no other gemstone has been as prized as the ruby. Celebrated in the Bible and in ancient Sanskrit writings as the most precious of all gemstones, rubies have adorned emperors and kings throughout history. Until improvements in chemical testing in the 1800s, most red gem-quality stones were called rubies. Thus, many of the famous “rubies” in the crown jewels of Europe, including Britain’s “Black Ruby” and the “Timur Ruby,” have since been identified as red spinels or garnets. Today, rubies continue to decorate the insignia of many Royal Houses.\nIn the 13th century, traveler Marco Polo wrote that Kublai Kahn, the Mongol Emperor of China, once offered an entire city for a ruby the size of a man’s finger. In ancient Hindu writings, the ruby represents the sun power. In China, the stone was given as offerings to Buddha.\nRubies were also given as offerings to Krishna in India. For a long time, India was considered the classical country of rubies. Their literature offers a rich and varied knowledge of the stone that was collected and handed down for over two thousand years. In the Sanskrit language, ruby is called “ratnaraj,” which translates as “king of gemstones.” Whenever a spectacular ruby was found, the emperor would send out his notables to welcome the precious gemstone in an appropriate style fit for a king.\nIn the Middle Ages, it was believed that a ruby could change color and grow darker to warn its owner that danger or illness was near. Thought to ward off misfortune, it was believed to chase away evil spirits and the spirits of the dead. The deep red color of rubies has been used for centuries as protection and to convey invulnerability. Soldiers wore them into battle to guard against wounds and promote healing if they received a wound. The color of blood, the stone is symbolic of courage and bravery. Warriors were said to have implanted rubies under their skin to bring them valor in battle, make them invincible against enemies and ensure victory.\nRubies have also been historically thought to bestow wisdom, wealth and love. In China and Europe during the 10th century, dragons and snakes were carved in the gems’ surfaces to increase the flow of money and power to their owners. A common belief was that dreaming of rubies meant the coming of success in business and money matters. Rubies were also used to capture a mate and light the passion of romance. The gem was believed to have the magical powers of sexual fire and success in love. It has also been said by ancient lore to be capable of reconciling lovers’ quarrels.\nWhen combined with gold and worn on the body, it is said that rubies can cause the body to rejuvenate and absorb energy from the sun to heal all types of body sickness and skin afflictions. It is believed that it should be worn with gold to banish sadness and bring joy.\nGiven as a symbol of success, devotion and integrity, the ruby is July’s birthstone and the traditional gift for 15th and 40th wedding anniversaries. Rubies have symbolized passion and romance for centuries, so when placed in engagement rings, they express unbridled love and promise of the heart.\nMost people think the coral used in jewelry comes from South Pacific coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef off Australia. However, these coral reefs are formed by a different species than the coral that is traditionally used in jewelry. Most jewelry coral is found in the Mediterranean Sea or in the Pacific near Japan and Taiwan. It grows in ocean colonies of branches that look like underwater trees, and is found in a range of colors, including pale pink (called angelskin coral), orange, red (called noble coral), white and black. The most valued colors are deep red, black and pink. It is much softer than other gems, with a hardness of only 3.5 on the Mohs Scale. In jewelry-making, coral is often carved into beads or cameos, or can be left and polished in its natural branch-like form.\nAmong the most ancient of gem materials, coral has been used for adornment since prehistoric times. While coral inlays and ornaments have been found in Celtic tombs from the Iron Age, the gem also has a history of religious significance. It is one of the seven treasures in Buddhist scriptures, and coral rosaries are used by Tibetan Lamas.\nCoral was long thought to be a powerful talisman that could stop bleeding, protect from evil spirits, and ward off hurricanes. Because it was believed that coral protected the wearer, it was a traditional gift to children. Coral was also believed to lose its powers once broken. Today, coral is the traditional 35th anniversary gift for married couples.\nStainless steel, also called corrosion resistant steel, is a steel alloy with added iron and chromium. The metal is low maintenance, rust-resistant, durable, highly lustrous and extremely hygienic, making it ideal for items such as cookware, knives, surgical instruments, jewelry and watches.\nThe nearly-indestructible and masculine nature of stainless steel is appealing for many jewelry styles. It has a similar appearance to platinum and polishes to a glistening sheen. Any scratches that may occur from day to day wear can be easily buffed away without endangering the piece. Unlike traditional gold, silver or platinum jewelry, stainless steel jewelry is not poured into molds, but is usually hand-cut from a solid piece of steel, leaving no seams or weak spots. With stainless steel, your jewelry will last a lifetime.\nStainless steel was first recognized in France in 1821 by metallurgist Pierre Berthier. He realized the iron-chromium alloys maintained resistance from acids and recommended their use in cutlery. After several corrosion-resistance related discoveries and patents in Europe and the United States, Harry Brearley in England discovered a modern blend of stainless steel alloy. When it was announced by The New York Times in January of 1915, he was officially credited with the invention of this impressive modern metal.\nA selection of our jewelry is made of sterling palladium alloy. Palladium is a member of the platinum group of precious metals. By replacing a portion of the copper content used in standard sterling silver with palladium, this proprietary formula renders a precious metal with superior performance attributes. Sterling palladium is five times more tarnish-resistant than standard sterling silver and has strength similar to that of 14K gold.\nPalladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939, originally as an alternative to platinum for making white gold. Its naturally white color requires no rhodium plating. Additionally, palladium is proportionally much lighter than platinum and is ideal for use in heavier gemstone jewelry. It is a more expensive alloy than nickel, but it seldom causes the allergic reactions that nickel alloy can.\nTo care for your plated jewelry items:","Moh’s Scale of Hardness\nThere are two methods to measure the hardness of materials: scratch hardness and static load indentation hardness. Scratch hardness, also known as Mohs hardness, is a relative hardness and is rather rough.\nIt uses ten natural minerals as standards. The hardness order does not represent the absolute size of a particular mineral’s hardness, but indicates that a mineral of higher hardness order can scratch a mineral of lower order. The hardness of other minerals is determined by comparison with these standard minerals.\nThe unit of Mohs hardness is kilogram-force per square centimeter (kgf/cm²), denoted as [Pa]. It’s a standard for expressing a mineral’s hardness, first proposed in 1824 by German mineralogist Frederich Mohs. The hardness is represented by the depth of the scratch made on the surface of the tested mineral using the scratch method with a pyramid-shaped diamond needle.\nThe hardness scale is as follows: talc 1 (softest), gypsum 2, calcite 3, fluorite 4, apatite 5, orthoclase (also known as feldspar or periclase) 6, quartz 7, topaz 8, corundum 9, diamond 10 (hardest). Mohs hardness is also used to express the hardness of other solid materials.\nFor a more specific method: one would scratch the mineral to be tested against the standard hardness on the Mohs hardness scale to determine the hardness of the tested mineral.\nFor example, if a mineral can scratch calcite and be scratched by fluorite, then the hardness of that mineral is between 3 and 4. Alternatively, one can use a fingernail (hardness 2-2.5), a coin (hardness 3.5), or a small knife (hardness 5.5) to scratch the mineral in order to broadly determine its hardness.\n|Representative Mineral Names||Common Uses||Hardness Scale|\n|Talc, Graphite||Talc is the softest known mineral, commonly used in the form of talc powder.||1|\n|Skin, Natural Arsenic||1.5|\n|Nails, Amber, Ivory||2.5|\n|Gold, Silver, Aluminum||2.5~3|\n|Calcite, Copper, Pearls||Calcite can be used as carving material and industrial raw material.||3|\n|Fluorite (also known as Fluorspar)||Carving, Metallurgy, Building Materials||4|\n|Phosphorite||Phosphorus is an important component of biological cells; it is used as raw material in feed, fertilizer, and chemical production.||5|\n|Glass, Stainless Steel||5.5|\n|Orthoclase, Tanzanite, Pure Titanium||6|\n|Teeth (outer layer of crown)||The main component is hydroxyapatite.||6~7|\n|Soft Jade – Xinjiang Hetian Jade||6~6.5|\n|Pyrite||It is used as raw material for the production of sulfuric acid; gold refining; and can also be used in medicinal purposes.||6.5|\n|Hard Jade – Burmese Jadeite and Jade||6.5~7|\n|Quartz Glass, Amethyst||7|\n|Electric Stone, Zircon||7.5|\n|Quartz||According to the old hardness scale, quartz is rated as 7.||8|\n|Topaz, Chromium, Tungsten Steel||On the old hardness scale, topaz is rated as 8.||9|\n|Moissanite||Synthetic gems are 2.5 times brighter than diamonds and cost 1/10th of the price.||9.5|\n|Corundum||Corundum is rated as 9 on the old hardness scale. Natural gems such as rubies and sapphires are now considered types of corundum, as is the hardness of synthetic sapphire crystals.||12|\n|Diamond||Diamonds are rated as 10 on the old hardness scale, making them the hardest natural gem on earth.||15|\nWhat is Mohs Hardness?\nMohs Hardness is a standard that indicates the hardness of minerals, first proposed in 1824 by German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs. This standard is established by using a pyramid-shaped diamond drill to scratch the surface of a mineral, with the depth of the scratch indicating the hardness.\nThe hardness of a mineral refers to its ability to resist certain external mechanical forces such as scratching, indentation, or grinding. In mineralogy, the hardness often referred to is Mohs hardness, which is the scratch hardness compared to the Mohs hardness scale.\nThe Mohs hardness scale is based on ten minerals of different hardness, divided into ten levels from low to high: 1. Talc; 2. Gypsum; 3. Calcite; 4. Fluorite; 5. Apatite; 6. Orthoclase; 7. Quartz; 8. Topaz; 9. Corundum; 10. Diamond.\nIn use, standard minerals are scratched against minerals of unknown hardness. If the mineral can be scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness is determined to be between 4 and 5.\nThis method was established and named by German mineralogy professor Friedrich Mohs (1773-1839). However, accurate measurement of mineral hardness still requires a microhardness tester or hardness tester. Mineral hardness is also one of the physical properties of minerals. Minerals with high hardness have been widely used in industrial technology.\nDiamonds, corundum, and other minerals are not only used in industry, but also become precious gemstones. As gemstones, they usually have a high hardness.\nFor example, the hardness of opal is 5.5-6.5, quartz is 6.5-7, sphalerite is 7.5-8. Tsavorite is 8.5, and the hardness of sapphires and rubies is 9, second only to diamonds. People choose high-hardness minerals as gemstones, probably because they are wear-resistant, symbolizing their timeless value!\nAccording to needs, people have also developed a gem hardness scale to identify the mineral hardness of gemstones, from the softest to the hardest minerals: talc, gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite, zircon, corundum, silicon carbide, boron carbide, diamond, etc.\nWhen there is no standard hardness mineral, the simplest way to measure hardness is with a fingernail or a small knife. The hardness of a fingernail is 2.5, a copper coin is 3, and glass and a small knife are both 5. Those above 6 are almost all gemstone-like minerals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1b5c9d7b-922b-4962-8ff1-8cb7157f78ae>","<urn:uuid:6f5dff6d-ddef-43d0-937c-cbff7f05f328>"],"error":null}
