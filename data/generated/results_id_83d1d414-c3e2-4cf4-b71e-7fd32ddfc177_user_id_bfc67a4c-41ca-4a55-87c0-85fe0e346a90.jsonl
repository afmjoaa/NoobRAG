{"question":"Are both melon-headed whales and pygmy killer whales aggressive species? I need this info for research paper.","answer":"While both species can show aggressive behavior, documented evidence suggests pygmy killer whales are notably more aggressive. Pygmy killer whales have demonstrated extreme aggression in captivity, attacking and killing other animals including their own species when placed in pens. They are also known to attack other marine mammals, such as dolphins escaping from tuna fisheries. For melon-headed whales, there is no specific mention of aggressive behavior in the documents - they are described as being social, often swimming with other species like Fraser's dolphins and being eager bowriders.","context":["Melon-headed whales have a triangular, relatively narrow head, in which only females and young have a beak, albeit short and poorly defined. The triangular, sickle shaped dorsal fin is tall, reaching up to 30 cm. The body of the melon-headed whale is generally charcoal gray to black, with white lips and a white urogenital patch. On larger animals the black triangular \"mask\" on the face of melon-headed whales distinguishes them from the more uniformly-colored pygmy killer whales. Melon-headed whales also have a cape that dips below the dorsal fin, although its margin is often faint.\nThese animals have 20-25 small slender teeth in each tooth row. Melon-headed whales reach a maximum of about 2.75 m. Length at birth is thought to be about 1 m or less. Maximum known weight is about 275 kg.\nCan be Confused With\nAt sea, melon-headed whales are often difficult to distinguish from pygmy killer whales. Major differences are that the melon-headed whale has pointed flippers and larger numbers of smaller teeth (pygmy killer whales have rounded flippers and only 8-13 pairs of more robust teeth.) Head shape, flipper shape, and the sweep and distinctness of the cape can be useful in identification. False killer whales can also be confused with this species at a distance.\nThe range of the melon-headed whale coincides almost exactly with that of the pygmy killer whale in tropical/subtropical oceanic waters between 40°N and 35°S.\nIn the Atlantic Ocean, melon-headed whales have been sighted on the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States, in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Caribbean, the coast of Brazil, and on the coast of Africa to Cape Good Hope.\nIn the Pacific Ocean, melon headed whales have been seen along the coast of Central and South America on the coast of Baja California, in the Gulf of Panama, and on the coast of Peru; in the eastern tropical Pacific and near the Hawaiian Islands; in the waters near Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia; and on the Australian coast of Queensland and New South Wales.\nIn the Indian Ocean, melon-headed whales are found near the coast of Africa; in the Arabian Sea; on the coast of India and Sri Lanka; and in the Bay of Bengal.\nEcology and Behavior\nMelon-headed whales inhabit shelf/slope waters and are highly social, and are known to occur in pods of 100-500 (with a known maximum of 2,000 individuals). They are often seen swimming with other species, especially Fraser’s dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific and Philippines. Melon-headed whales often move at high speed, porpoising out of the water regularly, and are eager bowriders in many areas, often displacing other species from the bow wave. There is some evidence indicating a calving peak in July and August, but this is inconclusive. Little else is known of the species’ reproductive biology.\nFeeding and Prey\nMelon-headed whales feed by seizing prey, consisting of a diet dominiated by several species of squid > small fish.\nKnown prey species include invertebrates such as: Dosidicus gigas, Enoploteuthis sp., Teuthowenia sp., Abraliopsis sp., Bathyteuthis abyssicola\nThreats and Status\nMain threats of melon-headed whales include:\n• Fisheries bycatch\nThe IUCN does not list the melon-headed whale as threatened or endangered, nor does the United States government. Although no large kills are known, melon-headed whales have been taken in various fisheries. This includes direct killing in drive fisheries in Japan and harpoon/driftnet fisheries in the Caribbean, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Indonesia, as well as incidental catches in tuna purse seines in the eastern tropical Pacific. This species is relatively common in some areas of its range, such as parts of the Philippines. The population in the eastern tropical Pacific was estimated in the early 1990’s to be ~45,000 individuals. In 1995, NMFS estimated the Gulf of Mexico population to be 3,965 (CV = 0.39), and the Hawaiian Islands population was estimated in 2000 to be 154 animals (CV = 0.88), although this number is thought to underestimate the population due to survey inadequacies.\nJefferson, T.A. and N.B.

Through photo id’s, they (unlike pygmy killer whales anywhere else in the world) seem to be “regular” residents – never leaving the coastline. Our onboard studies have shown that Oahu has it’s own resident pod of pygmy killer whales.\nTheir stable, long-term relationships resemble the social behaviors of killer whales and pilot whales, with many forming bonds with other individuals for at least 15 years. There are probably 200 individuals in Hawaii’s waters.\nHawaii’s group is the only known case of a pygmy killer whale population that remains isolated in one area and doesn’t venture out to the open ocean. On average, they are spotted about 4-6 miles from Hawaii shores., on out to almost 10 miles. They aren’t found farther than that as there isn’t much food for them.\nWhat the small pygmy killer whales lack in size, they make up for in attitude. These are formidable predators and are often known to attack other marine mammals, such as other dolphins escaping from the nets of tuna fisheries.\nWhen a number of Pygmy Killers were brought into captivity in Hawaii and South Africa they were extremely aggressive, killing or attacking everything that was in or entered their pen — even killing one another. Hmm… let’s keep them wild, shall we?\nPygmy killer whales are easily recognized by their round bulbous heads and their white underbellies. At the water’s surface, their pods may be quite social and acrobatic, leaping, spy hopping, tail slapping, and occasionally bowriding. More frequently, they are resting- or ‘logging’ – where a group floats at the surface of the water, each animal still, rather like logs!\nRobust body, Small size, Bulbous forehead, lacks a beak, White “lips”, chin, and belly; under slung jaw, Dark cape; Tall dorsal fin, sub-triangular, long based, lacks rigidity, often inclining to the side; White scratches and scars, The skull is asymmetrical and the right jaw is smaller and usually has one less tooth than the left jaw.\nImpacts to Hawaii Pygmy Killer Whales\nThere are very few, probably less than 200 individuals, in this distinct pygmy killer whale population off the islands. The population’s limited number make it more vulnerable than other whale populations to potentially harmful human behavior.\nThere have been no reports of a pygmy killer whale dying as a result of Hawaii’s long-line tuna and swordfish fishery. But the mouth of a pygmy killer whale stranded on Oahu in 2006 had hook and line marks, indicating fishing lines affect the animals.\nThere has been no documented case of a pygmy killer whale being hurt by sonar. But there’s low probability anyone would be able to document such harm given the whales are so rare and because they generally spend their time miles offshore.\nPYGMY SPERM WHALE\nScientific Name: Kogia breviceps\nMore information about the Dwarf and Pygmy Sperm Whales at NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center.\nDWARF SPERM WHALE\nScientific Name: Kogia sima\n(2005) Dr. Robin Baird reports that dwarf sperm whales are the sixth most commonly sighted odontocete around the main Hawaiian islands. This species’ small size, tendency to avoid vessels, and deep-diving habits, make finding them a true treasure.\nSighting Notes: Similar in appearance to the pygmy sperm whale, but has a larger dorsal fin, generally set nearer the middle of the back. Also, the dwarf sperm whale’s blowhole is positioned further forward.\nThe dwarf sperm whale has a shark-like profile (but with a more pointed snout than the pygmy sperm whale), gray and white countershading, and a light pigment block resembling a shark’s gill slit on the side of its head. Generally, a pair of short grooves similar to those in beaked whales is present on the dwarf sperm whale throat. It contains spermaceti in its melon.\nAdults of this species are up to 2.7 m long and may weigh up to 272 kg. Length at birth is about 1 m.\nGroup sizes tend to be small, most often less than five individuals (although groups of up to 10 have been recorded). This species, like the pygmy sperm whale, is shy and undemonstrative when observed at sea. They often drift motionless at the surface. When startled, dwarf sperm whales may leave a large rust-colored cloud of fecal material behind as they dive. In at least one area, there appears to be a calving peak in summer.\nOur wildlife tours focus on education and conservation with encounters conducted in the best interest of both humans and wildlife. We model admiration and deep respect for these wonderful mammals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a646dc60-050e-4dbb-a727-a9c435395a1c>","<urn:uuid:cdf00b2e-0fb0-47f6-8fbc-27409772adb4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Como especialista en riesgo crediticio, necesito entender: ¿por qué es insuficiente usar solo el puntaje FICO y el índice de bancarrota para evaluar préstamos?","answer":"Using only FICO scores and bankruptcy index is insufficient because these metrics alone can create a proxy variable for a protected class, potentially leading to bias. This is demonstrated by LiftFund's case, where borrowers with average FICO scores below 600 achieved a 95-97% repayment rate. Instead, a holistic approach using multiple variables measuring cash flow, credit, collateral and character is needed to create an unbiased decision model. Additionally, it's important to review each decision to ensure no single variable becomes a key decision-driver.","context":["4 Ways to Avoid Bias in AI Lending Models\nTakeaways from American Bankers’ Retail Banking Conference\nFor all its promise, artificial intelligence (AI) has its share of pitfalls.\nOne downside is the potential for AI algorithms to reinforce societal biases. Predictive models are only as good as the data they’re built on. And if that data reflects racial, ethnic or gender biases, so will the decisions or actions these models recommend.\nThis is especially relevant to lenders who use AI models to predict risk of default. Plenty of people have written about biased AI models in finance and other industries. But fewer have written about how to avoid bias when creating an AI model.\nMy firm 2River Consulting Group had the opportunity to help LiftFund, one of the nation’s largest small business lenders, develop models that improved loan processing time by 10%. Nelly Rojas-Moreno, LiftFund’s Chief Credit Officer, and I talked about the process of avoiding bias in AI lending models at last month’s American Bankers Retail Banking 2019 conference in Austin.\nHere are the four messages we relayed at the conference:\n1. Make sure your data set is diverse.\nAI models are trained on historical data. A model is less likely to produce biased predictions if there is significant diversity of lending cases in your training database.\nA lender that typically serves high-income and established businesses and fewer low-to-moderate-income entrepreneurs may wind up with a model that excludes those entrepreneurs. If a significant number of applicants in this group are from a protected class, this can lead to bias. By the nature of its work, LiftFund, a Community Development Financing Institution (CDFI), has a diverse borrower base. But other lenders may need to sample cases carefully to ensure a diverse training set of borrowers for their AI models to avoid bias.\n2. Use multiple features for each case in your model. But make sure they’re the right ones.\nLiftFund’s borrowers have an average FICO score below 600. Yet the lender’s repayment rate was a stunning 95% in 2017 and increased to 97% in 2018 after implementing the AI model. A model depending only on credit scores would have denied most of these borrowers.\nAdding a second variable, such as a third-party bankruptcy index wouldn’t solve the problem. Credit score and bankruptcy risk provide important information about potential borrowers. But used alone, they can create a proxy variable for a protected class. In the case of LiftFund’s model, we use nearly 80 additional variables measuring cash flow, credit, collateral and character, to create a holistic decision model. And we review each decision to makes sure no one variable is a key decision-driver.\n3. Make sure you can explain your model.\nIt is not enough to build a data set with diverse cases and dozens of features. If you cannot explain how each decision is made, you cannot be sure that the model is truly unbiased.\nIn a heavily regulated industry like lending, transparency in explaining denials is crucial. The more attributes you use, the more complicated your model becomes. But researchers have advanced methods to explain the mathematical models used in machine learning. These techniques (e.g., LIME, game theory approaches based on Shapley values) allow one to interrogate the machine learning model and identify the attributes that lead to the model’s outcome. This improves the transparency of decision models.\n4. Review and refresh your model every few months.\nWhile AI has increased efficiency in many areas of lending, it is still no substitute for human judgment. LiftFund’s underwriting and loan officer team proves that. Remember, this team achieved 95% repayment from borrowers with average FICO scores below 600.\nAfter creating the model, we made sure this team of experts reviewed the technology to ensure it reflected not only the data but also their judgment. We also planned to review the model every few months. Changes in the broader economy can affect the impact of some attributes. Keeping on top of those changes is important to ensure a sustainable, unbiased model.\nIf we learned anything from the experience, it’s that the importance of authentic human interaction remains key in this AI age. At the Retail Banking Conference last month, almost every panel and side discussion mentioned that banking customers – consumer or personal, small or large – still want to deal with a person at all stages of the banking process.\nLending decisions affect people’s lives. People, with the help of AI, should make them wisely."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0036fe8b-c71b-4df8-aadc-36f847dc939d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a store operations manager, I need to understand inventory tracking procedures. What are the critical timing factors in merchandise booking and receiving, and how does this relate to physical inventory counts?","answer":"The timing of merchandise booking and receiving involves several critical factors. Key considerations include when merchandise is booked to a particular store, when it's shipped, when it's received, and when records are updated - either automatically or manually. These aspects need to be carefully monitored as any errors in timing or recording can affect inventory accuracy. This ties into physical inventory management, where regular cycle counts should be implemented to track inventory levels. During these counts, only a small portion of inventory is counted on any given day, allowing for quick completion while maintaining accurate stock levels and helping identify items that need replenishment.","context":["Overseeing a retail business’s daily operations entails performing a wide range of tasks, from training shop personnel to upholding the brand’s reputation.\nRetailers can optimize their inventory and improve their customers’ shopping experiences by recognizing the numerous facets of store management and best practices. Retail businesses will be able to keep effective control over their operations and increase overall productivity with good management.\nWhat is Retail Store Management?\nThe technique of operating and monitoring all operations within a store is known as retail management. Working directly with employees, setting shift plans, talking with suppliers, and dealing with consumer concerns are all examples of this.\nStore managers are in charge of managing and monitoring inventory levels in order to avoid overstocking or understocking. Retailers will be required to satisfy client needs while reducing needless costs by ensuring they have the right quantity of goods on hand.\nRetail managers must also meet retail sales targets in order for the shop to stay profitable. Store managers also watch out for their employees’ well-being and give assignments to motivate them to accomplish their sales goals.\nRetail shop managers may also help strategize for ads on the sales floor and promotions to boost income in some circumstances, manage finances, ensure sufficient public liability insurance is in place, and oversee payroll.\nThree Fundamental Aspects of Store Management\nFulfilling all of the management process’s responsibilities can help a retail operation’s overall performance and profitability. The following are the three essential elements of effective retail management:\n- Providing support and encouragement to employees\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, the average employee turnover rate in the retail business is around 60%. Store managers have a critical role to play in assisting and encouraging employees in order to improve employee retention. Providing rewards or engaging with shop personnel, for example, can help to create a happy workplace.\nManagers may cut employee turnover even further by successfully managing these hiring procedures.\nHiring and Recruiting\nHiring trustworthy individuals whose skill sets coincide with the job description and who will fit in well with the company’s culture is one strategy to reduce employee turnover.\nManagers should set clear objectives for the position throughout the recruitment process and ask candidates questions that reveal how they function under pressure.\nOnboarding managers should provide extensive training to their new hires to enable a smooth transition into the role. Onboarding should involve instruction on how to utilize the point-of-sale (POS) system as well as sales suggestions.\nManagers should define performance targets and milestones for new recruits to fulfil in order to track their onboarding progress.\nEven once a new employee is fully onboarded, managers should continue to communicate with them to ensure that they are fulfilling their objectives and progressing. It’s also critical that management teams pay attention to their retail employees, encourage new ideas, and solve any issues that develop. This is critical because shop managers must keep staff engaged in order to guarantee that they work hard and efficiently.\n- Inventory Management\nInventory must be managed at ideal levels at all times for a retail firm to thrive and run efficiently. Businesses can reduce their risk of profit deficits by effectively regulating stock levels.\nStock-outs, for example, might result in lost revenue and customer loyalty when customers seek out rivals to get the things they require. Overstocking a store’s inventory, on the other hand, raises carrying costs since unsold items take up storage space.\nStore management is particularly concerned about inventory shrinkage, which occurs when shops have fewer things in their real inventory than what was recorded. Theft, product damage, and counting mistakes are the most common causes of shrinkage.\nCount your inventory on a physical basis.\nRegular cycle counts should be implemented by retail managers to keep track of inventories on a regular basis. Cycle counting is a method of inventory auditing in which just a tiny amount of the inventory is tallied on a particular day.\nManagement can easily check their inventory and discover popular goods that may need to be refilled by doing cycle counts. Furthermore, because managers would be concentrating on a subset of inventory, they would be able to complete it quickly and spend more time assisting consumers in their shop.\nDefend Against Theft\nCustomers can steal from you; in fact, so can staff. Loss prevention techniques may help firms detect shrinkage and gain a better understanding of their inventory on a day-to-day basis.\nStore managers should delegate tasks and collaborate with employees to keep stock under control. Businesses will receive further assistance in ensuring stock is properly kept if the importance of inventory is communicated and relevant training is provided.\n- Using Management Software\nThe newest digital tools and software can make store administration much simpler. Retailers, for example, can use cloud POS systems with additional capabilities like real-time reporting. Other software, such as inventory management and forecasting, can be connected with these solutions. This is significant because executive teams will be able to generate data reports, maintain inventories, and monitor financial results.\nThese technologies may be used by management to increase efficiency, make data-driven choices, and enhance sales.\nStore management entails a wide range of tasks, and with proper execution, retail operations may become more productive, and the customer experience can improve.","Most retail companies have a department dedicated to maintaining processes and procedures related to inventory management and retail shrinkage. The inventory control department ensures that optimum inventory levels of products are available and accessible to the stores; that stock levels/turnover are efficiently managed; that inventory is maintained in a safe and secure place; and that all profits associated with the process are capitalized. ‘\nIn addition, inventory control personnel are tasked with the development and implementation of the inventory-taking process, as well as the reconciliation of those inventory numbers. Using inventory control techniques in a way that is efficient, reliable and cost-effective is critical to the success of any retail business.\nFrom a loss prevention perspective, a strong understanding of how our inventory is managed is crucial as we attempt to resolve shrink-related issues. One basic but important component is knowing the inventory control techniques and accounting methods used by your company.\nThe two most common methods of accounting in the retail industry are the “retail” method of accounting and the “cost” method of accounting.\n- Cost Accounting tracks all merchandise at cost. In other words, this metric is based on what the company paid for or has invested in the product. The cost method of accounting requires minimal recordkeeping compared to retail accounting and merely requires that a physical inventory be taken and the actual cost associated with each item be documented to determine the inventory value. A steadfast point-of-sale (POS) system, coupled with a meticulous by-item inventory control strategy, is important when using a cost accounting system.\n- Retail Accounting tracks all merchandise at the actual retail price, which would include markups, markdowns, and sale prices. Accurate recordkeeping is essential for this type of inventory accounting, and all additions to or deductions from the retail value of the stock must be appropriately recorded.\nBoth types of accounting methods offer advantages and disadvantages. The cost accounting method is simpler, but it must incorporate a by-item inventory system. Without a by-item system, all costs are pooled together, making retail shrink difficult to segregate and measure. For example, there would be no potential for markdown-related shrink when this system is used. The percent to sales will naturally appear lower using this accounting method.\nThe retail accounting method enables us to focus on specific components affecting inventory shrinkage (markdowns, employee discounts, damages, paperwork, theft, and any combination thereof), enhancing our ability to monitor these issues and improving overall accountabilities. The physical inventory process is simplified because it can be conducted using retail prices, which is generally easier and less expensive than using cost figures. However, strict attention must be paid to maintaining accurate inventory records when using the retail accounting method. For example, failing to capture a product markdown will appear as shrink if not corrected.\nParticular inventory control techniques and accounting methods may work better for specific types of retail, and/or company variations may apply based on individual needs and systems.\nOther important questions will apply as well:\n- Do store records always accurately reflect the level of goods on hand?\n- When is merchandise booked to a particular store?\n- When is merchandise shipped?\n- When is merchandise received?\n- Is there a particular time when records are updated?\n- Are records updated automatically or manually?\n- What happens if an error occurs?\n- Does your system flag mis-shipments, or shipments never received?\nUnderstanding how your company addresses each of these questions and others are essential to performance of many core loss prevention responsibilities.\nBy capitalizing on opportunities to enhance our knowledge and education, we are making an investment in our own future.

{"question":"Hello! Please tell me about mining's impact on water resources and local economic development?","answer":"Mining has contrasting impacts on water resources and local economic development. Regarding water, mining can severely contaminate both surface water and groundwater through chemicals used in the mining process. Even small-scale operations like gold panning can affect water quality, while large-scale mining can have tremendous negative effects on water systems. On the economic development side, mining provides substantial benefits to local communities through various channels. Companies contribute through direct employment, paying taxes and royalties that fund infrastructure like roads and schools, and implementing community investment programs. They also stimulate local economies by prioritizing local suppliers and contractors. For example, some mining operations direct significant portions of their procurement spending (over 20%) to local Indigenous-owned companies, creating business opportunities and economic growth in the region.","context":["Contributing to Sustainable Community and Regional Development\nThe socioeconomic benefits at the local, regional, and national scale associated with mining activities are the counterbalance to the environmental risks and impacts discussed throughout this report. Quality of life and social well-being require the economic security that comes with industrial development. As a result of this balancing act and the recognition that the people closest to our operations are the ones who are most acutely aware of- and potentially affected by- the impacts of our operations, we prioritize these same people when it comes to providing economic opportunities and benefits.\nDescription of Impacts\nOur business stimulates the local and regional economies surrounding our projects and mines. We pay taxes and royalties directly to governments, which in turn is often used to build and maintain critical infrastructure such as roads, schools, and hospitals. The salaries and revenues earned by our several hundred employees, contractors, and suppliers – who mostly originate from areas near our operations – have direct and significant positive impacts on local and regional socioeconomic conditions. We also directly contribute to local communities through our community investment program. Indirect economic impacts often include the development of local and regional infrastructure.\nAt New Gold, we aim to understand our host communities’ priorities so that we can better contribute to the sustainable economic development of the local area. In addition to engaging with communities to understand their needs and priorities, we commissioned three independent studies that were completed by economic development specialists in the past several years, focused on Cerro San Pedro, Rainy River, and New Afton mines. The findings from these studies inform our approach to understanding and leveraging opportunities to maximize sustainable economic development of the areas around these mines.\nTraining and Employment\nHiring and training local people is one of the major ways we contribute to local economies. We support training and employment of local Indigenous Peoples with internal training programs. Our New Afton, Rainy River and Blackwater sites are great examples of building local capacity among local First Nations and Métis communities, as well as other non-Indigenous local community members, which allows us to source a significant portion of the workforce we need from these same communities.\nAt Rainy River, the construction period provided a great opportunity to train employees for long-term operations. The construction phase involved significant expenditures and it was a priority for New Gold to maximize the proportion of spend allocated to Indigenous companies. During 2017, at our Rainy River site, $64 million (22% of our direct total procurement spending) went to First Nations and Métis-owned companies, including joint ventures. At New Afton, $25 million (28% of our direct total procurement spending) went to First Nations companies and joint ventures. See the Working with Indigenous Communities tab for further information on our approach to prioritizing benefits for local Indigenous communities.\nLooking forward, we plan to roll out the New Gold Local Procurement Standard at Canadian sites. The Standard will provide clarity and consistency regarding procurement practices across our sites.\n|Expenditures for materials, products and services2||689.8||790.3||833.8|\n|Employee wages and benefits (includes payroll taxes paid to governments)||137.4||160.3||196.3|\n|Payments to providers of capital (interest paid and standby fees)||52.3||55.3||63.7|\n|Payments to governments4 (royalties, property, production and income taxes)||26.6||15.5||32.05|\nUnaudited figures.

Any discrepancy between this figure and the figures disclosed through Extractive Sector Transparency Measures Act (ESTMA) result from the latter not taking into account tax refunds and including payments for government fees and permits, which are not included here.6.\nExpenditures for voluntary donations and investment of funds in the broader community where the target beneficiaries are external to the company. Includes payments associated with participation agreements and impact benefit agreements, contributions to charities, NGOs and research institutes, funds to support community infrastructure, and direct costs of social programs and direct community development activities for all our sites as well as corporate offices. The significant increase in 2017 is due to issuance of shares for First Nations and Métis associated with the achievement of various milestones at the Rainy River Mine.\nAt New Gold, we consider Community Investments to be donations, sponsorships and/or other investments and payments made through Participation Agreements and Impact Benefit Agreements.\nNew Gold supports many organizations through donations and sponsorships. Our corporate Donations Committee meets on a quarterly basis to review requests from community organizations. Our sponsorships and donations support education, health and wellness, economic diversification, job creation, food banks and environmental conservation initiatives.\nAll New Gold sites continually seek opportunities to support community organizations and activities by, for example, promoting skills development, encouraging local entrepreneurship, and improving environmental stewardship.

In contrast, Hypersonix's SPARTAN scramjet is a hydrogen-fueled engine that operates at hypersonic speeds between Mach 5-12, using clean-burning hydrogen that allows the engine to switch on and off multiple times during flight for non-ballistic trajectory control.","context":["In what is claimed as the most significant development in aircraft design since the invention of wing warping by the Wright brothers, BAE Systems and the University of Manchester flew the MAGMA unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to demonstrate two innovative flow control technologies which could revolutionise future aircraft design.\nMAGMA, designed and developed by researchers at The University of Manchester in collaboration with engineers from BAE Systems, successfully trialled the two ‘flap-free’ technologies earlier this month at the Llanbedr Airfield, UK.\nThe technologies demonstrated in the trials were:\nWing Circulation Control: Taking air from the aircraft engine and blowing it supersonically through narrow slots around a specially shaped wing tailing edge in order to control the aircraft.\nFluidic Thrust Vectoring: Controlling the aircraft by blowing air jets inside the nozzle to deflect the exhaust jet and generate a control force.\nThe technologies have been designed to improve the control and performance of aircraft. By replacing moving surfaces with a simpler ‘blown air’ solution, the trials have paved the way for engineers to create better performing aircraft that are lighter, more reliable and cheaper to operate. The technologies could also improve an aircraft’s stealth as they reduce the number of gaps and edges that currently make aircraft more observable on radar.\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has begun to solicit for new materials and technology to accelerate R&D of hypersonic air vehicles and platforms. “The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of high performance leading edges for hypersonic air platforms,” US Department of Defense said Monday\nLockheed Martin has won a $28.5 million modification contract to exercise options for hypersonic booster technology development seeking to demonstrate technologies related to intermediate range capability through booster design, fabrication and validation testing\nSaab has received an order from the United States Government for X-band Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology.

US Patent Number US11639700B2 protects for close to 20 years some key features of an “Airframe integrated scramjet with fixed geometry and shape transition for hypersonic operation over a large Mach number range”. The air breathing and self-igniting scramjet engine invented by one of Hypersonix’s co-founders, Michael Smart, is able to accelerate between Mach 5 and Mach 12, depending on the selection of materials and manufacturing process chosen. This patent grows Hypersonix’s portfolio of patents to three, the other two being Australian innovation patents. Other features will also be covered as work progresses on our family of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.\nHypersonix’s unique design is fuelled by hydrogen, which has a higher ISP than other fuels used in Aerospace such as RP1 Kerosene. Apart from the Zero CO2 emissions non-polluting to the Earth’s atmosphere, clean burning hydrogen allows the engine to switch on and off several times during the flight, enabling a non-ballistic trajectory that cannot be achieved with conventional rockets, and also offers a longer range than other scramjets.\nSPARTAN’s fixed geometry is another unique feature which lends itself to rapid advanced manufacturing techniques. The first SPARTAN prototype was 3D printed in high temperature alloy material in December 2021 as part of an Accelerating Commercialisation Australia (ACA) grant awarded to Hypersonix.\nHypersonix also recently announced the completion of a manufacturing demonstrator using ceramic matrix composite (CMC) material for the SPARTAN engine which will allow the engine to withstand the higher temperatures expected at its top speed of Mach 12.\nHigh cadence flight and reusability are important aspects of the Hypersonix strategy. Hydrogen fuel is making this a reality as it burns cleanly, unlike other fuels such as Kerosene that leave residue, making it difficult to reuse quickly if at all. Whilst reusability is not a priority for other scramjet-powered hypersonic systems, it is a cornerstone of the Hypersonix product strategy.\nHypersonix’s ambition is to provide commercial solutions to the market for access to space and high-speed travel. Along the way Hypersonix has capitalised on the significant interest shown by Defence circles for the DART AE demonstrator flight vehicle in providing an advanced hypersonic test platform for collecting valuable data at hypersonic speeds.\nThanks to the SPARTAN design and the advanced manufacturing techniques and materials it uses, Hypersonix was selected for the Hypersonic & High-Cadence Airborne Test program (HyCAT), a solicitation by the Defense Innovation Unit in the US, part of the US Department of Defense (DoD) to deliver the DART AE flight vehicle.\nWhilst working with Defence as the first customer for Hypersonix, the company will pursue their commercial vision to apply their scramjet technology to develop a low cost and high cadence access to space solution for small satellites using green hydrogen, and in the longer term a hyperliner that may transport cargo and passengers from Sydney to New York City in just a few hours.\nDavid Waterhouse, Managing Director, Hypersonix added: “We are grateful for the DIU’s confidence in Hypersonix as our first customer so early in our history. Many technologies have found their first success in the Defence market before getting applied in the commercial world. And if there is one way for Hypersonix to grow the team faster in the current environment, the answer has to be to provide US Defence with unique capabilities.”\nMichael Smart said:” We are thrilled to have our original ideas recognised by a US patent for our SPARTAN scramjet design. Our team has already integrated my inventions and fresh ideas into various additional features that cement our technological leadership in hypersonic propulsion and flight.”\nHypersonix manufactures and operates hydrogen fuelled scramjet powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

{"question":"¿Cuáles son los dos tipos principales de equipos de mitigación que se utilizan para proteger contra problemas de calidad de energía eléctrica?","answer":"The two basic categories of power quality mitigation equipment are: 1) those that suppress the power-quality phenomena and 2) those that correct the phenomena. Suppressors include devices like TVSS (transient voltage surge suppressors), while corrective equipment includes devices like UPS (uninterruptible power supply) that add energy back into the voltage waveform.","context":["Casinos and hotels must keep the power flowing\nAny industry that depends on electricity to generate revenue knows that the quality of the electrical supply isn’t always what is needed to keep the revenue stream flowing. Depending on how large that revenue stream is determines how much effort is made in trying to keep it flowing, 24/7.\nThe hospitality/gaming/resorts industry is no exception. Walk into a casino at three in the morning and you would think that it is the afternoon. Having the stage lights flickering during a Broadway show would be distracting to both the performers and the audience (and could induce nausea or worse). Even to those potential winners in the long lines waiting for tickets to the Mega-Millions lottery draw would be quite upset if a power interruption resulted in the ticket machine going down, having them miss out on getting their lucky tickets. Here’s a take on which type of mitigation equipment is effective for which type of power-quality phenomena.\nTo determine what equipment to use is usually dictated by monitoring at the point of utilization to determine what is the quality of supply versus the susceptible load. The types of protection can be broken into two basic categories—those that suppress the power-quality (PQ) phenomena and those that correct the phenomena. Among the most common equipment used in the first category is TVSS or transient voltage surge suppressors. These are often found in outlet strips used to plug in PCs, monitors and printers and may be a mixture of MOV (metal oxide varistors), avalanche diodes, capacitors and other components that “snub” or “clamp” the over-voltage condition associated with positive impulsive transients.\nTake some precautions when using TVSS devices. First, they should be UL-listed and have an integral fuse, since some of the components are designed to fail in a short-circuit state if the transients are either too large or too repetitive. Second, they can only work on the positive portion of the transient. They do little for negative transients, such as notches, and provide no help for sags (or interruptions), which are normally far more common occurrences than transients.\nAnother type of mitigation equipment in this category is a harmonic filter, which are tuned circuits for specific harmonics that are considered to be too large in magnitude and cause problems in the facility, such as overheating transformers or other electromagnetic equipment. If the loads in the facility change quantity or frequency content (such as adding adjustable speed drives), it may require a redesign of the filter.\nThe second category of mitigation equipment includes equipment that add energy back into the voltage waveform to make up for either a decrease from a sag, or a total lack of voltage, from an interruption—for example, an automatic tap-changing transformer that returns the voltage level to the nominal voltage. Such equipment is also useful for overvoltage conditions. However, the speed at which the control circuits react is often multiple cycles, which may be too slow to keep equipment operational without some additional short-duration ride-through equipment.\nPerhaps the most commonly used equipment of this category is the UPS or uninterruptible power supply. UPS units are either of the continuous operation or bypass types. In the former, the AC supply is used to charge the batteries, which are used to continually convert the DC voltage back into AC voltage to power the loads. The latter uses a bypass switch to let the AC voltage pass straight through, except when the control circuits determine that the input AC voltage is too low. When running off the batteries, the overall efficiency is lower than in bypass; however, there is no transfer time, which may be a factor in the latter type. Batteries do have maintenance requirements, and there are other types of storage devices, such as flywheels or superconductive magnets, but battery-based UPS units are far more common.\nUPS equipment can only supply as much energy during sags or interruptions as was stored while the AC voltage was “normal.” Since the majority of sags are less than 10 cycles (in most surveys), this isn’t normally a problem. For longer-duration interruption protection, a back-up generator can be used by itself or in conjunction with UPS equipment. The generator may take several seconds to get up to the rated speed that is required to provide adequate voltage magnitudes at the rated frequency. A local generator is usually not as “stiff” a source as the generators on the interconnected electric utility grid. This can result in deeper sags for the same loads starting up, as well as changes in frequency when large loads are energized. And these, too, require a storage of energy—often diesel fuel—that need some adequate refill planning for sustained interruptions like August 14, 2003.\nFacilities that want to have “six 9s” of up-time (up 99.9999% of the time) often combine mitigation equipment. This doesn’t make them immune to PQ problems; proper integration is crucial. But with the right equipment, you can change the probability of a power-quality-related process interruption from luck, to an event as rare as winning the lottery."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f6e6c963-14da-4b94-9fc2-c5a7b2e926fe>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Como coleccionista de arte, me preocupa tanto proteger mis obras como entender mis derechos legales. ¿Cuáles son los pasos esenciales para asegurar una colección de arte y qué protección legal existe en casos de robo?","answer":"For protecting an art collection, it's essential to hire a certified expert appraiser who will document and assess each piece's value. This appraisal report is crucial for insurance purposes, as regular homeowners insurance provides only limited coverage (typically $1,500-$2,000) for valuables. Collectors need a specialized floater policy that covers risks like fire, theft, water damage, and accidental loss. Regarding legal protection in theft cases, the rights of original owners are protected through various legal frameworks. In the US, different states have different approaches - some start the statute of limitations at the time of theft, others use a 'discovery rule,' while New York applies a 'demand and refusal' rule that's most protective of original owners. However, when stolen art crosses borders, different laws may apply - some countries have prescription periods that can grant title to good faith purchasers of stolen objects after a certain time.","context":["Protecting Valuable Collections\nBy Sean Donahue\nIf you love art, antiques, fine wine, or other specialty items, you can spend years assembling a large collection of your favorite items. But what seems like a simple expression of your passion might also be a significant financial asset.\nUnfortunately, many collectors don’t take the important step of documenting and appraising the valuable items in their home. “Some collectors are quick to spend a lot of money on a painting, but are reluctant to spend a few hundred dollars to get that painting appraised,” says Barbara Rusoff, director of client services at New York Fine Art Appraisers.\nThat’s a big mistake. If you don’t document and appraise your collection, you won’t be able to obtain proper insurance coverage and you won’t have a clear picture of that collection as a tangible asset that you can sell, borrow against or include in the legacy you intend to leave for your heirs.\nThe inventory and appraisal process\nThe first step towards protecting your collection is to hire an expert appraiser to record the value of each item you own. Even if you follow the market closely and think you know what your items are worth, insurers and the Internal Revenue Service won’t take your word for it.\n“You cannot tell the insurance company that this is a $100,000 painting, or this is a $50,000 antique table,” says Rusoff. “They want that information in writing from an appraiser.”\nLook for an appraiser that specializes in your type of collection—some appraisers are experts in specific types of fine art; others focus on antiques or jewelry. And always select an appraiser certified by an organization such as the American Society of Appraisers or the International Society of Appraisers.\nThe appraiser will visit your home and examine each piece in your collection, as well as review receipts, previous appraisals, and other documentation that helps to establish an item’s authenticity and value. Be sure to tell the appraiser how you intend to use his or her assessment. For insurance purposes, you want a retail-replacement value appraisal, which covers the total cost to replace an item, including taxes, shipping, and even some inflation coverage. A fair-market value appraisal is used for estate planning and tax purposes, or for non-cash charitable contributions. These values are typically lower than retail, because they don’t include the costs associated with immediately replacing a lost or damaged item.\nBased on his or her research, your appraiser will write a complete appraisal report that lists each item and provides a detailed description of the piece, your history of ownership, and its value. The report may also include photos or video to help document those items.\nRequest at least two copies of the report—one to keep at home and one to keep at your office or in a safety deposit box. After all, you’ll need to easily recover that documentation in the event of a house fire or a natural disaster.\nThe inventory and appraisal report is required documentation if you want to properly insure your collection. Regular homeowners insurance policies provide only limited coverage for valuables such art or jewelry—typically about $1,500 to $2,000, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\nIf you have a collection that’s worth much more than that, you’ll need a floater policy to cover those items. Look for insurance companies that specialize in policies for fine art, antiques, jewelry, or other collectibles, and examine what risks are covered by their policies. You’ll want to protect your collection against fire, theft, water damage, and accidental loss or breakage.\nThen, provide your appraisers’ report to insurers to get quotes on different levels of coverage for those items. Rates will vary depending on the type of collection and where you live, but floaters typically cost between $.30 and $2.00 per $100 of insurance coverage, per year.\nPlan to update your appraisal every three years, or immediately after adding a significant new piece. Also keep tabs on major market changes, such as the death of an artist whose paintings you’ve been collecting, which might affect the value of your items. Once you’ve insured your collection and have the documentation to back up a potential claim, you’ll feel better knowing that the value of your items is protected.\nThe above content is provided for information purposes only.

I have previously discussed differing views on the repatriation of certain types of cultural property and the discussion is available here. This article is the first in a five-part series discussing restitution, repatriation, and return of cultural objects. Each part addresses a different category of return: (1) restitution of stolen cultural objects, (2) restitution of cultural objects taken during World War II, (3) restitution of illicitly excavated and/or illicitly exported cultural objects, (4) repatriation of tribal and indigenous cultural objects, and (5) the return of cultural objects removed during colonial occupation.\nRestitution of Stolen Cultural Objects\nOf what I identify as the five categories of claims for the return of cultural objects, the simplest of these, conceptually, is where the object has been stolen. We instinctually understand why the original owner would want the stolen object returned. Popular culture is sometimes ambivalent, though, regarding the theft of art as both glamorous and, to some extent, unserious. Art, in this context, is a luxury good. The art heist is a familiar film trope, generally light-hearted (i.e., Gambit (Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine, 1966, remade in 2012, with Colin Firth, Cameron Diaz, and Alan Rickman), Topkapi (Maximilian Schell, Melina Mercouri, Peter Ustinov, Robert Morley, and George Segal, 1964), How to Steal a Million (Peter O’Toole and Audrey Hepburn, 1966), or The Thomas Crown Affair (Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, 1968, remade in 1999, with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo), though sometimes considerably harsher (i.e., Headhunters (Aksel Hennie, Synnove Macody Lund, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau 2011) and Trance (James McAvoy, Rosario Dawson, and Vincent Cassel, 2013)). In its light-hearted variation, the art heist is perpetrated by a dashing, raffish thief (often a playboy, engaged in a dual life). After plot complications and reversals, the thief, on the verge of his (or her) identity being revealed, outwits the lumbering authorities, and escapes with the artwork, and usually his (or her) romantic interest. The harsher variation, after complications and reversals, typically ends less happily.\nOff-screen, art theft is less dashing and less romantic, and it often involves (at some level) criminal networks. Among the highest-profile thefts from museums are: (1) the brief theft of the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911, taken by museum handyman Vincenzo Peruggia, who attempted to return the painting to Italy (the irony being that the painting had never been unlawfully removed from Italy); (2) the 1990 theft of 13 works (including paintings by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Degas and Manet) from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, which remains unsolved and the works unrecovered, although the FBI has identified persons of interest in the case, all of whom have ties to organized crime; (3) the 2002 theft of two paintings from Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum, in which thieves entered the museum through the roof; the thieves were later arrested and convicted of the theft, but the paintings have not been recovered; and (4) the 2012 theft of seven paintings (including works by Freud, Gauguin, Matisse, Monet and Picasso) from Rotterdam’s Kunsthal Museum, taken by a group of Romanian thieves, and allegedly incinerated by the mother of one of the thieves to destroy evidence after the group had been arrested.\nMuseums are not the only targets of art theft. Cultural objects are perhaps even more frequently taken from private collections and other types of historic and cultural institutions. A few recent examples highlight how most art thefts are not the glamorous, highly-planned affairs of film, but tend to be crimes of opportunity, often by those who simply happen (for different purposes) to have access to the objects. In 2009, 12 paintings, including works by Marc Chagall, Chaim Soutine, Arshile Gorky, and Diego Rivera, were stolen from a residence in southern California. Nine of the paintings, reportedly valued at $12 million, were later recovered. In 2011, a 12th century illuminated musical manuscript, the Codex Calixtinus, was discovered missing from the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. The manuscript had been taken by a former electrician, who had been engaged in an on-going series of thefts from the cathedral, having taken, in addition to the manuscript, more than €2.4 million in cash. The thief was recently convicted and sentenced to a 10-year prison term. Still another workman (another electrician, even) with opportunistic access to artworks has also made news recently, although the theft occurred decades ago. An electrician who worked for Pablo Picasso at his house in Mougins, France, and the electrician’s wife, are currently on trial for stealing 271 artworks from the Picasso house, which the couple then stored in their garage for 37 years. The Picasso works are valued at between €60 and €80 million.\nWhether taken from museums or from private collections, when stolen objects are sold, they are moved through progressively higher-level intermediaries, cleansing them of information about the original owner and the circumstances of the theft. [See Interpol website, frequently asked questions] With the passage of time, the stolen object is sold (possibly several times), and the current owner may have innocently purchased the object, with no inkling that its history is tainted. This situation is sometimes spoken of as involving “two innocents” – the original owner from whom the object was taken and the good faith purchaser with no knowledge of the theft.\nTypical of such cases is Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation v. Lubell, in which the Guggenheim Museum sought return of a 1912 gouache by Marc Chagall that had been taken from the museum’s storage area by a mailroom employee in the late 1960s. While the museum had discovered the gouache was missing during a periodic inventory, it did not notify law enforcement of the theft, concerned that publicizing the theft would drive it underground and make its recovery unlikely.\nThe gouache was purchased by art collectors, the Lubells, from a gallery in 1967, and displayed it in their apartment for many years. The museum discovered that the Lubells owned the gouache in 1985, and wrote to the Lubells, demanding its return. In the litigation that followed, the Lubells argued that the museum had no right to the gouache because New York’s three-year statute of limitations for the return of stolen objects had run. Just as states have different statutes of limitations that cut off a property owner’s right to sue for the return of a stolen object (to discourage stale claims), states also have different rules governing when a cause of action for recovery accrues and the limitations period begins to run. In the U.S., there are three approaches to when a cause of action for replevin accrues, and each approaches gives different weight to the rights of the original owner and the rights of the current possessor. In the most favorable to the rights of the current possessor, the statute of limitations begins to run at the time of the theft. Most states, however, apply the “discovery rule,” under which the limitations period begins to run only when the original owner learns the location of the object and the identity of the current possessor. New York, however, is still more protective of the rights of the original owner, and applies the “demand and refusal” rule, so that the limitations period does not begin to run until the original owner makes demand upon the current possessor for the return of the object and the current possessor refuses that demand.\nIn Lubell, however, the trial court applied a variation on New York’s demand and refusal rule, requiring that the original owner show that it had diligently attempted to locate the object. The trial court granted the Lubells’ motion for summary judgment, holding that “in order to avoid prejudice to a good faith purchaser, demand cannot be unreasonably delayed and that a property owner has an obligation to use reasonable efforts to locate its missing property to ensure that demand is not so delayed.” In so doing, the trial court relied on a prior decision by the United States Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit, DeWeerth v. Baldinger, which had required diligence on the part of an original owner. The DeWeerth court had reasoned that:\nA rule requiring reasonable diligence in attempting to locate stolen property is especially appropriate with respect to stolen art. Much art is kept in private collections, unadvertised and unavailable to the public. An owner seeking to recover such property will almost never learn of its whereabouts by chance. Yet the location of stolen art may frequently be discovered through investigation.\nIn Lubell, the New York Court of Appeals ultimately rejected both the trial court’s holding and the Second Circuit’s holding in DeWeerth. The court held that “[o]ur case law already recognizes that the true owner, having discovered the location of its lost property, cannot unreasonably delay making demand upon the person in possession of that property. Here, however, where the demand and refusal is a substantive and not a procedural element of the cause of action . . . it would not be prudent to extend that case law and impose the additional duty of diligence before the true owner has reason to know where its missing chattel is to be found.”\nStatutes of limitations are not the only form of limitation that may apply, since many countries apply prescription periods that operate to vest title in good faith purchasers (even of stolen objects) after a designated period of time. Since cultural objects frequently cross borders, the mere fact that suit is brought in a jurisdiction (like the U.S.) that does not have such prescription periods and in which even a good faith purchaser cannot obtain good title to a stolen object, does not mean that such a period will not apply. In Winkworth v. Christie, Manson & Woods Ltd, certain artworks were stolen from a collector in England and were taken to Italy, where they were sold to an apparently innocent purchaser. [See Winkworth v. Christie, Manson & Woods Ltd.,  Ch. 496 ,  1 All E.R. 1121]. Later, that purchaser consigned the artworks to an auction house in London for sale. The collector from whom the objects had been taken brought suit in England for their recovery. Under English law, a thief cannot transfer good title, and had English law applied to Mr. Winkworth’s case, he would have prevailed and the objects would have been returned to him. However, the court determined that the question of whether the seller had obtained good title to the objects when he purchased them in Italy was governed by Italian (not English) law. Under Italian law, a good faith purchaser can obtain good title even to stolen objects.\nA similar case arose in New York, where the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem sought recovery of the Archimedes Palimpsest, a 10th century manuscript, which had been taken from Patriarchate at some point in the past.[See The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem v. Christie’s, Inc., No. 98 Civ. 7664(KMW), 1999 WL 673347 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 1999)]. The manuscript’s current possessor was the heirs of a French civil servant, who had acquired it in France in the 1920s. Under French law, a good faith purchase obtains good title to a stolen object after 30 years. The heirs consigned the manuscript to an auction house in New York, and the Patriarchate brought suit there. As in Winkworth, the Archimedes court found that the question of whether the French civil servant’s heirs had good title to the manuscript was governed by French law, not U.S. law.\nAlthough courts have tightened the availability of statute of limitations defenses in stolen art cases, current possessors of stolen (or allegedly stolen) art are increasingly making use of the equitable defense of laches, which operates very similarly to statutes of limitations in cutting off an original owner’s right to bring suit for the recovery of an object if (i) the original owner has unreasonably delaying bringing suit, and (ii) that delay has resulted in prejudice to the current owner (chiefly, resulting in lack of evidence or witnesses). Many of the most significant developments in the application of laches defenses in recent art cases have been in the area of claims for the restitution of cultural objects that were taken (by the Nazis or otherwise) during World War II, and so I will discuss those developments more fully in the next installment of this series.\n See Menzel v. List, 267 N.Y.S.2d 804, 809 (Sup. Ct. 1966) (“The resolution of these problems is made the more difficult in view of the fact that one of two innocent parties must bear the loss.”), modified, 279 N.Y.S.2d 608 (App. Div. 1967) (per curiam), modification rev’d, 246 N.E.2d 742 (N.Y. 1969).

{"question":"Which animals besides primates have successfully passed the mirror self-recognition test?","answer":"Several non-primate species have passed the mirror self-recognition test. These include Asian elephants (though not all tested individuals passed), bottlenose dolphins, orca whales, Eurasian magpies (the first non-mammalian species to pass), and some ants. The ants showed self-recognition behavior by attempting to clean blue dots placed near their mouths when seeing themselves in mirrors.","context":["The mirror test—sometimes called the mark test, mirror self-recognition (MSR) test, red spot technique, or rouge test—is a behavioural technique developed in 1970 by American psychologist Gordon Gallup Jr. as an attempt to determine whether an animal possesses the ability of visual self-recognition.The MSR test is the traditional method for attempting to measure self-awareness. However, agreement has been reached that animals can be self-aware in ways not measured by the mirror test, such as distinguishing between their own and others' songs and scents. Conversely, animals that can pass the MSR do not necessarily have self-awareness.\nIn the classic MSR test, an animal is anaesthetised and then marked (e.g., painted or a sticker attached) on an area of the body the animal cannot normally see. When the animal recovers from the anaesthetic, it is given access to a mirror. If the animal then touches or investigates the mark, it is taken as an indication that the animal perceives the reflected image as itself, rather than of another animal.\nWHAT ANIMALS CAN RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES :\nAsian elephants display a wide range of reactionary behaviors when they see their reflections in mirrors, and will respond to colored markings placed in-view on their bodies. However, not all of the elephants in a study2 by Joshua M. Plotnik passed. This might be because the normal behavior of elephants conflicts with what passing the mirror test requires. “\nThe mark test can be difficult to apply across species because it assumes that a particular animal will be interested in something weird on their body. Primates are interested in such things—we’re groomers. But elephants are different. They’re huge and they’re used to putting things on, not taking things off of their bodies, like mud and dirt.” said Plotnik.3\nThe Great Apes\nBonobos, chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas have all passed the mirror test.4,1,5 However, it isn’t uncommon for many individuals to fail, especially if they are particularly young or old. In chimpanzees, there is evidence for self-recognition in about 75% of young adults.6 This percentage lowers with individuals closer to either end of the age spectrum.\nMany gorillas have failed the mirror test. When shown a mirror, a number of silverbacks have exhibited aggressive behavior. It has been speculated that most of the gorillas and other primates who do not pass the test may have inhibited behavior due to the presence of observing humans.\n“Ironically, it may have been the gorillas’ very capacity for self-consciousness that prevented them from exhibiting behaviours indicative of self-recognition in the test situation.”7\nAdditionally, gorillas will often avoid eye contact with their reflection. By avoiding eye contact, gorillas are likely not able to look at their reflection long enough to realize that it is themselves who they are seeing. Koko the gorilla, well known for having learned sign language and performing well in other cognitive experiments, was the first of her species to pass the test.\nBottlenose dolphins usually show extreme interest when they catch sight of their reflections. They will open their mouths, stick out their tongues, and make a series of novel movements while observing themselves in the mirror. When marked, dolphins regularly inspect the marking.8\nIn a study9, orca whales were allowed to view themselves in a mirror. Afterward, they were marked, then allowed to view themselves in the mirror once more. Their behavior showed that they expected the image would be altered as a result of their being marked – a strong indication that they understand the image in the mirror is indeed of themselves.\nThe Eurasian magpie is the first non-mammalian species to pass the mirror test.10 When contrasting colored stickers were placed on their feathers, the magpies reacted to their reflections by trying to remove the mark. Birds who were marked with invisible stickers showed no altered behavior.\nPrior to this experiment, scientists believed that self-recognition abilities came from the neocortex, a part of the brain found only in mammals. Since magpies are birds, they do not have this part of the brain. Magpies passing the mirror test shows that the ability of self-recognition can arise from different brain parts in other types of brains. It’s a case of “convergent evolution”. This happens when similar abilities, behaviors, and traits independently evolve in species that are not closely related.\nIn 2015, scientists published research11 that suggests some ants can recognize themselves when looking in a mirror. When viewing other ants through glass, ants didn’t divert from their normal behaviors.\nHowever, their behavior did change when they were put in front of a mirror. The ants would move slowly, turn their heads back and forth, shake their antennae, and touch the mirror. They’d retreat and re-approach the mirror. Sometimes they would groom themselves.\nThe ants were next given a classic mirror test. The team of researchers would use blue dots to mark the clypeus of some of the ants, which is a part of their face near their mouths.\nWhen in an environment without mirrors, these ants would behave normally, and wouldn’t touch the markings. But this changed when they could see their reflections in a mirror. The ants with blue dots on their face would groom and appear to try to remove the markings.\nVery young ants, and other ants with brown dots that blended in with the color of their face didn’t clean themselves. Interestingly, neither did ants with blue dots put on the back of their heads.\nWhen put in the company of those with blue-dotted faces, other ants would respond aggressively, presumably because the difference caused them to think the blue-dotted ant was an outsider (not a member of their colony). All of this lead the researchers to conclude that the clypeus is a species-specific physical characteristic that is important for group acceptance.\nGiven that these ants tried to clean the mark rather than respond aggressively, the ants likely didn’t think their reflection was just another ant. The team thinks their study shows that self-recognition is not an “unrealistic” ability in ants.\nPromising Candidates: Manta Rays\nWhen it comes to fish, manta rays have the largest brains. This fact lead Dr. Csilla Ari to suspect that they might be the fish species most likely to pass the mirror test.12, 13 When she exposed captive manta rays to a large mirror, they showed great interest in their reflections.\nThe rays would repeatedly swim in front of the mirror, turning over to show their undersides and moving their fins. When in front of the mirror, they even blew bubbles, an unusual behavior. What the rays didn’t do is try to socially interact with the mirror image.\nAll of this suggests that the rays might recognize it’s themselves they’re seeing in the mirror, not another ray. However, a classic mirror test using marks on the rays’ bodies has yet to be done. If rays can pass a mark test, it’s a more solid indication of self-recognition abilities. The presence of exploratory behavior and a lack of social behavior doesn’t automatically indicate self-recognition."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e3ae8247-35af-42d6-a59c-5685e442116a>"],"error":null}

Lokoya produces minute quantities of appellation specific Cabernet Sauvignon from low vigor vineyard sites in the Napa Valley. View all Lokoya Wines\nAbout Napa Valley\nIt's hard not to think of Napa Valley when thinking of California wines. The region is, after all, the one that brought world recognition to California wine making. The area was settled by a few choice wine families in the 1960's who bet that the wines of the area would grow and flourish. They were right. The Napa wine industry really took off in the 1980's, when vineyard lands were scooped up and vines were planted throughout the county. A number of wineries emerged, from large conglomerates to small boutiques to cult classics. Cabernet Sauvignon is definitely the grape of choice here, with many winemakers also focusing on Bordeaux Blends. Whites are usually Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.\nNotable FactsWithin the Napa Valley lie smaller sub-AVAs that lend even more character specifics to the wines. Furthest south is Carneros, followed by Yountville, Oakville & Rutherford. Above those two is St.-Helena and finally, just grated an AVA, Calistoga. These areas are situated on the valley floor and are known for creating rich, smooth Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Chardonnay. There are a few mountain regions as well, nestled on the slopes overlooking the valley AVAs. Those include Howell Mountain, Stags Leap and Mount Veeder. Wines from the mountain regions are often more structured and firm, benefiting from more time in the bottle to evolve and soften.\nAbout CaliforniaIt's not rare to see a wine's country of origin listed as \"California.\" A country into itself in the wine world, California makes enough varieties and styles to match many European wine countries. It produces a diverse range of wines that span the quality spectrum.\nThe most famous of the California wine regions is Napa Valley, and these wines are certainly outstanding – but it's not as broad and diverse as its larger neighbor, Sonoma County. Down south, Santa Barbara's Santa Maria Valley is well-known for its Rhône blends, as well as cool-climate varieties like Pinot and Chardonnay. The Central Coast, the largest California AVA, has many different microclimates that lead to a wide range of wines with many sub-AVAs.\nCustomer ReviewsSign In to Add Your Review0 }div>\nAlcohol By Volume GuideMost wine ranges from 10-16% alcohol by volume.

{"question":"Could you explain how winter aerial photos specifically help in identifying potential deer bedding areas?","answer":"Winter aerial photos are particularly useful for identifying deer bedding areas because they make it easier to spot pine thickets, where deer often bed during winter. Pine thickets appear distinctly in winter photos, and these areas are typically very thick, making them preferred bedding locations for deer. This can be confirmed by ground verification after identifying these areas in aerial photos.","context":["These days, many hunters do not have the luxury of scouting for deer on pieces of land by foot for one reason or another. Maybe you can but don’t have much time and need to make the trip as productive as possible. Whatever your reason may be, using aerial maps can dramatically decrease the amount of time you need to spend with boots on the ground scouting for deer. By using aerial maps, you will be able to key in on the best areas that are most likely to produce good stand sites. Think of it this way; looking at an aerial is like looking at a road map, but for deer. Using the map, even a complete beginner can identify things like funnels and water sources. With a little practice you can also identify likely bedding and/or feeding areas depending on where you hunt.\nScouting for Deer Funnels using Aerial Maps\nThe thing that is usually pretty easy to identify with an aerial map is funnels. Funnels are a huge help to deer hunters in that a funnel will pinch deer down in a certain area which allows you to take advantage of their preference for traveling through cover rather than out in the open. In the center of the photo above, I found a funnel that I hunted last year in a suburban area. This funnel produced so much deer traffic that it was tough to decide when head in to the stand. Deer are constantly using that funnel to go back and forth between two very good bedding and feeding areas. An average sit on this funnel would produce 21 deer sightings. Below, you’ll find the a much closer view of the funnel with the preferred stand location. I was not able to put a stand here because I could not get permission from the owner, but I had a great view of just how good the spot could have been. Instead, I was able to hunt a couple existing stands set up on the neighboring property which still allowed me to mostly take advantage of the funnel.\nNot only does this this area provide a funnel, but there is also the added benefit of the creek to help make the funnel that much better. The easiest place to cross that creek is actually right where the woods meet smack dab in the skinniest portion of the funnel. If you count, there are 5 different lines of cover change that all meet right there. Along the road cutting through the East side of the photo are Pear trees and the neighbor that owns the land the actual funnel is on also puts out things to feed the birds that the deer can’t get enough of. In this one little area the deer have food, water, and bedding. Finding areas like this are not all that difficult and the only thing that I would have to walk the area for is the Pear trees. Every other bit of information was recovered using aerial photos.\nFinding Potential bedding Areas\nThis area is not quite as easy, but still not difficult to figure out. Often, deer are going to bed in thicker areas, especially during the winter. One way to pick out where deer will likely bed is to look at previous aerial photos of the area in winter to identify the pine thickets. In the photo below, I’ve done just that. It’s a winter photo of an area that has a couple different pine thickets. After identifying them on the aerial photo, I was able to walk them and confirm that deer do in fact bed in those areas and they are super thick.\nThis photo was taken quite a few years ago, but it’s the last winter photo taken for me to be able to see these areas. I also used winter photos to make it easier to see the funnel and the creek in the previous example. To know that there were bedding areas around the funnel, I used a summer photo confirm that the area off to the right of the funnel is a CRP field, providing a great bedding area. There is also a slew on the other side of the road that provides great bedding opportunities.\nBy using a combination of summer and winter aerial photos of the areas I will be hunting, I am able to get a great idea of what that property can provide in terms of hunting opportunity without ever having to step foot on the land. I was able to identify a major funnel and bedding on one piece of land and identify a few different bedding areas on another property. This information is extremely valuable because I now know what areas to try and avoid on my scouting mission if I don’t want to disturb the deer and identify areas that I need to go in and take a closer look at to confirm suspicions. If you don’t have the time to do some boots on the ground scouting, looking at aerial maps of the area can provide a great opportunity to pick a spot blind. This can be especially useful if you are going to hunt an area out of state or far away and wont be able to scout prior to being there to hunt. The next time you are planning a trip to go out scouting for deer, try taking a look at an aerial photo or two before heading out. It just might save you some time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:23ad2ad5-01b8-4f07-a39c-3fd77be311d2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which dental procedure is more comprehensive in addressing aesthetic issues - veneers or dental bonding?","answer":"Veneers are more comprehensive, as they can address multiple aesthetic issues including permanently stained teeth, spaces between teeth (diastemas), misaligned teeth, and damaged or broken teeth due to decay or injury. While dental bonding can also address some cosmetic issues like gaps, cracks, discoloration, and crooked teeth, it is typically used for simpler fixes and is often part of other treatments rather than a complete solution on its own.","context":["Veneers are a simple and relatively quick and cost effective method of improving your smile via a non invasive procedure typically completed over two appointments. Veneers are basically a thin layer of tooth coloured material which is shaped and then placed over your existing tooth to mask the underlying enamel whilst maintaining a natural appearance.\nVeneers are designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth by:\n- Masking permanently stained teeth\n- Closing Diastemas – spaces between your teeth\n- Straightening misaligned teeth\n- Improving the appearance of damaged or broken teeth due to decay or injury\nThe process of shaping and applying veneers is completed over two consecutive visits. The first part of the procedure involves the dentist removing a small amount of enamel from the front of your tooth and during the second appointment the veneers are fitted into place.Each veneer is individually handcrafted by our dental technician to correct the appearance of your teeth and to create a natural smile.\nPrior to selecting veneers as your preferred solution, you may elect to have a consultation appointment, where you can discuss with the dentist any concerns you have with your teeth and explain how you would like them improved.\nYour dentist can make a ‘Diagnostic wax up’ which is essentially a model made of your teeth to show how your teeth will look once veneers are applied. During this is procedure the dentist will take impressions (mould) of your teeth and these will then be sent to the laboratory. Our technician will then make a cast of your teeth using the supplied impressions (moulds). Dental wax is then applied to the cast, to show how the final veneers will look.\nIf you decide that veneers are for you, two further appointments are then needed. The first appointment is when the dentist prepares the teeth and then a second is to fit the veneers.\nThe Preparation Appointment\n- The dentist will give you a local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and the surrounding gum\n- A small amount of tooth is removed from the front surface of your tooth to make room for the veneers. The dentist will do this using a fast hand drill\n- An impression (mould) is taken of your teeth using special dental \"putty\". The putty is placed into an impression tray; they are both then inserted into your mouth and pushed onto your teeth in order to take an impression. Once the dental putty is set the impression will be removed. An impression is also taken of the opposing teeth, so the technician can see how you bite together\n- The dentist may fit temporary veneers to protect the teeth whilst your veneers are being fabricated\n- The impression (mould) of your teeth is sent to the Dental Laboratory where each veneer will be handcrafted to create your new smile. This process can take between two and three weeks\nThe Fit Appointment\n- Your temporary veneers will be removed and your teeth will be washed to remove any remaining cement\n- Your new veneers will be temporarily placed using a special paste which will allow the dentist to make any adjustments that are required and to make sure that you are happy with the appearance\n- The veneers will then be removed and the tooth surface prepared for the dental adhesive. The veneers will be permanently cemented in place to create the beautiful smile you have been waiting for\nVeneers do require some care to maintain\nWhilst they can last a long time, this really is depending on how you treat them. Poor habits such as biting pencils, pens or even biting your nails, can have a detrimental effect on veneers over time. Of course, once installed you must maintain a consistent oral hygiene regime which includes brushing and flossing twice a day and regular 6 monthly examinations with your dentists to monitor your overall dental health and the condition of your veneers.","How Much Does Dental Bonding Cost?\nIf you visit your dentist regularly, at some point or another you have probably received a dental boding treatment. Not sure what dental bonding is? The dental bonding procedure is when either bonding adhesive or composite material is permanently secured to your teeth. Dental bonding treatment is used for a variety of reasons, from cosmetic fixes to treating cavities. If your dentist has recently recommended you may need a dental bonding treatment, you may be wondering how much the bonding treatment will cost. Below is a more information on dental bonding treatment and some tips on how to cover the cost.\nTypes of Bonding\nThere are two types of dental bonding that are commonly used in a variety of dental treatments.\nDirect composite bonding is when a neutral tooth-colored composite putty is applied directly to the teeth to fill cavities, fix chips, or minimize space between teeth. Direct composite bonding can be performed in one dental visit and can be an inexpensive treatment approach to fix gaps, cracks, discoloration, and crooked teeth.\nAdhesive bonding is when material is attached to the teeth using an etchant. An etchant is an adhesive material. The etchant is securely attached through a curing process, using a high intensity light. Adhesive bonding is more commonly used to attach veneers, bridges, and crowns in the mouth.\nThe Bonding Process\nDental bonding treatment can be quickly completed in one dental visit. Prior to the bonding, a rubber dam is placed in the mouth to keep the treatment area dry and allow access to the area without interference. Next, a phosphoric solution is applied to prepare the surface of the teeth for the bonding. The teeth are now ready for either the direct composite bonding or the adhesive bonding treatment.\nDental Bonding Costs\nApproximating the costs of a dental bonding treatment can be difficult due to the various factors that will impact the cost. This estimation is further complicated by the fact that the dental bonding procedure is usually performed in combination with other treatments. Dental bonding is commonly part of an elective or cosmetic treatment and not based on need. If the bonding treatment is elective, cosmetic dental insurance plans may not fully cover the treatment costs. Some of the other factors that impact the costs of dental bonding treatment include:\n* Your dentist’s training and years of experience\n* The geographic location where your dentist is located\n* Type of bonding treatment used and purpose of treatment\nDental bonding that is needed with composite veneers usually costs between $300 and $700 for each veneer. However, the installation of porcelain veneers using bonding may cost on average between $600 and $1,500 for each veneer. If you are trying to estimate the costs of the bonding treatment you need, the best place to start is to have a discussion with your dentist. After you talk with your dentist you may also want to contact your dental insurance provider to determine if dental bonding is covered by your plan or if you have to pay out of pocket for the treatment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d7c1f0c8-9681-4b39-b0f3-17030e19d1a2>","<urn:uuid:65080af2-b4dd-4b23-b876-64d476220f2c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which architectural features characterize the Queen Anne style that became popular in Leicester during the 1870s?","answer":"The Queen Anne style is characterized by tall sash windows, ornate chimneys, decoration with tiles or ornamental carvings, and asymmetric gables. This style was influenced by English mid-17th century brick houses under Dutch influence.","context":["Photo: reliefs depicting the life and adventures of Thomas Cooke on the side of the Thomas Cooke building in Leicester city centre.\nIf you have lived in Leicester for any amount of time you may not know about the Goddard architectural dynasty, but you will certainly have seen their buildings.\nFrom the Clocktower through churches, houses and schools, generations of the Goddard practice have helped to shape the face of Leicester. The story of the Goddards is told very well in 'Men of Property - The Goddards and Six Generations of Architecture' by Geoff Brandwood and Martin Cherry, and anyone wanting to know more about the practice and the buildings it designed should read this book.\nJoseph Goddard (b.1751) came to Leicester from Kirby Muxloe and settled around Belgrave Gate. Henry Goddard was born in 1792, an era before the idea of an architect, as we know it, existed. Like Joseph, he would have to have been a jack of all trades - carpentry, surveying, etc. - and in 1807 he was articled to father.\nPhoto: The Fish and Quart Pub.\nHenry's first known work was in 1817 when he designed some tenements in Belgrave Gate for his father. Various other houses and farm buildings followed including the Fish and Quart pub in 1832.\nIn 1840 Henry's son Joseph was born and 16 years later he was articled to his father (this story is complicated slightly by the main characters all having the first names Henry or Joseph – so pay attention!).\nThe 1860s saw an upturn in the fortunes of the practice and in 1862 Joseph became a partner in the firm, but a few years later in 1868 Henry died and Joseph was in business by himself.\nPhoto: Tur Langton Church\nBuildings of this period include Tur Langton church 1865-6 and the Clocktower 1868, and Joseph often worked in a Gothic style, as in the schools of the 1860s and '70s. Up to this point a lot of the practice's work was church restoration, but things became more varied into the 1870s.\nPhoto: Tintern House\nJoseph became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1871, the same year as he designed Tintern House. The Leicestershire Banking Co HQ followed in 1872-4 and marked the high point and end of his use of Gothic for secular work.\nIn 1874 AH Paget became a partner in the practice, which became known as Goddard & Paget. Joseph became President of the Leicester & Leicestershire Society of Architects in 1879-81 and buildings of this period including Brookfield 1876-7, the first use of half-timbering in Leicester and a pointer to the Domestic Revival of the future.\nAround this time there was a definite movement among younger architects away from the Victorian Gothic towards an eclectic pick and mix of styles influenced by the Renaissance and traditional English housing.\nPhoto: Knighton Spinneys\nThere was a need for change and from 1875 'Queen Anne' elements were introduced into some of Goddard and Paget's buildings, and the Domestic Revival was exemplified by Goddard's own house, Knighton Spinneys 1886.\nThe commercial buildings of the practice were also being influenced by the arrival in 1888 of Joseph's son, Henry, in the practice, which became known as Goddard, Paget & Goddard.\nPhoto: Thomas Cook building\nHenry had toured Europe and now brought a Renaissance enthusiasm to bear, resulting in buildings such as the Thomas Cook offices 1894, the General News Room 1898, and several Jacobean-style houses in both city and county. This influence was also present in Henry's St James the Greater , Leicester 1914 (although designs go back as far as 1895).\nThe versatility of the practice in this period is demonstrated by churches such as Melbourne Hall 1880-81 and St John the Baptist 1884-5.\nPaget retired around 1897 and WA Catlow became a partner - the practice became Goddard & Co. Catlow designed the Tudor Hotel in 1900-01. Joseph Goddard died in 1900 and after this the practice came to specialise in country house work, such as the houses built in Horninghold 1905-1913.\nIn 1914 Henry went to fight in France and the practice did little during the war. However, his son Henry continued the family business, as does Anthony Goddard to this day.\nA Guide to Architectural Styles in Leciester\nThroughout this trail references are made to styles of architecture such as 'Gothic', 'Baroque' etc. Many buildings combine elements from different styles and below is a very brief, and very simple, guide to what these expressions mean. For a more detailed look at buildings, architects and the history of architecture try this architecture site\nArts and Crafts - influenced by Willam Morris this movement reacted against cheap mass-produced buildings and decorating materials by advocating a return to high quality materials and hand-made excellence in all fields of art and decoration - furniture, textiles, wallpaper etc.\nPhoto: Gimson's White House\nAn example of the simplicity admired by this school is Gimson's White House in Leicester, 1898. Buildings often mixed Arts and Crafts with elements from the English Vernacular, Old English, or Queen Anne styles.\nBaroque - the origin of the term 'baroque' is uncertain but buildings in this style may display exuberant decoration, expansive curved shapes, rich colours, large-scale, sweeping vistas, and spatially complex compositions.\nPhoto: the General News Room.\nThe English didn't really take this style to heart and here it was often tempered with classical elements. Think of Blenheim Palace nationally or, on a much smaller scale, Leicester's General News Room , 1898, which combines baroque and classical elements.\nClassical - the principles of Greek or, more often, Roman art and architecture. Georgian classicism was most heavily influenced by Palladianism - understated decorative elements and use of classical 'orders' such as Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian.\nPhoto: New Walk\nThis began in the 1750s as a reaction against the excesses of late baroque. New Walk has several buildings in a variety of Classical styles, while there is a simple classical building, c.1750, in Friars Lane.\nDomestic Revival - the English vernacular revival applied to houses. Medieval or Tudor styles - half-timbering, overhanging gables.\nGoddard's Knighton Spinneys , 1885, is an example of this, and the council houses at 317-355 Narborough Rd, 1928, also show this influence.\nGothic - known in the Middle Ages as the 'French Style', medieval architecture was critically attacked in the 16th century and compared to the barbarism of the Goths who had attacked Rome - hence 'Gothic'.\nThink of buildings with strong vertical lines, high vaulted ceilings, pointed window and door openings, and buttressed walls. From 1066 architectural style in England moved from Anglo-Saxon to Norman (also called Romanesque). Gothic elements were added to Romanesque buildings in a Transitional stage, occasionally called Norman Gothic, and from around 1200 the history of the style in England is usually divided into three phases - Early English Gothic, Decorated Gothic, PerpendicularGothic - each of which shows an evolution in style.\nThe Victorian Gothic revival began in earnest around 1840, a good example being the Palace of Westminster, London. High Victorian Gothic, such as the Albert Memorial in London or Leicester's Clocktower ,1868, became very popular in the mid to late 1800s.\nQueen Anne - buildings shaped by English mid-17th century brick houses under Dutch influence. This style became popular at the beginning of the 1870s and Leicester was, for a change, being quite modern when it commissioned the Town Hall in the Queen Anne style in 1876.\nPhoto: Leicester Town Hall\nHowever, architects often combined Queen Anne elements with other styles and two buildings as seemingly different as the Aylestone Nursing Home 1878, and The Tudor 1900-01, may be said to be Queen Anne influenced and yet share only a few features with the Town Hall.\nPhoto: Aylestone Nursing Home.\nFeatures of the style include tall sash windows, ornate chimneys, decoration with tiles or ornamental carvings,and asymmetric gables. It was a style often used for the Board schools of the late 1800s.\nThis trail is part of a larger trail that explores the architecture of the Goddard family in Leicester, it can be found on the East Midland Oral History Archive. www.le.ac.uk/emoha/leicester/goddardindex.html\nTo find out more about architecture of Leicester visit the Sound and Vision website, an off-shoot of the East Midland Oral History Archive."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a8636719-8236-420f-bd26-313fb0c112a5>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What role do indoor air purification methods and immune system supplements play in managing seasonal allergies?","answer":"Indoor air purification methods include HEPA air filtration systems that effectively trap allergens like pollen and mold, with additional UV light systems that can kill microorganisms in the HVAC system. These can be complemented with immune system supplements such as Proligna Pine Cone Extract, which boosts dendritic cell development and reduces IgE, black cumin seed oil for immune balancing, and Pycnogenol which reduces hay fever symptoms. The combination of proper air filtration and immune-supporting supplements helps address both environmental triggers and the body's immune response to allergens.","context":["Natural Allergy Solutions\n(Featured as a Two-Part Article in Lifestyles 55)\nWhile most Winnipeggers are happy to have survived another winter, spring can make many allergy sufferers wish winter had stayed around a bit longer.\nWith the annual awakening of vegetation that had been dormant or covered in snow, along come the most common seasonal allergies like hay fever. Also called allergic rhinitis, hay fever is usually triggered by weed or grass pollen, although dust mites, mold, and pet dander can also be causes.\nExposure to allergens doesn't cause a reaction with most people they're usually harmless. Allergy symptoms occur when the body mistakes these particles as invaders, setting off a strong reaction and production of the antibody immunoglobulin-E. The next time you are exposed to that allergen, your immune system causes specialized mast cells to release various chemicals including histamine. These reaction chemicals produce the classic allergy symptoms including congestion, itchy eyes, sneezing, and mucus production.\nA troubling aspect for many older people is that allergens that have never produced a reaction in the past can become a trigger later in life. As we age, it is critical to keep our immune system in balance. We want to avoid the 'overreactions', but we also need our immune system to protect us from potential environmental threats like pathogens and harmful microbes.\nFortunately, there are a number of products designed to help ease allergy symptoms naturally by either eliminating the allergy triggers or by modulating the immune system to prevent the exaggerated response.\nA study published in the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology found a significant improvement in symptoms of allergic rhinitis in children using LED phototherapy. Bionette produces a specific 630 nm wavelength of red light that can be very effective for treating seasonal allergies. The device is inserted in the nose for 4.5 minutes, for up to three times a day initially, reducing to once or a twice a day once symptoms have improved.\nShaped like a small teapot, the neti pot is one of the most popular natural products that helps relieve allergy symptoms by cleansing the nasal passages with a salt solution, using 2.5 grams of salt in 8 ounces of warm water. Simply insert the spout into one nostril and tilt your head to one side, allowing the warm saline solution to travel up one nostril and down the other, washing out dirt, dust, and pollen.\nPersonally, I prefer a more modern version of this traditional solution. The Nasaline rinsing system allows you to control the flow and pressure, making it easier to use and more effective than a neti pot.\nConventional salt solutions can dry out the nasal passages, and some find the solution a bit harsh for the delicate nasal membranes. I recommend a buffered salt/xylitol solution that combines sodium bicarbonate and xylitol with powdered Himalayan crystal salt. A natural sugar alcohol found in many fruits and vegetables, xylitol keeps the nasal membranes moist and helps prevent bacteria from adhering to the nasal passages, enhancing the effect of the salt solution.\nTo make your own buffered salt/xylitol solution, mix 100 g of baking soda with 300 g Himalayan crystal salt (fine powder) and 800 g of xylitol. This mixture should be enough for about 200 cleanses. Use 6 g (about a teaspoon) for every 8 ounces of water.\nEasier to use than a neti pot, saline sprays can help with symptoms but generally are not as effective as a neti pot or Nasaline. I recommend Xlear as a superior alternative to regular saline sprays as it combines a saline solution with xylitol, better protecting delicate nasal tissues while keeping them hydrated.\nOne of the best ways to reduce indoor allergy symptoms is with a HEPA air filtration system. HEPA filters trap pollen, mold, and many other allergy triggers. For best results, keep windows closed to prevent allergens from entering the home. Portable units can be more effective in small spaces however, HEPA filters that are attached to your HVAC system are recommended as they reduce allergens in the entire home. Combining both solutions is ideal.\nHEPA filters help to remove airborne particles, but they can't kill all the bacteria present in our living environment. New technologies that produce OH radicals can kill up to 10 times more pathogens than photocatalytic oxidation, the conventional method of generating OH radicals in air purifiers. An exciting new disinfection system developed in Korea, the Air Vaccine 015+ is especially effective for rhinitis and respiratory infections. Suitable for spaces up to 1300 square feet, the Air Vaccine works to remove 98% or more of dangerous contaminants like E. coli, smallpox virus, Influenza type A (H1N1), and many other volatile organic compounds in just a few hours.\nMany older homes (particularly those with damp basements) can have mold that infiltrates the home. If allergy symptoms persist, hire a company to test the air. If mold is present, there are companies that do mold remediation and can help ensure that it won't be an ongoing problem. Ideal as a preventative measure in homes and cottages, the Airfree Onix 3000 air sterilizer safely uses heat to help reduce indoor pollution by incinerating mold spores, bacteria, and viruses.\nAs many allergy and asthma symptoms are caused by dust mites, it is important that you work to eliminate mites from your bed, bedding, pillows, carpet, and furniture. I recommend breathable total encasement mattress and pillow protectors that use silver ions to kill dust mites and bacteria. Mattress protectors like PureCare and Natura's Protect Deluxe are effective at reducing allergy symptoms, as they integrate silver ions in the fabric (killing mites and bacteria).\nThese lifestyle recommendations can help you to effectively deal with allergy symptoms. The next article will outline foods and dietary supplements that can help balance the immune system and prevent the overreaction that ultimately causes allergy symptoms.\nIn the last entry in this series, I outlined a variety of products and lifestyle changes that can help to reduce or eliminate allergy symptoms including phototherapy, nasal cleansing, and air filtration. In addition to lifestyle modifications and environmental improvement, there are a number of natural supplements that can reduce allergy symptoms.\nAs mentioned in Part I, exposure to allergens doesn't cause a reaction with most people the particles are generally harmless. Allergy symptoms occur when the body mistakes these particles as invaders, triggering an overreaction of the immune system that causes increased production of the antibody immunoglobulin-E (IgE). The next time you are exposed to that allergen, specialized mast cells release various chemicals including histamine which lead to the classic allergy symptoms including congestion, itchy eyes, sneezing, and mucus production.\nThe connection between the microbiome (our gut microbiota) and the immune system is one of the most active areas of medical research today. Our immune system health is closely linked with healthy oral and gastrointestinal bacteria. Increasing levels of good bacteria through supplementation can help to balance immune response and prevent the overreaction to allergens. I recommend a quality probiotic, taken two to three times a day.\nSome of the powerful dietary supplements that work to balance the immune system include Proligna pine cone extract, plant sterols, Pycnogenol, magnesium, zinc, stinging nettle, olive leaf extract, and quercetin.\nProligna Pine Cone Extract (PPC): Pine cone extract has a long history of usage around the world, particularly in Japan. Fourteen patents and over 31 peer-reviewed studies support its use for immune enhancement, antiviral, antibacterial, and anticancer activities. I take one small capsule daily, and have not succumbed to a cold or flu for as long as I've been taking it.\nAllergy research has identified the importance of dendritic cells in helping balance the immune response that results in allergy symptoms. PPC boosts dendritic cell development nine-fold in just nine days, and reduces IgE two-fold in fourteen days, while promoting disease-fighting T cell response.\nPlant Sterols: These naturally occurring plant fats are found in whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes. Plant sterols have a wide range of health benefits including helping to modulate the inflammatory response to allergens. They can also help lower cholesterol, block the enzyme associated with male pattern baldness and enlarged prostate, and decrease levels of cortisol -- the stress hormone that can adversely affect the immune system.\nNature's richest source of plant sterols is rice bran solubles. Supplements that work well to alleviate allergy symptoms have a minimum of 117 mg of beta-sitosterol per capsule, combined with Cellasate and Enzogenol. Cellasate is a blend of essential fatty acids designed to increase bioavailability, and Enzogenol is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory plant compound from the bark of New Zealand pine trees.\nButterbur (Petasites Hybridus): An herb frequently prescribed for the treatment of migraine headaches, recent research found it to be as effective at reducing allergy symptoms as a well-known anti-histamine drug, but without the drowsiness that is a common side effect.\nBlack Cumin Seed Oil (Nigella Sativa): Also called black seed oil, many health professionals believe this oil to be among the most powerful natural immune balancing products, with a tremendous range of health benefits. For allergy relief, I recommend two 500 mg capsules twice a day, or one tablespoon of black cumin seed liquid daily.\nPycnogenol: Research indicates that Pycnogenol reduces hay fever, nasal, and ophthalmic symptoms. Additional benefits may be seen when taking it for at least 5 weeks prior to allergy season some users report being able to lower or eliminate their allergy or asthma medications. An extract from French maritime pine bark, Pycnogenol is one of the most effective supplements for improving microcirculation, male fertility, and athletic performance. It helps maintain beautiful healthy skin, and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (including deep vein thrombosis and varicose veins).\nOlive Leaf: When taken at the onset of symptoms, olive leaf helps the body produce a decongestant effect in the body. I prefer the liquid complex, which is higher in anti-inflammatory components than olive leaf extract capsules. Olive leaf can also help normalize blood pressure and reduce the incidence of colds and flu.\nOmega-3: A German study found those with the highest levels of omega-3 essential fatty acids were less likely to overreact to potential allergens. Researchers found the higher the omega-3 levels, the greater the effect. Omega-6 fats can cause inflammation, while omega-3 fats are anti-inflammatory. I recommend a balanced 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diet, and avoiding oils high in omega-6 including grapeseed, corn, safflower, sunflower, rice bran, canola, peanut, walnut, and soybean oil. Choose oils high in monounsaturated fat (olive, macadamia nut, avocado), saturated fat (coconut, red palm, MCT) and omega-3 (camelina and flax).\nVitamin C with Bioflavonoids: Two to three grams of vitamin C taken in divided doses (ideally 500 mg every four hours) can be effective at reducing allergy symptoms. Choose a formula with bioflavonoids, which help strengthen capillaries and stabilize mast cells. I recommend buffered forms of vitamin C, which combine ascorbic acid with minerals like magnesium and calcium to increase the alkalinity. Mineral ascorbate forms of vitamin C are easier on the stomach, with the added benefits derived from the minerals in the formula.\nI also recommend vitamin C formulas that use threonic acid enhanced buffered calcium ascorbate combined with alpha lipoic acid, a powerful antioxidant that recycles vitamin C in the body. This combination maintains high levels of vitamin C in the bloodstream for up to 12 hours, while most formulas must be taken every 3-4 hours for optimal results.\nQuercetin: One of the most effective natural antihistamines, quercetin is a bioflavonoid found in onions, apples, blueberries, okra, buckwheat, olive oil, citrus fruits, green tea, and red wine. Quercetin may also be effective at reducing symptoms of asthma. Researchers at Tufts Medical Center found that 300-1000 mg per day can help alleviate allergy symptoms by reducing the inflammatory response.\nStinging Nettle: The roots of stinging nettle have traditionally been used to help reduce an enlarged prostate, but the shoots can be effective for treating kidney stones, arthritis, and allergy symptoms including hay fever. In a recent study, 60% of those taking 300 mg per day experienced relief.\nZinc: Studies show that over 40% of seniors are deficient in zinc, one of the most important minerals for the immune system. When histamine-producing mast cells are zinc deficient, zinc lozenges can help stop the release of histamine and provide quick relief, often lasting up to 12 hours. Oral lozenges containing zinc acetate or zinc gluconate are usually recommended to help combat the common cold, but with continued use, some find that allergy symptoms disappear completely. I recommend taking a multivitamin that supplies a minimum of 15 mg of zinc per day, but if you are a vegetarian or don't often eat animal products, I recommend 30 mg.\nMagnesium: According to Terry Phillips, Ph.D, magnesium deficiency definitely accentuates the allergic situation. A key nutrient that is required for over 360 biochemical reactions in the body, over 60% of the population is deficient, and many pharmaceutical drugs interfere with its absorption. Magnesium helps relax constricted airways while inhibiting the release of histamine from mast cells. Studies have found that higher levels of histamine are associated with magnesium deficiency. I recommend a multivitamin that contains a 300-500 mg of magnesium per day in divided doses. For the highest bioavailability, I recommend Magnesium Synergy from AOR, as it also contains zinc and nutrient cofactors that improve magnesium absorption.\nThe key to alleviating allergies is modulating the immune response to prevent the overreaction that results in allergy symptoms. The recommendations outlined here can help control the response without the side effects of prescription medicines, and can provide additional natural health benefits.","There aren't many things more frustrating than an air conditioning that refuses to run. A hot, muggy home can make your space incredibly uncomfortable, which is why I have always focused on maintaining my air conditioning system. Unfortunately, I still run into problems from time to time and I am sure that all of you do, which is one of the reasons I decided to build this website. Check out these posts for more information about keeping your system working beautifully, even if you aren't naturally good at fixing things. You never know, making the right changes could dramatically improve your summertime experience.\nCan HVAC filter replacement or an HVAC UV light protect your family against viral or bacterial particles? If you want to sanitize the indoor air, take a look at the top questions homeowners have and their answers.\nCan an HVAC System Filter Out Microorganisms?\nYou want to purify the indoor air, remove the germs, and make your home a healthier place. But is a new filter the way to achieve your interior air sanitization goals? The answer to this question depends on the MERV, or minimum efficiency reporting value, rating. Lower MERV-rated filters remove larger particles, such as pet fur or dust from the air.\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), MERV rated one through four filters trap less than 20 percent of three- to ten-micron particles. In comparison, high-efficiency particulate air filters (or HEPA filters) remove over 99.9 percent of 0.3-micron particles. These particles include everything from dust and pollen to some types of mold, bacteria, and other microorganisms.\nDo HEPA Filters Sanitize the Air?\nIf you don't choose a high-quality HEPA filter, it's not likely your HVAC system will remove microorganisms from the air. But if you do select a high-MERV rated filter, you can reduce the number of viral or bacterial particles—under the right circumstances.\nThe ability of a high MERV filter to remove microorganisms depends on several factors. These include the age of the filter, how clean it is, and the indoor air. Older, clogged HEPA filters won't efficiently or effectively remove microorganisms or other small particles from the interior air.\nHow Can You Sanitize the Air?\nA HEPA filter isn't the only way to clear the indoor air. Ultraviolet light (also known as UV light) can kill microorganisms. The light acts as a germicide inside of your HVAC system. This reduces the viral, bacterial, and mold spore count and can lead to cleaner indoor air.\nCan You Use a High MERV Filter and a UV Light?\nTo maximize the effectiveness of your home's system, combine both options (a HEPA or high MERV filter and a UV light system). Again, a HEPA filter won't remove smaller-sized particles if it's clogged. Don't substitute a UV light for a filter cleaning or replacement.\nCheck your home's HVAC system often. If the filter has visible debris or your furnace or AC unit doesn't heat/cool efficiently, it's time to clean or change the filter.\nWho Should Install a Filter or a UV Light?\nTo maximize the effectiveness of either option, hire a licensed HVAC contractor to help you choose and install a new filter or UV light. The professional's expert knowledge may help you to improve the indoor air quality and reduce the number of microorganisms/particles inside of your home. Look for HVAC filter replacement options near you."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5ba7bc31-4caf-418a-b0c6-741bca84183a>","<urn:uuid:d5903180-2750-4a44-8ea4-e2f7bc543599>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What are the advantages of using balance boards over ankle braces and tape for preventing ankle sprains?","answer":"Balance board training avoids the negative side effects associated with braces and tape. While braces can be irritating if not fitted properly and may affect performance, and tape loosens during play, requires qualified personnel to apply, and can cause skin irritation, proprioceptive balance board training is equally effective without these drawbacks.","context":["A new study in the American Journal of Sports Medicine by Evert Verhagen (who has been a visiting scientist at the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center during the fall of 2002) proves that proprioceptive balance board training is effective for the prevention of recurrent ankle sprains. A one season proprioceptive balance board training programme that was incorporated in the training routine of 66 Dutch volleyball teams significantly reduced the incidence of ankle sprains when compared to a control group of 50 similar Dutch volleyball teams.\n|Training on balance board prevents new injuries effectively|\nThe majority of contemporary sports entails physical activity, and relatively recently the potential of these physical activities in the prevention of chronic diseases has been recognised. This has caused that today people of all ages are encouraged to have a physically active lifestyle and to actively participate in sports. However, participation in sports also has its downside in the form of injuries. Acute lateral ankle ligament injuries (ankle sprains) are the most common injuries across a wide variety of sports. Athletes who suffer from ankle sprains are\nmore likely to re-injure the same\nankle, which can result in disability and can lead to chronic pain or instability in 20 to 50% of these cases. This high incidence of ankle sprains and their negative consequences for future sports participation, calls for preventive measures.\nBraces and tape are widely used measures against ankle sprains. It is known from previous research that braces show a reduction in ankle sprain incidence, and it is argued that tape also has a preventive effect, since the working mechanism is thought to be similar to braces. However, both measures have negative side-effects; e.g. while braces can be irritating if not fitting properly and are argued to negatively affect performance, tape loosens during play, needs to be applied by qualified personnel, and can cause skin irritation. Proprioceptive balance board training is another measure, presumably as effective as braces and tape is, but without the above mentioned negative side effects. This measure is already used in the rehabilitation following ankle sprain, in order to re-strengthen muscles and ligaments, and to restore proprioception of the damaged structures around the ankle. Proprioceptive balance board training has also been suggested as an alternative to taping or bracing in the prevention of ankle sprains. Previous studies showed that this method is promising in doing so. However, these previous studies failed to show a significant reduction of ankle sprains, presumably due to low sample size and/or inadequate study design.\nIn order to establish the effect and cost-effectiveness of a proprioceptive balance board training programme for the prevention of ankle sprains, 116 Dutch male and female volleyball teams were followed prospectively during one volleyball season. Teams were randomized by four geographical regions to an intervention group and control group. While control teams followed their normal training routine, intervention teams followed a prescribed balance board training programme. Volleyball exposure during training and matches, as well as injuries was recorded for each individual player on a weekly basis. If a player sustained an ankle sprain a cost-diary was completed for the duration of the injury.\nIn the intervention group significantly less ankle sprains were found as compared to the control group (risk difference = 0.4 per 1,000 playing hours; 95% CI: 0.1 0.7). This significant reduction in ankle sprain risk was found only for players with a history of ankle sprains. Since only an effect was found for players with previous injury, which is a known risk factor for re-injury, the effect of the balance board training programme should be regarded as a rehabilitative effect rather than a primary preventive effect.\nThe total costs per player (i.e. including the intervention material) were significantly higher in the intervention group (Euro 36.99 ± 93.87) as compared to the control group (Euro 18.94 ± 147.09). The price to prevent one ankle sprain was approximately Euro 444.03. However, a sensitivity analysis showed that the costs associated with the balance board programme will be lower and might even prove cost-beneficial when the target population would be defined more strictly and when a prolonged use of the intervention material would be taken into account.\nThe present study was conducted in volleyball and provides evidence for a preventive effect of a proprioceptive balance board training programme in this sport. However, since the injury mechanism underlying ankle sprains as well as the risk of injury recurrence are universal across all sports, the use of a balance board programme is recommended for all players with a history of ankle sprains participating in a wide variety of sports.\nThis study was performed at the EMGO-Institute of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Evert Verhagen PhD conducted the study with his colleagues professor Willem van Mechelen MD, professor Lex Bouter, and Allard van der Beek PhD. This study was also carried out in cooperation with professor Roald Bahr the chair of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center, who had a major contribution in analysing and writing up this study for publication.\nRead the article here."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1d6bbb38-35fd-4160-ab7d-070c31c97ffc>"],"error":null}

The poem, written in some 7,400 dactylic hexameters, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through richly poetic language and metaphors. Lucretius presents the principles of atomism; the nature of the mind and soul; explanations of sensation and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena. The universe described in the poem operates according to these physical principles, guided by fortuna, \"chance,\" and not the divine intervention of the traditional Roman deities.\nEpicurus maintained that the unhappiness and degradation of humankind arose largely from the dread which they entertained of the power of the gods, from terror of their wrath, which was supposed to be displayed by the misfortunes inflicted in this life, and by the everlasting tortures which were the lot of the guilty in a future state, or where these feelings were not strongly developed, from a vague dread of gloom and misery after death. To remove these fears, and thus to establish tranquillity in the heart, was the purpose of his teaching. Thus the Gods, whose existence he did not deny, lived forevermore in the enjoyment of absolute peace, strangers to all the passions, desires, and fears, which agitate the human heart, totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike by their virtues and their crimes. To prove this position he called upon the atomism of Democritus, by which he sought to demonstrate that the material universe was formed not by a Supreme Being, but by the mixing of elemental particles which had existed from all eternity governed by certain simple laws. The task undertaken by Lucretius was to clearly state and fully develop these views in an attractive form; his work being an attempt to show that everything in nature can be explained by natural laws without the need for the intervention of divine beings.\nLucretius identifies the supernatural with the notion that the gods created our world or interfere with its operations in some way. He argues against fear of such gods by demonstrating through observations and arguments that the operations of the world can be accounted for in terms of natural phenomena—the regular but purposeless motions and interactions of tiny atoms in empty space. Meanwhile, he argues against the fear of death by stating that death is the dissipation of a being's material mind. Lucretius uses the analogy of a vessel, stating that the physical body is the vessel that holds both the mind (mens) and spirit (anima) of a human being. Neither the mind nor spirit can survive independent of the body. Thus Lucretius states that once the vessel (the body) shatters (dies) its contents (mind and spirit) can no longer exist. So, as a simple ceasing-to-be, death can be neither good nor bad for this being. Being completely devoid of sensation and thought, a dead person cannot miss being alive. According to Lucretius, fear of death is a projection of terrors experienced in life, of pain that only a living (intact) mind can feel. Lucretius also puts forward the 'symmetry argument' against the fear of death. In it, he says that people who fear the prospect of eternal non-existence after death should think back to the eternity of non-existence before their birth, which probably did not cause them much suffering.\nThe poem consists of six untitled books, in dactylic hexameter. The first three books provide a fundamental account of being and nothingness, matter and space, the atoms and their movement, the infinity of the universe both as regards time and space, the regularity of reproduction (no prodigies, everything in its proper habitat), the nature of mind (animus, directing thought) and spirit (anima, sentience) as material bodily entities, and their mortality, since, according to Lucretius, they and their functions (consciousness, pain) end with the bodies that contain them and with which they are interwoven. The last three books give an atomic and materialist explanation of phenomena preoccupying human reflection, such as vision and the senses, sex and reproduction, natural forces and agriculture, the heavens, and disease.\nThe poem opens with an invocation to Venus, whom Lucretius addresses as an allegorical representation of the reproductive power, after which the business of the piece commences by an enunciation of the proposition on the nature and being of the gods, which leads to an invective against the gigantic monster superstition, and a thrilling picture of the horrors which attends its tyrannous sway. Then follows a lengthened elucidation of the axiom that nothing can be produced from nothing, and that nothing can be reduced to nothing (Nil fieri ex nihilo, in nihilum nil posse reverti); which is succeeded by a definition of the Ultimate Atoms, infinite in number, which, together with Void Space (Inane), infinite in extent, constitute the universe. The shape of these corpuscles, their properties, their movements, the laws under which they enter into combination and assume forms and qualities appreciable by the senses, with other preliminary matters on their nature and affections, together with a refutation of objections and opposing hypotheses, occupy the first two books.\nIn the third book, the general concepts proposed thus far are applied to demonstrate that the vital and intellectual principles, the Anima and Animus, are as much a part of us as are our limbs and members, but like those limbs and members have no distinct and independent existence, and that hence soul and body live and perish together; the argument being wound up by a magnificent exposure of the folly manifested in a dread of death, which will forever extinguish all feeling.\nThe fifth book, generally regarded as the most finished and impressive[who?], addresses the origin of the world and of all things that are therein, the movements of the heavenly bodies, the changing of the seasons, day and night, the rise and progress of humankind, society, political institutions, and the invention of the various arts and sciences which embellish and ennoble life.\nThe sixth book contains an explanation of some of the most striking natural appearances, especially thunder, lightning, hail, rain, snow, ice, cold, heat, wind, earthquakes, volcanoes, springs and localities noxious to animal life, which leads to a discourse upon diseases. This in its turn introduces an appalling description of the great pestilence which devastated Athens during the Peloponnesian War, and thus the book closes. The abrupt ending suggests that Lucretius had not finished fully editing the poem before his death.\nLucretius wrote this epic poem to \"Memmius\", who may be Gaius Memmius, who in 58 BC was a praetor, a judicial official deciding controversies between citizens and the government. There are over a dozen references to \"Memmius\" scattered throughout the long poem in a variety of contexts in translation, such as \"Memmius mine\", \"my Memmius\", and \"illustrious Memmius\". According to Lucretius's frequent statements in his poem, the main purpose of the work was to free Gaius Memmius's mind of the supernatural and the fear of death—and to induct him into a state of ataraxia by expounding the philosophical system of Epicurus, whom Lucretius glorifies as the hero of his epic poem. Apparently, Lucretius's attempt was unsuccessful.\nHowever, the purpose of the poem is subject to ongoing scholarly debate. Lucretius refers to Memmius by name four times in the first book, three times in the second, five in the fifth, and not at all in the third, fourth, or sixth books. In relation to this discrepancy in the frequency of Lucretius' reference to the apparent subject of his poem, Kannengiesse advances the theory that Lucretius wrote the first version of De rerum natura for the reader at large, and subsequently revised in order to write it for Memmius. However, Memmius' name is central to several critical verses in the poem, and this theory has therefore been largely discredited. Bruns and Brandt have set forth an alternative theory that Lucretius did at first write the poem with Memmius in mind, but that his enthusiasm for his patron cooled. Stearns suggests that this is because Memmius reneged on a promise to pay for a new school to be built on the site of the old Epicurean school. Memmius was also a tribune in 66, praetor in 58, governor of Bithynia in 57, and was a candidate for the consulship in 54 but was disqualified for bribery, and Stearns suggests that the warm relationship between patron and client may have cooled.[a]\nManuscript history and rediscovery\nCopies of the poem made it by chance into a few libraries in the 9th century before it was rediscovered in January 1417 by Poggio Bracciolini. The copy found by Poggio did not survive, but a copy of it by Poggio's friend, Niccolò de' Niccoli, did; it is kept today at the Laurentian Library in Florence (\"Codex Laurentianus 35.30\"). Machiavelli made a copy early in his life. Molière produced a verse translation which does not survive; John Evelyn translated the first book.\nNotable figures who owned copies include Ben Jonson whose copy is held at the Houghton Library, Harvard; Thomas Jefferson owned at least five Latin editions and English, Italian and French translations. Montaigne's Essays contain almost a hundred quotes from De rerum natura.\nLucretius maintained that he could free humankind from fear of the gods by demonstrating that all things occur by natural causes without any intervention by the gods. Historians of science, however, have been critical of the limitations of his Epicurean approach to science, especially as it pertained to astronomical topics, which he relegated to the class of \"unclear\" objects.\nThus, he began his discussion by claiming that he would\nexplain by what forces nature steers the courses of the Sun and the journeyings of the Moon, so that we shall not suppose that they run their yearly races between heaven and earth of their own free will [i.e., are gods themselves] or that they are rolled round in furtherance of some divine plan....\nHowever, when he set out to put this plan into practice, he limited himself to showing how one, or several different, naturalistic accounts could explain certain natural phenomena. He was unable to tell his readers how to determine which of these alternatives might be the true one.\n- Let us now take as our theme the cause of stellar movements.\n- First let us suppose that the great globe of the sky itself rotates....\n- There remains the alternative possibility that the sky as a whole is stationary while the shining constellations are in motion. This may happen\n- because swift currents of ether ... whirl round and round and roll their fires at large across the nocturnal regions of the sky. Or\n- an external current of air from some other quarter may whirl them along in their course. Or\n- they may swim of their own accord, each responsive to the call of its own food, and feed their fiery bodies in the broad pastures of the sky.\n- One of these causes must certainly operate in our world.... But to lay down which of them it is lies beyond the range of our stumbling progress.\nDrawing on these, and other passages, William Stahl considered that \"The anomalous and derivative character of the scientific portions of Lucretius' poem makes it reasonable to conclude that his significance should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist.\"\nDeterminism appears to conflict with the concept of free will. Lucretius attempts to allow for free will in his physicalistic universe by postulating an indeterministic tendency for atoms to swerve randomly (Latin: clinamen). This indeterminacy, according to Lucretius, provides the \"free will which livings things throughout the world have.\"\nThe earliest recorded verdict of Lucretius' work is by Cicero, who calls Lucretius's poetry \"full of inspired brilliance, but also of great artistry\".[b] However, Cicero is elsewhere critical of Lucretius and the Epicureans, and disparaged them for their omission from their work of historical study.\nCornelius Nepos, in his Life Of Atticus, mentions Lucretius as one of the greatest poets of his times.\nOvid, in his Amores, writes: Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti / exitio terras cum dabit una dies (which means \"the verses of the sublime Lucretius will perish only when a day will bring the end of the world\").\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery, notes Lucretius in \"Southern Mail/ Night Flight\" on page 20.\nLucretius has also had a marked influence upon modern philosophy, as perhaps the most complete expositor of Epicurean thought. His influence is especially notable in Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, who praised Lucretius (along with Dante and Goethe) in his book 'Three Philosophical Poets.'\nAt the start of the 7th century, Isidore of Seville produced De natura rerum, a book of astronomy and natural history dedicated to the Visigothic king Sisebut. About a century later, Bede produced a work of the same title, partly based on Isidore's work but apparently ignorant of Lucretius' poem.\n- Greenblatt, Stephen (8 August 2011). \"The Answer Man – An ancient poem was rediscovered—and the world swerved\".

{"question":"Could you explain both how the 'anabolic window' theory for post-workout nutrition originated and why it has been scientifically debunked?","answer":"The 'anabolic window' theory originated from the observation that exercise depletes glycogen stores and damages muscle fibers. The theory suggested that consuming protein and quick-release carbs immediately after workouts (within 30-60 minutes) would prevent muscle breakdown, spike muscle protein synthesis, and refill glycogen stores. However, this theory has been debunked through scientific research. A comprehensive review by researchers showed no conclusive evidence that consuming protein and carbs immediately post-workout increases muscle protein synthesis. Additionally, studies revealed that muscle protein breakdown is only slightly elevated after workouts (unless training fasted), and glycogen doesn't need immediate replenishment - it can be effectively restored even when nutrients are consumed hours later. In fact, a 12-week study comparing two groups - one consuming post-workout shakes and one using placebos - showed no differences in muscle growth between the groups.","context":["You might want to think twice before you rush to slug down another post-workout smoothie. Your pre-workout routine of oatmeal and fruit? It might not be helping in the way you think. And the extra BCAAs you’re drinking during your workout? The real impact is likely only on how much money you have in your wallet.\nFrom building muscle to surviving your endurance runs, the rules of workout nutrition have completely changed. But, there’s one big problem: few people are aware of what really helps you fuel before a workout and recover afterward.\nWhich is why this is both your warning and a sigh of relief. The latest breakthroughs have rewritten the script, and that’s good news for anyone who likes to exercise. Gone are the days of carb-loading or rushing to have protein within 30 minutes of finishing your workout.\nIn fact, both nutrient timing and workout nutrition needs have liberating truth: Neither matters as much as we once believed.\nSo, while you might look at the past as wasted, it’s best to view these new rules for what they are: a serious fitness upgrade that makes it easier than ever to eat the right way to fuel performance, strip away fat, or even build extra muscle without all the extra, unnecessary eating.\nConfusion 101: Are Sports Drinks Better Than Water?\nIf you really want to know why the advice has been so misguided, you don’t have to look any farther than the sports drink aisle at your grocery store.\nFor most weekend warriors, the need for a sports drink (think Gatorade, Powerade, or any other energetic adjective + “ade”) isn’t as real as the ads make it seem.\nYes, there can be benefits to sports drinks. But, the liquid rejuvenation is limited to a very select group of exercises that deplete their bodies of certain nutrients.\nAnd, for most gym-goers, runners, and weekend warriors, it’s rare that you ever push your body to the point of needing the type of energy locked inside the bottle.\nYou see, most people’s workouts fall into one of 2 categories:\n- High intensity but shorter duration (think less than 1 hour of gym activity)\n- Lower or moderate intensity for a longer duration (think 1-2 hour runs)\nIn both of these cases, the only necessary hydration is water. If you want a little boost, then you might want to sip on some electrolytes (think more sodium and potassium than you’ll find in sports drinks, as well as calcium and magnesium), and a few carbs to help with hydration — but not the 30 grams of sugar packed into your favorite sports drink.\nWhen you’re working out at a high intensity and for longer periods of time (think more than 2 to 3 hours), that’s when sports drinks offer the most benefits because they refill what is lost during that type of extreme condition.\nIf you regularly sweat out 2 to 3 percent of your body’s weight during long duration, intense exercise—3 to 6 pounds, for most of us—you probably need more sodium. That’s what a sports drink provides.\nThe same goes for the minerals you lose through heavy sweating. For example, most athletes know about electrolytes. In particular—potassium, magnesium, and sodium—are essential (and have the name “electrolyte) because your body needs them to transmit electrical signals from your brain to your muscles. This is what allows your body to function.\nBut, the same type of research that was used to formulate products like Gatorade was also the basis of your workout strategy. In other words, Gatorade was designed more for high-level athletes than high-level executives, mothers, fathers, and typical gym-goers.\nThis was the basis of nutrient timing theory: The high carb amounts. The immediate need for protein. The fear of fats slowing down recovery.\nThe reality? None of it was really designed for your body.\nDo You Have To Eat Directly After Your Workout?\nLet’s set one thing clear: What food you put into your body is still very important and determines how hard you can exercise and how well you recover.\nThe bigger issue is exactly what you should be eating, or maybe, more importantly, when you should be eating it.\nThe idea of the “anabolic window” or that you need to eat as soon as possible after finishing your workouts is one of the most misleading pieces of fitness advice that has persevered for decades.\nIt’s based on a fear-driven, scientifically-debunked mentality that your muscles live in an hourglass, and with each passing second of eating before or after a workout you were losing out on improvement.\nFor the past 20 years, the prevailing idea was that you had about 30 to 60 minutes to eat something after your workout. If not, your body would become catabolic (a state of stress) and you would lose muscle, not recover fast enough, and fail to see the benefits from all your hard work and time invested.\nWhen you think about it, the theory seems crazy. How could the human body have such a small window for recovery?\nThat was the question exercise physiologist Dr. Brad Schoenfeld aimed to solve.\nHe reviewed a large number of studies that examined nutrient timing and set out to answer a simple question: Is there such thing as the “anabolic window?”\nTurns out there is—but it’s much bigger than anyone ever suggested. And the timing of your meals after a workout isn’t even the biggest indicator of your success. (More on that in a moment.)\nWhen Should You Eat After Your Workout?\nAfter you exercise you burn up your main energy store of carbohydrates, also known as glycogen. So, it only makes sense that you need to refuel glycogen by eating lots of carbs to replace what was lost.\nBut, when food was consumed in a shorter window of time after a workout there was no significant difference than when it was consumed after a long delay.\nIn fact, the research would go as far as suggesting that your post-workout window is actually the entire 24 hours after you train, with the key time to eat ideally occurring anywhere within 4 hours after you finish your last set, stop your run, or end your athletic event.\nNot exactly the same message as slug your protein shake before your muscles shrink.\nHow did this massive misunderstanding occur?\nIt goes back to the sports drink phenomenon. The “glycogen emptying” idea wasn’t really applicable to the average person. In reality, it takes a tremendous effort to completely deplete your glycogen stores.\nExtreme marathoners can do it. Bodybuilders who train twice per day can do it. NFL athletes who play a 3-hour game can do it.\nBut you? It’s a different story.\nMost people don’t’ go to the gym completely fasted or do workouts that completely tap-out your energy reserves (even if you feel exhausted). And yet, those were the test conditions used to determine what to eat after your workout.\nWhile it might feel like your body needs food immediately, the ROI of rushing to or even forcing food into your system is minimal: you won’t see added strength, additional muscle, faster fat loss, improved endurance, or a boost in recovery.\nThe new rules of nutrient timing focus on the bigger picture. If you want to perform and look your best, then you need to consider three factors: what you eat before your workout, what you eat after, and what type of activity you perform.\nHow to Fuel Your Workouts The Right Way\nJust because the timing of your post-workout meal has been reduced from urgent to “apply on your time,” doesn’t mean the entire concept of nutrient timing is dead.\nIn fact, it’s just the opposite. There’s never been a clearer idea of exactly what you should be eating to help your body. And the biggest breakthrough is clear. Protein is the new carbs.\nIt used to be that you needed to fuel up with carbs prior to your workout and then replenish after your workout. This all ties back to glycogen as a primary source of energy and fuel for your body. Most research tested the benefits of using carbohydrates as fuel and then tested different amounts of carbs.\nBut, even that rationale was a bit flawed. Nutrient timing should focus on three aspects that help improve your performance and appearance.\nGlycogen replenishment: Glycogen is your fuel. The more you have the harder you can push your body for longer periods of time.\nProtein breakdown: If you want to gain muscle, protein synthesis (anabolism) has to be greater than protein breakdown (catabolism).\nProtein Building – Protein Breakdown = Muscle Growth or Loss\nSo, it only makes sense that you want to slow the breakdown process.\nProtein synthesis: Eating protein after a workout is supposed to optimize the other side of the same equation by increasing muscle protein synthesis, the process that helps you repair and rebuild muscle.\nCombined, all three of these factors influence how hard you can train (endurance, strength, work capacity), how well you recover, and your ability to build muscle and burn fat. So it only makes sense that what you eat should target any or all of these goals.\nDo Carbs Help Your Workouts?\nCarbs are a great source of fuel for your body. But, eating more carbs doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have more energy. And that’s because depleting glycogen is actually very difficult.\nFor example, let’s say you did a full-body workout of 9 exercises, performed 3 sets of each exercise (so 27 sets total), and pushed at a high intensity of 80 percent of your 1 rep max. That’d be a grueling workout, but when researchers tested this exact protocol, they found that it only depleted about one-third of total glycogen stores.\nEven crazier? When a similar workout was tested and followed with no food, about 75 percent of the depleted glycogen was replenished within 6 hours.\nSo what’s going on? Your body is protective of your energy. The more you deplete your glycogen, the faster resynthesis occurs. The higher your intensity, the quicker you recharge. Even in marathon runners and endurance athletes, complete resynthesis is usually complete within 24 hours.\nThat’s not a call to avoid carbs. They are important and necessary, and if you’re exercising they need to be a part of your plan.\nBut, the extreme nature of pre-workout (carb-loading) and post-workout (insulin-spiking) carb needs were overblown. You don’t need to fuel up with hundreds of grams of fuel pre, during, and post-workout because you’re not tapping out your glycogen.\nWhen your tank is empty, you’ll know it without question. So, your ideal carb plan will ultimately depend on the type of activity you perform.\nHow Much Protein Should You Eat After a Workout?\nWhen eating protein and carbs was compared to carbs alone, it instantly became clear that protein is your body’s best friend. Adding protein improved recovery, muscle protein synthesis, and protein breakdown.\nBut most interesting? When protein and carbs (25 grams of protein and 50 grams of carbs) was compared to just protein alone (25 grams), there was no additional benefit in terms of muscle protein synthesis or muscle protein breakdown when the carbs were added.\nThe verdict: Protein is the new king of workout nutrition.\nAnd it doesn’t end there. While we know that protein is important for preventing muscle protein breakdown and fueling muscle protein synthesis, and some carbs (but not too much) are good for glycogen, how much you eat around your workout should not be your primary consideration.\nResearch shows that the most important dietary factor for performance and appearance was not how much protein or carbs you had before or after your workout, but rather how much you ate in the entire day.\nIn essence, even if your pre- or post-workout nutrition was less than optimal (say, if you’re in a rush to get to work), as long as you still ate the right amount of nutrients (proteins, carbs, and fats) for the entire day, then you would still see benefits.\nThe Best Pre- and Post-Workout Nutrition Plan\nTiming nutrition around your workout is a good idea for both fueling your performance and helping recovery. But, you don’t need to stress the timing as much as we once thought. Instead, the urgency of nutrition depends more on the activity you perform and whether you eat something before you exercise.\nWhen you enjoy a pre-workout meal, that will determine what you need after a workout. That’s because eating before your workout ensures that your insulin, amino acid, and glucose levels are still going to be high several hours after the workout.\nMost mixed meals will keep your insulin levels high enough to stop protein breakdown for 4-6 hours. A 45-gram dose of whey protein will do the same for about two hours. Most studies have shown that if you eat protein before, immediately after, or several hours after your workout, your muscle protein synthesis will be about the same.\nTranslation: choose a pre- and post-workout nutrition approach that works for you.\nIf you don’t like to eat before a workout, then don’t. But you’ll want to emphasize that post-workout meal more because you won’t have protein or carbs in your system.\nIf you do like a meal before exercise, there’s no rush to refuel immediately after. Not to mention, if you load up on carbs (such as with oatmeal or some fruit), depending on your type of activity you might not even need post-workout carbs.\nThe closer your meal is to the training bout, the longer your window following the session. And both are dependent on your primary training goal. Meaning there isn’t a gold standard for what you should be eating around your workouts. Instead, you should fuel your body based on the type of activity you perform.\nAnd remember, as long as you consume enough protein by the end of the day, your body generally has no trouble growing new muscle tissue, recovering, or having the energy needed to push through and become better.\nTo help you figure out your needs, use the activity chart below — based on the latest research — to help determine exactly what you need for your body and your goals.\nThe Ultimate Guide to Workout Nutrition\nYour Goal: Endurance Sports\nExamples: Long-distance track and cycling events, marathons, basketball, soccer, MMA\nWhat to eat: Carbohydrates for replenishing muscle glycogen, maintaining stamina, and maintaining energy during your event.\nWhat to remember: It’s easy to argue that nutrient timing is most important for endurance athletes because of the duration and demands of the activity. Performance is the main goal, therefore making carbohydrates more important as a fuel source during the activity and after for recovery. Protein, while useful for minimizing protein loss, is not as essential in the moment for these athletes, but is still important for recovery and retention of muscle.\nYour Nutrition Plan\n- The Focus: carbs and protein\n- The dose: 0.2-0.25 g/lb target bodyweight for both protein and carbs\nDuring your workout\n- For every hour of endurance activity, consume 8-15 g protein and about 15-30 grams of carbs. Liquids and gels are usually best for this.\nYour Goal: Strength/Power Sports\nExamples: Olympic weightlifting, football, powerlifting, bodybuilding, high-intensity intervals\nWhat to eat: Protein for optimizing muscle recovery and growth and minimizing muscle damage\nWhat to remember: Based on the length of time and type of activity, muscle glycogen is not depleted to the extent of endurance sports. Protein is important for supporting strength and muscle growth while minimizing muscle damage and loss. Carbohydrates are important, but less so, and are generally taken care of by meeting total daily calorie and macronutrient goals.\nYour Nutrition Plan\n- A balanced, full meal consisting of carbs and protein, 0.2-0.25 g/lb target bodyweight for both protein and carbs\nYour Goal: Weight-Loss\nExamples: Any type of activity geared towards losing weight. This is your typical cardiovascular type of activity (walking, treadmill, stairstepper) or weight training. NOTE: This is not high-intensity work or something like CrossFit, which is more likely to fit into the strength or endurance categories.\nWhat to eat: Fewer calories (calorie deficit) and more protein\nWhat to remember: The most important thing to keep in mind is you must burn more calories than you bring into your body. Create a calorie deficit first, and then worry about dialing in your pre- and post-workout nutrition.\nYour Nutrition Plan\n- Eat a balanced, full meal consisting of carbs and protein, 0.2-0.25 g/lb target bodyweight for both protein and carbs\nYour Next Steps\nRemember that nutrient timing should focus on three core aspects: glycogen replenishment, protein breakdown, and protein synthesis. And rather than stressing over timing, focus on giving your body the proper nutrition based on what type of activity you perform.\nHave questions?

They swear that drinking protein during this window is a mandatory part of packing on mass…\nBut it’s 100% bullshit! And I’ll prove it in this article.\nThe “Anabolic Window” Myth Explained\nBefore I break down why this myth is false, let’s start by explaining how it gained traction in the first place.\nHere’s the typical logic people use to support the anabolic window:\nAfter you lift weights, your muscle fibers are in a damaged state and your glycogen stores (the carbs your body stores for immediate energy) are depleted…\nThis part is true. But after that is where the “bro science” comes into play.\n…By consuming a mixture of protein and “quick-release” sugary carbs you’re able to super-compensate for these effects by preventing further muscle protein breakdown, spiking muscle protein synthesis, and refilling your glycogen stores. This results in a temporary state where your body can quickly construct new lean mass — the “anabolic window”.\nThe problem with this theory is that it relies only on simple logic, NOT proven science…\nAgain, the basis of this theory is true: intense exercise depletes glycogen and breaks down muscle tissue. But using these facts to justify that you MUST consume a mixture of protein and carbs IMMEDIATELY after your workout is making a lot of assumptions.\nBelow are 3 reasons that prove it simply doesn’t work this way…\nNote: If you’re confused what any of these terms mean, keep reading. I’ll explain them all.\nEvidence #1: There’s no evidence post-workout nutrition raises muscle protein synthesis\nThe main purported benefit of the “anabolic window” is that is raises your rates of muscle protein synthesis. This is so important because muscle protein synthesis is the #1 indicator of muscle growth.\n..But here’s the thing: the research simply does not support this claim.\nIn 2013 Alan Aragon and Brad Schoenfeld – 2 top bodybuilding nutrition researchers – conducted an in-depth review of the “anabolic window.” They analyzed and compared every relevant study that has ever been done on this topic.\nThere is zero conclusive evidence that shows ingesting carbs and protein immediately after a workout raises muscle protein synthesis.\nWhile some studies found a slight benefit, others found a bigger benefit from consuming a pre-workout meal. And to make matters more complicated, many of the studies (both for and against the “anabolic window”) were conducted on elderly individuals, obese people, or populations that don’t regularly exercise.\nIn other words, there’s no clear benefit to having a post-workout shake. Sure, it may offer slight benefits in some rare cases, but it’s only going to make a negligible difference in the long run.\nEvidence #2: Muscle protein breakdown is only an issue if training fasted\nAnother alleged benefit of the “anabolic window” is to prevent muscle breakdown.\nThis is accomplished by including simple carbs (e.g. dextrose) in your post-workout shake. You see, simple carbs spike insulin levels. And spiking insulin is proven to slow muscle protein breakdown.\nThis is important because your body only builds muscle when your rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) are greater than your rates of muscle protein breakdown (MPD).\n…But here’s the thing: studies show that muscle protein breakdown is only VERY slightly raised post-workout.\nIn other words, there’s no need to prevent muscle protein breakdown in the first place.\nHowever, there’s one big exception to this rule: fasted training (ie. working out before eating breakfast). If you train fasted, studies show that muscle protein breakdown is significantly raised post-workout.\nSo, if you train fasted, then you’re in a different category here. In your case, consuming a post-workout shake with protein and simple carbs is actually quite important.\nEvidence #3. Glycogen doesn’t need to be replenished right away\nThe final purported benefit of the “anabolic window” is to replenish your glycogen stores.\nPut simply: glycogen is a form of stored carbohydrates in your muscles. It acts as one of the primary sources of energy during your workouts.\nAnd studies show you can use up a lot of your glycogen by the end of a workout. If you want to perform at your best, get stronger, and build muscle, then you want to make sure your glycogen stores are full before every workout.\nBut here’s the thing: glycogen doesn’t need to be replenished immediately after your workout.\nAll you need to worry about is refilling your glycogen stores before your next workout, so you can lift as much weight as possible at that time.\nAnd studies show that there’s no difference between consuming carbs immediately post-workout or 2 hours later. In both cases, glycogen levels were exactly the same when measured 8 hours and 24 hours later.\nSo, unless you’re a competitive athlete who plans on working out again in just a few hours, you don’t need to worry about consuming carbs and replenishing your glycogen stores right away. Just be sure to eat enough carbs as part of your regular diet (especially if you want optimal testosterone levels).\nConclusion: There’s no reason to drink a post-workout shake (unless you trained fasted)\nWhat can we conclude from all of this data?\nSimple: there’s no evidence to support the theory of the “anabolic window”.\nThe exception to this rule is if you train fasted. In this case you should have a protein shake (or a meal) right after your workout in order to prevent muscle breakdown.\nIf you’re still skeptical, consider this study that examined the long term benefits of drinking a post-workout shake. 33 young men were divided into 2 groups (half had a post-workout shake, half had a placebo). After 12 weeks of lifting, there were no differences in muscle growth between the groups.\ne no magical “anabolic” properties to this shake, but it’s a quick meal replacement that helps me reach my target calories and macros.\nFor this reason, I recommend incorporating a shake into your diet as well."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8a814cd6-27b0-4409-b5c6-b658b7469570>","<urn:uuid:2626092e-9488-472e-bba2-6d43df0ef625>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm into unique musical venues - what different performance spaces are used during the Dobršská brána festival?","answer":"The festival features several performance spaces: a main outdoor stage, a Baroque church, a shady lawn beside a Gothic tower, and a barren pub that serves as a backup venue in case of bad weather.","context":["The Dobršská brána International Music Festival keeps to its tradition and ambition with another year of first-rate musicians from across Europe including the Czech Republic. Each year’s festival has a focus on an instrument; as last year’s was the Accordion, 2021 will spotlight the power of the Drums.\nIn the jazz pantheon, the list of legendary drummers is formidable including Art Blakey, Buddy Rich, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, and on and on. However, there have not been many women on the list until recent years with the inclusion of Cindy Blackman Santana followed by Terri Lynn Carrington. Following hard on bass-drum pedals is Anika Nilles (born 1983), a fiery drummer from Germany leading her group Nevell (a jazz-funk-rock-pop fusion trio), and Anne Paceo (born 1984 in France), who is a drummer, composer and leader of the Circles project.\nAnika Nilles Nevell performs on the opening night of the festival, which runs for two days/evenings in various venues throughout the quaint hillside village of Dobrs, in South Bohemia’s Sumava foothills.\nAnother highlight of the first day is Pavel Fajt (born 1957 in Brno), a veteran avant-garde drummer percussionist initially noted for his collaborations with the experimental vocalist and violinist Iva Bittová. Fajt is an esteemed figure in the Czech experimental music scene from the 1970s into the current times. In 2001, Fajt released Drum Trek, displaying this master as a soloist with electronics.\nThe roll call of most noted drummers & percussionists on the main day includes Bodek Janke, Cyril Atef, Klaus Kugel and the final headliner Anne Paceo.\nBodek Janke performs his project SONG2, an experimental blend of pop songs from across decades under his jazz-improvisational arrangements and sung by the smooth and fragile-voiced Namibian vocalist Shishani Vranckx. Their repertoire includes jazz ballads “I Fall in Love Too Easily” (Chet Baker), along with 80s and 90s pop radio hits “What is Love” (Haddaway), “Rhythm is a Dancer” (Snap!), “Take on Me (A-ha), and “Eye of the Tiger (Survivor), to list only a few retro-pop nuggets.\nJanke (born 1979, Warsaw) is a Polish-Russian mostly raised and currently based in Germany. He has been schooled in classical conservatories (Karlsruhe) and jazz academies or specialty programs–the Academy of Music Cologne, and City College New York City (MA in Arts & Music Performance). SONG2 also features Estonian pianist Kristjan Randau, and British bassist Phillip Donkin.\nCyril Atef is a French-Persian percussionist and composer and he will bring his project Bumcello with Vincent Segal, who is handy on a wide variety of instruments. Their performances are multimedia and the high-tech visuals are essential to enhance their psychedelic-hypnotic groove with its exotic and experimental twists and turns. Their downtempo electronica is both modern-day primal and futuristic.\nAtef was born in Berlin (1968) then moved to Los Angeles, California, at the age of ten. In the mid-1980s he studied at the Percussion Institute of Technology and at the end of the 80s at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He has been based in Paris since 1990. The other half of Bumcello, Vincent Segal, was born 1967 in Reims, France, and he commands the stage on electric cello and as the lead vocalist.\nConcluding the festival is Anne Paceo, who has been awarded the Victories de la Musique (Jazz Artist of the Year in 2016) and Jazz Discovery of the Year in 2011. Her project Circles is a modern fusion jazz quartet with an uplifting female vocalist-rapper (Camille Durand) and sound-wise, they are a roaring thunder of drums & percussion thanks to Paceo along with saxophone (Christophe Panzani) and keyboards (Tony Paeleman). The roar of drums should be heard loudest of all and far and across the nearby valleys and mountains of South Bohemia for the concluding evening of this year’s festival.\nThe remaining artists/groups on the program include Klaus Kugel, a German master drummer from Munich, who has been a leading figure on the modern jazz scene in Central Europe. Then from the Czech Republic, JeN Hovorka (voice) and Marek Urbanek (drummer) combine urban beat rapping with funky drumming, and the MaBaSo Trio, featuring Czechs Daniel Soltis (drummer) and Michael Baranski (bassist) with Polish vibraphonist Bernard Maseli play a funky 70s jazz art-rock-fusion.\nThe only group in the festival sans drummer is Romanovská Tichý Hrubý & Blažíková. Yet, this group is a nod to the original orientation of the festival combining improvisational and classical musicians for the most curious of outcomes. In this case, the improv trio of classical violinist and koto player Anna Romanovská, classical and jazz double-bassist Peter Tichý, and the free jazz improviser saxophonist-clarinetist-flutist Michal Hrubý will be joined by the soprano and harpist Hana Blažíková, who is a most highly-regarded soprano on the Czech/European classical scene. Hrubý was also an initial organizer of this festival, in its first edition, so this group marks a return to the festival’s roots.\nDespite its size, in the village of Dobrš, this festival offers in this part of Europe the most eclectic first-rate international musicians performing experimental contemporary jazz, classical and pop music. Besides the main outdoor stage, smaller concerts are held in a Baroque church, a shady lawn beside a Gothic tower, and if necessary due to the weather, a barren pub makes for a cozy performance space.\nThe Fifth Annual Dobršská brána International Music Festival 2021 will be on August 13th & 14th.

{"question":"What makes free VPNs dangerous for privacy?","answer":"Free VPNs often have serious privacy flaws: 25% have DNS leaks, 85% contain questionable permissions and functions that hint at spying, and some contain malware. They typically enable aggressive advertising, may use location-based permissions to geo-target ads, and many request access to sensitive information like texts and user data. Some don't even encrypt traffic. Since they can't charge users, they often resort to these shady practices to make money.","context":["TechsPlace | When looking for a VPN service for the first time, most people start by looking at the free options. This is a bad idea. VPNs are supposed to establish a secure network between you and the server. They facilitate a secure transfer of data through encrypted tunnels. That way, VPN services protect you from prying eyes of snoopers, hackers, and government agencies looking to track your online activities. VPN is an excellent tool when it comes to internet privacy.\nHowever, not all VPNs are made the same. Some are not as secure as they may want you to believe. This is true for many of the free VPN services out there. In 2019, Top10VPN tested 150 of the most popular android VPNs on Google Play store with a total of 260M downloads and found that 25% had DNS leaks, 85% featured questionable permissions and functions in the source code that hint on spying, and 27 were flagged as malware as tested by VirusTotal. Here are the privacy flaws of free VPNs:\nThe presence of intrusive permissions doesn’t necessarily make a VPN unsecure, but it doesn’t mean that it’s safe either. Often, the presence of intrusive permissions and risky functions in a software program is a sign of hasty development that neglects the users’ need for privacy. Most of the free VPNs need to make money somehow. Seeing as they are ‘free,’ they can’t charge the users a nominal fee so they resort to shady practices.\nTo keep these VPN services free, most enable aggressive advertising within these applications. Some free VPN services even use location-based permissions and functionality to geo-target ads to users with an active VPN. Developers of free VPNs often bundle their software with excessive, intrusive permissions and functions. This could be deliberate or an unintended consequence of hasty development. Either way, consumers looking to protect their privacy with a VPN deserve better.\nMore than 60 percent of the applications tested contained risky functions potential for privacy abuses not expected from a VPN app. Many displayed the location manager exposing the device’s last known location. Intrusive permissions and risky functions open the door to potential abuse of privacy. Recent Android versions come with built-in protection for such applications. Application permissions are set to ‘denied’ by default until the app requests that they are allowed.\nWhat is a DNS leak? First, you’ll have to understand what a DNS is. DNS is short for Domain Name System, which functions as the phonebook of the Internet. In the human language, a website is in the form of a domain name, like google.com, but to the web browser, the destination is actually in the form of an Internet Protocol (IP) address. DNS translates your website query into an IP address so browsers and loads your requested page.\nA DNS leak occurs when a VPN fails to protect your device’s DNS queries even when the rest of your internet traffic is hidden the VPN tunnel. This happens when your query is fired at a DNS server (mostly owned by your ISP) that tracks internet activities. A DNS leak hence allows your DNS server operator and your internet service provider to access private data such as the apps you use and the websites you visit. If you’re wary of a leak, use a DNS leak test to find and fix it.\nIn 2017, the University of NSW and UC Berkley tested 283 Android VPNs. The test found that 38% contained malware or malvertising (malicious ads that contained viruses) that can steal passwords, 80% requested access to sensitive information such as texts and user data, and 20% did not even encrypt traffic — one of the key functions of a VPN. Most of the affected services are free VPNs.\nThis should come as no surprise. As the saying goes, if something is free, you are the product. In 2017, the Economist wrote: “The most valuable resource is no longer oil – it’s data.” Recognize this and you will see that tech and telecom companies out there, big and small, are all scrambling for your data in the most sneaky ways imaginable. Your privacy and cybersecurity are your own to protect, and you should never trust big brands or popular services to do that for you."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6da161c3-ca79-46eb-8f60-03c994a207e6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between structural and stratigraphic traps in hydrocarbon accumulation?","answer":"Structural traps are formed by structural deformation of rocks, such as folding and faulting, while stratigraphic traps are related to depositional or diagenetic features in the sedimentary sequence. This is evident in the salt diapir example from the Gulf of Mexico, where both structural features (faulting associated with the dome) and stratigraphic thinning (from 1.0 to 2.0 secs) contribute to trap formation. Many traps are actually combinations of both types, called strati-structural or combination traps.","context":["Salt Diapir—Gulf of Mexico\nM.T. Sunwall, K.A. McQuillan, C.J. Nick, 1983. \"Salt Diapir—Gulf of Mexico\", Seismic Expression of Structural Styles: A Picture and Work Atlas. Volume 1–The Layered Earth, Volume 2–Tectonics Of Extensional Provinces, & Volume 3–Tectonics Of Compressional Provinces, A. W. Bally\nDownload citation file:\nThis example is representative of piercement salt domes from the Gulf of Mexico, Outer Continental Shelf area. It is located Offshore Louisiana in sediments of Tertiary and Quaternary age. The seismic profile A-A' (Figures 1, 2) illustrates the piercement structure and several important stratigraphic phenomena. This profile trends east to west and is oriented perpendicular to the salt-sediment interface and also perpendicular to the structural strike of the beds. It is worthy to note that the orientation of a seismic profile in this manner is essential to obtaining good quality data over a salt dome.\nThe most graphic seismic anomaly on the profile is the reflection free zone, between shotpoints 350-400, which contains the salt intrusive (Figure 2). The interpretation of the salt configuration, given in Figure 3, is based on a combination of well control, gravity, reflection, and refraction data.\nThe faulting associated with the dome is basically of two types consisting of small normal faults on the domal crest and numerous radial faults emanating from the salt perimeter. Though the crestal faults are readily apparent on the A-A' profile the radial faults are difficult to interpret because their strike is identical to that of the seismic line, thus the fault traces parallel the bedding planes.\nThe stratigraphic thinning, evident in the interval from 1.0 to 2.0 secs (Figure 2), indicates that this dome was a positive structural feature at the time of sediment deposition. Therefore, it is probable that the structural traps around this dome were formed contemporaneous with deposition and thus were in place, able to trap hydrocarbons upon their generation and migration from the basin.\nFigures & Tables\nSeismic Expression of Structural Styles: A Picture and Work Atlas. Volume 1–The Layered Earth, Volume 2–Tectonics Of Extensional Provinces, & Volume 3–Tectonics Of Compressional Provinces\nUntil a few decades ago, structural and regional geology were traditionally the preserve of field geologists. They usually mapped areas of outcropping deformed rocks and supplemented their work by laboratory studies of rock deformation and by theoretical work. Structural geology became tied to the geology of uplifts, folded belts, and underground mines, all of which were accessible to direct observation. Since World War II we have witnessed a tremendous development of geophysics in oceanography and in petroleum geology. Academic geophysicists in oceanography led their geological colleagues into modern plate tectonics and industry geophysicists developed reflection seismology into a superb structural mapping tool that penetrated the subsurface.\nToday we are facing a situation where instruction and textbooks in structural geology are almost entirely dedicated to rock deformation, analytical techniques in detailed field geology and summaries of plate tectonics. Illustrations based on reflection seismic profiles are virtually absent in textbooks of structural geology. These texts illustrate only the parts of the proverbial elephant, together with some conjecture, but without ever offering a glimpse of the whole elephant.\nSome of the reason cited for the relative scarcity of published reflection profiles are: 1) the confidentiality of exploration data; 2) difficulties in the photographic reduction and reproduction of seismic profiles for a book format; 3) the two-dimensional nature of vertical reflection profiles; and 4) the obvious distortions in reflection profiles that are typically recorded in time.\nThe AAPG leadership felt that it was time to attempt to correct the situation and to produce this picture and work atlas. The first volumes, of what may become a series of volumes, are addressing an audience that includes: petroleum geologists concerned with structural interpretations; exploration companies that provide in-house training; the AAPG continuing education program; and academic colleagues interested in updating their curricula in structural geology by inclusion of reflection profiles from the “real world” in their teaching.\nThe atlas is not meant to be a textbook in reflection seismology (instead we listed some at the end of this introduction) nor a text in structural and/or regional geology. Our intent is simply to provide a teaching tool.","Hydrocarbon traps form where permeable reservoir rocks (carbonates, sandstones) are covered by rocks with low permeability (caprocks) that are capable of preventing the hydrocarbons from further upward migration. Typical caprocks are compacted shales, evaporites, and tightly cemented sandstones and carbonate rocks.\nThe caprock need not be 100% impermeable to water, oil or gas. If the upward loss of hydrocarbons is less than the supply of hydrocarbons from the source rocks to the trap, hydrocarbons may still accumulate…\nBasic Trap-Fluid Nomenclature\nTraps are usually classified according to the mechanism that produces the hydrocarbon accumulation. The two main groups of traps are those that are formed by structural deformation of rocks (structural traps), and those that are related to depositional or diagenetic features in the sedimentary sequence (stratigraphic traps).\nMany traps result from both of these factors (strati-structural or combination traps). A common example is stratigraphic pinch-out (e.g., a sandstone lens wedging into mudstone) that is combined with tectonic tilting (which allows hydrocarbons to pond in the updip part of the sandstone wedge). Other traps result mainly from fracturing (which creates the reservoir\nporosity) or hydrodynamic processes.\nThere are many classifications of hydrocarbon traps in use, but most have ~90% in common…\n1. Anticlinal (fold) and dome traps\ndirections). The simplest type of trap is formed when a sandstone bed that is overlain by\ntight (i.e. low permeability) shale is folded into an anticline. A simple anticline,\nhowever, may not necessarily be a trap. The crest of the anticline must have an apical\nculmination (i.e. a peak) somewhere along the fold axis so that hydrocarbons can be\ntrapped. Anticlinal traps are commonly detected by seismic reflection. In mature oilfields, most of these simple traps have probably been found, but many anticlinal traps remain to be discovered offshore and in new prospective areas.\nb) Salt domes: Strata around the salt dome curve upward creating traps against the sealing salt layers (see below for more details).\nc) Growth domes. Domes or anticlines that form during sedimentation when one area subsides more slowly than the surrounding areas. Their formation is concurrent with sedimentation (i.e. they form during deposition), and not due to later (tectonic) folding.\nGrowth anticlines may form due to differential compaction over salt domes or other upward-projecting features in the substrate (topographic highs on the buried landscape).\n2. Fault traps\nThe fault plane must have a sealing effect so that it functions as a fluid migration barrier for\nreservoir rocks. There are several common types of fault trap:\na) Normal faults — commonly associated with graben (rift) structures.\nb) Strike-slip faults — these may not be sealed due to incremental movements, but basement-controlled strike-slip faults commonly produce good anticlinal structures in overlying softer sediments.\nc) Thrust faults — commonly associated with compressional tectonics (e.g., the Front Ranges in Alberta).\nd) Growth faults — Growth faults typically form in sediments that are deposited rapidly, especially at deltas. Faulting occurs during sedimentation (i.e. syndepositionally), such that the equivalent strata on the downthrow side will be thicker than on the upthrow side.\nThe geometry and timing determine whether faults will be effective in forming fault traps:\n- Dead faults that predate basinal sediments only affect the underlying basement – they play no direct role in hydrocarbon trapping in the younger sedimentary pile.\n- Continuously developing faults (growth faults) — these are active during sedimentatioand are major petroleum traps (e.g., Niger Delta).\n- Young (late) faults —these form late during sedimentation; depending on their initiation and growth, they may or may not be effective as traps.\n- Late regenerated faults —these are new movements on old faults — they are more likely to destroy than form traps, but may be effective.\nMany petroleum fields are closely linked to faulting, but traps that result from faulting alone are less common. There are three common fault – petroleum pool associations:\n- The fault itself makes the trap without an ancillary trapping mechanism such as a fold —normal faults are the most common examples.\n- The fault creates another structure (e.g., a fold or horst) that in turn forms the main trap.\n- The fault may be a consequence of another structure that forms the main trap — e.g., the extensional crestal faults that form above some anticlines.\nImportant point: Faults are highly ambiguous features. They may leak, acting as permeable conduits for fluid flow (including oil and gas migration), but more commonly act as seals unless they are rejuvenated after petroleum has pooled.\nSALT DOME RESERVOIRS\nSalt domes form when salt is less dense than the overlying rock, and the salt moves slowly upwards due to its buoyancy. For this to happen, there must be a minimum overburden and the thickness of the salt deposits must be more than ~100 m. Upward movement of salt through the sedimentary strata, and associated deformation is termed halokinetics or salt tectonics. Movements may continue for several hundred million years.\nTraps may form (1) in the strata overlying the salt dome, (2) in the top of the salt domes (the cap rock - caused by brecciation and dissolution), (3) in the strata that curve upward against the salt intrusion (4) due to stratigraphic pinch-out of strata around the salt dome:\nSalt dome reservoirs produce major oilfields where basinal sediments contain thick salt deposits. Salt deposits are common in Permian-Jurassic sediments around the Atlantic Ocean. Examples include the Gulf of Mexico, where there is Permian and Jurassic salt, the Permian Zechstein salt in NW Europe and the North Sea.\nStratigraphic traps are created by any variation in the stratigraphy that is independent of structural deformation, although many stratigraphic traps involve a tectonic component such as tilting of strata.\nTwo main groups can be recognized —\nPrimary stratigraphic traps result from variations in facies that developed during sedimentation.\nThese include features such as lenses, pinch-outs, and appropriate facies changes.\n- Primary pinch out of strata, e.g., strata that pinch out updip in less permeable rocks such as shale;\n- Fluvial channels of sandstone that are isolated and surrounded by impermeable clay-rich sediments;\n- Submarine channels and sandstone turbidites in strata rich in shale;\n- Porous reefs that are surrounded by shale, etc.\nSecondary stratigraphic traps result from variations that developed after sedimentation, mainly because of diagenesis. These include variations due to porosity enhancement by dissolution or loss by cementation.\nPaleogeomorphic traps are controlled by buried landscape. Some are associated with\nprominences (hills); others with depressions (valleys). Many are also partly controlled by\nunconformities so are also termed unconformity traps.\nIf porewater flow in a sedimentary basin is strong enough, the oil-water contact may deviate from the horizontal because of the hydrodynamic shear stress that is set up. In some cases, oil may accumulate without closure. Flow of fresh (meteoric) water down through oil-bearing rocks commonly results in biodegradation of the oil and formation of asphalt, which may then form a cap rock for oil."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:49296eec-c789-4fb6-984a-96b1483f1cfe>","<urn:uuid:016f229b-0937-43a7-90e8-37ab9a042f76>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which military operation required more extensive jungle combat experience: the Merrill's Marauders' Burma campaign or the Bravo Company's training at Kahuku?","answer":"The Merrill's Marauders' Burma campaign involved far more extensive jungle combat experience. The Marauders marched over 1,000 miles through extremely dense jungles, engaging in five major and thirty minor engagements over four months of uninterrupted jungle fighting. Only the First Marine Division at Guadalcanal had comparable jungle fighting service. In contrast, Bravo Company's training at Kahuku Training Area was just a weeklong exercise focusing on basic squad-level tactics and MOUT training.","context":["'Lava Dogs' instill squad level tactics in new Marines\nMarines.mil | Oct 14 2013\nKAHUKU TRAINING AREA, Hawaii (October 4, 2013) - Marines and sailors with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment completed a weeklong exercise at Kahuku Training Area Oct. 4, 2013. The exercise focused on familiarizing new Marines with current training methods used within the company while helping seasoned Marines sustain knowledge they were already taught.\nBravo Company stayed at KTA for the duration of their training exercises to acclimate the new personnel to the environment and their fellow brethren. With new Marines fresh out of the School of Infantry, a majority of the exercises were conducted on a squad-level, allowing the squad leader and his team leaders to assess their new Marines' abilities.\n\"This exercise is essentially focusing on squad-sized evolutions,\" said 2ndLt Carl Stofberg, second platoon commander, Bravo Co., 1st Bn., 3rd Marines, and 23-year-old native of Glen Rock, N.J. \"We've got new Marines who are young and new to their platoons, so a few of these exercises will involve a lot of individual actions to see how much knowledge they've retained.\"\nFor the first evolution of the exercise, Marines conducted numerous squad patrols, such as daytime, night and reconnaissance patrols. Soon after, the squads transitioned into reacting to enemy ambushes while conducting a patrol.\nDuring periods of rest, the Marines would hydrate and discuss what they did right during the ambush and what areas they need to work on.\n\"In a nutshell, we're working on unit cohesion and just coming together as a squad,\" said Lance Cpl Ryan Lee, team leader with second platoon, Bravo Co., 1st Bn., 3rd Marines, and 20-year-old native of Brandon, Miss. \"We're going through basic procedures, but the key is to get them thinking individually and learning how to work together.\"\nLater in the week, Bravo Company advanced into the other two evolutions of the exercise, which involved raiding an objective and extracting a target within a Military Operations in Urban Terrain facility. Different squads of Marines took turns carrying out the evolutions.\n\"It's all about getting into that MOUT mindset and remembering your SOPs (standard operating procedures) when you're clearing a building,\" said Cpl Andrew Frank, acting platoon sergeant for third platoon, 1st Bn., 3rd Marines, and 22-year-old native of Walla Walla, Wash. \"This training helps mold the new Marines into that mindset. The goal is to get them performing at the same level as the other Marines.\"\nDuring the MOUT training, Marines used simunition rounds to illustrate the importance of not getting shot on the battlefield. Anyone who was impacted by a SIM round was taken out of play and became temporarily \"dead.\"\nSimunition rounds are a type of paintball ammunition that closely resembles actual ammunition.\n\"The new guys are retaining the training and are working hard to improve themselves,\" Lee said. \"They're beginning to learn what to do in actual (combat) situations, and they're whoopin' it here at Kahuku's.\"\nBravo Company completed one of its first training exercises that will lead into bigger exercises involving the company as a whole in the future, such as Island Viper and the Integrated Training Exercise.\n\"The team leaders are teaching their Marines everything they know because those Marines will be their replacements,\" Stofberg explained. \"(Through) more exercises, those younger Marines will begin to see how their training is molding them into future successful team leaders.\"\nMarines.mil is the official website of the United States Marine Corps and is maintained by the Marine Corps' Division of Public Affairs.","MERRILL' S MARAUDER\n5307 Composite Unit (Provisional)\nIn August 1943 at the \"Quebec Conference\", President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and other allied leaders decided that an American Long Range Penetration Mission behind the Japanese Lines in Burma was needed to destroy the Japanese supply lines and communications and to play havoc with the enemy forces while an attempt was made to reopen the much needed Burma Road.\nPresident Roosevelt issued a Presidential call for volunteers for \"A Dangerous and Hazardous Mission\". The call was answered by approximately 3,000 American soldiers. The volunteers came from State side units, from the jungles of Panama and Trinidad they came, from the campaigns of Guadalcanal, New Guinea, New Georgia they came, to answer the call, some battle scarred, some new to the ways of war, each different but with one thing in common. They Answered The Call.\nThe Unit was officially designated as the \"5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)\" Code Name: \"GALAHAD\", later it became popularly known as \"MERRILL'S MARAUDERS\" named after its leader, Brigadier General Frank Merrill. Formed into six combat teams (400 per team),color-coded Red, White, Blue, Green, Orange and Khaki, two teams to a Battalion, the rest formed the H.Q. and Air Transport Commands.\nAfter preliminary training operations were undertaken in great secrecy in the jungles of Central India, the Marauders began the long march up the Ledo Road and over the outlying ranges of the Himalayan Mountains into Burma. The Marauders with no tanks or heavy artillery to support them, walked over 1,000 miles through extremely dense and almost impenetrable jungles and came out with glory.\nIn Five major (WALAWBUM, SHADUZUP, INKANGAHTAWNG, NHPUM GA, & MYITKYINA) and thirty minor engagements, they defeated the veteran soldiers of the Japanese 18th Division (Conquerors of Singapore and Malaya) who vastly outnumbered the Marauders. Always moving to the rear of the main forces of the Japanese the Marauders completely disrupted the enemy supply and communication lines, and climaxed their behind the lines operations with the capture of Myitkyina Airfield, the only all-weather airfield in Northern Burma.\nThe attack on Myitkyina was the climax to four months of marching and combat in the Burma jungles. No other American force except the First Marine Division, which took and held Guadalcanal for four months, has had as much uninterrupted jungle fighting service as Merrill's Marauders. But no other American force anywhere had marched as far, fought as continuously or had to display such endurance, as the swift-moving, hard-hitting foot soldiers, of Merrill's Marauders\nWhen the Marauders attacked Myitkyina they had behind them over 800 miles of marching over jungle and mountain roads and tracks. They had to carry all their equipment and supplies on their backs and on the backs of pack mules. Re-supplied by air drops the Marauders often had to make a clearing in the thick jungle to receive the supplies.\nEvery wounded Marauder was evacuated, an extraordinary feat in itself. Each wounded Marauder had to be carried on a makeshift stretcher (usually made from bamboo and field jackets or shirts) by his comrades until an evacuation point was reached. These evacuation points where mostly small jungle village's, where the Marauders would then have to hack out a landing strip for the small Piper Cub Evac. Planes. The brave sergeant-pilots of the air-rescue unit would then land and take off in these very hazardous conditions, removing every seriously wounded Marauder one at a time. The small planes, stripped of all equipment except a compass, had room for the pilot and one stretcher.\nAt the end of their campaign all remaining Marauders still in action were evacuated to hospitals suffering from tropical diseases, exhaustion, and malnutrition or as the tags on their battered uniforms said \"A.O.E.\" (accumulation of everything).\nFor their accomplishments in Burma the Marauders were awarded the \"DISTINGUISHED UNIT CITATION\" in July, 1944. However in 1966 this award was redesignated as the \"PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION\" which is awarded by the President in the name of Congress. The Marauders also have the extremely rare distinction of having every member of the unit receive the \"BRONZE STAR\".\nThompson M1A1 submachine gun with 30-round magazine\n|Weight, empty||4.78 kg|\n|Barrel length||267 mm|\n|Rate of fire||~ 700 rpm|\n|Magazine capacity||20 or 30 rounds box|\n|Effective range||100-150 meters|\nNEW FORCES OF VALOR 2008 1/16\nU.S. SHERMAN M4A3"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a3db8678-5bc3-4df3-b031-f33813271561>","<urn:uuid:3b440e91-ea88-44fd-bd3c-c790d51d153f>"],"error":null}

The application domains where graph or network analytics are regularly applied include social media, finance, communication networks, biological networks, and many others. Despite much work on the topic, graph data management is still a nascent topic with many open questions. At the same time, I feel that the research in the database community is fragmented and somewhat disconnected from application domains, and many important questions are not being investigated in our community. This blog post is an attempt to summarize some of my thoughts on this topic, and what exciting and important research problems I think are still open.\nAt its simplest, graph data management is about managing, querying, and analyzing a set of entities (nodes) and interconnections (edges) between them, both of which may have attributes associated with them. Although much of the research has focused on homogeneous graphs, most real-world graphs are heterogeneous, and the entities and the edges can usually be grouped into a small number of well-defined classes.\nGraph processing tasks can be broadly divided into a few categories. (1) First, we may to want execute standard SQL queries, especially aggregations, by treating the node and edge classes as relations. (2) Second, we may have queries focused on the interconnection structure and its properties; examples include subgraph pattern matching (and variants), keyword proximity search, reachability queries, counting or aggregating over patterns (e.g., triangle/motif counting), grouping nodes based on their interconnection structures, path queries, and others. (3) Third, there is usually a need to execute basic or advanced graph algorithms on the graphs or their subgraphs, e.g., bipartite matching, spanning trees, network flow, shortest paths, traversals, finding cliques or dense subgraphs, graph bisection/partitioning, etc. (4) Fourth, there are “network science” or “graph mining” tasks where the goal is to understand the interconnection network, build predictive models for it, and/or identify interesting events or different types of structures; examples of such tasks include community detection, centrality analysis, influence propagation, ego-centric analysis, modeling evolution over time, link prediction, frequent subgraph mining, and many others [New10]. There is much research still being done on developing new such techniques; however, there is also increasing interest in applying the more mature techniques to very large graphs and doing so in real-time. (5) Finally, many general-purpose machine learning and optimization algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, ADMM) can be cast as graph processing tasks in appropriately constructed graphs, allowing us to solve problems like topic modeling, recommendations, matrix factorization, etc., on very large inputs [Low12].\nPrior work on graph data management could itself be roughly divided into work on specialized graph databases and on large-scale graph analytics, which have largely evolved separately from each other; the former has considered end-to-end data management issues including storage representations, transactions, and query languages, whereas the latter work has typically focused on processing specific tasks or types of tasks over large volumes of data. I will discuss those separately, focusing on whether we need “new” systems for graph data management and on open problems.\nGraph Databases and Querying\nThe first question I am usually asked when I mention graph databases is whether we really need a separate database system for graphs, or whether relational databases suffice. Personally I believe that graph databases provide a significant value for a large class of applications and will emerge as another vertical.\nIf the goal is to support some simple graph algorithms or graph queries on data that is stored in an RDBMS, then it is often possible to do those using SQL and user-defined functions and aggregations. However, for more complex queries, a specialized graph database engine is likely to be much more user-friendly and likely to provide significant performance advantages. Many of the queries listed above either cannot be mapped to SQL (e.g., flexible subgraph pattern matching, keyword proximity search) or the equivalent SQL is complex and hard to understand or debug. An abstraction layer that converts queries from a graph query language to SQL could address some of these shortcomings, but that will likely only cover a small fraction of the queries mentioned above. More importantly, graph databases provide efficient programmatic access to the graph, allowing one to write arbitrary algorithms against them if needed. Since there is usually a need to execute some graph algorithms or network science tasks in the application domains discussed above, that feature alone makes a graph database very appealing. Most graph data models also support flexible schemas — although an orthogonal issue, new deployments may choose a graph database for that reason.\nWhether a specialized graph database provides significant performance advantages over RDBMSs for the functionality common to both is somewhat less clear. For many graph queries, the equivalent SQL, if one exists, can involve many joins and unions and it is unlikely the RDBMS query optimizer could optimize those queries well (especially given the higher use of self-joins). It may also be difficult to choose among different ways to map a graph query into SQL. Queries that require recursion (e.g., reachability) are difficult to execute in a relational database, but are natural for graph databases. Graph databases can also employ specific optimizations geared towards graph queries and traversals. For example, graph databases typically store all the edges for a node with the node to avoid joins, and such denormalization can significantly help with traversal queries, especially queries that traverse multiple types of edges simultaneously (e.g., for subgraph pattern matching). Replicating node information with neighbors can reduce the number of cache misses and distributed traversals for most graph queries (at the expense of increased storage and update costs). Similarly, min cut-based graph partitioning techniques help in reducing the number of distributed queries or transactions, and similar optimizations can be effective in multi-core environments as well. On the other hand, there is less work on query optimization in graph databases, and for simple queries (especially simple subgraph pattern matching queries), the query optimizer in relational databases may make better decisions than many of today’s graph databases.\nI think exploring such optimizations and understanding the tradeoffs better are rich topics for further research. For example, how the graph is laid out, both in persistent storage and in memory, can have a significant impact on the performance, especially in multi-core environments. We also need to better understand the common access patterns that are induced by different types of queries or tasks, and the impact of different storage representations on the performance of those access patterns. Another key challenge for graph querying is developing a practical query language. There is much theoretical work on this problem [Woo12] and several languages are currently used in practice, including SPARQL, Cypher, Gremlin, and Datalog. Among those, SPARQL and Cypher are based primarily on subgraph pattern matching and can handle a limited set of queries, whereas Gremlin is a somewhat low-level language and may not be easy to optimize. Datalog (used in LogicBlox and Datomic) perhaps strikes the best balance, but is not as user-friendly for graph querying and may need standardization of some of the advanced constructs, especially aggregates.\nUnfortunately I see little work on these problems, and on end-to-end graph databases in general, in our community. There are quite a few graph data management systems being actively built in the industry, including Neo4j, Titan, OrientDB, Datomic, DEX, to name a few, where these issues are being explored. Much of the work in our community, on the other hand, is more narrowly focused on developing search algorithms and indexing techniques for specific types of queries; while that work has resulted in many innovative techniques, for wide applicability and impact, it is also important to understand how those fit into a general-purpose graph data management system.\nLarge-scale Graph Analytics\nUnlike the above scenario, the case of new systems for graph analysis tasks, broadly defined to include graph algorithms and network science and graph mining tasks, is more persuasive. Batch analytics systems like relational data warehouses and MapReduce-based systems are not a good fit for graph analytics as is. From the usability perspective, it is not natural to write graph analysis tasks using those programming frameworks. Some graph programming models (e.g., the vertex-centric programming model [Mal10]) can be supported in a relational database through use of UDFs and UDAs [Jin14]; however it is not clear if the richer programming frameworks (discussed below) can also be efficiently supported. Further, many graph analysis tasks are inherently iterative, with many iterations and very little work per vertex per iteration, and thus the overheads of\nthose systems may start dominating and may be hard to amortize away.\nA more critical question, in my opinion, is whether the popular vertex-centric programming model is really a good model for graph analytics. To briefly recap, in this model, users write vertex-level compute programs, that are then executed iteratively by the framework in either a bulk synchronous fashion or asynchronous fashion using message passing or shared memory. This model is well-suited for some graph processing tasks like computing PageRank or connected components, and also for several distributed machine learning and optimization tasks that can be mapped to message passing algorithms in appropriately constructed graphs [Low12]. Originally introduced in this context in Google’s Pregel system [Mal10], several graph analytics systems are built around this model (e.g., Giraph, Hama, GraphLab, PowerGraph, GRACE, GPS, GraphX).\nHowever, most graph analysis tasks (e.g., the popular modularity optimization algorithm for community detection, betweenness centralities) or graph algorithms (e.g., matching, partitioning) cannot be written using the vertex-centric programming model while permitting efficient execution. The model limits the compute program’s access to a single vertex’s state and so the overall computation needs to be decomposed into smaller local tasks that can be (largely) independently executed; it is not clear how to do this for most of the computations discussed above, without requiring a large number of iterations. Even local neighborhood-centric analysis tasks (e.g., counting motifs, identifying social circles, computing local clustering coefficients) are inefficient to execute using this model; one could execute such a task by constructing multi-hop neighborhoods in each node’s local state by exchanging neighbor lists, but the memory required to hold that state can quickly make it infeasible [Qua14]. I believe these limitations are the main reason why most of the papers about this model focus on a small set of tasks like PageRank, and also why we don’t see broad adoption of this model for graph analysis tasks, unlike the MapReduce framework, which was very quickly and widely adopted.\nSome of the alternative, and more expressive, programming models proposed in recent years include distributed Datalog-based framework used by Socialite [Seo13], data-centric programming models of Ligra [Shu13] and Galois [Ngu13], Green-Marl DSL [Hon12], and NScale framework from our recent work [Qua14]. Unlike the vertex-centric frameworks, however, distributed data-parallel execution is not straightforward for these frameworks, and investigating the trade-offs between expressiveness, ability to parallelize the computations, and ease-of-use remains a crucial challenge. The equivalence between graph analytics and matrix operations [Mat13], and whether that leads to better graph analysis systems, also need to be explored in more depth.\nOn a related note, the need for distributed execution of graph processing tasks is often taken as a given. However, graphs with 10’s to 100’s of billions of edges can be loaded onto a single powerful machine today, depending on the amount of information per node that needs to be processed (Ligra reports experiments on a graph with 12.9 billion edges with 256GB memory [Shu13]; in our recent work, we were able to execute a large number of streaming aggregate queries over a graph with 300 million edges on a 64GB machine [Mon14a]). Given the difficulty in distributing many graph analysis/querying tasks, it may be better to investigate approaches that eliminate the need to execute any single query or task in a distributed fashion (e.g., through aggressive compression, careful encoding of adjacency lists, or careful staging to disk or SSD (a la GraphChi)), while parallelizing independent queries/tasks across different machines.\nOther Open questions\nDespite much work, there are many important and hard problems that remain open in graph data management, in addition to the ones discussed above; more challenges are likely to come up as graph querying and analytics are broadly adopted.\nNeed for a Benchmark: Given the complex tradeoffs, many of the questions discussed above would be hard to answer without some representative workloads and benchmarks, especially because the performance of a system may be quite sensitive to the skew in the degree distribution and the graph diameter. Some of issues, e.g., storage representation, have been studied in depth in the context of RDF triple-stores, but the benchmarks established there appear to focus on scale and do not feature sufficient variety in the queries. A benchmark covering a variety of graph analysis tasks would also help significantly towards evaluating and comparing the expressive power and the performance of different frameworks and systems. Benchmarks would also help reconcile some of the recent conflicting empirical comparisons, and would help shed light on specific design decisions that impact performance significantly.\nTemporal and real-time analytics: Most real-world graphs are highly dynamic in nature and often generate large volumes of data at a very rapid rate. Temporal analytics or querying over historical traces can lead to deeper insights into various phenomena, especially those related to evolution or change. One of the key challenges here is how to store the historical trace compactly while still enabling efficient execution of point queries and global or neighborhood-centric analysis tasks [Khu13]. Key differences from temporal databases, a topic that has seen much work, appear to be the scale of data, focus on distributed and in-memory environments, and the need to support global analysis tasks (which usually require loading entire historical snapshots into memory). Similarly real-time querying and analytics, especially anomaly detection, present several unique challenges not encountered in relational data stream processing [Mon14b].\nGraph extraction: Another interesting, and practically important, question is how to efficiently extract a graph, or a collection of graphs, from non-graph data stores. Most graph analytics systems assume that the graph is provided explicitly. However, in many cases, the graph may have to be constructed by joining and combining information spread across a set of relations or files or key-value stores. A general framework that allows one to specify what graph or graphs need to be constructed for analysis, and how they map to the data stored in the persistent data stores would significantly simplify the end-to-end process of graph analytics. Even if the data is stored in a graph data store, often we only need to load a set of subgraphs of that graph for further analysis [Qua14], and similar framework would be needed to specify what subgraphs are to be extracted.\nThe above list is naturally somewhat skewed towards the problems we are working on in our group at Maryland, and towards developing general-purpose graph data management systems. In addition, there is also much work that needs to be done in the application areas like social media, finance, cybersecurity, etc.; in developing graph analytics techniques that lead to meaningful insights in those domains; in understanding what types of query workloads are typical; and in handling those over large volumes of data.\nBlogger Profile: Amol Deshpande is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland with a joint appointment in the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS).

But king cauli is super versatile, vibrant and marries beautifully with a number of different flavours.\nWhat to look out for?\nA good quality and fresh cauliflower will be extra sweet and tasty. To be sure of freshness, buy one that’s really firm and not starting to look a bit sad and limp. Also try to pick one that’s bright white and not starting to discolour and brown on the outside of the florets.\nWhat does it go with?\nCheese is a real crowd pleaser, but there are also so many other options. Try it with anchovies - boil some chopped cauliflower well, then add to a pan with plenty of anchovies, garlic, parsley and olive oil and mix with pasta. Spices and curry flavours are a match made in heaven with cauliflower (think cumin or garam masala). As a member of the brassica family, it will also go great with salty pork flavours, as with our special recipe at the bottom.\nDon't throw away those leaves! Roast 'em up in a hot oven with olive oil and salt for 20 mins or so until the leaves are browned and wilted, and the white rib of the leaf is tender. Delicious!\nWhat does the nutritionist say?\nOur featured nutritional specialist Emily Moreton tells us: Cauliflower is a great source of Vitamin C, just a quarter of a small sized cauliflower will give you 43 mg of Vitamin C, which is your entire daily requirement!\nYou could have a go at a fermented Piccalilli, if not for the potential health benefits for your gut microbes, then for the electrifying colour and tangy crunch. Cauliflower is a core ingredient in the yellow preserve piccalilli which uses vegetables of the garden with Indian spices and makes a great addition to a Christmas cheese board. Although the scientific literature is quite limited at the moment around fermented foods, anecdotally speaking this doesn’t mean to say that they don’t have any health benefits, we just need more evidence.\nWhat are our favourite ways to prepare it?\nRoast your cauliflower in a very hot oven and it will start to colour, char even. As it goes brown it will develop a delicious nutty flavour; try roasted cauliflower with a tahini sauce! Simply boiled and cooled it’s also great in a salad with a tangy dressing and herbs. It also makes a simple and luxurious soup, as with our delicious recipe below.\nWhat did you say?\nWe asked on our Instagram what you love to do with the cauli. 'Roasted' was the answer we saw most. Of course, we got lots of cauliflower cheese shouts...I mean who doesn't love it doused in cheddary bechamel?! The curry combo was also very popular....two words: aloo gobi! We had some other really inspiring answers...poached in butter, deep fried, dipped in aioli, and au gratin!\nRecipe Time: Our Cauliflower Recipe for Eat the Seasons.\nThis soup is a beauty. It won't take you all day and has relatively few ingredients. It's not excessively heavy but it feels super indulgent as it's silky, thick and bursting with luxurious flavour. The nuts and crispy pork add texture and contrast; feel free to leave out the pancetta if you are veggie. If you like truffle, you can also drizzle a little truffle oil over it at the end! If you want to bring a cauliflower '2 ways' kind of vibe to the soup, you can also roast a few florets in the oven and then serve on top of the soup with the other garnishes!\nClick HERE for the visual recipe guide on our Instagram!\nCreamy Cauliflower Soup with Crispy Pancetta and Roasted Hazelnuts\n- 100g pancetta or gunaciale, cut into lardons if not bought chopped. (Guanciale is cured pig cheek, and in Italy it's not a proper Carbonara or Amatriciana unless you use Guanciale! But it's hard to find so pancetta is also fine.)\n- Handful of hazelnuts, roughly chopped\n- 1 white onion, finely sliced\n- 2 cloves garlic, chopped\n- 1 small/medium cauliflower, chopped into small pieces\n- 500ml milk\n- 500ml water\n- 50ml of cream\n- Handful of grated Parmesan\n- Glug of extra virgin olive oil\n- Chives, chopped, to garnish\n- Salt and pepper, to season\n- Fry the pancetta, or guanciale in a frying pan on a medium heat until nice and crispy. You don't need any oil in the pan to cook it, it will release its own fat. Once brown and crispy, remove from the pan and put on some kitchen paper.\n- Put the hazelnuts in the pan in which you cooked the pancetta and toast the nuts on a medium heat for around 5 mins until lightly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside, leaving the fat in the pan.\n- Add the onion to the pan; there should be some pork fat left in the pan, depending on the fattiness of the pancetta. Add a good glug of good olive oil to help with frying the onions (unless the pork was super fatty and the pan is already swimming with oil). Add a good pinch of salt and fry on a medium heat for around 10 minutes, until the onions are well softened. Add the garlic and fry for a futher 2 minutes.\n- Pour the contents of the onion pan into a deep saucepan, then add the cauliflower, milk, cream, Parmesan and water. The cauliflower should be just covered in liquid. Bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes, depending on how small you chopped your cauliflower. We are looking for the cauliflower to be completely soft and cooked through, not 'al dente', otherwise it won't blend to a smooth soup.\n- Once you are happy the cauliflower is well cooked and soft, pour the mixture into a blender and blend until luxuriously smooth. You can also put a stick blender in the pan and blend that way. Season well with salt and pepper and check the taste; it needs to be well seasoned to make it sing - you can also add more Parmesan if you feel it needs it! If you're feeling a bit naughty you could also whisk in a little butter ;)\n- Ladle into bowls and garnish with the pancetta, hazelnuts and chives. Enjoy with some freshly baked bread and butter!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ae0dbb35-f4a3-41a5-b89f-a40c621ff9f9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hi! I'm doing research on brain hormones. Could you tell me whether oxytocin affects both alcohol consumption and social bonding?","answer":"Yes, oxytocin affects both alcohol consumption and social bonding. Research shows that oxytocin administration reduces binge-like alcohol drinking through signaling at oxytocin receptors in the brain. Additionally, oxytocin plays a critical role in social behaviors including social recognition, communication, parental care, and social bonding, as demonstrated in studies with monogamous rodents like prairie voles.","context":["Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that exogenous administration of oxytocin (OT) may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for reducing heavy alcohol drinking. However, it remains unknown whether these effects are mediated by stimulation of endogenous sources of OT and signaling at oxytocin receptors (OTR) in brain or in the periphery. To address this question, we employed a targeted chemogenetic approach to examine whether selective activation of OT-containing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) alters alcohol consumption in a binge-like drinking (“Drinking-in-the-Dark”; DID) model. Adult male Oxt-IRES-Cre mice received bilateral infusion of a Cre-dependent virus containing an excitatory DREADD (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry) or control virus (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry) into the PVN. Chemogenetic activation of PVNOT+ neurons following clozapine-N-oxide injection reduced binge-like alcohol drinking in a similar manner as systemic administration of the neuropeptide. Pretreatment with a brain-penetrant OTR antagonist (L-368,899) reversed this effect while systemic administration of a peripherally restricted OTR antagonist (Atosiban) did not alter reduced alcohol drinking following chemogenetic activation of PVNOT+ neurons. Altogether, these data are the first to demonstrate that targeted activation of hypothalamic (endogenous) OT reduces alcohol consumption, providing further evidence that this neuropeptide plays a role in regulation of alcohol self-administration behavior. Further, results indicate that the ability OT to reduce alcohol drinking is mediated by signaling at OTR in the brain.\nSubscribe to Journal\nGet full journal access for 1 year\nonly $9.15 per issue\nAll prices are NET prices.\nVAT will be added later in the checkout.\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nRent or Buy article\nGet time limited or full article access on ReadCube.\nAll prices are NET prices.\nAddolorato G, Vassallo GA, Antonelli G, Antonelli M, Tarli C, Mirijello A, et al.

It causes a major mental developmental arrest at an early age. Some children begin to develop speech and then regress, a factor that has led to unfortunate theories of causation, such as the hysteria about childhood immunization. Now, a cluster of cases among Somali immigrants in Minnesota might offer some new leads to the cause.\nAutism and schizophrenia share some similarities in that both conditions result in problems with social interaction and functional behavior. The autistic child fails to develop speech and other social behavior such as emotional attachment to others. Schizophrenia has similar effects on interpersonal behavior. The autistic child often seems to live in a world cut off from others, responding to inner stimulation but unable to relate to parents or other children. Similarly, the schizophrenic is unable to interpret visual cues and social interaction is difficult. The schizophrenic typically has auditory hallucinations, hearing voices. The autistic child may have similar inner stimuli but is unable to express what is happening because of speech failure.\nThere are theories about schizophrenia as a consequence of brain development, especially the phenomenon of cerebral dominance which gives us speech and handedness. Now, new theories implicate hormone changes that might be common to both conditions. Animal studies have suggested this association.\nUnderstanding the neurobiological substrates regulating normal social behaviours may provide valuable insights in human behaviour, including developmental disorders such as autism that are characterized by pervasive deficits in social behaviour. Here, we review the literature which suggests that the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin play critical roles in modulating social behaviours, with a focus on their role in the regulation of social bonding in monogamous rodents. Oxytocin and vasopressin contribute to a wide variety of social behaviours, including social recognition, communication, parental care, territorial aggression and social bonding. The effects of these two neuropeptides are species-specific and depend on species-specific receptor distributions in the brain. Comparative studies in voles with divergent social structures have revealed some of the neural and genetic mechanisms of social-bonding behaviour. Prairie voles are socially monogamous; males and females form long-term pair bonds, establish a nest site and rear their offspring together. In contrast, montane and meadow voles do not form a bond with a mate and only the females take\npart in rearing the young. Species differences in the density of receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin in ventral forebrain reward circuitry differentially reinforce social-bonding behaviour in the two species.\nThis is from Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences. 2006 Dec 29;361(1476):2187-98., “Oxytocin, vasopressin and pair bonding: implications for autism.”, by Hammock EA, Young LJ.\nThis may seem a rather far fetched association with human autism but there is more.\nCNS neuroscience & therapeutics. 2008 Fall;14(3):165-70., “Oxytocin levels in social anxiety disorder.”, by Hoge EA, Pollack MH, Kaufman RE, Zak PJ, Simon NM.\nDepartment of Economics, Claremont University, Claremont, CA, USA.\nOxytocin is a neuropeptide recently associated with social behavior in animals and humans, but the study of its function in populations with social deficits such as autism, schizophrenia, and social anxiety disorder has only recently begun. We measured plasma oxytocin in 24 patients with Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD) and 22 healthy controls using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There were no significant differences in oxytocin level (pg/mL) between patients (M=163.0, SD=109.4) and controls (M=145.0, SD=52.9, z=0.21, P=0.8). Within the GSAD sample, however, higher social anxiety symptom severity adjusted for age and gender was associated with higher oxytocin level (R2=0.21, beta=0.014, SE=0.006, t=2.18, P=0.04). In addition, dissatisfaction with social relationships was associated with higher oxytocin levels (R2=0.18, beta=-0.20, SE=0.10, t=-2.01, P=0.05). Our data provide preliminary support for a link between social anxiety severity and plasma oxytocin. These findings may suggest a possible role for oxytocin as a facilitator of social behavior, an effect which may not be fully utilized in individuals with severe social anxiety.\nThis is very preliminary but the existence of the Somali cluster of autism cases might allow further work in this association. Oxytocin has been known as the hormone that begins labor and brings the mother’s milk “down” but it is increasingly seen as having other roles in human behavior. It is not unusual to see the hormones, originally thought to have a single function, assume new roles as physiology is investigated. It would be very interesting if these hormones turn out to play a major role in mental illness. Freud is finally gone from the treatment of major mental illness.\n“This is one of the first looks into the biological basis for human attachment and bonding,” said Rebecca Turner, PhD, UCSF adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry and lead author of the study. “Our study indicates that oxytocin may be mediating emotional experiences in close relationships.”\nThe study builds upon previous knowledge of the important role oxytocin plays in the reproductive life of mammals. The hormone facilitates nest building and pup retrieval in rats, acceptance of offspring in sheep, and the formation of adult pair-bonds in prairie voles. In humans, oxytocin stimulates milk ejection during lactation, uterine contraction during birth, and is released during sexual orgasm in both men and women.\nVasopressin is also involved, especially in males. Vasopressin is a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland and associated with water retention by the kidney. It now appears that it has other functions, as well.\nProgress in brain research. 2008;170:337-50.\nNeuropeptides and social behaviour: effects of oxytocin and vasopressin in\nHeinrichs M, Domes G.\nDepartment of Psychology, Clinical Psychology and Psychobiology, University of\nZurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\nThe fundamental ability to form attachment is indispensable for human social relationships. Impairments in social behaviour are associated with decreased quality of life and psychopathological states. In non-human mammals, the neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are key mediators of complex social behaviours, including attachment, social recognition and\naggression. In particular, OXT reduces behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to social stress and seems both to enable animals to overcome their natural avoidance of proximity and to inhibit defensive behaviour, thereby facilitating approach behaviour.\nDoesn’t this sound like autism ?\nAVP has primarily been implicated in male-typical social behaviours, including aggression and pair-bond formation, and mediates anxiogenic effects. Initial studies in humans suggest behavioural, neural, and endocrine effects of both neuropeptides, similar to those found in animal studies.\nSchizophrenia is more common in males and is hereditary. Anxiety is a major factor. There may also be a hereditary association in autism. This is enormously exciting research and might even be the first sign of a cure for these disorders of brain function."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6efc70bb-5a8a-48df-8fe5-f35e18c4546f>","<urn:uuid:4c7ad8dc-a83f-448c-a085-1e678514d394>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does headless architecture affect content management tasks and what tech advantages it provides for website performance?","answer":"In content management, headless architecture makes content managers and marketers more dependent on developers for updates, as they require support for custom coding rather than using a traditional CMS. However, it enables content reuse across multiple platforms through API calls. On the technical side, headless architecture improves website performance by allowing the frontend to be hosted on serverless computing services for better response times. It enables single-page applications that dynamically rewrite webpages rather than loading new pages from servers, eliminating wait times for client-server communication and providing faster user experiences.","context":["Headless commerce isn’t as scary as it sounds (or it might be, depending on the expertise of your developer). Essentially, it means that the frontend of your ecommerce platform is separated from the backend, unlike traditional ecommerce where the two are tightly bound.\nThis article takes a deep dive into what that looks like but isn’t meant to be an in-depth discussion of the technical aspects of headless commerce. Instead, we’ll focus on the business side of headless commerce—the benefits, challenges, and some illustrative examples.\nWhat is Headless Commerce?\nThe technical definition: headless commerce is an ecommerce system in which the backend, where orders and payments are processed and data is stored, is separate from the frontend interface that the user interacts with when placing an order.\nIf you’re considering making the switch to headless commerce, this definition isn’t really of use. It’s full of jargon and doesn’t provide much insight into why or how you and your team might go about this.\nHere’s A Better Way To Explain Headless Commerce\nWith a lunch tray.\nThe lunch tray represents the backend of your ecommerce system, and your lunch is the frontend.\nIn traditional ecommerce, the lunch tray influences what you order for lunch, while in a headless architecture you have more flexibility in what you order.\nTraditional Ecommerce = Compartmentalized Lunch Tray\nGo back to your grade school cafeteria, where you grab a tray for lunch. The tray has set compartments for each part of the meal.\nThere’s a spot or two for sides, a section for a drink, and a big compartment in the middle for the main course. You have your choice of a main course, sides, and drinks, but the lunch tray always has the same layout and doesn’t permit, say, ordering two mains and no sides.\nIf you wanted to do that, you’d need a whole new lunch tray with a different layout. This might take weeks or months for the manufacturer to make and, even after all that, you might decide you preferred the first option.\nIn the same way, the backend of traditional ecommerce systems limits the frontend presentation layer of your ecommerce system. The backend and frontend are tightly linked, so changes to the frontend also require changes to the backend, the same way that if you want two main courses and no sides for lunch, you need to change the lunch tray.\nHeadless Commerce = Flat Lunch Tray\nIn a different cafeteria, you grab a tray for lunch. This tray is flat, without any compartments.\nWhat you order for lunch isn’t limited by the compartments. The lunch tray and your order are not so tightly linked, and you don’t need different trays for ordering a main course and a side one day, and two sides the next.\nHeadless commerce is not limited by the constraints of the backend. While there is still a connection between the backend and frontend (after all, you still need a tray to carry your lunch on), you are free to make changes to one or the other without needing to update both, or get a new tray, so to speak.\nHere’s an example of product attributes and characteristics to illustrate:\nSay a customer is looking for pots and pans.\nEcommerce managers and marketers might classify the pots and pans products in a few different ways depending on sales or campaigns they want to promote. For example, they might be listed separately under kitchenware, or as a set under kitchenware sets. They might be under-sale or clearance items, or sorted by color, size, number of items in the set, or other ways.\nThe classification system that the attributes are part of needs to be applied the same way across every frontend that is part of the ecommerce architecture. This classification structure ensures products and content are properly retrieved across the various frontends.\nLet’s go back to the lunch tray analogy.\nWith attributes and characteristics used in headless commerce systems, a “lunch tray” that denotes which items can be ordered and where they are placed isn’t needed.\nRather than orders being based on what can fill the tray, it’s based on the attributes of what you want for lunch.\nFor example, at lunch, you might be in the mood for something:\nThat has vegetables in it\nIs served hot\nIs a large portion\nThat costs less than $10\nIf you input these attributes into your lunch order, you might receive a choice between a spicy Thai curry dish and a spicy minestrone. In this way—in headless commerce—you have more ways to offer choice to users and to make your products accessible to them.\nWhile both ecommerce systems have their uses, headless commerce is arguably the superior option—for your customers, your ecommerce team, and your business overall.\nBenefits Of Headless Commerce for Customers\nHeadless commerce provides a few key benefits for customers and, since they ultimately decide the success of your ecommerce business, you’ll want to keep them happy.\n1. More choice.\nWith headless commerce, you can use APIs to connect your backend to any frontend or create custom frontends, giving your customers more ways to shop beyond your website. Think social commerce, voice-controlled ecommerce, or custom frontends.\n2. Ease of ordering.\nBy providing more frontend options, or customizing a frontend that shortens the ordering process, customers will find it easier to order. They won’t need to go through your entire website checkout process when you have a custom one-click ordering frontend.\nConvenience is very important to customers. They will abandon an order at the first inconvenience. Keep your customers on your ecommerce platform by providing them the ease and convenience of ordering through their preferred method.\nBenefits Of Headless Commerce for Ecommerce Teams\nDevelopers, ecommerce managers, and content managers all benefit from headless commerce as well. While planning for and developing numerous frontends might seem like extra work, the benefits of headless commerce balance this out.\n1. Integrate with any system.\nRather than be tied to one frontend ecommerce solution, your team can use several to cover every system, so you don’t miss out on the opportunities afforded by other systems. You can integrate one backend with multiple eCommerce architectures.\nLina Bustos, an ecommerce strategist and author for Ecommerce Illustrated, explains:\n“Now that most ecommerce platform vendors have decoupled their front ends from their back ends and “gone headless,” headless commerce is more accessible than ever. Today, single-page applications and progressive web apps are table stakes, which is great for both front and back end developers, who no longer have to coordinate everything they do with each other (something that responsive design made even more tricky). Fast-loading pages also are great for customers and conversion!”\n2. Faster updates.\nAs the backend and frontend are separated in headless systems, updates are faster because you don’t need to update both every time. In traditional ecommerce, changes to the frontend require difficult changes to the backend as well, but not in headless commerce.\n3. Easier to scale.\nAs you don’t need to update the backend for every change to the frontend, it’s easier to scale your ecommerce solution up or down. You can adjust your ecommerce architecture as you see fit and add new frontends.\nFrontend developers can be more flexible and creative in their work, as they are not limited by the constraints that the backend puts on frontend development. Give your developers the freedom to come up with the latest and greatest.\n5. Less Downtime.\nWith fewer updates to the backend when you update the frontend, it follows that there is less downtime while you’re performing and testing any updates. Updates are also less risky because you don’t need to update the backend, so there is less risk of breaking it.\n6. Reuse of Content.\nWith traditional ecommerce, putting your content on multiple platforms involves manually adding it to those platforms. With headless applications, you can focus on content commerce, and reuse your content in many places, because it can simply be called by an API and used across every frontend.\n“Another great benefit of headless is the ability to give business teams a more user-friendly content management system (CMS) or digital experience platform (DXP) to load their content and make frequent (even daily) changes to the site without involving IT. This is HUGE as, in the past, sometimes even changing a home page banner could take hours of work and cost thousands of dollars through a development partner, let alone creating amazing landing pages and merchandising features.”\nBenefits Of Headless Commerce for Businesses\nThere are benefits for businesses too, which include the continued delivery of content and convenient ordering to customers.\n1. More flexibility and customization.\nWith headless, you can more easily adapt your ecommerce strategy to where your customers are and how they are buying. You can give them the frontend experience they are looking for. For example, if your audience moves to use more voice-controlled shopping, you can follow them there by creating a custom frontend that allows this.\n2. More agile.\nHeadless commerce keeps you agile and competitive. You can quickly implement new frontend platforms without much downtime, as well as keep up with competitors and avoid lagging behind because of long development and testing times.\n3. Implement omnichannel.\nWith more customization, you’ll be able to ensure a seamless experience across ecommerce platforms and systems that you’re using as part of your omnichannel marketing strategy. This is important for boosting your conversion rate and retaining customers. Currently, only about 52% of businesses have implemented omnichannel. Be in that percentage with headless commerce.\nChallenges of Headless Commerce\nFor all the benefits of headless commerce, there are challenges that ecommerce teams will need to consider.\n1. Managing Roles And Responsibilities\nWith both traditional and headless ecommerce, many team members are involved in implementing, maintaining, and improving the experience for customers. This can involve marketers, ecommerce managers, content managers, and frontend and backend developers.\nIn traditional ecommerce, roles are easily defined because everyone can work on their task independently. For example, content managers can update content without necessarily needing input from developers.\nIn headless commerce, team members need input from each other, especially when ensuring the user’s journey is coherent and seamless. This might slow down workflow in the short term, but it can benefit your team as well because, by collaborating with team members in different departments, they can avoid fishbowl thinking.\nThe main way to avoid a slowdown is to define workflows that minimize back and forth and streamline content, development, and user journey updates.\n2. Content Managers And Marketers Are Less Independent\nBecause the frontend requires custom coding by developers, marketers aren’t as free to go into the system and add and update content as they would with a traditional CMS and digital commerce platform. They will require support from a developer, which can be time-consuming and can cause a loss of agility.\nThe best way to tackle this is the same as above. Define a workflow that allows marketers to be as agile as possible.\n3. Additional Work For Frontend Developers\nWithout a default frontend, developers need to build a custom one for each application or frontend in use. This is more work upfront, and this process is ongoing as you add more applications and as maintenance is required.\nTime management will become more important for frontend developers, as will allocating time for testing and maintenance. You’ll also want to make sure you’re following UX best practices for each channel.\nThe Birth Of A New Generation Of Headless Commerce: Microservices\nWith headless commerce now so common, there’s the next generation of headless commerce: microservices. This approach goes steps further than just separating front and back and starts chipping away at the commerce platform itself.\nTo get insight on this topic, I reached out to the aforementioned Lina Bustos, an ecommerce specialist and author for Ecommerce Illustrated. Here’s her explanation of microservices and where she sees the new generation “headed”:\n“Because most commerce platforms are deployed as one system (monolithic code), all pieces of the platform such as catalog, cart, checkout, customer accounts, pricing, payments, and promotions are all tightly woven together. This means that any changes or updates to the platform or content impacts this large block of code, and can potentially break something anywhere in the platform. IT has to be very careful about managing the commerce application, and business users often are restricted from making updates independently (like adding promotions, changing pricing, or creating new categories).\nWith microservices, a promotions service (for example) would be its own application. And like with a CMS, business users could (with the right business user tooling) add, modify, delete and schedule promotions independent of IT. The microservice could also be extended to new touchpoints and experiences, like an airport vending machine or pop-up shop, so customers could apply the same discounts from the online shop anywhere they encounter the brand or retailer, and self-checkout through their mobile phones (connecting to cart, checkout, and payment microservices).\nMicroservices can also scale independently, which helps site performance and uptime. Net-a-Porter, for example, built a microservices system to support the traffic spike for their twice-annual clearance sales (events that would ALWAYS bring down the site).\nWith analysts recommending IT and business teams to choose more modular platforms to run ecommerce, and more vendors embracing microservices architecture, I predict we’ll see more and more online merchants (large and small) using them by 2022, and blending commerce with unconventional touchpoints like voice assistants, chatbots and in-store digital.”\nHeadless Commerce Platform Examples\nA good way to understand how headless commerce works is with concrete examples. We’ve put together a few examples of headless commerce solutions currently being offered.\nAbout You, Cloud’s Backbone is an ecommerce infrastructure that companies can use as their ecommerce solution. Backbone is API based, allowing ecommerce activities such as product management, catalog organization, order processing, stock management, warehouse management, and more. Backbone lets you do all of this in one place, through API calls. You can also integrate it with the ecommerce tools you are currently using.\nElastic Path offers ecommerce architecture solutions, including APIs and headless commerce solutions. They also offer solutions for things like voice commerce and chatbots. Elastic Path partners with all types of different companies, from ecommerce CRMs to consulting to web hosting services to ensure you have the tools you need to make your ecommerce system work.\nAmplience is a headless commerce solution that also provides a content solution. With Amplience, your headless system can extend to both commerce and content. Their main focus is allowing ecommerce teams, including content managers and their teams, to work together to keep the content and ecommerce side of things up to date and ensure a coherent and polished customer experience. This includes product attributes and classification, product page content, landing page content, and greater ease of development.\nHere’s how Amplience works to do this.\nThis image shows one of Amplience’s add-ons, which allows ecommerce teams to easily create, update, and scale frontend menus, based on their classification and sorting model for products. There are separate tabs for production and development, allowing both developers and content teams to work from the same place. No matter what the frontend looks like, this menu will be consistent across all applications. The preview above shows the desktop view of how this looks in practice.\nThis image shows another Amplience add-on, one which uses API calls to pull product information such as pricing, features, and stock so that content teams can quickly build lists of products, such as best sellers or new featured products.\nImportantly, Amplience has a way to plan workflows so that marketers, content teams, and developers can plan launches and schedule milestones together. Roles and responsibilities are defined and deadlines are noted. This makes it easy to plan content updates, ecommerce updates, and campaigns.\nThe Future of Headless Commerce\nThese days, ecommerce conversions are hovering at only 2.86% globally. This means it’s more important than ever to meet your customer’s needs by tailoring your ecommerce solution to them. One of the easiest ways to do that is with headless commerce. Not enough companies are using headless commerce yet and, as a result, they are having trouble keeping up with competitors that are. This is the way ecommerce is heading, and ecommerce managers should implement it early to manage the challenges that come with it and keep their heads on straight (see what we did there).","Freedom for Developers: Leveraging Sitecore JSS to Create Headless Sitecore Applications\nTo stay competitive in the digital era, today’s businesses are evolving to drive customer engagement and improve user experience. To achieve these goals and simplify the process of website development, many organizations are taking a decoupled, headless approach to application architecture for their content management systems (CMS).\nDevelopers, who traditionally built a CMS to be managed through a single interface, are now relying on decoupled front and back-end solutions, which provide benefits in architecture, personalization, website and SEO performance and overall business value. However, not all CMS are created equal. While most CMS solutions can be headless, many platforms lack personalization features, such as analytics and reporting, marketing automation and multivariate testing, which are critical components for success in today’s consumer-driven landscape.\nMany organizations are choosing Sitecore JSS because the platform allows developers to architect headless applications, significantly simplifying the process of building websites that elevate the user experience and increase customer engagement.\nWhat is a headless approach and how it is different from a traditional approach?\nTraditional websites have a back-end and front-end with the same code base that enables communication between the two. However, in a headless installation, the front-end is a stand-alone piece of software, which through the API, communicates with the back-end. Both parts operate separately from each other and can even be placed on separate servers, creating a minimal version of a multi-server architecture.\nMarketers can greatly benefit from a decoupled approach, as they have full control of the front-end application and can update the website or application content without deploying any code or restarting the server. This means new features can be created for your client-facing website without interruption. Marketers can also have control over how and where content appears, including web, mobile or wearable devices, with the ability to deliver it quickly and efficiently.\nNow that we’ve identified how to architect the solution, let’s turn our attention to how headless can increase engagement with consumers.\nWhere does personalization fit in?\nAccording to Econsultancy, the average reported conversion rate increase for websites with applied personalization was 16% over the past 12 months. Companies are now recognizing the need for a personalized marketing approach, offering consumers a better customer experience, ultimately increasing the likelihood of brand adoption and retention.\nLet’s explore an example of how personalization features can be leveraged with headless CMS through the introduction of Sitecore JSS on the Sitecore Experience Platform™. Sitecore’s API supports the delivery of dynamic content, meaning you can deliver personalized content to almost any device or browser. Sitecore JSS allows users to keep all of the automated marketing features that Sitecore offers out-of-the-box, including personalization, analytics, reporting and multivariate testing.\nWith Sitecore JSS, data can be captured from customer interactions on your website, mobile applications, retail kiosks, wearable devices, chatbots, connected home devices and many other channels and leveraged for personalization. Additionally, Sitecore JSS, in conjunction with Sitecore’s Experience Editor, allows content authors to easily modify content on a website through inline editing.\nDoes a headless approach improve performance?\nPersonalization alone does not define the success of your website. If your website is slow, the chances of your customer or prospect experiencing your website’s unique features are low. Taking the short attention span of humans into consideration, each millisecond of your website load time counts from a customer’s perspective. Time to first byte (TTFB) is the most important criteria of your website performance. By decoupling your application, your front-end can be hosted from serverless computing services, providing improved response time.\nHeadless architecture also enables the use of a single-page application (SPA), which interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the webpage rather than loading new pages from a server. In other words, when all interactions and renderings occur in the browser, there is no need to wait for client-server communication, thus providing the end-user with an optimized experience.\nLooking back at our Sitecore example, Sitecore JSS provides the ability to architect your SPA application with a headless approach. With Sitecore JSS, developers now have the freedom to use their preferred tools and frameworks like Angular, React, Vue and React Native for mobile development. Front-end developers no longer need to rely on back-end content and can start with a code-first approach, which means application development and content data is mocked using local files instead of Sitecore instance. Once Sitecore instance is available, developers can consume data via Sitecore Layout Service and connect the application to Sitecore instance, which is referred to as connected mode.\nWhat are the limitations associated with a headless approach?\nWhile a headless approach creates opportunities for utilizing the best practices in the industry for website architecture, we must also consider the disadvantage. Compared to traditional architecture, a headless approach lacks the presentation layer and usually doesn’t come with a live preview, which means there is no WYSIWYG functionality. On the bright side, as we have already mentioned, Sitecore JSS fills this gap by making the presentation layer management available in the Experience Editor.\nHow does this approach increase business value?\nBuilding a website with quick TTFB, personalization and mobile-first indexing is critical for businesses today to increase engagement and achieve a high conversion rate.\nSitecore JSS offers several benefits for marketers through personalization and consolidated data insights. It helps to extend your reach to consumers in different segments and enables consistent marketing and control over content across multi-channel and multi-device environments. With this approach, business operations no longer interfere with developer workflows, resulting in fewer project dependencies and eliminating the need to maintain multiple bodies, which is a cost-effective, long-term solution.\nDespite the many benefits of a headless approach, it’s important to acknowledge that when decoupled, not all CMS allow end-users to manage the presentation layer. However, with Sitecore JSS and Sitecore Experience Editor, marketers can retain visual control and easily make changes to items directly on the web page.\nA headless architecture provides freedom for developers and marketers, improving their day-to-day operations, while enhancing website performance and customer experience.\nTo read additional Sitecore insights by Tony Mamedbekov, visit his blog: https://mysitecore.blog/"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f537b63c-53bd-4137-925c-cfcd924b85ce>","<urn:uuid:1b19cffc-e68f-432d-871a-b486e7ccb9b3>"],"error":null}

His tomb contained an extensive collection of treasures including jewelry, furniture, weapons, thrones, jars, vases, games, boats, chariots, clothes, and statues. These items were made of gold and silver and encrusted with precious jewels. They were buried with him due to the Ancient Egyptian belief in the afterlife, where such possessions were seen as essential for the pharaoh's continued existence after death.","context":["(1804) Swashbuckling raid scuttles a pirated US frigateDisguised as Maltese sailors, Lt.

Originally named City of Philadelphia, she was built in 1798–1799 for the United States government by the citizens of that city. Funding for her construction was the result of a funding drive which raised $100,000 in one week, in June 1798. She was designed by Josiah Fox and built by Samuel Humphreys, Nathaniel Hutton and John Delavue. Her carved work was done by William Rush of Philadelphia. She was laid down about November 14, 1798, launched on November 28, 1799, and commissioned on April 5, 1800, with Captain Stephen Decatur, Sr. in command.

He has since his discovery been colloquially referred to as King Tut. His original name, Tutankhaten, means “Living Image of Aten”, while Tutankhamun means “Living Image of Amun”. In hieroglyphs, the name Tutankhamun was typically written Amen-tut-ankh, because of a scribal custom that placed a divine name at the beginning of a phrase to show appropriate reverence. He is possibly also the Nibhurrereya of the Amarna letters, and likely the 18th dynasty king Rathotis who, according to Manetho, an ancient historian, had reigned for nine years—a figure that conforms with Flavius Josephus’s version of Manetho’s Epitome.\nBorn: 1341 BC · Ancient Egypt Died: 1323 BC · Ancient Egypt Height: 5′ 11″ (1.80 m) Parents: Akhenaten (Father) · The Younger Lady (Mother) Siblings: Ankhesenamun (Sister)\nwiki/Tutankhamun(1960) Submarine begins world’s first underwater circumnavigationThe USS Triton begins ‘Operation Sandblast,’ the first submerged circumnavigation of the globe.

{"question":"How do the Original Cornell Syncopators and Olympia Brass Band differ in their approach to preserving historical jazz styles?","answer":"The Original Cornell Syncopators and Olympia Brass Band took different approaches to preserving historical jazz styles. The Cornell Syncopators, formed in 2016, focused on recreating and exploring collegiate jazz bands of the 1920s, particularly emphasizing academic research with 40 pages of historical notes and carefully reconstructing specific recordings like the ODJB's first session. In contrast, the Olympia Brass Band, revived in 1958, maintained New Orleans jazz traditions through direct performance and mentorship, serving as a training ground for new generations of jazz musicians while maintaining traditional roles like playing at Preservation Hall, parades, and even performing for dignitaries like Queen Elizabeth and Pope John Paul II.","context":["As a collector of 78 RPM records for a quarter century, I have learned to flip through bins with a certain precision, making split second judgments about what deserves a closer look, choosing what goes into the maybe pile or what gets flipped past. My tastes are my own, but I have found pausing on labels like Cameo and Perfect gets me in the ballpark. I’ve also found that oddball jazz referencing band names should go straight to the buy pile. A lot of these turn out to be, as Wikipedia puts it, “the moderately jazz-influenced peppy dance band style called ‘Collegiate Hot’ that to many people exemplifies the music of the ‘Roaring Twenties.’” So when I heard about Collegiate by the Original Cornell Syncopators, my ears perked up.\nThe Original Cornell Syncopators were started by then Cornell Freshman Colin Hancock in 2016 to celebrate the centennial of the ODJB’s first recordings. They soon discovered that they had predecessors at the school. The Cornell Collegians were the first college band to be recorded, in 1923, aided by their proximity to New York City, the hub of recording at the time. The Collegians, as they were named on the Victor label, featured local trombonist Spiegle Willcox, and performed in New York as Whiteman’s Collegians after being spotted by the King of Jazz at a gig in Syracuse.\nThat initial research, and a conversation in Italy about an obscure recording covered by the Original Prague Syncopators, eventually led to this rewarding album exploring an underappreciated slice of jazz history. That back story was told at length in our July issue.\nYears in the making, this album is inspired by the recordings of college jazz bands of the twenties. It is accompanied by 40 pages of notes exploring the contribution of these obscure bands in their various types, college bands out in middle America, those at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and the bands at the Ivy League schools which, in general, had more chances to record even if they paid out of pocket to do so.\nLike many of the collegiate bands they cover the Original Cornell Syncopators consist of both current and former students, as well as a couple ringers from the community; Ed Clute, the noted pianist, and Robert Van Renesse, a banjoist, also appearing on the accordion here, who is a professor by day and has offered them guidance. Cornell has a music major, but of the 15 student members given a bio in the notes only the bands second leader, Hannah Krall, was enrolled in it, she is also pursuing music in post graduate education, as a PhD candidate in Musicology.\nOf the bands discussed in the notes, most featured some musicians that had already graduated, or people that were not enrolled at all. Most of these bands existed to play the many college dances and parties, not as part of any sanctioned educational program. Indeed the HBCU music programs looked down on jazz and focused on European classical music. These were working bands, often touring in the region near the school and sometimes farther. Most never had a chance to record, though a few had true national hits, and some bands are remembered as influential, including Jimmie’s Joys out of U of T Austin.\nMany important groups developed out of college bands including those led by Fred Waring, Hal Kemp, Rudy Vallee, Ted Weems, Les Brown, and Jimmie Lunceford. These aren’t all household names now, but they were top sellers in their time.\nMany musicians from these bands are well known, particularly those that attended, or at least played in the bands at HBCU’s, these include Horace Henderson, Fess Williams, Lois Deppe, Ben Webster, Benny Carter, Erskine Hawkins, and Rex Stewart, all discussed in the notes. (Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, and others were graduates of these Universities but this is about the bands, not the schools.) Interestingly Jimmie Lunceford led and recorded with a band of high schoolers, losing many from his band to the pursuit of other majors when he insisted they go to college.\nLike most releases from Rivermont, the album notes alone are worth the price of the album. The Cornell Syncopators are introduced, and the album given a statement of purpose, by Julio Schwarz-Andrade. The heart of the notes, the research into collegiate jazz bands, is shared in a joint effort by Colin Hancock and Hannah Krall, with input from Rivermont founder Bryan Wright. Then The Syncopated Times’ own Andy Senior tells the story of the band. Finally Colin Hancock goes track by track through the 20 selections on this generous album, noting the source for each, the goal of the recording and anything worth listening for.\nThe music is excellent, fun, true to the source material, and recorded wonderfully. Many tracks have a large orchestrated sound, indicating how many of these bands grew into the large dance orchestras that preceded swing. Indeed, drawing on a pool of 17 musicians the band averages at least ten on each track.\n“Original Dixieland One-Step” is a band favorite going back to their initial mission of recreating the ODJB’s first session. Here they imagine an unreleased version recorded by Hitch’s Happy Harmonists at Gennett studios, by inferring a style from three cuts that were released from that day.\n“San” is popular among swing dancers right up to today. They cover the version released by the Barbary Coast Orchestra, which was first known as the Dartmouth Five. It is still in existence, making it one of the world’s oldest continuous jazz bands.\nAccording to the notes “Broke Again” tells the timeless story of being an impoverished student. Coming from the Princeton Triangle Club Jazz Band you can wonder whether their perceived poverty was relative. Done as an instrumental here, it’s a great tune, and one ripe for hot covers.\nOther college themes include the drinking song “Peruna” named for a Prohibition-era patent medicine sold near Southern Methodist University that was 28% alcohol. The band joins in on a chorus borrowed from “She’ll be Coming Around the Mountain.” A title that gets a full vocal is “You’ll Do it Some Day, So Why Not Now?” which I’ve heard them play live to chuckling audiences.\n“Congaine” is an Earl Hines composition for Lois Deppe’s band, of which he was a member. The band had ties to Wilberforce University and the Black community that grew up around it. Trombonist and collector Dave Bock provided them a high quality transfer to study from.\nThe full page of acknowledgments shows how much community support went into this long-awaited album. It is a release that should be celebrated and enjoyed by us all. In the third decade of the 21st century, collegiate jazz carries on.\nThe Original Cornell Syncopators • Collegiate • rivermontrecords.com\nRoger Kimmel Smith produced a Radio program about this album contrasting each track with a predecessor, you may hear it HERE.","Olympia Brass Band\nThe Olympia Brass Band is a New Orleans jazz brass band.\nThe first “Olympia Brass Band” was active from the late 19th century to around World War I. The most famous member was Freddie Keppard.\nIn 1958, saxophonist Harold Dejan, leader of the 2nd unit of the Eureka Brass Band, split off to form the current Olympia, reviving the historic name.\nThe band had a notable part in the 1973 James Bond movie Live and Let Die where they lead a funeral march for a freshly assassinated victim. Trumpeter Alvin Alcorn plays the knife wielding “baby faced killer.”\nIn addition to playing for parades and parties, the band had a weekly gig at Preservation Hall on Sunday nights for many years. The band also toured Europe on numerous occasions and also toured Africa for the U. S. State Department. The band did a BBC radio broadcast for Queen Elizabeth’s 25th wedding anniversary in 1972 while they were in London, and also played for Pope John Paul II on his visit to New Orleans.\nThe Olympia Brass Band was included with other stellar musicians from Louisiana, on the Southern Stars poster created by Dianna Chenevert to promote them and historically document their contribution to the music industry. On October 12, 1983, USA Today reporter Miles White highlighted the poster which provided additional nationwide attention. In 1986, Chenevert booked the “Olympia Brass Band” for a month long engagement in Israel at the night club El Hamm. According to the Times-Picayune front page article on September 4, it was Olympia’s first trip to Israel and they arrived at the Tel Aviv airport wearing their traditional band outfits (red blazers, black pants and white hats). The Israeli immigration officials detained Olympia at customs, mistaking them as Black Hebrews, a sect at odds with the government. Band leader Herold Dejan saw the brief delay and international press coverage as good advertising, and made the comment “everything’s lovely!”\nThe Olympia Brass Band was a training ground for a whole new generation of jazz musicians including clarinetist Joseph Torregano, saxophonist Byron “Flea” Bernard; drummers Tanio Hingle and Kerry Hunter; and trumpeters Kenneth Terry and “Kid” Mervin Campbell.\nNotable members of the band over the years were: Harold “Duke” Dejan, leader and alto saxophone; Emanuel “Pappy” Paul & Ernest Watson tenor saxophone; clarinetists Willie Humphrey, Joseph Torregano and David Grillier; trumpeters Milton Batiste (Asst. leader), Edmond Foucher, George “Kid Sheik” Colar, Reginald Koeller, Kenneth Terry, & Mervin Campbell. Trombonists Paul Crawford, Frank Naundorf, Wendell Eugene, Eddie King, Gerald Joseph, and Lester Caliste; Sousaphonists Allan Jaffe, William “Coby” Brown, Anthony Lacen AKA “Tuba Fats,” Edgar Smith, and Jeffrey Hills. Snare drummers Andrew Jefferson, Leroy “Boogie” Breaux, Kerry “Fatman” Hunter: Bass Drummers, Henry “Booker T.” Glass, Nowell “Papa” Glass, and Cayetano “Tanio” Hingle. Grand Marshalls for the band were the immortal Matthew “Fats” Houston, Anderson Minor, Anderson Stewart and Richard “King” Matthews.\nAlthough the band left numerous recordings, none is more prevalent then their recording of “The Westlawn Funeral Dirge” which featured Emanuel Paul on the tenor saxophone.\nThe Olympia Brass Band is profiled in the book, The Great Olympia Band by the late English writer Mick Burns, and Keeping the Beat on the Street: The New Orleans Brass Band Renaissance also by Mick Burns.\nA trumpet is a musical instrument.

{"question":"Hello, I am studying the role of regulatory T cells in melanoma. What was the specific impact of removing Nrp1 from regulatory T cells in melanoma mouse models?","answer":"In mouse models of melanoma, mice lacking Nrp1 on regulatory T cells were almost completely resistant to developing melanoma, while showing no autoimmune or inflammatory complications. This was described as a particularly dramatic impact compared to other cancer models tested.","context":["Currently we test and support the following browsers:\nPlease note that this is not intended to be an exhaustive list of browsers that support web standards, nor a test of browser compliance, nor a side-by-side comparison of various manufacturers’ browsers.\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital researchers discover how to unleash the immune system against cancer in mice without triggering autoimmune reactions\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital scientists have discovered a way to target the immune system to shrink or eliminate tumors in mice without causing autoimmune problems. Researchers also found evidence that the same mechanism may operate in humans. The study was published today in the advance online edition of Nature.\nThe findings provide a new target for ongoing efforts to develop immunotherapies to harness the immune system to fight cancer and other diseases.\nThe work focused on white blood cells called regulatory T cells. These specialized cells serve as the immune system’s police force, working to control inflammation and guard against autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Regulatory T cells can, however, interfere with the immune system’s ability to fight cancer.\nIn this study, investigators identified a mechanism that boosts the ability of regulatory T cells to cause problems by blocking an effective anti-tumor immune response. The same process, however, plays no role in maintaining immune balance or preventing the misguided immune attack on healthy tissue that leads to autoimmune problems, researchers reported. Blocking this mechanism led to the elimination or dramatic reduction of melanoma by the immune system in mice, without causing the autoimmune and inflammatory problems often associated with current cancer-treatment efforts that target immune regulators, scientists said.\n“Regulatory T cells are a major barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity,” said the study’s corresponding author, Dario Vignali, Ph.D., vice chair of the St. Jude Department of Immunology. “We have identified a mechanism that enhances the ability of regulatory T cells to put the brakes on the immune response in tumors but plays no role in immune system maintenance. For the first time, we may now have an opportunity to selectively target the activity of regulatory T cells for treatment of cancer without inducing autoimmune or inflammatory complications.”\nThe mechanism is built around two proteins. One, semaphorin-4a (Sema4a), is carried on the surface of various immune cells that can spark inflammation. The other, neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), is carried on the surface of regulatory T cells.\nVignali and his colleagues used a variety of molecular and cellular techniques to show that Sema4a binding to Nrp1 turns on a biochemical pathway in mouse regulatory T cells that enhances their function, stability and survival. When scientists eliminated Nrp1 on just regulatory T cells, those cells were unable to respond to signals that normally bolstered their anti-inflammatory activity.\nWhen investigators analyzed human regulatory T cells, they found evidence that the pathway may also serve the same role.\nIn addition, more than 16 months after losing Nrp1 activity in their regulatory T cells, the mice showed no signs of autoimmune or inflammatory complications. “That is significant because mice and humans that lack or have substantial defects in regulatory T cells develop lethal autoimmune disease,” Vignali said.\nKnocking out or blocking the activity of Nrp1 on regulatory T cells in mouse models of several human cancers, including the deadly skin cancer melanoma, led to reduced, delayed or complete elimination of the tumors. Blocking Sema4a had a similar anti-tumor effect, researchers reported. “The impact was particularly dramatic in a mouse model of human melanoma,” Vignali said. “Mice lacking Nrp1 on regulatory T cells were almost completely resistant to developing melanoma, but did not develop any autoimmune or inflammatory complications.”\nAlthough investigators have not yet identified which cells carry Sema4a in tumors and boost regulatory T cell function, the scientists did report that immune cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) provided more than half of the Sema4a in tumors in this study. That was surprising because pDCs make up a very small percentage of immune cells, and there is a long history of suppressive interactions between regulatory T cells and pDCs in tumors, Vignali said. Both cell types are recognized as inducing the immune system to tolerate, rather than attack, tumors.\nResearchers also provided new details of how the Nrp1 pathway functions, including evidence that along with bolstering the ability of regulatory T cells to suppress the immune response, the pathway also helps maintain a stable population of regulatory T cells. “This pathway does not just boost regulatory function. It may define how regulatory T cells maintain their identity,” said Greg Delgoffe, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in Vignali’s laboratory.

{"question":"What are the primary factors causing traffic crashes on freeways, and what safety measures are recommended to prevent accidents?","answer":"The primary factors causing traffic crashes include road curvature, median type, number of lanes, pavement surface type, and presence of on/off-ramps. Additionally, traffic volumes immediately preceding crashes are better predictors than annual average daily traffic (AADT). To prevent accidents, several safety measures are recommended: implementing policies against distracted driving (including bans on texting and hands-free devices), preventing fatigued driving through proper policies and procedures, ensuring proper vehicle maintenance with thorough documentation, and equipping vehicles with safety technology and telematics, which has shown to reduce backing crashes by 81% and cut distracted driving incidents by 35% in just 30 days.","context":["Crash Frequency, Negative Binomial Models, Contingency Tables, Seemingly Unrelated Regression, Logistic Regression, Principal Component Analysis\nTraffic crashes have been identified as one of the main causes of death in the US, making road safety a high priority issue that needs urgent attention. Recognizing the fact that more and effective research has to be done in this area, this thesis aims mainly at developing different statistical models related to the road safety. The thesis includes three main sections: 1) overall crash frequency analysis using negative binomial models, 2) seemingly unrelated negative binomial (SUNB) models for different categories of crashes divided based on type of crash, or condition in which they occur, 3) safety models to determine the probability of crash occurrence, including a rainfall index that has been estimated using a logistic regression model. The study corridor is a 36.25 mile stretch of Interstate 4 in Central Florida. For the first two sections, crash cases from 1999 through 2002 were considered. Conventionally most of the crash frequency analysis model all crashes, instead of dividing them based on type of crash, peaking conditions, availability of light, severity, or pavement condition, etc. Also researchers traditionally used AADT to represent traffic volumes in their models. These two cases are examples of macroscopic crash frequency modeling. To investigate the microscopic models, and to identify the significant factors related to crash occurrence, a preliminary study (first analysis) explored the use of microscopic traffic volumes related to crash occurrence by comparing AADT/VMT with five to twenty minute volumes immediately preceding the crash. It was found that the volumes just before the time of crash occurrence proved to be a better predictor of crash frequency than AADT. The results also showed that road curvature, median type, number of lanes, pavement surface type and presence of on/off-ramps are among the significant factors that contribute to crash occurrence. In the second analysis various possible crash categories were prepared to exactly identify the factors related to them, using various roadway, geometric, and microscopic traffic variables. Five different categories are prepared based on a common platform, e.g. type of crash. They are: 1) Multiple and Single vehicle crashes, 2) Peak and Off-peak crashes, 3) Dry and Wet pavement crashes, 4) Daytime and Dark hour crashes, and 5) Property Damage Only (PDO) and Injury crashes. Each of the above mentioned models in each category are estimated separately. To account for the correlation between the disturbance terms arising from omitted variables between any two models in a category, seemingly unrelated negative binomial (SUNB) regression was used, and then the models in each category were estimated simultaneously. SUNB estimation proved to be advantageous for two categories: Category 1, and Category 4. Road curvature and presence of On-ramps/Off-ramps were found to be the important factors, which can be related to every crash category. AADT was also found to be significant in all the models except for the single vehicle crash model. Median type and pavement surface type were among the other important factors causing crashes. It can be stated that the group of factors found in the model considering all crashes is a superset of the factors that were found in individual crash categories. The third analysis dealt with the development of a logistic regression model to obtain the weather condition at a given time and location on I-4 in Central Florida so that this information can be used in traffic safety analyses, because of the lack of weather monitoring stations in the study area. To prove the worthiness of the weather information obtained form the analysis, the same weather information was used in a safety model developed by Abdel-Aty et al., 2004. It was also proved that the inclusion of weather information actually improved the safety model with better prediction accuracy.\nMaster of Science in Civil Engineering (M.S.C.E.)\nCollege of Engineering and Computer Science\nCivil and Environmental Engineering\nLength of Campus-only Access\nMasters Thesis (Open Access)\nPemmanaboina, Rajashekar, \"Assessing Crash Occurrence On Urban Freeways Using Static And Dynamic Factors By Applying A System Of Interrelated Equations\" (2005).

As a result, the commercial auto insurance market has seen unprecedented volatility. Rates are up and underwriting capacity is shrinking. Now, more than ever, businesses with fleets and trucks must be proactive.\nNew research shows that traffic fatalities are finally declining after spiking in 2015 and 2016. However, that trend does not apply to large trucks. In 2017, large-truck fatalities increased by 4.9 percent. In 2018, large-truck fatalities increased again, this time by 0.9 percent. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 11 percent of motor vehicle crash deaths involve large trucks.\nLitigation is also on the rise, according to Insurance Business Magazine. Trucking-for-hire companies present the greatest underwriting challenge because they drive the most miles-per-vehicle and heavy vehicle weights can cause deadly accident scenarios. In litigation, attorneys aggressively look for driver safety and vehicle maintenance issues. If your driver is in an accident and any issues are identified, there is a high likelihood that your company will be found negligent.\nA few preemptive measures can help keep your drivers safe and your commercial auto insurance rates down. Focus on:\nDistracted Driving: By now, everyone’s heard of the dangers of distracted driving. Hopefully, you’ve already implemented policies to prevent your workers from driving while distracted. This should include bans on texting while driving, but it shouldn’t end there. As an article in EHS Today explains, even hands-free devices can create dangerous distractions. The CDC defines distracted driving as anything that takes your eyes off the road, your hands off the wheel, or your mind off driving. Make sure your drivers are giving the road their full attention.\nFatigued Driving: It’s hard to determine exactly how many crashes are caused by drowsy driving, but we know it’s significant. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, fatigued driving is often underreported but may be involved in more than 100,000 crashes per year. The CDC says commercial drivers, shift workers, drivers with untreated sleep disorders, and drivers who take certain medications are among those with a higher risk of drowsy driving. Create policies and procedures that reduce the risk of drowsy driving.\nWinter Weather: As cold weather sets in, it’s important to think about how rain, ice, and snow can create road hazards. Pay attention to weather alerts and keep an eye on road conditions. Make sure that drivers are prepared for an emergency and that vehicles are in good condition. Also, keep in mind that drivers may need to slow down when the weather is bad. Give them extra time.\nVehicle Maintenance: Commercial vehicles undergo significant wear and tear, and your company could be held liable if a lack of maintenance contributes to a crash. Make sure brakes, tires, and other truck components are regularly serviced. Maintain thorough documentation of your efforts so you have evidence that you took reasonable care to prevent issues and related accidents in case you are sued.\nSafety Technology: When possible, equip your vehicles with the latest technology and telematics. A study conducted by General Motors and the University of Michigan found that automated safety features are effective at reducing crashes. With the right features, backing crashes can be cut by 81 percent. In American Trucker, the CEO of Cambridge Mobile Telematics says that a smartphone telematics program cut distracted driving incidents by 35 percent – in only 30 days. Hard braking was cut by 20 percent. Some carriers are beginning to offer commercial insurance discounts when safety technology is used.\nAt Heffernan, we partner with Our Safety Department (OSD) to provide our trucking company clients an automated software platform that allows all telematics systems to automatically report data to a central platform. This includes ELDs, dash cameras, critical events, and equipment maintenance. OSD combines all of a company’s telematics data into one simple report and can submit reports to entities such as the DOT, resulting in easier compliance with record-keeping requirements.

{"question":"What are the primary applications of geotextiles in construction projects, and what specialized solutions do they offer for problematic ground conditions?","answer":"Geotextiles have numerous applications in construction projects, primarily being used in road construction where they reinforce soil by adding tensile strength and serve as water levels in roadbeds. They are also extensively used in railway works to separate soil from sub-soil in unstable ground conditions, and in stream/canal projects to protect banks from erosion. For problematic ground conditions, geotextiles offer specialized solutions particularly when conventional foundation designs cannot be implemented. They can be used to improve strength characteristics of soils, such as in highway subbase strengthening through soil mixing techniques, and can help address challenges in sites with high ground water levels or thick layers of compressible soil.

More detailed discussions of individual topics can be accessed by clicking on the links provided.\nFoundation Design/Improvement of Subsurface Conditions\nThe design of foundations for structures such as buildings, bridges, and roads is a common element of our professional practice. We are familiar with the design of all types of spread footings, mats, and deep foundation systems (driven piles, drilled shafts and micropiles). The use of a particular foundation type is a function of the subsurface conditions at a site. Conditions such as the presence of soft compressible material at the surface or highly variable support materials typically guide the selection of the type of foundation system to be employed. Sometimes it may be desirable to improve foundation conditions by modifying the surficial materials. Some examples include dynamic consolidation (dropping a heavy weight to consolidate the soil), stone columns (densification of surface materials using vibratory methods with gravel backfill) and soil mixing (mixing of soft soils with coarser material using multiple augers). D'Appolonia has applied these techniques and others to improve site foundation support conditions. Our familiarity with soil improvement techniques enables us to select an effective technique based upon technical feasibility and cost. We routinely prepare designs that employ soil improvement techniques, and we prepare related plans and specifications and monitor construction activities.\nDriven Pile, Drilled Shaft and Micropile Foundations\nDeep foundations are required in situations where high foundation loads cannot be supported by spread footings on soil. Deep foundation options include driven piles, drilled shafts and micropiles. Driven piles are frequently located close together in groups with the tops connected by a concrete cap that supports the structural load. In many situations driven piles are not attractive due to the presence of subsurface obstructions to pile driving or environmental problems with driving piles such as noise and vibration. Drilled shafts can be constructed with large diameters sometimes eliminating the need for a pile group connected by a cap. Micropiles, which are sometimes referred to as minipiles or pin piles, have gained substantial acceptance in recent years. In application, multiple micropiles are used to replace a driven pile group or a larger drilled shaft, particularly in karstic or difficult to drill geologic conditions. Much higher stress transfer per unit area can be achieved with micropiles, and they can be installed in restricted spaces where other solutions may not be feasible, or where hard rock conditions inhibit economical advancement of larger shafts. D’Appolonia is experienced in the design of all types of deep foundations and is familiar with the situations in which each type is advantageous, both from a technical and economic standpoint.\nSlope and Slope-Retaining Structure Design\nDevelopment of a site in sloping or uneven terrain typically requires that the site be graded to accommodate the planned construction. This process frequently leads to the need for analysis and design of temporary and permanent site slopes and, where space is limited, the design of retaining structures. D'Appolonia is skilled in the analysis of slope stability, and our staff understands the importance of determining key strength parameters through field exploration, sampling and laboratory testing. We are frequently called upon to analyze slope failures and to prepare remedial designs. Our experience includes the design of earth embankment dams and multi-stage retaining embankments for coal refuse impoundments. We are familiar with the design and construction of a broad spectrum of retaining structures ranging from anchored walls and soil nail applications to reinforced soil slopes (RSS) and mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) embankments.\nRemediation of Failed Slopes and Embankments\nAs part of the evaluation of failures and their causes, D'Appolonia is frequently called upon to prepare an engineering design to remediate the problem. Some typical examples include design of repairs for failed slopes, redesign of failed retaining walls, design of remedial measures for settled or heaved floor slabs, and design of repairs for failed roads.\nExcavation Support/Deep Excavations\nStructures with below-grade levels require substantial excavations frequently leading to the need for the design of retaining structures/walls to allow construction to proceed in a safe manner. In situations where existing structures abut the construction site, the design of these retaining walls is of great importance, because of the possibility for costly damage to the surrounding structures. D'Appolonia is experienced in the design and construction of anchored retaining walls where disturbance must be kept to a minimum. We have also been called upon in emergency situations to support excavations and underpin structure foundations. We have designed braced excavations and a wide range of retaining walls involving tangent or secant drilled shafts, soldier piles and lagging, drilled-in anchors and soil nails. Our experience includes geotechnical aspects of the design of a subway system in an urban area where existing structures and other infrastructure were major concerns.\nProblem Ground Conditions\nD’Appolonia is frequently called upon to develop foundation designs at sites where conventional foundation designs or retaining structures cannot be constructed because of unfavorable site subsurface conditions. These conditions might include high ground water levels; thick layers of very compressible soil; thick layers of loose, granular soil; intermittent hard rock and soft, compressible infills associated with karst terrain; or other difficult subsurface condition that prevents the use of conventional technologies. Sometimes a solution can be achieved by improving the strength characteristics of the soils present at the site. Examples include utilizing soil mixing techniques to strengthen fine coal refuse sufficient to serve as highway subbase and consolidation of loose granular soils using dynamic compaction such that spread footings can be supported. Our expertise also includes applications of grouting and construction of deep foundations. We have the expertise to evaluate foundation or retaining structure options and to identify attractive, cost-effective and constructable solutions that meet design requirements. We develop innovative solutions that solve engineering problems while operating within cost constraints. We prepare plans and specifications for our designs and routinely provide monitoring services during construction.\nExpansive Soils, Shale and Slag/Foundation Heave\nD’Appolonia is experienced in identifying the presence of expansive pyritic shales, steel-making slags, pyritic bottom ash, and moisture-sensitive clays and in assessing the potential for related floor or foundation heave. Our technical services have been utilized for school and university facilities, office buildings, industrial plants and parking areas. These projects normally require characterization of expansive materials by visual examination and physical-chemical testing. Physical-chemical testing typically includes soil index testing to determine moisture content and plasticity characteristics; chemical analysis to identify expansive sulfides and oxides; and pH analyses, mineralogical examination, and swell testing. Our staff is experienced in developing site exploration and laboratory analysis programs for identification of potentially expansive materials and in performing related engineering analyses and developing design measures and monitoring programs associated with corrective action. Typical remedial actions may include removal of expansive materials, redesign of foundations, and isolation of expansive materials from air and moisture.\nGeosynthetic materials have many applications in civil engineering. Geosynthetics are polymeric materials in the form of geotextiles, geogrids, edge drains, drainage composites, erosion control materials, sediment control materials, and geomembranes. Some applications of geosynthetics include filtration, drainage, temporary and permanent erosion control, sediment control, roadway reinforcement, roadway subgrade improvement, pavement overlays, embankments over soft foundations, mechanically stabilized earth walls, mechanically stabilized earth slopes, and geomembrane-lined containment impoundments and caps. D'Appolonia is experienced in performing analyses that reflect the strength contribution of geosynthetics and in preparing designs for foundations, embankments, pavements, waste containment facilities, channels and erosion and sedimentation control that incorporate geosynthetic materials.\nRETURN TO TOP OF PAGE"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c7371962-7a06-4d5f-be9b-76bd176a77af>","<urn:uuid:4e86489c-b9fc-4271-a62a-d97be767c053>"],"error":null}
{"question":"大家好！想问问应急包应该存放在家里哪个位置比较好？有什么特别注意的地方吗？","answer":"The disaster kit should be kept in a safe location within your house that meets several protective criteria: it should be most likely to be protected from falling objects, falling debris, broken glass, and water leaks. Additionally, the location should protect the supplies from extremes in temperature. For specific room selection, FEMA recommends storing emergency supplies in a small, interior, windowless room in a sturdy building on the lowest level that will not be subject to flooding.","context":["Disaster Preparedness Kit Basics\nIn 2016, there were 46 major disaster declarations made by the federal government (www.fema.gov/disasters). These disasters represented significant events such as fires, flooding, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Because they overwhelmed local and state resources, they qualified for federal assistance during the response and recovery process. In major disasters, it can take days for relief organizations and government resources to reach disaster affected communities with supplies. While many websites recommend that a disaster kit have three days of supplies, lessons learned from large-scale disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the Northridge earthquake have led disaster experts to recommend emergency supplies that will last seven to ten days.\nPreparing a basic disaster kit for you and your family will allow you to survive until outside resources are available. Building a comprehensive disaster kit will allow you to survive in comfort! Building a disaster kit takes time and can represent an additional expense. It’s okay to start slow and build your disaster kit on what your budget allows over time. But keep in mind that many of the items needed for a disaster kit are probably already in your home. Got an old backpack laying around? That could be the start of your car disaster kit. Have some old clothes and a jacket in your closet? You’ll need a spare set of clothes to put in your home disaster kit. Come up with your disaster kit inventory list, and you can even make a family scavenger hunt out of finding the items!\nTo help you build your disaster kit inventory list, we have provided a list of essential items for your home and car. Keep in mind that every family’s list will be different, depending on the number of people, whether or not there are kids in the household, and the presence of any specials needs or medical conditions. You should modify and add to this list as necessary. Links to other lists are provided for further reference and review.\nMaintaining Your Disaster Kit\nKeep your disaster kit in a safe location within your house that is most likely to be protected from falling objects, falling debris or broken glass, water leaks, and extremes in temperature. It is imperative to check your disaster kit and update the contents once per year. To make it easy to update, you can keep items that expire in a single bag or at the top of your kit. By rotating food items into your normal food inventory every six months, you can minimize the cost of maintaining your disaster food supply. Keep in mind that storage in extreme conditions (such as the heat of your trunk) will reduce the shelf life of food and water supplies. Rotate these out at the end of every summer to ensure you have a fresh supply.\nWhere to Buy Disaster Kit Items\nMajor retailers such as Walmart, Target, and even Costco are a great place to obtain your disaster supplies. Online retailers, such as Amazon or Costco.com, offer pre-made disaster kits; just keep in mind that these kits will give you a head start, but won’t prepare you for disaster until you add the many personal items needed for survival. Finally, you can search for local disaster supply retailers, such as Simpler Life in Redlands; they offer advice on everything from basic kits to comprehensive kits. Building a kit is easy once it is made a priority, start by searching your home for the above\nIn putting together your kit, try to purchase items that you are familiar with or use every day. Would you trust a flashlight that has never been turned on? Would it still work if you dropped it? Have you ever eaten a survival food bar? How will your body react to eating these bars for three days? In a disaster, you need to know your equipment and have confidence that it will work under adverse conditions. A focus on quality is well worth the extra investment!\nHelpful Links and Resources\nIt is always a good idea to cross reference your disaster supplies kit list with other lists. Here are a few reputable resources:","LOS ANGELES - When a hurricane strikes, things can go from fine to fatal in the blink of an eye, but being prepared for any outcome and having strong plans for all scenarios can significantly lessen the threat to you, your home and your loved ones.\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The Pacific hurricane season runs May 15 to Nov. 30, but storms are most active during the month of September, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\nBelow are suggestions compiled from FEMA, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on precautions you can take before, during and after a hurricane.\nPrepare ahead of time\nMake plans for both evacuation and sheltering in place\nFEMA suggests getting familiar with your area’s risk of hurricane so that you know what to expect.\n- Know exactly where you will be taking shelter. A FEMA safe room or ICC storm shelter would be the best option, but your next best bet is to hunker down in a small, interior, windowless room in a sturdy building on the lowest level that will not be subject to flooding.\n- Familiarize yourself with your evacuation zone, evacuation route, and shelter locations.\n- Make sure you have several options for places to go, such as friend’s homes in nearby towns, and that these options are in different directions so you can outrun a storm regardless of how it’s approaching.\n- Plan how to communicate if you lose power. During disasters, sending text messages is usually more reliable and quicker than making phone calls because phone lines can get easily overloaded.\n- Sign up for alerts through community warning systems as well as the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and National and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio emergency alerts.\n- Risk analysis Check your hazards risks with FEMA's Map Portal. Rate your flood risk with the FloodSmart.gov portal.\n- Check your hazards risks with FEMA's Map Portal.\n- Rate your flood risk with the FloodSmart.gov portal.\nEmergency Kit Supplies\n- Keep important documents — such as birth certificates, social security cards, copies of insurance policies, identification and bank account records — in a safe place and/or create password-protected digital copies.\n- Keep a list of important contacts, such as Emergency Management Offices, county law enforcement, county public safety fire/rescue, local hospitals, local utilities, local media (such as TV and radio stations) and your property insurance agent.\n- Assemble a disaster supply kit that will help you meet all your basic needs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) suggests including: Water — one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days to be used for drinking and for sanitation Food — at least three days-worth of non-perishable foods Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert Flashlight First aid kit Extra batteries Whistle to signal for help Dust mask to help filter contaminated air and plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter in place Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties for personal sanitation Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities Manual can opener for food Local maps Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery Prescription medications Non-prescription medications such as pain relievers, anti-diarrhea medication, antacids or laxatives Glasses and contact lens solution Infant formula, bottles, diapers, wipes, diaper rash cream Pet food and extra water for pets Cash or traveler’s checks Sleeping bag or warm blanket for each person Change of clothing appropriate for your climate and sturdy shoes Household chlorine bleach and medicine dropper to disinfect water Fire extinguisher Matches in a waterproof container Feminine supplies and personal hygiene items Mess kits, paper cups, plates, paper towels and plastic utensils Paper and pencil Books, games, puzzles or other activities for children\n- Water — one gallon of water per person per day for at least three days to be used for drinking and for sanitation\n- Food — at least three days-worth of non-perishable foods\n- Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert\n- First aid kit\n- Extra batteries\n- Whistle to signal for help\n- Dust mask to help filter contaminated air and plastic sheeting and duct tape to shelter in place\n- Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties for personal sanitation\n- Wrench or pliers to turn off utilities\n- Manual can opener for food\n- Local maps\n- Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery\n- Prescription medications\n- Non-prescription medications such as pain relievers, anti-diarrhea medication, antacids or laxatives\n- Glasses and contact lens solution\n- Infant formula, bottles, diapers, wipes, diaper rash cream\n- Pet food and extra water for pets\n- Cash or traveler’s checks\n- Sleeping bag or warm blanket for each person\n- Change of clothing appropriate for your climate and sturdy shoes\n- Household chlorine bleach and medicine dropper to disinfect water\n- Fire extinguisher\n- Matches in a waterproof container\n- Feminine supplies and personal hygiene items\n- Mess kits, paper cups, plates, paper towels and plastic utensils\n- Paper and pencil\n- Books, games, puzzles or other activities for children\nIt’s important to keep your emergency kit updated, so check in annually to replace any expired medications or food and to update the kit with additional items your family may need.\nIf you have pets, it’s important to plan for their needs as well, and you may want to create a separate emergency kit just for them. FEMA offers suggestions for what to place in that kit to ensure your pet’s best chance of getting through the emergency safely.\nFEMA also recommends keeping you pet’s microchip information up to date in case they get lost, and creating a buddy system with neighbors or nearby friends and family to help your pet in the case that you aren’t home. Familiarize yourself with pet-friendly hotels and shelters along your evacuation routes in the case that you must leave your home — many emergency shelters cannot take in animals that are not service animals for health and safety reasons.\nYour home is almost certainly going to take a beating during a hurricane, but here are steps you can take to fortify your residence:\n- Keep drains and gutters free of debris and clutter\n- Install check valves in your plumbing to prevent backups\n- If you don’t have hurricane shutters, consider getting them\n- Review your insurance policies\nIf you need to drive away from a hurricane in an evacuation, having important items ready in an separate emergency kit in your car can make leaving much more efficient. Prepare items such as:\n- Physical maps\n- Jumper cables\n- Extra cans of gas\n- Warm blanket(s)\n- A change of clothes\nIn this NOAA satellite handout image captured at 15:02 UTC, shows Hurricane Florence as it travels west in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S. on September 13, 2018. (Photo by NOAA via Getty Images)\nWhat to do as the hurricane approaches\nWhen the hurricane is a day or two away\n- Stay tuned in to TV and radio reports so that you don’t miss evacuation warnings.\n- Bring inside any loose objects which are lightweight enough to become projectiles during high winds, such as patio furniture, and anchor any objects which are unsafe to keep in the home, such as propane tanks.\n- Trim or remove trees that could potentially fall on your home.\n- Cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows, but a second option is to board up windows with 5/8-inch exterior grade or marine plywood, which you should keep cut to fit your windows and ready to install at a moment’s notice.\n- Keep your cell phone charged at all times.\nWhen a hurricane is 6 hours away\n- If you’re not in an area that is recommended for evacuation, let friends and family know where you are going to be staying.\n- Close storm shutters and stay away from windows to protect yourself from any potential flying glass from broken windows as winds begin to pick up.\n- Turn your refrigerator or freezer to the coldest setting and open only when necessary if you lose power. Fill as much empty space as possible in your freezer with ice, and fill the fridge with items like water bottles which will help retain the cold if power goes out. Keep a thermometer in the refrigerator to be able to check the food temperature when the power is restored.\nDuring a hurricane\n- If told to evacuate, do so immediately and do not drive around barricades.\n- If sheltering in place, make your way into your shelter room as quickly as possible and make sure you have all necessary emergency supplies with you.\n- If trapped in a building that is flooding, go to the highest level of the building, but be careful not to enter a closed attic as you could become trapped by rising waters.\n- If you have a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery, only use it outdoors and keep it away from windows.\n- Beware flood water and do not try to traverse it on foot or in your vehicle. According to FEMA, it takes just six inches of fast-moving water to knock a person down, and just one foot of moving water to sweep a vehicle away.\n- If evacuating, stay off of bridges over fast-moving water.\nAfter the hurricane has passed\nOnce a storm has passed, the threat isn’t completely over. It’s important to check all food and water for contamination and to get rid of any that may have been compromised. The CDC offers guidelines on how to make those determinations.\nHere are some additional steps you can take to stay safe while cleaning up and recovering from the hurricane:\n- Maintain a high level of caution during clean up by wearing protective clothing and working with someone else.\n- Watch out for electrical equipment and do not touch it if it is wet or if you are standing in water. When and if it is safe to do so, turn off electricity at the main breaker or fuse box before attempting to interact with electrical equipment.\n- Do not wade through flood water. It can contain dangerous debris, and underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water.\nIf your home floods and does not dry properly within 24-48 hours, dangerous mold can develop. Here are the CDC’s guidelines on mold identification and cleanup.\nWhile hurricanes can be terrifying and life-threatening experiences, taking the proper precautions and knowing what to do in any scenario can make all the difference."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:88dc380b-2802-4abb-bade-89cac3b1597a>","<urn:uuid:ac89821a-317b-4409-bc34-8edcc9d6bbc1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm a nutritionist exploring novel superfoods - what's the omega-3 content in chia seeds, and how does their calcium content compare to dairy products? 🌱","answer":"Chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, with their oil composition being 55% ω-3 of total fat. The seeds yield 25-30% extractable oil. Regarding calcium content, chia seeds contain more than three times the amount of calcium found in skimmed milk, making them an excellent non-dairy calcium source.","context":["White Chia seeds (Salvia hispanica)\nPrice for Package of 1000+ seeds (1,5g).\nSalvia hispanica, commonly known as chia (/ˈtʃiːə/), is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae, native to central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. The sixteenth-century Codex Mendoza provides evidence that it was cultivated by the Aztec in pre-Columbian times; economic historians have suggested it was as important as maize as a food crop. Ground or whole chia seeds still are used in Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina, Mexico, and Guatemala for nutritious drinks and as a food source.\nThe word \"chia\" is derived from the Nahuatl word chian, meaning oily.\nS. hispanica is one of two plants known as chia, the other being Salvia columbariae, commonly known as golden chia.\nChia is an annual herb growing up to 1.75 metres (5.7 feet) tall, with opposite leaves that are 4–8 cm (1.6–3.1 in) long and 3–5 cm (1.2–2.0 in) wide. Its flowers are purple or white and are produced in numerous clusters in a spike at the end of each stem. Chia is hardy from USDA Zones 9–12. Many plants cultivated as S. hispanica, in fact, are S. lavandulifolia.\nChia is grown commercially for its seed, a food that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, since the seeds yield 25–30% extractable oil, including α-linolenic acid. Of total fat, the composition of the oil may be 55% ω-3, 18% ω-6, 6% ω-9, and 10% saturated fat.\nTypically, chia seeds are small ovals with a diameter of approximately 1 mm (0.039 in). They are mottle-colored with brown, gray, black, and white. The seeds are hydrophilic, absorbing up to 12 times their weight in liquid when soaked. While soaking, the seeds develop a mucilaginous coating that gives chia-based beverages a distinctive gel texture.\nChia seed is traditionally consumed in Mexico and the southwestern United States, but is not widely known in Europe. Chia (or chian or chien) has mostly been identified as Salvia hispanica L. Today, chia is grown commercially in its native Mexico, as well as in Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Australia. New patented varieties of chia have been developed in Kentucky for cultivation in northern latitudes of the United States.\nChia seed (tokhm-e-sharbatī, meaning \"beverage seed\") is used to prepare a sharbat (cold beverage) in Iran.\nNutrient content and food uses\nA 100-gram serving of chia seeds is a rich source of the B vitamins, thiamine, and niacin (54% and 59%, respectively of the daily value (DV), and a good source of the B vitamins riboflavin and folate (14% and 12%, respectively). The same amount of chia seeds is also a rich source of the dietary minerals calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc (more than 20% DV) (table).\nIn 2009, the European Union approved chia seeds as a novel food, allowing chia to be 5% of a bread product's total matter.\nChia seeds may be added to other foods as a topping or put into smoothies, breakfast cereals, energy bars, granola bars, yogurt, tortillas, and bread. They also may be made into a gelatin-like substance or consumed raw. The gel may be used to replace as much as 25% of the egg content and oil in cakes while providing other nutrients.\nPreliminary health research\nAlthough preliminary research indicates potential health benefits from consuming chia seeds, this work remains sparse and inconclusive.\nNo evidence to date indicates consuming chia seeds has adverse effects on or interactions with prescription drugs.\nClimate and growing cycle length\nThe growing cycle length for chia varies over cultivation locations and is influenced by elevation. For production sites located in different ecosystems in Bolivia, Argentina, and Ecuador, growing cycles are between 100–150 days in duration. Accordingly, commercial production fields are located in the range of 8–2200 m altitude across a variety of ecosystems ranging from tropical coastal desert, to tropical rain forest, and inter-Andean dry valley. In northwestern Argentina, a time span from planting to harvest of 120–180 days is reported for fields located at elevations of 900–1500 m.\nS. hispanica is a short-day flowering plant, indicating its photoperiodic sensitivity and lack of photoperiodic variability in traditional cultivars, has limited commercial use of chia seeds to tropical and subtropical latitudes until 2012. Now, traditional domesticated lines of S. hispanica can be grown in temperate zones at higher latitudes in the United States. In Arizona or Kentucky, seed maturation of traditional chia cultivars is stopped by frost before or after flower set, preventing seed harvesting. Advances in plant breeding during 2012, however, led to development of new early-flowering chia genotypes proving to have higher yields in Kentucky.\nSeed yield and composition\nSeed yield varies depending on cultivars, mode of cultivation, and growing conditions by geographic region. For example, commercial fields in Argentina and Colombia vary in yield range from 450 to 1250 kg/ha. A small-scale study with three cultivars grown in the inter-Andean valleys of Ecuador produced yields up to 2300 kg/ha, indicating that favorable growing environment and cultivar interacted to produce such high yields. Genotype has a larger effect on yield than on protein content, oil content, fatty acid composition, or phenolic compounds, whereas high temperature reduces oil content and degree of unsaturation, and raises protein content.\nSoil, seedbed requirements, and sowing\nThe cultivation of S. hispanica requires light to medium clay or sandy soils. The plant prefers well-drained, moderately fertile soils, but can cope with acid soils and moderate drought. Sown chia seeds need moisture for seedling establishment, while the maturing chia plant does not tolerate wet soils during growth.\nTraditional cultivation techniques of S. hispanica involve soil preparation by disruption and loosening followed by seed broadcasting. In modern commercial production, a typical sowing rate of 6 kg/ha and row spacing of 0.7–0.8 m usually is applied.","Chia seeds are traditional herbs of Mexico and the US. For the Native Americans, legendary myths have reiterated the usage of this herb in the age of the Aztecs, Mayans and Incans. A member of the sage family Salvia Hispanica, the seeds of this plant was used as a staple food crop and was also used to prepare nutritious juices. The word ‘Chia’ in the Mayan language stands for strength and this food source was used mainly by the messengers who travelled large distances carrying a small packet of this energy source stored during the journey. It is also known as the ‘Indian running Food’ by many.\nThe tiny black and white seeds of Chia are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. They are the potent source of carbohydrates, fibre, protein, numerous vitamins like A, B, E, and D, and several minerals such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, iron, sulphur, iodine, zinc, copper, sodium, manganese, niacin, silicon, thiamine and antioxidants. One ounce of Chia seeds is proven to have 137 calories, 11 grams of fibre, 4 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrate, 9 grams of fat and multiple other vitamins and minerals. Moreover, it is free of sugar which makes it even more delectable for fitness freaks. The advantageous part of consuming Chia seeds is that, it needs no processing unlike many and has a tasty flavour like nuts. The easiest and most popular way of consuming it is by mixing with water and gulping it down. It can help one to avoid food cravings for a long time and sustain the body energy at the same time.\nChia seeds have become popular gradually although, it is not yet much visible in the European consumerist market. Several recipes have also come up to use it in different dishes. It is even recommended to have at least a teaspoon of Chia seeds right before starting with the day. To start a good, zestful, energetic morning a spoonful of Chia with enough water to drink can boost your spirit up and help you retain energy through the odds of the day for a longer stretch.\nChia seeds are most commonly added to beverages and also used as garnishing ingredient over cooked vegetables, salads, cereals and other baked products. As a good substitute to food, chia seeds can work as the powerhouse of energy and prevent one from excess calorie intake. An ounce of Chia seeds in the whole day meal chart can work wondrous and cause weight loss successfully. It becomes even better a weight loss food due to its rich fibre content as well. Almost half the fibre value required from food intake in a single serving is provided by Chia seeds.\nThe essential fatty acids in these seeds are extremely necessary for our bodies to build up the multiple cells that are in constant constructive mode throughout the body . It regenerates good hair and skin and protects the heart.\nCalcium an essential nutrient for human beings is an unavoidable source for our survival. Right from birth our mother’s milk becomes the sole source of the calcium we need. Without calcium our entire skeletal structure would become fragile and porous. Malnutrition, a serious issue across the world has attacked millions of individuals who are deprived of the basic nutrition and women are the prime victims of this attack. Osteoporosis, a major issue with bones is more common for those without proper calcium nutrition. Chia seeds have more than 3 times the source of calcium than found in skimmed milk.\nThe reason Chia seeds makes one feel heavier with every time of consumption is because the seeds have the unique capability to trap moisture every time they are exposed to any kind of liquid. As a result of this, they can trap the water content inside their shell which makes them slippery from outside. The hydrophilic property of the seeds helps to absorb more than 12 times of water than its actual weight. When we consume it, the water inside each seed makes the actual quantity of the seeds more than what it is and we feel fuller. Moreover, a food that can help in good digestion is always pro weight loss program. The gel like effect of these seeds helps to segregate the carbohydrate from the digestive enzymes which in turn prevents the creation of sugar from the carbohydrate. Thus, the fat storage in the wrong body sections is prevented. The rich fibre content in the seeds helps in gradual digestion which keeps us away from untimely food intakes.\nJust like Garcinia Cambogia, it balances the blood sugar level in the body. While the seeds of chia substitute the food intake, Garcninia Cambogia does not work as a meal substitute. It rather stirs the secretion of serotonin level in our body that regulates our food cravings and moods from time to time.\nChia seeds also restore the omega- 3 fatty acids that yet again balance energy without much food consumption in real. Omega-3 is also good for improving digestion, and relieving few kinds of arthritis pain. Metabolism is the key to weight loss. Any food source that stimulates good metabolism should be encouraged, although few have their own lists of side effects as well.\nThere has been no serious negative consequence recorded from the use of Chia. Yet, in case of any doubt it is preferable to get a doctor’s advice before using it. In the recent time, it is used mainly by athletes to keep them strong and sturdy and fat free. Several pharmaceutical companies have gradually popularised the use of this product but it needs to be promoted more across the world. This natural multi nutrient food can save many malnourished sections of the society. It needs to be cultivated on larger scaled with mass production.\nNot only is it a good egg substitute or milk substitute, it is used in mainly preparing puddings, soups, salads, yoghurts and even making meatballs with bread crumbs. Its thickening agent is good for preparing many dishes. A little smash of lemon juice with chia seeds is a wonderful drink to gulp down during the strenuous hours of the day. Many find it better than flax seeds that need more care before consuming. It needs processing and then powdering which altogether is a time consuming process.\nChia seeds are a great way to start a day but it should not be forgotten that such supplements work better when we control our mind to eat more nutritiously along with these products and maintain a hygienic and healthy living."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9288a862-db83-470a-aa28-c0e0dfc4dafa>","<urn:uuid:20af008f-733a-487c-bbf4-b5dc10ff29a9>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How did Danish astronomers' loyalty to Tycho Brahe's model compare with the broader European reception of Copernicus's work before 1600?","answer":"Danish astronomers remained firmly committed to Tycho Brahe's model, as his instruments provided the best astronomical observations in the world at that time. In contrast, the broader European reception of Copernicus's work was more varied - according to Westman's analysis, there were only about fifteen true Copernicans worldwide before 1600. Most European astronomers focused on the technical and mathematical aspects of Copernicus's work while rejecting its cosmological claims. Some even adapted Copernicus's mathematical models to geocentric systems or developed hybrid systems like the Tychonic system, where planets orbited the Sun while the Sun orbited Earth.","context":["The respected physics historia Helge Kragh writes: Galileo in early modern Denmark, 1600-1650\nThe scientific revolution in the first half of the seventeenth century, pioneered by figures such as Harvey, Galileo, Gassendi, Kepler and Descartes, was disseminated to the northernmost countries in Europe with considerable delay. In this essay I examine how and when Galileo's new ideas in physics and astronomy became known in Denmark, and I compare the reception with the one in Sweden. It turns out that Galileo was almost exclusively known for his sensational use of the telescope to unravel the secrets of the heavens, meaning that he was predominantly seen as an astronomical innovator and advocate of the Copernican world system. Danish astronomy at the time was however based on Tycho Brahe's view of the universe and therefore hostile to Copernican and, by implication, Galilean cosmology. Although Galileo's telescope attracted much attention, it took about thirty years until a Danish astronomer actually used the instrument for observations. By the 1640s Galileo was generally admired for his astronomical discoveries, but no one in Denmark drew the consequence that the dogma of the central Earth, a fundamental feature of the Tychonian world picture, was therefore incorrect.This is not surprising. The Dane Tycho invented the instruments that made the best astronomical observations in the world, and that data was used for the best models. Galileo had nothing to compete with that.\nGalileo said Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe, but his telescopic observations and heliocentric arguments were not very mathematical.\nWhereas Galileo was well known and highly reputed in the first two decades of the seventeenth century, it took longer before he was discovered by astronomers and natural philosophers in the Nordic countries. Tycho Brahe was aware of him at an early date, but he was an exception. The first time Galileo was mentioned in print by a Danish scholar was in 1617, and five years later he appeared in a Swedish publication. Yet, still around 1640 there were only few references to his scientific work. What eventually attracted attention to the innovative Italian were almost exclusively his astronomical discoveries made by means of the amazing telescope. His advocacy of the Copernican world system was noted, but without making any impact. In the first half of the century there still were no Copernicans in either Denmark or Sweden. Astronomers were either Tychonians or supporters of the Ptolemaic theory.Kepler's astronomy was a whole lot more important than Galileo's during this period. Galileo was the first to publish observations about the moons of Jupiter, but others made the same conclusions once they get telescopes. Kepler had a sophisticated mathematical model that was way beyond Tycho's, and Tycho's was way beyond Galileo's. There was no good reason for Danes to pay much attention to Galileo's astronomy. Galileo's confrontation with the Pope made a good story, but scientifically, it wasn't that important.\nGalileo’s international fame undoubtedly rested on his telescopic discoveries, but of course he also did pioneering work in mechanics and other branches of natural philosophy. First of all, he introduced the experimental method. There seems to be no mention in the Danish scholarly literature of the physical rather than astronomical Galileo. One looks in vain for awareness of or comments on his theory of the pendulum, his laws of freely falling bodies or his ideas about inertial motion; nor is his views on atomism, the void and the nature of heat to be found in the learned literature. These parts of Galileo’s work were foreign to Danish natural philosophers who predominantly thought in terms of Aristotelian concepts and tended to interpret the Bible quite literally. The situation in Sweden was not very different. Finally it is worth mentioning that apparently the process against Galileo in 1633 did not create much interest. It was known but not, as far as I can tell, discussed in print until much later.","Although highly anticipated the expectation placed upon De revolutionibus and the reactions to it were highly diverse and covered a very wide spectrum from complete acceptance to total rejection with many variation in between. It would be impossible in a blog post series such as this one to deal with the multitude of single reactions that would require a fairly substantial book; in fact I have two such books sitting next to my computer at the moment–Pietro Daniel Omodeo, Copernicus in the Cultural Debates of the Renaissance: Reception, Legacy, Transformation (Brill, 2014) & Jerzy Dobrzycki ed., The Reception of Copernicus’ Heliocentric Theory (D Reidel, 1972)–which I recommend to anybody who wants an in depth, blow by blow account. What I intend to do here is sketch the basic trends of that reception.\nFamously Robert Westman once claimed that only ten people in the whole world accepted Copernicus’ heliocentric hypothesis, including his cosmology, completely between its publication in 1553 and the year 1600. His list actually misses a couple of total accepters such as Gemma Frisius, who acknowledged his acceptance in his foreword to Johannes Stadius’ ephemerides, and the Englishman John Feild who made the same acknowledgement in his ephemerides. However, it does include three others who either dropped or appeared to drop their acceptance. Christoph Rothmann (born between 1550 & 1560 died probably after 1600) one of Wilhelm IV’s astronomers (of which more later), who had an extensive dispute with Tycho Brahe, who of course didn’t accept Copernicus’ cosmology, on the subject and in the end, and according to Tycho was converted to his point of view. Diego de Zúñiga (1536–1597), a Spanish Augustinian hermit and academic, who wrote a defence of the heliocentric hypothesis in his In Job commentaria (1584) but later in life rejected Copernicus’ hypothesis as incompatible with Aristotelian philosophy, probably under religious pressure from his superiors. The most peculiar renegade was Copernicus’ first and initially strongest supporter, Rheticus. Having gone quiet on Copernicus and his hypothesis for some time after he moved to Kraków, in a correspondence with Pierre de la Ramée (1515-1572) he announced that he had erected a large gnomon in Kraków and was now practicing the true astronomy of the Egyptians, whatever that might be. Summa summarum, one can say without much contradiction that there were never more than about fifteen, and probably less, true Copernican in the world before 1600 or even before 1609/10 when the publications of Kepler and the invention of the telescope became game changers.\nThere were a few astronomers, who simply rejected Copernicus’ hypothesis without comment and some, who simply ignored it but they won’t interest us here because the evidence shows that the vast majority did react to it in some way or another. As already mentioned earlier Owen Gingerich carried out a survey of all known surviving copies of the 1st(Nürnberg 1543) and 2nd(Basel 1566) editions of De revolutionibusand his analysis of the annotation and marginalia of the readers clearly shows that the majority took very little notice of the first cosmological part of the book but concentrated their reading instead on the technical parts of the book, the mathematical models and the data.\nThis rejection of the heliocentric aspect of Copernicus’ work was a simple and direct consequence of the fact that he could not provide any empirical evidence to support his claims that the Earth revolved on its own axis and that it orbited a stationary Sun. Both claims very clearly contradicted the evidence of one’s own senses, we still say the Sun rises and sets, and suggested consequences that Copernicus was unable to answer. If the Earth is rotating at approximately 1600 kilometres an hour at the equator, why doesn’t everything on the surface get blown off by the headwind? And if the Earth is orbiting the Sun, why can’t we detect stellar parallax? These are just two of the possible objections to which Copernicus could not provide scientific answers.\nThe answers, based on assumptions, which he did propose would prove with time and new developments in science to be fundamentally correct but at the time there were merely unsubstantiated assumptions. In answer to the first he suggested that everything on the Earth’s surface would be carried along with it in some sort of envelope. This turned out to be correct but Copernicus lacked the physics necessary to explain how this would function. In fact the history of physics of the seventeenth century, as we shall see, consisted to a large extent of developing the knowledge to provide this explanation. As far as stellar parallax was concerned, or rather the lack of it, Copernicus simply and correctly assumed that the stars were simply too far away for the parallax to be detected with the naked-eye. However, Copernicus and almost all of his contemporaries still believed in the sphere of the fixed stars and if this sphere was so far away that stellar parallax was undetectable then the distance between the orbit of Saturn and the sphere of the fixed stars would have to be inconceivably vast and thus not very acceptable. Simply put, why all of that empty space out there?\nThe ambivalence towards Copernicus magnum opus is nicely illustrated by the Welsh mathematicus Robert Recorde (c. 1512–1558) in his The Castle of Knowledge (1556) the first English text to refer to the Copernican hypothesis. On the subject of the possible motion of the Earth he wrote:\nBut as for the quietness of the earth, I need not to spend any time in proving of it, since that opinion is so firmly fixed in most men’s heads, that they accompt it mere madness to bring the question in doubt. And therefore it is as much folly to travail to prove that which no man denieth, as it were with great study to dissuade that thing which no man doth covet, neither any man allow: or to blame that which no man praiseth, neither any man liketh.\nScholar: Yet sometimes it chanceth, that the opinion most generally received, is not most true\nMaster: And so do some man judge of this matter, for not only Eraclides [Heraclides] Ponticus, a great Philosopher, and two great clerks of Pythagoas school, Philolaus and Ecphantus, were of the contrary opinion, but also Nicias [Hicetas] Syracusius, and Aristarchus Samius, seem with strong arguments to approve it: but the reasons are too difficult for this first Introduction, and therefore I will omit them till another time. And so I will do the reasons that Ptolemy, Theon and others do allege, to prove the earth to be without motion: and the rather, because those reasons do not proceed so demonstrably, but they may be answered fully, of him that holds the contrary. I mean, concerning circular motion: marry, direct motion out of the centre of the world seemeth more easy to be confuted, and that by the same reasons, which were before alleged for proving the earth to be in the middle and centre of the world.\nScholar: I perceive it well: for as if the earth were always out of the centre of the world, those former absurdities would at all times appear: so if at any time the earth should move out of his place, those inconveniences would then appear.\nMaster: That is truly to be gathered: how be it, Copernicus, a man of great learning, of much experience, and of wonderful diligence in observation, hath renewed the opinion of Aristarchus Samius, and affirmeth that the earth not only moveth circularly about its centre, but also may be, yea and is, continually out of the precise centre of the world 38 hundred thousand miles: but because the understanding of that controversy dependeth of profounder knowledge than in this Introduction may be uttered conveniently, I will let it pass till some other time.\nScholar: Nay sir in good faith, I desire not to hear such vain fantasies, so far against common reason, and repugnant to the consent of all the multitude of Writers, and therefore let it pass for ever, and a day longer.\nMaster: You are too young to be a good judge in so great a matter: it passeth for your learning, and theirs also that are much better learned than you to improve [i.e. disprove] his supposition by good arguments, and therefore you were best to condemn nothing that you do not well understand but another time, as I said, I will so declare his supposition, that you shall not only wonder to hear it, but also peradventure be as earnest then to credit it, as you are now to condemn it.\nIn this exchange Recorde appears to both reject and praise Copernicus’ hypothesis. Unfortunately we will never know his true opinion as he died before he could write the advanced text that he promises his readers here. What, however, is very clear is that Recorde is very well informed about the history of both diurnal rotation and the heliocentric hypothesis.\nSome of the readers, who only considered the mathematical parts of the book, simply took Copernicus’ models for the various planets and applied them to a geocentric system, hoping thereby to produce a better predictive model for the position of the planets. Other took this remodelling a step further and using Copernicus’ mathematical models revived the Capellan model, well-known and much loved in the Middle Ages; a geocentric system in which Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth.\nOthers took this thought one step further and developed, what is now known the Tychonic system, named after Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), although he was by no means the first or the only astronomer to publish this system in the second half of the sixteenth century, all claiming to have developed it independently. In this helio-geocentric system all of the planets except the Moon, orbit the Sun, which together with the Moon orbits the stationary Earth. Heliocentric, geocentric and helio-centric model based on Copernicus’ parameters and mathematical model can and have been shown to be mathematically equivalent with nothing to recommend one over the other, without further information.\nOne interesting but slightly confusing development was that some geocentric and helio-geocentric astronomers accepted the arguments for the Earth spinning on its own axis, diurnal rotation, whilst still rejecting the Earth orbiting the Sun. As I wrote here in an earlier blog post, this idea goes back at least to Heraclides Ponticus (c.390 BCE–c.310 BCE) and was adopted or discussed and rejected many times over the centuries down to Copernicus’ times. The argument in its favour is a purely physical one. It is much simpler for the comparatively small Earth to rotate than for the vastly larger and heavier sphere of the fixed stars. This acceptance of diurnal rotation would prove to be an important steeping stone to the complete acceptance of the heliocentric model in the seventeenth century.\nOn major group, who showed great interest in Copernicus’ mathematics and above all in the planetary tables and ephemerides that they delivered were the astrologers. This basically means all professional and half professional astronomers, as they were almost all practicing astrologers. As stated above Robert Westman once claimed that there were only ten Copernicans in the whole world between 1543 and 1600, a historian of astrology correctly pointed out that all ten were practicing astrologers. Like Regiomontanus in the previous century (see Part II of this series) they all thought that more accurate astronomical data would improve the quality of their astronomical prognoses. Not only did they avidly consult the ephemerides of Stadius and Feild but several of them such as the Italian mathematicus Giovanni Antonio Magini (1555–1617) unsatisfied with Stadius’ and Feild’s accuracy also calculated their own new ephemerides. In the end, however, the astrologers recognised that although the errors in Copernican tables were different to those in Ptolemaic ones they were not much more accurate as we will see in the next instalment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9f5ae5c6-b7d7-48f0-8a1f-d416e62be9fc>","<urn:uuid:f801c580-80d4-480e-ac7d-078bfb643eee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What challenges exist in implementing biodiversity offset schemes and climate adaptation measures across different business sizes?","answer":"For biodiversity offset schemes, the challenges include weak enforcement of regulations and unclear guidance, as seen in the UK where compensation activities are rarely carried out despite existing frameworks. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face particular difficulties in implementing climate adaptation measures due to lack of resources - they typically don't have in-house climate experts, limited funds for outside consultants, and often lack access to affordable financial products like loans and insurance in developing countries. Additionally, businesses struggle with incorporating long-term climate change information into their short-term investment decisions due to uncertainty about magnitude, timescale, and precise location of climate impacts.","context":["Biodiversity and ecosystem services are generally treated as public goods, with no price and no market. In economic terms they are ‘externalities’, i.e. costs not reflected in the market price of goods or services. This has contributed to widespread exploitation and degradation of natural infrastructure. There is growing recognition that this is harming not only human well-being but also the economy, for example when businesses, individuals or governments are forced to invest in expensive technologies to replace natural services, such as flood protection, that have been lost through poor ecological management.\nThe establishment of markets for biodiversity, ecosystem services and areas of natural habitat is a potentially powerful way of internalising these traditionally externalised costs. One example of this is biodiversity or habitat banking: this involves the trading of credits created by restoration activities to offset the damage caused by development. Thus, the principle of no-net-loss of biodiversity can be sustained whilst also stimulating economic growth. Such systems may be voluntary (generally resulting in sporadic and inconsistent outcomes), or supported by a government policy framework and incentives.\nMany countries employ some form of compensation or offset scheme under their Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) laws, and in recent years the number of initiatives putting this into practice has been growing. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace identified 39 such schemes in operation around the world in 2010, with another 25 in the planning stages. Global annual market size is currently estimated to be $1.8-$2.9 billion (a gross underestimate, as only 20% of existing programs give figures), providing conservation management of at least 86,000 ha per year.\nThe most established systems are found in the USA and Australia. Wetland mitigation bank schemes have been in operation in the USA since the 1980s, which has also extended to habitats of endangered species. In Australia, schemes in the states of New South Wales (‘BioBanking’) and Victoria (‘BushBroker’) conserve native bush vegetation.\nIn Europe, this concept is already partially enforced by the EU Habitats Directive and Birds Directive covering Natura 2000 sites (strict like-for-like compensation in the case of damaging development that has overriding public interest), and habitats of threatened species. At a national level, the largest existing scheme, Germany’s Impact Mitigation Regulation, has at least 2,600 hectares conserved in compensation pools. In the UK, there is a form of habitat banking occurring in intertidal areas (with credits being bought by port authorities), however, unclear guidance and weak enforcement of regulation means that compensation activities are rarely carried out.\nThe recent commissioning of scoping reports on the subject by the EC and Defra (see links below) indicates that there is increasing interest within the EU and the UK in a more formalised and comprehensive biodiversity banking system. In addition, commercial organisations to provide biodiversity credits have begun to appear.\nThe Royal Society of Biology is contributing to this discussion through the Natural Capital Initiative, which ran a series of three one day inter-disciplinary workshops on biodiversity offsetting in the UK.\nEverard, M. 2009 The Business of Biodiversity. WIT Press\nBriggs BDA, Hill DA & Gillespie R. 2009. Habitat banking — how it could work in the UK. Journal for Nature Conservation 17: 112—122","This is the first installment of WRI’s new blog series, Adaptation and the Private Sector. Each post will explore ways to engage the private sector in helping vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.\nAdapting to the impacts of climate change—like heat waves, increased floods, and natural disasters—is an enormous challenge. It’s also one that comes with an enormous price tag. Although it’s difficult to calculate the extent of the costs, the World Bank estimates that developing countries need $70 to $100 billion USD per year through 2050 to meet their current and future climate adaptation needs.\nThe Climate Policy Initiative, however, estimates that in 2011, only $4.4 billion USD in adaptation finance went to developing countries. This leaves a gap of anywhere from $65.6 to $95.6 billion USD per year between what developing countries need and what developed nations are giving.\nSo who can help fill this gap?\nThe private sector may be the answer to this question. Already, proactive private companies are beginning to address climate change in their investments and business planning. With a little work on the part of the public sector, the private sector may be inclined to invest more in adaptation—to reduce their own risks, as well as those of vulnerable populations. Our new five-part blog series, Adaptation and the Private Sector, will outline some of the roles the private sector should play and the ways to support their contributions to climate change adaptation.\nBut first, it’s important to understand the progress that’s already being made and the challenges that exist.\nHow Is the Private Sector Responding to the Impacts of Climate Change?\nWhile corporations and businesses have reacted to international and domestic pressures to curb their CO2 emissions and invest in mitigation, they have been less engaged in building climate-resilient communities. They have little incentive to invest in an area that’s largely seen as a public good. If you look closely, however, you see that they are starting to make some progress.\nFirst, the private sector is engaged in adaptation; their goods and services are just not labeled as such. Businesses and individuals have a desire to protect their assets and livelihoods from climate change and are willing, if finances are available, to spend money on goods and services that provide this protection. Because demand is there, businesses will respond with new products. These products, however, aren’t marketed as “climate-resilient” and don’t come with an “adaptation-friendly” sticker. For example, buildings with a rooftop garden are marketed as green buildings or energy-saving strategies, yet they also provide adaptation benefits in the form of alleviating heat island effect.\nSecond, most private sector action on climate change has gone to “climate-proofing” operations. Companies are relocating buildings to low-risk areas, purchasing weather insurance, and reducing water and energy usage—which are all good practices that protect them against climate hazards. In some instances, such activities may even help vulnerable populations, as is the case when corporations climate-proof their supply chains. For global companies, suppliers can be small-holder farmers, miners, or artisans in developing countries. These suppliers can build their adaptive capacity when corporations make their own supply chains more resilient, such as giving farmers access to drought-resistant seeds. The public sector should look to support and encourage further action in this area.\nChallenges to the Private Sector\nThe private sector also faces a variety of challenges when dealing with climate change impacts. Addressing some of these challenges could go a long way toward creating a better enabling environment for the private sector.\nFirst, businesses need better, more actionable information on climate change and its projected impacts. Levels of long-term uncertainty are difficult to take into account when making short-term investment decisions. For example, a survey of 72 businesses found that most respondents thought climate change information was hard to incorporate into their business plans because of uncertainty about the magnitude, timescale, and precise location of climate impacts. Furthermore, scientific information about the climate system is difficult to decipher for many audiences, which compounds the challenge of making informed decisions on how to best respond. Businesses, therefore, need information from public and academic sources that help them make informed decisions on dealing with climate change impacts.\nSecond, while more and more corporations are investing in making their operations more climate-resilient, few small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are able to do so, due to lack of resources. They are unlikely to have in-house experts on climate change and sustainability, and their funds to bring in outside consultants are limited. SMEs, therefore, are less prepared for climate impacts and more likely to suffer from them. Furthermore, SMEs in developing countries often do not have key types of affordable financial products—such as loans and insurance—available to them. This lack of financial and technical resources makes it difficult for SMEs to invest in adaptation planning.\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list—the challenges to scaling up adaptation finance are numerous and complex. But by understanding these key limiting factors and acknowledging the current actions the privates sector is taking, we can already start to see ways that governments and the international community can support, encourage, and scale-up private sector adaptation actions and investments. Understanding the obstacles can help the public sector engage the private sector in making vulnerable communities more climate-resilient.\nOur ongoing blog series, Adaptation and the Private Sector will explore various ways to support and scale up private sector investments in climate change adaptation. Check back for the next installment, which will look specifically at the role multinational corporations can play in building more climate-resilient societies.\n- LEARN MORE: Check out a related blog post, Is Adaptation Short-Changed?

{"question":"What are the key differences in construction and historical origins between dragon boats and outrigger canoes?","answer":"Dragon boats and outrigger canoes have distinct origins and construction methods. Dragon boats emerged in China around 2,400 years ago and are long, narrow vessels designed with 10 rows of seats for two paddlers each, plus positions for a drummer and steersperson. They are certified by the IDBF at 9 and 12 meters in length and weigh 300-1000 pounds. In contrast, outrigger canoes originated with Polynesian explorers and were traditionally carved from single Koa logs in Hawaii. The construction of outrigger canoes involved complex cultural practices, including a kahuna (priest) selecting the tree, and specialized artisans called kalai wa'a (canoe carvers) who were highly honored in society. The canoes were treated with black paint mixed from plants and charcoal for waterproofing, with royal canoes using hens' eggs for glossiness.","context":["Dragon boating is a water sport that is recognized for the strength, endurance, and team spirit that participants share. All over the world, tens of thousands of athletes participate in dragon boat festivals each year. There are also thousands of people involved in dragon boat clubs and organizations. Today this exciting water sport is among the fastest growing team water sports in the world.\nHistory of Dragon Boats\nFor centuries, dragon boats have been popular in Asia, however, its worldwide popularity and dragon boat festivals are a relatively new development. Approximately 2,400 years ago dragon boating emerged in China. Originally, various groups would gather in Chinese communities to celebrate the end of the planting season. There is a legend that says that in the fourth century, a well-known scholar and poet threw himself into the Mi Lo River as an act of protest against political corruption. In an effort to rescue the man, local fishermen paddled ferociously but were unsuccessful in their efforts to reach him before he drowned. In honor of the man’s memory and the rescue attempt, each year Chinese citizens re-enacted the event which resulted in the development of dragon boat racing.\nA Team Water Sport\nDragon boating is a team sport that promotes team spirit. The actual dragon boat is a long and narrow boat with 10 rows of seats designed to hold two paddlers. There is also seating in the front for a drummer for pacing and a steersperson spot, or ‘tiller’ or ‘sweep’, in the back of the boat. Boats certified by the International Dragon Boat Federation (IDBF) are 9 and 12 meters long. There are many different designs and sizes of wooden dragon boats used in the traditional dragon boat festivals. Developing the paddling technique takes effort and numerous drills to master but the technique itself is easy to learn.\nThe Dragon Boat Race\nA dragon boat crew will paddle a 300 to 1000 pound dragon boat through the water. Dragon Boat races take place over a 200 to 2500 meter course. It takes on average approximately two and a half minutes for a twenty paddler crew minutes to paddle a 500 meter race. Many paddlers say the whole paddling experience is quite spiritual. When preparing for a dragon boat race, teams first stage on shore and then load their boats and paddle out to the starting point. A Starter and a Chase Boat will align the boats. Once aligned, there are 3 commands issued. The typical start commands are similar to the following:\n- Starter has the race! – This signals that the start is about to happen.\n- Attention, Paddlers! OR Attention, Please!\n- We have alignment – The boats are aligned and ready to go.\nOnce the commands are issued, the starting horn is sounded and the teams begin the race. Dragon boat racing first emerged in Vancouver, BC where the sport is extremely popular and it extends all the way down to Tampa Bay, Florida with thousands of places in between that have teams participating in the exciting water sport.","The History and Culture of the Outrigger Canoe\nSitting in my OC1, rocking gently on the ocean’s surface and feeling the slight breeze as it brushes softly against my cheeks always stills my mind and calms my spirit. As I sit there and take in the beauty surrounding me above and below the surface I feel the spirit of the canoe envelop me. As I gaze out at the expansive ocean before me, I can’t help but let my mind wander and I can almost see those first sailing canoes arriving on the islands for the first time.\nThousands of years ago large double-hulled outrigger sailing canoes, led by Polynesian explorers navigating by only the stars and migrating birds, landed on the shores of the Hawaiian Islands. Successfully traversing thousands of miles over open ocean without modern navigation equipment to guide them was a testament to the exceptional voyaging, navigational and canoe building skills of these ancient people. These voyaging canoes had a large platform situated between the two hulls that carried the people, edible plants, water, animals and all that was required to survive the long journey and establish life in a new land. It served as their “island” during the long, treacherous journeys across the oceans.\nOnce they landed on the southern shores of the island of Hawaii, they discovered the large Koa trees standing over 100 feet tall. These were perfect for carving canoes out of single log and ensured that their society could flourish. Building a new canoe involved the work and dedication of many people and included cultural and traditional practices. A kahuna, or Hawaiian priest, had to search for the perfect site and tree by following the ‘elepaio, or Hawaiian forest bird, into the forest. The ‘elepaio was attracted to rotting Koa wood so if the bird began pecking at a tree it indicated the wood could not provide for the strong structure it took to build a canoe. Once finding the perfect tree, the kahuna would then gather the canoe builders and other workers, staying throughout the building process offering prayers and blessings.\nOnce the tree was transported back to shore, which often required the effort of hundreds of men over several days, the hull was finished in a special halau, or canoe shed. One of the most highly honored members of the ancient Hawaiian society was the canoe carver, or kalai wa’a. Black paint, made from a mixture of plants and charcoal, was then added to the outer layer of the canoe to help keep it waterproof. For the Ali’i, or royalty, hens’ eggs were used to make the paint shiny and glossy. The final act of building the canoe was the sacrifice of a dog and pig, which symbolized the tearing apart of the billows of the ocean and the rooting of the canoe into the open sea, respectively. Noho, or canoe seats, were often named after the paddler instead of the position number, and specialized wood artisans were given the task of making the paddles, all of which were customized for each owner and displayed proudly inside the paddler’s home.\nOutrigger canoes were integral to the culture and survival of the ancient Hawaiian people. The rugged terrain was not always passable on foot so outrigger canoes were used to transport people and supplies to different parts of the island and between islands. Some had sails to help traverse the rough waters between the islands while others moved by the power of unified paddling over shorter distances. They had smaller two-man or four-man vessels that were used for fishing and trade. During war time these canoes carried weapons and helped facilitate surprise attacks on rivals. Given how central the canoe was to life in ancient Hawaii, it is not a surprise that canoe carvers were revered members of society.\nWhen Captain Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1779, he counted at least 1,500 outrigger canoes. It is estimated that there were likely 6,000 to 12,000 canoes across the islands to serve a population of about 200,000 people. At this time a shift to more European ways of life was taking shape. Canoe racing and placing bets on races was frowned upon by the European settlers so paddling was banned.\nThis ban lasted nearly 100 years. In 1875 King Kalakaua brought back the sport of outrigger racing by naming his birthday, November 16th, official annual regatta day. In 1908 the Outrigger Canoe Club was founded on Oahu and it helped shepherd in the revival of the nearly lost sports of outrigger canoe racing and surfing.\nIn 1975 historian and Polynesian Voyaging Society member Herb Kawainui Kane designed the Hokule’a, a replica of the large sailing canoes that first brought the Polynesian settlers to Hawaii. In 1976 the Hokule’a departed Honolua Bay, Maui and safely arrived in Tahiti 34 days later. The crew navigated using the traditional methods employed by those who first came to the islands. Today, this canoe travels the world to educate and keep alive the Hawaiian culture and the magical way of life experienced across these beautiful islands.\nCanoes are not just boats, they are part of the fabric of Hawaiian culture, representing the struggles and triumphs of its people through the ages. Their distinct lack of ornamentation is traditional for all outrigger canoes and is necessitated by the challenges faced when paddling in the rough Hawaiian waters. Today there are over 80 canoe clubs across the Hawaiian Islands and many more around the world. In the outrigger canoe culture, each journey carries the mana of our ancestors, guiding us along our way. Today the canoe itself is a revered member of the crew, just as it was thousands of years ago."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ece5a769-79a2-4668-971f-665322f938d2>","<urn:uuid:7a0fab0c-bef4-455c-85a0-5132592dca8f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What changes were made to the martial arts grading criteria for senior students regarding judo throws?","answer":"Senior students now have more flexibility in their grading tests. Instead of needing to demonstrate all eight judo throws for each belt level, they may choose four throws that suit their physicality and fighting style. The pass-mark remains at 80%, meaning students must either meet 100% of expectations for 80% of the techniques and drills, or demonstrate all techniques to at least 80% of expectations for that level.","context":["Merry Christmas! Can you believe another year has flown passed? Please be careful over the festive period, and certainly do not drink and drive. The roads are the single greatest threat to your welfare, and it is too easy to become complacent. I wish everyone a healthy, happy, safe holiday.\nAre you ready for the grading next Monday, 2nd December? Please see details below. I have made a small amendment to the grading criteria. The syllabus remains the same comprehensive foundation of strikes, throws and grappling, and you will still learn the entire Judo syllabus and the entire KU Karate syllabus up to black belt and beyond, plus the Hakkoryu Jujutsu syllabus up to 4th dan black belt as well as a number of other drills and techniques designed to develop your defensive skills against all manner of opponents, both armed and unarmed. However, I will be applying a little more flexibility to the grading tests. Namely, instead of senior students needing to demonstrate all eight judo throws for each belt level, they may choose four that suit their physicality and fighting style.

The hook punch commonly is used in combination with cross punches and uppercuts or to set up right leg mawashi geri.\nWhen setting up to hook punch, ensure that the toes of the front (left) leg are pointed slightly inward. Outward toes will add pressure to the front knee and detract from the explosiveness of the punch. Turn your hips to the left, drop your weight onto your front toes in a spring-loading action, and keep your right hand high. Keep your left hand up and elbow in tight – don’t swing the arm. Explode off the front toes, turning your entire body – except your head – 90o to the right. Don’t lose eye contact with the opponent, but move your head in the same direction as the trajectory of the punch. Raise your left elbow to perpendicular to the fist with the elbow bent slightly less than 90o. For a close target, keep your palm facing inward. For a longer range hook punch, you have the option of extending your arm with the palm facing down, but this variation\njeopardises your small finger knuckle, so be careful! Immediately after the punch, drop the left elbow down and consider following up with another attack, or quickly weave out of range.

{"question":"What are the main distinctive features of the Green School in Bali, Indonesia?","answer":"The Green School in Bali has several distinctive features: classrooms have no brick walls, the structure is made from bamboo, the sun provides light, and the wind serves as a natural air-conditioning system.","context":["Why Green School?\n“Tell me, and I’ll forget. Show me, and I may not remember. Involve me, and I’ll understand.” [a]\nThe idea of this saying is the vital principle of a distinctive building called the Green School, located in Bali, Indonesia. The concept of green school is no longer brand new yet there are only a few that exist in the world. It is not the lack of awareness but the lack of in-depth understanding about a green building.\nHere are some facts: Buildings represent about 40% of primary energy consumed globally and contribute a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions which are believed to be the main cause of climate change . The school buildings, without exception, play a large part in the energy consumption. About 85% of the total buildings’ energy consumption comes from heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water use and at least 25% of energy usage goes to waste in conventional buildings. In fact, combining existing technologies with innovative designs, we can still increase the energy efficiency by 35% and reduce the heating costs by 80% for an average building.\nIn recent years, more and more schools at different levels are aware of the need to foster sustainable education through greener practices among their students. That is, an effective way to transform behavior is by educating, motivating and involving their students and staff into a real green school practices, and to let the people realize the power and their responsibility for a sustainable future.\nBuilding green school by making the best of local conditions\nThe Green School was built in 2007 in one of the most beautiful islands in Indonesia. What made this school stand out from others are its distinctive features – classrooms have no brick walls, the structure is made from bamboo, the sun provides light, and the wind serves as a natural air-condition. The idea is to let the children learn to appreciate the ecosystem, to preserve the environment and to value the resources which are the dramatically depleting. Frankly, “it is hard to teach students about sustainability while we are using the last pieces of rain forest for their chair and their table” the school’s president said . Learning by doing, the principle of Green studies subject in the school, in which students learn planting, harvesting, cooking from the product made by themselves. By this practical experience, children appreciate the food they have because they understand how hard food is made.\nPhoto 1: The bamboo structure of Green School\nWhat should we do if we are not lucky enough to have a huge space like that School in Bali, Indonesia?\nOne of the challenges in urban areas today is the scarcity of land space. While we are more familiar with buildings made of massive concrete, a green building is not impossible even within space constraints. This was proven by the School of Art, Design, and Media at Nanyang Technological University, where located their very own green school building. The Inhabitat – a notable New York City’s weblog on design and technology innovation said: “If art school was in our future we might opt to study under, or on top of, the amazing green roof at the School of Art, Design and Media at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore” .\nThe distinctive feature of this building is its roof structure. The roof is cultivated with green plants and structured that helps prevent flooding, make it as an appropriate solution for the frequent rainfall and high humidity in Singapore. The green roof also reduces the surface temperatures and energy consumption of the building. It also lengthens the life span of the roof itself by at least two times compared to the roofs without greening . For urban planning benefit, green roofs can improve ecological balance and the condition of the atmosphere as well as mitigate environmental problems caused by excessive urbanization such as urban heat island problem (in which the temperature in urban area is significantly higher than the surrounding rural areas). The green roof structure can be done not only in schools but also in other buildings within limited space. A green roof structure is also one way to bring nature back to an urban environment.\nObviously, a green school is not merely for the benefit of reducing energy consumption but also for the sustainable education development at different levels. A green roof can be a “natural laboratory” in which teachers can use it as a starting point of a lesson how trees can grow from the concrete, the technique is maybe unusual in children’ mindset that the trees only can grow from soil on the ground. Green roof can also be a real model for college students to learn how the waterproof roofs are made, to understand the way of forming the urban wildlife habitat, and for those who want to learn the amazing mutual relationship in the ecosystem.\nGreen does not have to be primitive or to be surrounded with bamboos, trees, rivers, or mountains. There are many ways in making our surroundings more environmentally sound and sustainable. Green can be the green roofs on concrete buildings, the use of recycled building materials, of reclaimed water, or the use of renewable energy. Adopt a holistic approach is essential to integrate technologies and innovations, to educate and motivate the users and consumers. However, to make all these happen, we should start among the young and motivate behaviorial change until the terms such as “green” and “sustainable” are no longer fashionable. Since, all the schools should be green; all human activities should be sustainable.

{"question":"How do the Dark Sky Ambassador Scheme and light pollution control measures work together in the Brecon Beacons?","answer":"The Dark Sky Ambassador Scheme trains National Park and Geopark Ambassadors about the night skies in Wales' first International Dark Sky Reserve, which extends across the National Park with the darkest skies found in the Geopark's western region. To maintain dark skies, light pollution must be controlled by addressing its components: glare (excessive brightness causing visual discomfort), clutter (groupings of light sources), light trespass (light crossing property boundaries), and sky glow (luminous background that blocks star visibility). These measures help preserve the natural night environment for both tourism and ecological purposes.","context":["Books, maps and other things to look at, training opportunities for businesses…\nVisit the downloads page for the chance to download a variety of audio-trails and podcasts at Henllys Vale and around Waterfall Country.\nDisplays & Exhibitions\nNational Park Visitor Centre\nThe Centre (also known as ‘the Mountain Centre’) is open 364 days a year.

In this section, the GLDS wants to outline the three steps essential to reduce light pollution and create a Dark Sky environment. They are as follows:\n- Human-Made Light Pollution Components\n- The Byproducts of Light Pollution\n- Light Pollution Solutions\nHuman-Made Light Pollution Components\n- Glare – Strong, luminous light that results in excessive brightness that causes visual discomfort.\n- Clutter – Groupings of light sources that emit excessive glare. Clutter contributes to light trespass.\n- Light Trespass – Light, individual or a cluster, that crosses over from one property or parcel of land onto another in a built-up/populated area.\n- Sky Glow – The proliferation of clutter and light trespass in a built-up/populated area that produces a luminous background that inhibits one’s ability to view the stars. Sky glow is highly variable on the amount of light being emitted upwards, immediate weather conditions and the quantity of air particles (dust and gas) in the immediate geographic area.\nThe Byproducts of Light Pollution\nFor hundreds of millennia, mankind experienced a natural night sky bursting with stars. It was an integral part of the day and night cycle of life. The natural dark sky enabled man to better understand its place in the universe. Consequently, it inspired science, religion, philosophy, literature and art. Artificial light that resulted in light pollution disruptive this natural cycle and had a negative impact in our world as follows: Wildlife and Ecosystems An ecosystem is a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. Plants and animals are reliant on our planet’s daily cycle of light and dark to maintain its sustainable rhythm. The addition of light pollution at night disrupts the habitat. Some primary examples:\nNocturnal animals sleep during the day and become active at night in order to use the cover of darkness to escape their predators.\nWetland amphibians (e.g., frogs) rely on the nighttime for their reproductive activities.\nSpecies of birds migrate or hunt at night and use the natural light of the moon or stars to navigate.\nInsects are drawn to natural light, but the introduction of light pollution has been destructive to certain species.\nThe International Dark Sky Association estimates that 30 percent of all outdoor lighting (lighting that is not shielded) in the U.S. alone is wasted. This wasted energy has huge economic and environmental consequences – approximately $3.0 billion in energy costs per year and the release of an estimated 15 million tons of carbon dioxide (source: U.S. Department of Energy 2011).\nHealth & Well Being\nHumans sleep-wake pattern (a.k.a. biological clock) are controlled by the day-night cycle they are exposed to. Artificial light can disrupt that cycle. In medical terms, that cycle is known as a circadian rhythm. Our bodies produce a hormone (melatonin) which keeps us healthy – positive functioning of key organs, lower cholesterol, stronger immune system, etc. Exposure to artificial light at night, especially blue light according to a 2015 Harvard Medical Study http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side can be disruptive and suppresses our melatonin production.\nBrighter does not mean safer when it comes to outdoor lighting deterring crime or reducing accidents. Numerous published studies have found that increased streetlights do not prevent crime. In reality, too much outdoor lighting utilized to enhance safety and security at night increases overall energy costs and produces glare which actually impairs visibility since the pupils in our eyes constrict as a result."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4af7ca52-214e-49d3-9567-b210c69d442f>","<urn:uuid:dcbed352-5387-49f3-ba02-779210d27c5b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did manufacturing challenges affect the development of both the Soviet TB-7 bomber engines and the British 8000lb bomb?","answer":"The TB-7 bomber faced reliability issues with its inline engines, which led to the development of a radial engine version that proved more reliable in the long run. The British 8000lb bomb encountered manufacturing difficulties during its development, initially considering a sectional design with 2000lb components bolted together. This was later modified to two 4000lb sections with a tail, joined by flanged rings welded to the body. While the TB-7's engine modification was successful, the sectional bomb design revealed problems during trials, including difficulties in joining sections and inferior blast effects compared to single 4000lb bombs.","context":["by: Matthew Robeson [ ]\nOriginally published on:\nThis is a kit I would have never expected to see a kit of, let alone so many of them. A-Model has also produced this version, the TB-7, and Zvezda has released 3 kits of the inline engined Pe-8. This was the Soviet Union's premier strategic bomber in World War 2, and one of the first planes to carry out bomb raids on Berlin. The plane could carry up to 5,000 kg of standard bombs, or one huge 4,000 kg bomb, which the TB-7 usually carried. The radial engine version was created because of reliability problems from the inline engines, and the radial engines were much more reliable in the long run.\nI was presented this kit by Jim Starkweather to review, since he knows I have an affinity for different and off the beaten path aircraft, and Soviet strategic bombers seem to fit that bill very well, even though I'm not often a 1/72 builder. I have also never built a Zvezda kit before, but I had looked at the Pe-8 after seeing a great build of it in Model Airplane International (Issue #41).\nThe first thing you see is the very large box, but once you open it, you can see why the box needs to be so big. The plane inside is massive! The box is one of the best I've ever seen actually, opening via a very secure flap in front, and hinging open from the top. it is a very strong and heavy box, and should never show any signs of shelf wear or shipping damage, as some other company's boxes do with very weak boxes. There is a great scene of a TB-7 bomber over Germany, dropping the one, huge 4,000 kg bomb. The sides and bottom of the box show pictures of an assembled and un-painted model, which is a very nice touch I think. it also explains that the box contains 317 parts, and comes out to about 12 inches long, with a 21.4 inch wingspan, so very large model. The Pe-8 is even larger than the B-17 and Lancaster for those that need a comparison to its closest relatives.\nUpon opening the box, you're presented with a multitude of medium grey plastic parts, all bagged in their own individual bags, with the exception of the wing halves and two small sprues. It's always good to see companies take the step to protect their parts. The clear parts came in a nice Zip-Lock bag, which means no chance of damage there. There is also a 12 page instruction manual and a tiny sheet of decals, more on those later.\nThe first thing you pull out of the box is the instruction manual, and this is very well done. It comes on 12 pages, and contains around 40 construction steps (there are some sub-sets scattered through). The manual is all in black and white, but is very well laid out, and very clear as to where everything goes and when it does. This looks to be a kit to follow the instructions, instead of trying to build without them. The construction actually begins with the wing assembly, instead of the cockpit which has become the custom. There are also some windows that need to be opened up in the fuselage halves, but these are clearly shown in the instructions and inside the fuselage. There is also an option to open the lower nose hatch and install the boarding ladder, this is clearly depicted in the instructions for anyone looking to add this detail\nThere is only one color scheme offered, and is on the back of the instruction guide. This is also in black and white, although I would have preferred color. This is more of a minor gripe on my part though, the black and white features enough contrast so as to not cause any confusion on colors. The one scheme is in the standard Soviet GPW three tone scheme of dark tan/olive green/and black. Being a night bomber, the underside is also black, so that should be fun to paint.\nMoving onto the actual plastic bits, the first thing to strike you is the quality of the parts. I've never built a Zvezda kit, or ever seen one, but if this is par for the course, then I will have to buy some more from them. The plastic is very high quality, I would place it between modern MPM and Eduard in terms of quality. There is a very, very light texture on the parts that I would relate to the most recent Revell Germany kits, but if it bothers you, I'm sure you can Micro-Mesh the parts to the glossy finish you desire. The scribing is some of the best I've ever seen in 1/72 scale, very crisp and clean, while staying in scale. I think that the panel lines should take the decals and wash very well in the actual build. The fabric detail is also top-notch, at least to my eyes. There are some who will say that it's too much, but a little light sanding will knock it back, and then paint will tone it down even more. There was a short shot on the lower left wing aileron on my example, but it seems to be just on the one kit, since no one else has reported a problem with that part.\nOn a big bomber kit, the interior is always the most important part, and this kit does not disappoint at all. Each station has its own detail, with the exception of the engineer's station, but it's hidden inside of the fuselage, between the two wing spar/bulkheads, so completely invisible. Each station features a well done floor, seat, figure, linkages, and other fittings. There are figures included for each position, and they all have separate arms and heads so they can be placed however you would like. The only downside is that the panels are all represented with decals, and no raised detail is provided. I personally like to paint my own panels, but the decals should work out fine under the canopies. The bottom of the cockpit floor also forms the basis for the bomb bay, which is just as nicely detailed as the interior. As I have no references on the Pe-8, nor know of any, I think it's accurate, but I can not know for sure. It also gives you a place to mount the huge 4,000 kg bomb, of which only one could be fitted. An option for open or closed bomb bay doors are offered on the sprue, so no cutting is required.\nLooking at the many turrets around the plane, they are all well appointed. Each station gives you the gunner, his seat, a well-molded gun, and an ammo feed belt. The only thing is that the gun barrel is not drilled out, so you'd have to do that for yourself if you so desire.\nLooking at the wings, the wheel bays are very, very well done for this scale. Instead of just giving you a large, empty hole to look in, Zvezda provided some ribs and other structural detail to provide some nice looking wheel bays. The landing gear door interiors are bare, but I have no idea how busy they were in real life, so I'm not planning to worry about it. The engine nacelles look nice, although the radiator detail on the front is a little bit underwhelming, but we'll see how it looks under a coat of paint. One nice touch is a spacer installed in the nacelle halves so that they will line right up to the wing halves when it's time to assemble everything.\nThe next thing pulled out of the box are the clear parts, and these are just as nice as the grey parts. They are very clear, with nicely defined frame lines, which is essential on a big bomber with all of the glass like this one. Eduard does do a mask set for those who do not feel like masking their own parts, but it will not fit the nose section of this kit, as it is meant for the turret-nosed Pe-8 kit. Just a fair warning, I would say get out the Tamiya tape and the sharp no.11 blades. I think the parts could use a dip in Future to really make them shine, but that's a personal preference call for the builder. I would also watch out for the lower nose clear piece, since it is in two halves. I think that it all falls on a frame line, but be very careful with any gluing and sanding, so as to not harm the clear windows. The pilot's canopy is provided in two pieces, a windscreen and canopy part. If you wish to open the sliding section, you'll have to cut it yourself, but the part does seem clear enough to not need to be cut open.\nThe final piece of the puzzle is the decal sheet at the bottom of the box, and it is tiny in comparison to everything else in the kit. It is only for one marking option, and Russian planes weren't known for excessive markings on them. The decals do have a very matte appearance, like the recent Revell decals, so we will have to see how they behave on the kit. My example was a tiny bit yellowed, so they will go up in the window to bleach so they can be used.\nPlease remember, when contacting retailers or manufacturers, to mention that you saw their products highlighted here - on AEROSCALE.","8000lb High Capacity Bomb\nThe requirements for the new bomb were sent to the Ordnance Board in March 1941 and specified a bomb that weighed approximately four tons and was to have the greatest possible blast effect over the greatest possible area, the case was to be strong enough to ensure detonation on impact with a hard target at any height up to 20,000 feet.\nInitially the bomb had been intended to be carried in a glider but soon it was decided to investigate the possibility of putting the bomb into the heavy bombers under development, the Warwick was the first considered but the maximum diameter which could be accommodated was 30 inches and so the bomb would have to have been increased in length which would have caused difficulties in manufacturing and handling. The solution suggested was to have the bomb made in sections, each weighing around 2000lb which could be bolted together, this would make manufacturing and handling easier.\nThe idea of a composite bomb was new and untried, there was obvious difficulties particularly with simultaneous detonation. The biggest disadvantage with the bomb was the extreme length when compared with its diameter and it had been calculated that a 30 inch, 8000lb bomb would require a length to diameter ratio much greater than 3. Two bombs were suggested, a 48 inch diameter bomb for use in gliders and a 30 inch inefficient bomb to fit a modern heavy bomber.\nIt was then discovered that there had been an error in the examination of the Warwick and that it could accommodate a 38 inch bomb and this would allow for a much more satisfactory length to diameter ratio, work on the 30 and 48 inch bombs was abandoned and the Ordnance Board went ahead with the design of a 38 inch bomb. By June preliminary designs of the bomb were completed, the principle of making the bombs in section had also not been dropped but instead of using 2000lb sections two 4000lb sections with a tail were to be used. These sections were joined by means of flanged rings welded to the body, through which bolts could be secured.\nArrangements for the production of 200 bombs were made, with production stopping at 12 until preliminary trials had been completed. By August three bombs had been completed, these were filled inert and sent for handling and installation trials. Another two bombs were completed and filled for detonation trials. The initial handling trails revealed several small manufacturing faults and some difficulties in joining the sections together but none were serious. A Lancaster had also been modified to carry the bomb by this time for loading and handling trials.\nBy October static trials had been completed and a serious deficiency in blast effect compared to the 4000lb had was found. Blast pressure and fragmentation were found to be satisfactory but the duration of the effect was short by 50%. The sections of the 8000lb High Capacity bomb were tested and were found to be inferior to a single 4000lb High Capacity bomb. These were filled with amatol.\nTrails with differing thickness of case were completed in January 1942 but these did not show improvement, a bomb filled with RDX/TNT gave results comparable to that official 4000lb high capacity bomb. At this point the Ordnance Board could not recommend the amatol filled bombs for service use in it's current form and only a handful of RDX filled bombs were available due to it's rarity at the time.\nIn the closing days of 1941 a committee called the \"Static Detonation Committee\" was set up in the Ministry of Supply, the committee recommended the 8000lb high capacity bomb to be filled with 85% amatol and 15% RDX/TNT. Trails of this filling were carried out and it was found to be at least 90% as effective as the RDX/TNT filling. In April 1942 the Air Staff agreed to introduce the bomb into service and arrangements were made for an experimental order of 2000 bombs filled with the new filling. Only very minor modifications were introduced for the production version of the bomb which was known as the Mk I.\nThe Lancaster was designed to carry a single 4000lb high capacity bomb so modifications were required, this involved constructing a bulge in the bomb doors, it was later found out that this interfered with the installation of radar equipment so only 10% of Lancaster's were to be modified to carry the 8000lb high capacity bomb but by this time the material for the doors had already been ordered so a compromise of 30% was made.\n8000lb High Capacity bomb specifications\n|Bomb||8,000-lb HC Mk I-II|\n|Usual weight||7,860lb (3572.72kg)|\n|Total length||133.6in (339.34cm)|\n|Body length||95in (241.3cm)|\n|Body diameter||38in (96.52cm)|\n|Wall thickness||0.5in (1.27cm)|\n|Tail length||36.5in (92.71cm) or 64in (162.56cm)|\n|Tail width||37.8in (90.01cm)|\n|Filling||Amatex 9, Torpex 2|\nNumber of 8000lb High Capacity bombs released per year\nSources - AVIA 46 285, AVIA 46 163"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ce4e5037-166c-4488-985f-f1fc17685326>","<urn:uuid:2d365ee0-e17c-4c8b-9ec1-30f44be31a4f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key security features of TLS encryption for email transmission, and how does the TLS handshake protocol establish secure connections between servers?","answer":"TLS encryption provides several key security features for email transmission. It ensures messages are encrypted before sending, making them impossible for third parties to interpret. It includes authentication to verify sender and receiver IDs and prevent spoofing. The encryption is widespread, covering not just emails but also VPNs, VoIP, and other end-to-end communications. For establishing secure connections, TLS uses a handshake protocol where the server and client first verify each other and negotiate encryption algorithms before any data transfer. During this handshake, they agree on a cipher suite that specifies the encryption toolkit for communication. The handshake forms its encoding from the interaction of public and private certificate keys, creating a 'secret handshake' that confirms the authenticity of subsequent communications. This process helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks where malicious entities might try to intercept communications between servers.","context":["TLS Encryption and Email Security\nHackers and stalkers have taken social sharing to a stage where it makes us vulnerable to their attacks. The internet helps them grow faster, learn from each other and makes the act of snooping over someone’s private data easier than earlier. As wise men say – safety is the number one priority. All we can do is to ensure there is a proactive breach-proof technology in place when it comes to transmission of data, and stay ahead of the game.\nWhen we provide multiple levels of assurance, we can improve the user experience along with providing secure communication. We believe that any TLS (Transport Layer Security) is better than no TLS. This is because all certificates, despite their different assurance levels, work to provide session safety and encrypt any data transmitted over the website. Depending on your requirements, we suggest you make a choice that serves your needs best. But first, you need to know what TLS encryption is and what it exactly does, so here you go:\nWhat is TLS Encryption?\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that implements privacy and data integrity within two communicating entities.TLS encryption is a cryptographic protocol that ensures network security over end-to-end communication. It is the most broadly deployed safety protocol used today by web browsers and other applications that need to privately transfer data over a network. It includes file transfers, VPN links, instant messaging, VOIP and sending messages over email.\nTLS is composed of two layers, the TLS Record Protocol and the TLS Handshake Protocol. The Record Protocol renders connection securely. The Handshake Protocol requires the server and client to verify each other first and barter encryption algorithms and cryptographic keys before any data is transferred.\nThe key features of TLS encryption include-\n- Encrypted messages– TLS makes sure that your messages that are sent over emails are secured from hackers. It encrypts the message before sending it so that it is impossible for a third party to interpret it.\n- Authentication– This is the process of checking the sender and receiver ID. It is done to verify that the messages are being sent from authenticated sources and the process has no spoofing.\n- Standardized websitesTLS encryption is now becoming a standard practice for websites. While Google Chrome is striking out non-HTTPS sites, people are also becoming wary of entering websites that do not have an HTTPS security protocol.\n- WidespreadTLS encryption is not limited to only websites and emails, VPN Voice over IPs, and many other such servers who provide end to end communication.\nTo maximize the utilization of TLS, you should ensure that both the parties have secure SSL/TLS Sessions. Most of the leading ISPs are supporting TLS these days for better transfer of emails.\nHow does TLS work for an email?\nThe mechanism and language (protocol) by which one email server sends an email message to another email server is called SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol). For a long time now, email servers have had the choice of using TLS to transparently encrypt the message transmission from one server to the other. TLS used with SMTP, when possible, guarantees that the content of the email is guarded during communication between the servers.\nWant to know more on SSL and TLS ?\nTLS is initiated with a sequence called TLS handshake. The TLS handshake establishes a cipher suite for communication which specifies the encryption kit that will be shared for that communication. Once this data is encrypted, it is then signed with a Message Authentication Code which can be verified by the recipient to test the authenticity of the data transferred.\nThe target email server must support TLS for TLS communication to be used. The sending computer or server must be configured to use TLS links when possible.\nHere are two examples of emails sent with and without TLS encryption. This will help clarify the meaning and use of encryption:\n1. Without TLS encryption\n2. With encryption\nImage 2 is the perfect example of TLS encrypted email and how the receiver can see it.\nBoth mail servers are required to support TLS for the encryption process to work. The server and the client recognize which encryption keys to use before anything is broadcasted. The negotiation itself is guarded as well.\nWhy is TLS important?\nWhen you use a regular POP or IMAP link to download your email (the most common technique in practice), your username and password are carried in clear text over the Internet. This means, that anyone using the same wireless connection, the same channels, picketing traffic at your ISP or anyone in a position to see your Internet traffic can conceivably “hijack” your web traffic and find out your username and password. With this knowledge, they can easily read all your email, steal classified data and/or send out spam emails on your behalf.\nTLS encryption shields the transportation of the content in email messages. However, it does not defend the security of the information before it is transmitted or after it reaches its destination. For that, other encryption tools may be used, such as PGP, S/MIME, or storage in a secure portal.\nTLS encryption ensures that any information transmitted between the server and client does not fall prey to a man-in-the-middle attack, i.e. spammers attacking the data before it reaches the server. Encryption ensures that data which is being transmitted does not fall prey to attackers.\nOpportunistic TLS for Email Security\nAre you able to use TLS encryption optimally? If no, then Opportunistic TLS is the solution. To arrive at a clear idea, if the sending server sends an encrypted email but if the receiving server doesn’t accept encrypted messages, then email is sent unencrypted and hence available for email spoofing. Hence, the essential thing is to have an email provider that uses a secure connection. Trusted email service providers (ESPs) like Pepipost have security measures that do not allow unauthorized users from sending messages.\nGoogle’s Email Transparency report can let you find out the statistics of encrypted mail interaction with Gmail Server. The benefits of an opportunistic TLS are a higher sender reputation and 100% spam free delivery.\nFailure in TLS Handshakes\nThe failure rate of TLS handshakes is a topic of concern for system engineers across the world as it causes authentication and security issues. TLS handshakes can be of two types – one based on RSA and other on Diffie-Hellman. These both work on algorithms and if an algorithm fails, it leads to a failure in the TLS handshake. The bottom line is TLS encryption alone is not sufficient to keep your emails secure and authentic.\nConsidering as a whole, TLS encryption is very important for sending and receiving emails in a secured manner. But, it can fall into some traps and you may suffer a data breach or unsuccessful emails in certain cases. Therefore, it is not a complete solution in case of exceptional situations and you need to handle them on your own.\nBut, the good news is that there are measures/technologies in place that can alleviate the impact of TLS handshakes. TLS false start is one such program where the server and client can\nYou might send an email normally without a secondary level of protection. This could be fine if your email is a general email. However, it becomes a matter of concern if you have to send any confidential data over emails. Although most of the popular ISPs support TLS and ensure double protection of your conversations over an email, you cannot ensure the security at the receiver’s end. If the receiver suffers a data breach or hacking at his end, you cannot control your data from being lost or stolen, even though it was secured through TLS encryption.\nTLS Vs. SPAM\nTLS encryption is assumed to be a secured connection between two ends. It is free from spam most of the time. However, it does not ensure 100% security. There are some companies that have a special kind of spam or anti-virus implemented, which could affect the security of the email message. The whole message may not be encrypted and you may need to ensure the security of the messages while sending them over the internet. Therefore, you must check whether the TLS system is working properly in advance and ensure that there are no loopholes in it.\nAlso, interestingly you can identify SPAM from Email Headers.","You may have first heard about TLS because your Apache service needed to be secured using TLS for a PCI scan (Payment Card Industry: PCI scans are a standard to ensure server security for credit card transactions). Or maybe you noticed that your SSL also mentions TLS when you are ordering the certificate. Beyond where you heard the names, the question is, what is this mysterious TLS in relation to SSL and which of the two should you be using?\nSo what is the difference between SSL and TLS? Surprisingly not much. Most of us are familiar with SSL (Secure Socket Layer) but not TLS (Transport Layer Security), yet they are both protocols used to send data online securely. SSL is older than TLS, but all SSL certificates can use both SSL and TLS encryption. Indeed SSL certificates are appropriately called SSL/TLS certificates, but that becomes a mouthful. Thus the industry has stuck with calling them SSLs. From here on out I will break from convention and call the actual certificate an “SSL certificate” to distinguish the encryption type from the certificate. SSL has its origins in the early 1990s. The mention of Netscape and AOL should date how old these protocols are as they are the first to coin the term SSL.\nIf you look up to the upper left corner of this webpage, you may see a very tiny lock and the word “Secure” written in green. While that doesn’t look like much, it plays a critical part of security. The SSL is what your web browser uses to show that data sent from your computer is safe. SSL certificates create a secure tunnel for HTTPS communication. HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure, differentiating from HTTP, (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) which has no SSL present. If you see a red lock or a caution sign in the corner of your web browser, that indicates that the connection is not encrypted. Meaning a malicious third party could read any data sent on that webpage.\nA secure connection happens via what is called a “handshake” between your browser and the web server. A simplified explanation of this is that the server and your browser agree on a literal “secret” handshake between each other based upon the type of encryption (SSL/TLS) and the SSL certificate itself. This handshake forms its encoding from the interaction of the public and private certificate key. From that point onward they use this secret handshake to confirm the information sent back and forth is from the authentic source.\nThis handshake and the accompanying SSL certificate helps prevent a man in the middle attack between customers and a server-side business. A man in the middle attack is where a malicious entity intercepts communication between a server and your computer. The man in the middle receives requests from the user and passes along the information to the server and back again. Data between the end user and the server are read, hence “man in the middle” phrase. If attacked, the Man in the Middle technique will show passwords and other sensitive information. As terrifying as that sounds this attack is only possible if there is no SSL certificate on the site.\nAs you may have heard, Google and FireFox are phasing out non-SSL/TLS encrypted websites. The change will soon show an explicit warning with the browsers for any site that is not covered by an SSL certificate. The browsers will force an acknowledgment that you want to proceed with an insecure website before showing any content.\nFor business owners who accept online payments, it is even more critical to not only have an SSL certificate but also enforces the latest TLS versions on the server. In a PCI compliance scan, it requires that the domain only use specific TLS versions.\nSSL and TLS each have specific versions which relate to the type of encryption that the SSL certificate will use in the previously mentioned handshake.\nThe SSL versions are:\n- SSL v1\n- SSL v2\n- SSL v3\nNever released to the public but still notated is SSL v1; SSL v2 was an improvement upon SSL v1 but still problematic; SSL v3 fixed some of these initial bugs but is open to attacks through vulnerabilities like POODLE or DROWN (read more on those vulnerabilities here). SSL v3 was at the End of Life in 2015, forever ago regarding the internet.\nModern TLS encryptions cover:\n- TLS v1.0\n- TLS v1.1\n- TLS v1.2\n- TLS v1.3\nEach of which addresses flaws from one version to the next. The newer encryptions are just that, more modern and more secure ways to encrypt data for security. The later the release, the better the encoding and the more difficult it is to decrypt by malicious third parties. Conversely, the older versions, like with SSL, have vulnerabilities which can be exploited to collect private data. In many ways, you can think of TLS as the newer version of SSL. Some refer to TLS v1.0 as TLS v 1.0/SSL v3.1.\nFor the interested technophile, as it relates to the handshake example, we break down the first connection process. The first connection deals with the browser, and a “browserhello” is the first exchange in the handshake. The browser then states the version of TLS they accept, say, for example, everything up to TLS v1.1. The server then replies with a “serverhello,” which is the second exchange in the handshake. The server states the version of encryption that is for the rest of the interaction based upon the first connection.\nThis interaction should force the newest version of SSL/TLS that both the server and browser are capable of handling. Some outdated browsers do not use the latest versions of TLS. The server is also capable of disabling specific TLS/SSL versions, ensuring all the connections to the server are safer. In this way, new servers should disable the use of all SSL versions and even some of the TLS versions. For example, as of September 2018, PCI certification require all SSL versions and TLS v1.0 disabled.\nSo back to our original question, what is the difference between SSL and TLS? In sum, TLS is the logical progression of SSL and the safer of the two by that fact. Beyond this, they work in the same fashion, but the newer versions use stronger types of encryption."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e4a4a932-c2a7-4c42-9ec4-526adda36103>","<urn:uuid:3be93002-8ffb-4cbb-b399-5eaaa087f5f6>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What is the difference between thermal stress and nutrient pollution in their effects on coral reef degradation?","answer":"While both factors damage coral reefs, they work differently. Thermal stress causes corals to expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae (algae), leading to bleaching and potential death if the stress persists for over six weeks. In contrast, nutrient pollution, particularly from nitrogen sources like septic systems, creates an imbalance in the nitrogen-phosphorous ratio that breaks down coral membranes, causing phosphorous limitation and starvation. The nutrient pollution also promotes harmful algal growth that can overtake and degrade coral reef ecosystems.","context":["Stories about the demise of the world’s coral reefs are becoming all-too-commonplace, unfortunately. We’ve all heard the sad descriptions of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, for example. Hundreds of miles of its most pristine northern sector are dead, with overheated seawater reported as the culprit. A researcher at the Harbor Branch of Florida Atlantic University, Brian Lapointe, PhD, has a slightly different take on the global coral problem, however. With a career spent studying nutrients, algal growth, and eutropication, Lapointe has analyzed water quality and living coral cover in the Florida Keys over the last 4 decades. While many scientists attribute coral demise to sea-surface temperatures associated with climate change, Dr. Lapointe’s findings about Florida’s coral reefs show otherwise.\nInstead, increasing nutrient pollution from septic tanks, combined with new policies to “send water south” from Lake Okeechobee, have increase nitrogen concentrations and phytoplankton biomass at Looe Key, his study site. Sewage discharge makes it difficult for coral to thrive and damages the complex relationships that exist among the plants, coral, and other animals that are part of the reef ecosystem.\nWhat we’re seeing, Lapointe outlines, is destruction of the coral reefs due to nutrient dominance. As the nitrogen-phosphorous balance in the ocean gets out of balance, certain membranes in the coral start to break down. The coral can’t get enough phosphorous, which leads to what Lapointe calls “phosphorous limitation and eventual starvation.”\n“It degrades the ability of these organisms to survive high light and high temperatures,” Lapointe explains. “This is real, ladies and gentlemen. We are changing the chemistry of the planet.”\nFlorida Atlantic University, Harbor Branch Ocean Science Lecture Series\nNearly every Wednesday during the southern high season of January through March, the Harbor Branch of the Florida Atlantic University opens its door for a free lecture. The intent is to share with the public the research that usually takes place behind closed doors in laboratories. In this week’s session, Dr. Brian Lapointe talked about “Chasing Nutrients and Coral Reef Decline at Looe Key, Florida Keys: A Four Decade Quest.”\nAs the audience entered, a short film played on the overhead screens. Virtually, we swam along the reef with divers. Only the sounds of the scuba diver’s breathing were evident as we floated by schools of black and blue fish, coral with tree-like branches, and white chrinolated coral. We came to realize that we were watching a chronological unveiling of the life of a reef over a series of decades. The colors slowly weakened and bleached and became covered by meadows of brown algae in what we later learned in the lecture is a “coral algae shift.”\nThe Looe Key reef has evolved from being dominated by branching coral with schools of fish living in a 3-dimensional space to a loss of habitat so that, by 2018, much of the coral was white — ghost white. Why? Increasing nutrient inputs elevate the nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) ratio in reef macroalgae, a condition known to cause metabolic stress in coral. That stress makes them more susceptible to coral diseases and bleaching.\nLooe Key: 4 Decades of Analyzing the Coral Reef\nNamed after the 1743 British warship “Looe,” the Key was a problem for schooners who were circumnavigating the world for commerce. Louis Agassi was asked in 1851 about the ways to reduce the prominence of “unfavorable” reefs for the safety of navigation. “I do not see the possibility of eliminating in any way,” he mused, the growth of the coral reefs.\nLittle did Agassi know about the problem that would become anthropogenic-caused (human-caused) algae.\n“Nutrient pollution is pushing Florida’s refs beyond their capacity to survive,” Lapointe wrote back in 1990. So what did the Florida cognoscenti do then? They let water out of Lake Okeechobee so it would cleanse the Keys, interpreting the reef change problem as a shortage of fresh water.\nSuch misinformed decision-making pushed more nutrients toward the Florida Keys and led them to be declared a dead zone in 2003.\nMany people have argued that overfishing is the cause of the reef decline. Lapointe’s perspective is different, however. He says that the nitrogen content is a significant contributing factor to Florida coral reef loss. Mass tourism and agriculture change the reef due to nitrogen increases, which inspire algae blooms. Formerly “gin clear” water is now emerald green, due to a cyano bacterial bloom. Coral has been overgrown by algae — and not reduced grazing fish, Lapointe indicates, as his data indicates that grazing fish actually seem to be increasing over time.\nAlgae has replaced corals at Looe Key. High N:P ratios reduce resistance, and the reefs become susceptible to diseases. The result? Coral bleaching.\nPoop is the Problem & It’s Expensive to Fix\nThe primary culprit is septic systems. “Do you know how many toilets are flushing in Orlando? We need to do more up there,” he says. He allows that agriculture, too, has a role to play. “Even with the cattle farms — we can do a lot more to treat the systems. A lot of people think that the problem is sugar cane, but their water goes south, into the Everglades. 95% or more of the water in Lake Okeechobee comes from its north, and nitrogen can move a mile a day.”\nThe release of water from Lake Okeechobee filled with nitrogen creates levels that starve the reefs of phosphorus and photo-oxydated stress. Lake Okechobee releases 120 million metric tons of reactive N per year. “We’re at a level that is double of a Woods Hole peak level warning from the late 20th century,” according to Lapointe.\n“Lake Okeechobee calls for treatment and storage,” he continued. “Money is always the problem in getting these problems fixed.” He discussed how a major problem is septic system “infrastructure that’s at the end of its life cycle, which would cost an estimated $18 billion to fix. That’s just getting infrastructure that’s already in place up to grade. It’s not going to be cheap.”\nAlthough the Environmental Protection Agency might once have been a partner in such septic system infrastructure upgrading, the “EPA isn’t looking so good with the cuts” to its funding, Lapointe reminded the audience.\nSolutions are Possible to Restore Florida’s Coral Reefs\nAn emphasis of Lapointe’s work has been the role of land-based nutrient pollution in supporting harmful algal blooms and degrading coral reef and seagrass ecosystems. He tries to educate the public, business community, and policymakers regarding the need for improved wastewater and stormwater infrastructure to mitigate the harmful algal blooms and help secure Florida’s water future.\nLapointe’s findings suggest that local and regional actions to moderate anthropogenic nitrogen loading can increase the resilience of coral reefs under the current temperature stress.\n“There is some hope. Bonair is one of the last beautiful reefs in the Caribbean,” he described. Government officials “got scared, and the Dutch government helped fund the central sewer construction. It was reported 2 years ago that, after the plant went online, corals are starting to grow again.”\n“We, too, can make a difference. I’m just hoping that this sad story of the Florida Keys will resonate around the world,” Lapointe emphasized. A plan to treat the water north of Lake Okeechobee is necessary to solve the Florida Keys reef problems, Lapointe argues. “By these small island states taking action, they can make a change. We need to bring our wastewater upgrades up to par, I think, with what we’re spending on Everglades restoration.”\nOther solutions can help the coral to revive, too, at least in part. “Denitrification can remove some of the nitrogen that we’ve been seeing,” he answered in response to an audience member’s question. “It takes nitrogen. Bacteria break it down and release it to the atmosphere, taking it from the reactive form.”\nLooe Key and Rock Pile videos are available on YouTube.

Most people have seen images of brightly colored fishes and other reef-dwelling organisms, yet many do not understand why these systems are personally important. Programs and articles about coral reefs typically point out benefits that include protecting shorelines from erosion and storm damage, supplying foods that are important to many coastal communities, and providing recreational and economic opportunities. These benefits are obviously important to people who live near reefs, but there is another aspect of coral reefs that can benefit everyone: the highly diverse biological communities are new sources of powerful antibiotic, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory drugs.\nThe idea of coral reefs as a source of important new drugs is new to many people; but in fact, most drugs in use today come from nature. Aspirin, for example, was first isolated from the willow tree. Morphine is extracted from the opium poppy. Penicillin was discovered from common bread mold. Although almost all of the drugs derived from natural sources come from terrestrial organisms, recent systematic searches for new drugs have shown that marine invertebrates produce more antibiotic, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory substances than any group of terrestrial organisms. Particularly promising invertebrate groups include sponges, tunicates, ascidians, bryozoans, octocorals, and some molluscs, annelids, and echinoderms. For more information on drugs from the sea, visit\nDespite their numerous benefits to humans, many coral reefs are threatened by human activities. Sewage and chemical pollution can cause overgrowth of algae, oxygen depletion, and poisoning. Fishing with heavy trawls and explosives damages the physical structure of reefs as well as the coral animals that build them. Careless tourists and boat anchors also cause mechanical damage. Thermal pollution from power plants and global warming cause physiological stress that kills coral animals and leaves the reef structure vulnerable to erosion. Many of these impacts are the result of ignorance; people simply aren’t aware of the importance of coral reefs or the consequences of their actions, but the damage and threats to reefs continues to increase on a global scale.\nSome of the most severe damage appears to be caused by thermal stress. Shallow-water reef-building corals live primarily in tropical latitudes (less than 30° north or south of the equator). These corals live near the upper limit of their thermal tolerance. Abnormally high temperatures result in thermal stress, and many corals respond by expelling the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that live in the corals’ tissues. Since the zooxanthellae are responsible for most of the corals’ color, corals that have expelled their algal symbionts appear to be bleached. Because zooxanthellae provide a significant portion of the corals’ food and are involved with growth processes, expelling these symbionts can have significant impacts on the corals’ health. In some cases, corals are able to survive a “bleaching” event and eventually recover. When the level of environmental stress is high and sustained, however, the corals may die.\nPrior to the 1980s, coral bleaching events were isolated and appeared to be the result of short-term events such as major storms, severe tidal exposures, sedimentation, pollution, or thermal shock. Over the past twenty years, though, these events have become more widespread, and many laboratory studies have shown a direct relationship between bleaching and water temperature stress. In general, coral bleaching often occur in areas where the sea surface temperature 1°C or more above the normal maximum temperature.\nIn 1998, the President of the United States established the Coral Reef Task Force (CRTF) to protect and conserve coral reefs. Activities of the CRTF include mapping and monitoring coral reefs in U.S. waters, funding research on coral reef degradation, and working with governments, scientific and environmental organizations, and business to reduce coral reef destruction and restore damaged coral reefs.\nAs co-chair of the CRTF, and as directed by the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, NOAA has the responsibility to conserve coral reef ecosystems. NOAA’s coral reef conservation efforts are carried out primarily through its Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP). Under this program, NOAA works with scientific, private, government, and nongovernmental organizations at the local, federal, and international levels to address conservation actions. Among other actions, the CRCP undertakes a variety of mapping and monitoring activities to understand:\n- locations of coral reef ecosystems;\n- how they function;\n- how human activities impact reef processes; and\n- how managers and the public can reduce or eliminate these impacts.\nThe first part of this lesson is intended to:\n- introduce students to coral reefs and improve their understanding of why these systems are important, how they are threatened, and what can be done to protect and restore these unique and valuable ecosystems; and to\n- introduce students to hypotheses that explain why corals under stress may expel their zooxanthellae.\nIn the second part of this lesson, students design and prepare educational programs to improve public awareness of the importance of coral reefs and what needs to be done to reduce or eliminate harmful impacts from human activities. This activity offers many opportunities for cross-curricular activities, and may be extended over several weeks or months. If time is limited, you may choose to use the first part alone.\n- Direct students to the Corals Tutorial at:\nhttp://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_corals/. You may want to assign different tutorial sections to each student group. Have each student or student group complete one version of the Subject Review (downloadable), and lead a discussion to review the answers. Be sure that students understand the relationship between coral animals and their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), and that under thermal stress many corals will expel their zooxanthellae.\nBriefly explain the purpose and activities of the U. S. Coral Reef Task Force (CRTF) and the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP), and highlight the monitoring functions that are intended to identify reef areas threatened by thermal stress or algal blooms (visit http://www.coralreef.gov for more information on the CRTF and http://coralreef.noaa.gov for more information on the CRCP).\n- Tell students that their assignment is to investigate possible explanations for zooxanthellae expulsion by corals under stress, and prepare a written report outlining at least one hypothesis that explains this behavior. The report should explain:\n- the symbiotic relationship between corals and their zooxanthellae;\n- how corals obtain their zooxanthellae; and\n- how environmental stress may alter the symbiosis.\nIf you want to provide a starting point for this research, the following resources will be useful:\nhttp://www.coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/ (NOAA Coral Reef Watch Program and Satellite Monitoring of Coral Bleaching)\nhttp://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_corals/supp_corals_roadmap.html (Roadmap to Resources: Corals)\nnext.html (article: Coral Bleaching: the Whys, the Hows and What Next?)\nhttp://ioc.unesco.org/coralbleaching/Hughes%20et%20al.pdf (article: Climate Change, Human Impacts, and the Resilience of Coral Reefs)\nhttp://www.crc.uri.edu/download/COR_0011.PDF (article: Coral Bleaching: Causes, Consequences and Response)\nLead a discussion of students’ research results. Written reports should include some of the following points:\n- Zooxanthellae are single-celled motile algae (dinoflagellates).\n- Many marine invertebrates in addition to corals have symbiotic algae.\n- Photosynthesis by zooxanthellae provides a significant source of nutrition for many host symbionts; as much as 90% of the total energy requirement in some coral and giant clam species.\n- Zooxanthellae are also involved in calcium carbonate deposition (skeletal growth) in some corals.\n- Some zooxanthellae produce an ultraviolet-absorbing pigment that may act as a sort of “sunscreen” for host corals.\n- The mechanism by which corals obtain zooxanthellae (or, from a slightly different perspective, become infected with zooxanthellae) is not known, but sea anemone larvae have been reported to indiscriminantly ingest zooxanthellae along with other particulate materials. The algal cells become incorporated into the larvae’s endodermal cells, while other particulate materials are either digested or expelled.\n- “Bleaching” has been observed in most marine organisms that host zooxanthellae.\n- It is not known whether bleaching happens because the algae leave their host animal or because the host expels the algae.\n- Bleaching can also occur when algae expel their pigments.\n- Bleaching appears to be the result of various types of environmental stress, including high temperature, exposure to excessive irradiance, lowered salinity, and pollution.\n- Combinations of different stresses may result in bleaching, even though corals might be tolerant of the individual conditions (for example, if corals are near their upper thermal limit, even small increase in irradiance can result in bleaching)\n- Elevated temperatures reduce the photosynthetic ability of zooxanthellae.\n- Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide may lead to increased dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater, which will increase the solubility of calcium and reduce calcification.\n- While there is no absolute proof that bleaching events are the result of climate change, most scientists consider the link to be incontrovertible.\n- Different species of corals have different tolerance levels for various environmental factors. Similarly, different strains of zooxanthellae have different tolerance levels.\n- Different strains of zooxanthellae are found within and among coral species.\n- Coral genera with fast growth rates and high metabolic rates are most susceptible to bleaching.\n- The “adaptive bleaching hypothesis” proposes that corals expel their zooxanthellae under stress so that they can be replaced with other strains that are better suited to the stress conditions. There is no evidence, however, that corals can simply take up more tolerant strains of algae. In addition, high mortality, reduced growth rates, and decreased fecundity in bleached corals do not suggest an effective adaptation to stress conditions.\n- If the stress conditions that cause bleaching persist for more than about six weeks, corals may die. The duration of the stress conditions and the intensity of high temperatures determine the severity of bleaching and the ability of corals to survive.\n- Some scientists have predicted that persistent temperature increases coupled with other stresses will lead to widespread loss of coral reefs, which may require 500 years or more to recover.\n- Marine protected areas are currently the most effective management tool for protecting coral reefs and other marine resources, but they cannot stop temperature increases or other adverse climate changes.\nAsk students to discuss why coral reefs are at risk, and what they think can or should be done to reduce or eliminate the negative impacts of human activity on coral reefs. There is a strong possibility that a significant part of the current risk to coral reef systems is the result of human activity, particularly as it relates to climate change. Meaningful actions to address this type of issue depend upon widespread understanding of the problem and commitment to workable solutions. Public education is an important step toward building this sort of understanding and commitment. Have students brainstorm what “key messages” might form part of a public education program about coral reefs, what audiences should be targeted to receive these messages, and how these messages might be most effectively delivered to these audiences.\nHave students or student groups prepare one or more public education programs about coral reefs, based on the results of their brainstorming sessions in Step 3. Encourage students to consider various media, including publications, visual presentations, drama, music, etc. You may want to have an entire class work on a single program, or have smaller groups work on multiple programs using the medium (or media) or their choice. There are many possibilities, depending upon the target audiences. These presentations also offer cross-curricular opportunities, particularly with social studies, English language arts, and fine arts. Whatever media students choose to work with, their final presentation should be accompanied by a list of sources for the information they present. A good starting point for this activity is the Roadmap to Resources: Corals (http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_corals/supp_corals_roadmap.html), which provides links to many other sources of coral reef data and information.\nThe Bridge Connection\nThe Bridge is a growing collection online marine education resources. It provides educators with a convenient source of useful information on global, national, and regional marine science topics. Educators and scientists review sites selected for the Bridge to insure that they are accurate and current.\nThe “Me” Connection\nHave students write a short essay on why coral reefs are personally important, what personal actions may contribute to human-caused threats to coral reefs, and what they could do to reduce these threats.\n- The symbiotic relationship between zooxanthellae and coral polyps can be a springboard for discussing other types of cellular symbionts. Many biology students tend to overlook microbial associations in natural communities, but there is mounting evidence that eukaryotic organisms were (and are) the result of symbiotic associations between prokaryotic organisms. At some point in these associations, one (or more) species (called endosymbionts) entered the cells of another species, and performed useful functions. Each species had its own DNA, and when these organisms reproduced, both were replicated. Eventually, the individual identities of the species disappeared, resulting in a new type of organism. This sort of transformation has actually been seen in the laboratory, and is described in Margulis and Sagan (1986).

The Earth has one big ocean with many features.\n- Fundamental Concept h. Although the ocean is large, it is finite and resources are limited.\nEssential Principle 5. The ocean supports a great diversity of life and ecosystems.\n- Fundamental Concept d. Ocean biology provides many unique examples of life cycles, adaptations and important relationships among organisms (such as symbiosis, predator-prey dynamics and energy transfer) that do not occur on land.\nEssential Principle 6. The ocean and humans are inextricably interconnected.\n- Fundamental Concept b. From the ocean we get foods, medicines, and mineral and energy resources. In addition, it provides jobs, supports our nation’s economy, serves as a highway for transportation of goods and people, and plays a role in national security.\n- Fundamental Concept e. Humans affect the ocean in a variety of ways. Laws, regulations and resource management affect what is taken out and put into the ocean. Human development and activity leads to pollution (such as point source, non-point source, and noise pollution) and physical modifications (such as changes to beaches, shores and rivers). In addition, humans have removed most of the large vertebrates from the ocean.\n- Fundamental Concept g. Everyone is responsible for caring for the ocean. The ocean sustains life on Earth and humans must live in ways that sustain the ocean. Individual and collective actions are needed to effectively manage ocean resources for all.\nEssential Principle 7. The ocean is largely unexplored.\n- Fundamental Concept c. Over the last 40 years, use of ocean resources has increased significantly, therefore the future sustainability of ocean resources depends on our understanding of those resources and their potential and limitations.\n- Fundamental Concept f. Ocean exploration is truly interdisciplinary. It requires close collaboration among biologists, chemists, climatologists, computer programmers, engineers, geologists, meteorologists, and physicists, and new ways of thinking."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f0271d47-3769-4a41-9384-0c86687ab7d4>","<urn:uuid:20ad2d7d-1f89-444c-b7a9-38b3c42eb68d>"],"error":null}

{"question":"As an orthopedic specialist, I'm studying joint pain patterns: is pain experienced immediately upon movement in both anterior ankle impingement and shoulder instability, or are there differences in how pain manifests in these conditions?","answer":"There are differences in how pain manifests in these conditions. In anterior ankle impingement, pain is specifically produced when the ankle is passively or actively dorsiflexed (bent upwards). In shoulder instability, pain occurs alongside other symptoms like swelling and may appear suddenly or develop over time, with varying degrees of pain depending on the instability level. Additionally, shoulder instability is characterized by the upper arm bone popping in and out of place, while ankle impingement pain persists even after an associated ankle sprain has healed.","context":["The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint with a wide range of motion. That impressive range of mobility also makes the shoulder quite unstable, however.\nDamage to one or more of the structures that work together to stabilize the shoulder can result in shoulder instability. Those structures include:\n- 4 \"rotator cuff\" muscles\n- the fibrous joint capsule\n- the labrum, a ring of tissue that lines the socket area, and\n- ligaments, which connect bone to bone.\nAn unstable shoulder allows the ball-shaped top of the upper arm bone (humerus) to move about excessively in the socket (glenoid). Instability can lead to shoulder dislocations and damages to the structures in the joint. These conditions can reduce your ability to work, exercise and perform self-care activities.\nInjury is the No. 1 cause of shoulder instability. Falling on your shoulder or outstretched hand, or sustaining a strong blow to the shoulder by an object or another person can tear muscles or ligaments. In some people, shoulder instability is hereditary - they experience joint laxity throughout their bodies. Work and recreational activities that involve a great deal of shoulder motion can also overstress the joint.\nSigns of shoulder instability may appear suddenly, or may develop over time. They will vary according to the degree of instability. You will experience some pain and swelling in the area, and partial-to-complete loss of shoulder movement. The upper arm bone may pop in and out of place. A bone moving partially out of the joint is known as a subluxation. A dislocation occurs if the bone moves completely out of the joint.\nYour doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and the history of the problem. A physical examination of the shoulder and its movement will help identify signs of instability. And X-rays may be taken to assess joint alignment and rule out the possibility of broken bones. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may be used to identify any detached ligaments.\nConservative treatment consists of a period of rest and immobilization of the affected shoulder. For dislocations, the shoulder may be manually repositioned into place. You may need to wear a sling to support the joint and allow soft tissue to heal. Anti-inflammatories may be recommended to decrease pain and swelling. And ice packs may be applied to the area several times a day until the swelling disappears.\nSevere or recurrent cases may require surgery, also known as shoulder stabilization. This procedure allows your doctor to repair the damaged tissues and restore stability to the shoulder joint. As with conservative treatment, a period of rest and rehabilitation will follow the surgery.\nA rehabilitation program guided by a physical and/or occupational therapist may be recommended by your doctor. The goal of rehab is to help you return to regular activities and restore function in the shoulder.\nThe time necessary for your shoulder to heal will depend on your age, overall health, extent of the instability and the treatment recommended by your doctor. Patients with mild conditions may require just a few weeks to regain strength and flexibility. Cases requiring surgery may need 4-6 months for complete recovery. Following your rehabilitation program as closely as possible will promote healing and help prevent re-injury.","What is Ankle Impingement?\nAnkle impingement is a condition where there is bony growth at either the front or back of the ankle bone where it joins the shin bone. Ankle Impingement are of two types, anterior ankle impingement, which occurs in the front region and posterior ankle impingement which occurs in the back region.\nSymptoms of Ankle Impingement\nSymptoms of ankle impingement depends on the type of impingement.\nSymptoms of Anterior Ankle Impingement\n- Pain due to anterior ankle impingement is present in the anterior side or the lateral side of the ankle. This anterior ankle impingement symptom of pain does not subside even after an ankle sprain has healed.\n- Symptoms of weakness is felt in the ankle due to anterior ankle impingement.\n- Pain is produced when the ankle is passively or actively dorsiflexed.\nSymptoms of Posterior Ankle Impingement\n- Pain in the posterior region of the ankle is a symptom of posterior ankle impingement.\n- Tenderness is felt posteriorly at the bottom tip of the fibula.\n- Worsening pain at the end of plantar flexion (foot pointing downwards).\n- Pain upon standing on toes is also a symptom of posterior ankle impingement.\n- X-ray shows if any bony spurs are present on the talus (heel bone) and at the end of the tibia (shin bone).\nCauses of Ankle Impingement\nWhen the ankle is fully bent either upwards or downwards, it traps the tissues present in the ankle joint between the bones in the ankle. This condition is known as ankle impingement. Posterior ankle impingement occurs in the back of the ankle. Posterior ankle impingement is commonly seen in ballet dancers.\nAnterior ankle impingement occurs at the front of the ankle. Anterior ankle impingement occurs from an acute or recurrent ankle sprain causing the ligaments to thicken and get compressed between the bones i.e. the tibia and the talus bone. When these torn or ruptured ligaments heal, there is excessive scar tissue formation along the front and at the side of the ankle joint resulting in a meniscoid lesion.\nTreatment of Ankle Impingement\n- Rest should be taken for at least 4 weeks for ankle impingement to heal.\n- A plaster cast or splint to treat ankle impingement may be applied to limit ankle movement.\n- Cold therapy or ice application helps in reducing pain and inflammation associated with ankle impingement.\n- NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and naproxen help in reducing pain and inflammation caused due to ankle impingement.\n- Surgery for ankle impingement is required if the patient does not benefit from conservative treatment.\nWhat is the Recovery Period for Ankle Impingement?\nSurgical treatment for Ankle Impingement usually is the best way to treat this condition. Surgical treatment for ankle impingement facilitates speedy return of function and resuming normal activities with no pain. Recovery is generally very rapid if surgery for ankle impingement only involves removal of scar tissue from the outer aspect of the ankle. The patient may feel increased ankle pain for some six weeks before improvement is observed. Complete recovery from ankle impingement usually takes around seven to eight months. If there are other conditions in the ankle like peroneal tendonitis, ankle arthritis and the like which require additional correction then recovery may take a bit longer. The overall prognosis for ankle impingement due to these additional conditions may definitely be affected but still complete recovery from ankle impingement is seen in majority of the cases.\nWhat are the Exercises for Ankle Impingement?\nStretching Exercises for Ankle Impingement are as Follows:\nRehabilitation for Ankle Impingement usually begins with these forms of exercises. Most of the symptoms of ankle impingement may resolve after this therapy without further intervention from the physical therapist. While doing these exercises the patient should make sure that an effective stretch should be maintained for at least half a minute as long as it is pain free. Some of the exercises to achieve this are as follows:\nGastrocsoleus Stretching for Ankle Impingement:\nTo do this exercise, stand facing a wall and place the hands on the wall. Now extend the injured leg and place a cloth under the arch of the foot for support. Keep the front part of the knee slightly bent. Now, gently point the toes inward on the back foot. Keep the injured heel on the floor with the knee straight, shift the body weight towards the wall. You will feel a gentle stretch in the calf. Maintain this position for about half a minute. Come back to the normal position and repeat this exercise five times and do it about 10 times a day.\nRange of Motion Exercises for Ankle Impingement Includes:\nAnkle Plantar Flexion Exercise for Ankle Impingement:\nTo do this exercise, sit with the injured leg crossed over the opposite knee. Use the opposite hand to pull the top of the foot and toes towards the body. This should give a feeling of a gentle stretch on the top of the foot and ankle. Maintain this position for about half a minute and repeat this exercise about five times and about 10 times a day.\nAnkle Eversion Exercise for Ankle Impingement:\nTo do this exercise sit with the injured ankle crossed over the opposite knee. Grip the foot with the opposite hand, placing the thumb on the top of the foot and fingers across the bottom of the foot. Now, gently push the foot downwards with little rotation such that the toes rise up slightly. This should make you feel a gentle stretch on the inside of the ankle. Maintain this position for about half a minute. Repeat this exercise about five times and do it about 10 times a day.\nAnkle Inversion Exercise:\nTo do this exercise, sit with the injured ankle crossed over the opposite knee. Grip the foot with the opposite hand placing the thumb on the bottom of the foot and fingers across the top of the foot. Gently pull the foot such that the toe comes towards the body and the thumb pushes the inside of the ball of foot away from the body. This should give a gentle stretch on the outside of the ankle. Maintain this position for about half a minute and do this about 10 times a day.\nStrengthening Exercises for Ankle Impingement\nIt should be noted that these exercises should be done under the guidance of a physical therapist. In the initial stages you may feel some soreness of the muscles but it will improve with time.\nDorsiflexor Strengthening Exercise for Ankle Impingement:\nTo do this exercise, you need to have a rubber tube to act as resistance which should be fixed to a stationary object such as a table or a pole. Loop the other end of the tube around the injured leg. Now, sit on the floor facing the object. There should be slight tension felt in the tube when the foot is relaxed. Now gently pull the foot backwards towards the body using the ankle and toes. Maintain this position for about half a minute and then return to normal position. Repeat this exercise about five times and do it about 10 times a day.\nAnkle Eversion Strengthening Exercise for Ankle Impingement:\nTo do this exercise, take one end of the resistance tube while the other end is fixed to a stationary object. Take the other end of the tube and place it around the injured foot. Place your fists between the knees. Now draw the band across the opposite foot and slowly pull the little toe outwards and upwards. Make sure that there is gentle resistance offered by the rubber tubing. Maintain this position for about half a minute and do this exercise about 10 times a day repeating it five times with each try.\nAnkle Inversion Strengthening Exercise for Ankle Impingement:\nTo do this exercise, loop one of the tube over the injured foot and the other end attached to a fixed object. Now gently pull the big toe upwards and inwards ensuring that the rubber tube resists the entire motion. Maintain this position for about half a minute and maintaining the resistance by the tube come back to the starting position. Repeat this exercise about five times and do it about 10 times a day.\nBalance Exercises that are Essential after Treatment of the Ankle Impingement\nIt is extremely vital to maintain caution when doing these exercises as they are quite advanced and are done after almost complete healing of the condition. Make sure that you consult with the physical therapist before starting these exercises.\nInversion or Eversion Balance Exercises for Ankle Impingement:\nMake a balance board of about 1.5 feet long and 1.5 inch wide. Use a stick or a rod which is placed underneath the board across it. Now, stand on a smooth surface and step on the board with the feet about a hip width apart at an equal distance from each side of the rod or the stick. Now, use your feet to balance the board and at the same time tipping it from side to side making sure that the board does not touch the ground. You can rest for a few moments before starting to balance the board again. Repeat this exercise about five times and do it about four times a day."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:09352aae-3026-4e57-bea6-b2394b9d6b03>","<urn:uuid:e8f520f7-ea50-4355-a23e-f71ea2c13844>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I work in urban development - which approach is more cost-effective for pedestrian safety: road safety audits during design phase or transportation health impact assessments?","answer":"Road safety audits during the design phase are more cost-effective for ensuring pedestrian safety. When issues are identified and addressed during the design stage, changes like extending curbs, widening sidewalks, or inserting pedestrian islands are easy and inexpensive to implement. In contrast, altering a road design after construction is extremely expensive, often prohibitively so. While transportation health impact assessments are valuable policy tools for long-term planning and stakeholder engagement, road safety audits provide immediate, specific recommendations that prevent costly post-construction modifications while achieving the same goal of protecting vulnerable road users.","context":["A road safety audit can help make sure that the most vulnerable users of the road, such as pedestrians, are kept safe. Photo by Mira on the wall.\nWhen people think “road” they think “automobile.” Roads are most usually designed with cars in mind, and the most vulnerable users of the road – pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists – are often neglected. Currently, 70% of traffic fatalities world-wide involve vulnerable users of the road. When the needs of these vulnerable users are addressed, it is often in an ad-hoc manner. Sometimes crosswalks or bike lanes are added after a road is built, which leads to crosswalks that are too long, or bike lanes that disappear every few blocks. In other instances, streets heavily crossed by pedestrians may still have a barrier in the median of the road, with no pedestrian crossings for several blocks. This forces pedestrians to jump over the divider as they cross, which can be extremely risky.\nRoad safety audits – inspections of road design with safety in mind – are an important tool for improving road safety, since they examine a project from the point of view of the road’s most vulnerable users. In developing countries like India, where the volume of pedestrian traffic is very high, it is even more important to perform these audits.\n“Pedestrian fatalities account for the largest share of traffic fatalities in most Indian cities.”\nA road safety audit is a systematic assessment of a road design project from the point of view of safety. It looks for possible safety risks in the design, and suggests recommendations on how to address them.\nSince pedestrian fatalities account for the largest share of traffic fatalities in most Indian cities, an audit gives high priority to pedestrian safety. Audits ask questions such as: Are there complete sidewalks free of obstacles? Are there adequate and appropriately located pedestrian crossings? What’s the distance to the closest pedestrian crossing?\nAudits in India\nIn a developing country, the issues are often more complex than merely checking if road design standards are met. A high volume of pedestrian traffic and mixed modes of transport, with vehicles of different sizes and speeds, make it difficult to design roads which cater to everyone’s needs. Poor traffic enforcement and poor street conditions at the edge of the street, where the sidewalk would normally be located, make road safety audits even more necessary. Sometimes the pedestrian area is left unpaved or dirty, forcing pedestrians to walk in the street, with the traffic. A road safety audit helps to prevent such problems by identifying the issues in the early stages of the project, when it possible to make inexpensive changes to a problematic design.\n“A high volume of pedestrian traffic and mixed modes of transport, with vehicles of different size and speed capacity, make it difficult to design a road which caters to everyone’s needs.”\nMumbai, India, which has a metro-area population of over 20 million people, is in the process of redesigning the roads along a prominent metro rail corridor which runs east to west through the northern part of the city, as well as a monorail corridor, located in the western part of the city.\nAs part of this redesign, EMBARQ India is spearheading a Road Safety Audit of the plans, in hopes of improving safety and accessibility for all modes of transport, especially for commuters to and from the metro rail stations. One proposed recommendation is to include a wide sidewalk free of all obstacles, which will run the length of the corridor. Another recommendation involves extending the curbs at several intersections, which will force vehicles to slow down when making a turn, as well as reduce the distance a pedestrian must cross. The audit has also led to a recommendation to add high quality pedestrian crossings, at least every 80 meters (87 yards) and at every intersection. These specific changes will help to make pedestrians and drivers safer, in the most efficient way possible.\nAn early audit saves money and lives\nA road safety audit is an essential part of the road design process, since it helps to make sure the road designer’s goals are aligned with safety needs. Without such an audit, the road designer has two main goals: keeping costs as low as possible and ensuring that the design meets government standards. Often, the legal standards are not specific or robust enough to keep pedestrians and other vulnerable users safe. An audit goes beyond the standards and looks at specific issues which may need treatment, regardless of whether those changes are required by law.\n“Often, the legal standards are not specific or robust enough to keep pedestrians and other vulnerable users safe.”\nWhen these issues are pointed out at the design stage, it is easy to make changes. The curb can be extended, the sidewalk widened, or a pedestrian island inserted. Altering a design after the road has been constructed can be extremely expensive, often prohibitively so, not to mention dangerous for road users in the meantime.\nConducting an audit at the design stage saves money and lives. EMBARQ India’s preemptive work auditing the plans for the metro rail corridor will help ensure that the project meets the needs of all road users- drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike.","Transportation Health Impact Assessment Toolkit\nFor Planning and Health Professionals\nReduced drinking and driving and increased seatbelt use—these transportation policies have helped save many lives. Transportation policies can also be about infrastructure—how people get from place to place. These policies can help or block people from healthy lifestyle choices, such as making regular doctor visits, accessing good jobs, and choosing healthy food. This is especially true for underserved residents, children, older adults, and households without automobiles.\nWhen health is considered among the goals of transportation policy and land use planning, the resulting policy can help reduce air pollution; prevent traffic injuries and deaths; and lower obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer rates. Such outcomes can happen when roads are designed to be pedestrian-, cyclist- and public transit-friendly. Roads that are designed for people as well as for cars and trucks can increase physical activity, enhance community quality of life, and increase access to community services.\nHow can public officials, community members, and planners ensure that future transportation policies consider health? One way is to use a health impact assessment (HIA). Transportation HIAs help policymakers see and address the potential health effects of a proposed transportation project, plan, or policy before it is built or implemented. A transportation HIA can ensure that all people, regardless of age, income, or ability, are able to move about their community easily and safely.\nA community’s transportation planning process can have many stages. For example, a Long-Range Transportation Plan made by states and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) sets the vision for transportation over a twenty-year timeline. A Transportation Improvement Program identifies which projects will be funded and constructed over the next four years. As a policy tool, transportation HIAs can help prioritize local and statewide project proposals by identifying the health value. The HIA process can also encourage all stakeholders, including the MPO, project managers, elected officials, public health officials, the residents, and commuters to work together on improving public health.\nThe Transportation HIA Toolkit provides a framework for public health departments, city planners, project managers, and other stakeholders to conduct HIAs on proposed transportation projects, plans, and policies. If your are seeking the Transportation and Health Tool developed by CDC and the U.S. Department of Transportation, go here.\nThe elements of the Transportation HIA Toolkit are:\nGeneral HIA resources\nSectors from education to housing to community design use HIAs to identify opportunities to improve public health. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Healthy Places Health Impact Assessment page for an HIA overview and the steps involved in any HIA process. You can also find links to online HIA courses and other resources.\nHIA Background Information and HIA Indicators\nTo conduct an HIA, practitioners will need to research background information on the project area and affected population. The HIA Background Information and HIA Indicators section links to national databases and provides guidance on relevant indicators that assess the health impact of transportation projects. This section also directs practitioners to local sources for data specific to an area.\nStrategies for Health-Oriented Transportation Projects and Policies\nHIAs make evidence-based recommendations to promote positive health outcomes and minimize negative consequences. The Strategies for Health-Oriented Transportation Projects and Policies section identifies transportation design and infrastructure strategies recognized in published HIAs. It also provides resources to inform recommendations. The strategies and evidence are divided into six categories:\n- Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)\n- Expand Public Transportation\n- Promote Active Transportation\n- Incorporate Healthy Community Design Features\n- Improve Safety for All Users\n- Ensure Equitable Access to Transportation Networks\nIn the case studies, you can find existing HIA reports on transportation-related projects and policies, ranging from walking and biking improvements and public transit expansion to VMT legislation.\nOther Transportation HIA Resources:\nTransportation and Health Toolkits\n- Transportation and Health Tool\nThe tool was developed by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide easy access to data that practitioners can use to examine the health impacts of transportation systems.\n- Convergence Partnership: Transportation and Health Toolkit\n- American Public Health Association: Transportation and Health Toolkit\nThis site has tools to help you explain to others the connection between transportation and health.\n- UCLA Health Impact Assessment Clearing House\n- Transportation Web page\n- Data sources for HIA: Demographic and health risk data for describing affected populations\n- Partnership for Prevention (US).

{"question":"Hey, what jobs did boats have historically in Kerala and Venice shipping areas?","answer":"In Kerala, Kettuvallams were originally used for commercial transport, carrying about 30 tons of rice and spices from Kuttanad to the port at Cochin, with journeys taking about three days to complete. They became obsolete for cargo after the arrival of lorries but were later repurposed for tourism. In Venice, particularly in the Castello district and Arsenal area, boats were crucial for naval industry and commerce in the Saint Mark's Republic, with numerous shipyards supporting both the Arsenal's large ship construction and smaller boats for lagoon navigation. The Arsenal was a vital hub of naval industry, supported by various craftsmen and shipbuilding services in the neighborhood.","context":["About Kerala Houseboats\nAbout Kerala houseboats or the Kettuvallams as they are known, are the main highlights of the Kerala backwaters\nTypes of Houseboat\nOne Bed Accommodation\nThe one bedroomed houseboats are considerably smaller than the two bedroom boats but this time smaller is actually better. The one bedroom houseboat comes with a lot more features and make an ideal cozy heaven for couples after a bit of privacy.\nUnlike the bigger boats, there is usually a sundeck which is great for sunbathing but even better for gazing at the bright Kerala stars. There is a small kitchen from which sumptuous keralan cuisine is served.\nUnlike the bigger boats you will also get the opportunity to stop the houseboat any place you like to take photographs.\nOk, now one thing you will notice about kerala houseboats are that these these boats are big. When I was there, we managed to get seven of us in one of these boats and we still felt lonely! We had a huge round table which was great for drinking and playing cards etc. There is also a television but I do not know why you would want to use that!\nEach bedroom has an attached bathroom. There is a large living area used for dining and plenty of room to laze about in the sun. There is seperate accommodation for the crew so you barely see them, unless they are bringing out various snacks or fine cuisine.\nThe Kerala Houseboats are also known as Kettuvalloms, which means 'Boat of knots', were originally used for general transport. They would carry tons of rice and spices from Kuttanad to the port at Cochin (Kochi).\nThe boats could usually carry about 30 tons of goods (about three lorry loads) and the journey would usually take them about threee days to complete.\nSince the arrival of lorries in India, they became obsolete until the insurgance of tourism into the area. The boats were already equipped with small kitchens and crews, were refitted and turned into the floating equivalent of a five star hotel. In fact, the houseboats have proved so popular as floating hotels, ther is now almost twice as many as there was before.\nThe Kettuvallam or 'boat with knots' as it is known locally, was so called because the entire boat is held together by knots. Made from the tough fibre of coconut, not one single nail is used during the construction.\nBuilding a houseboat\nMost of the houseboats average 70 feet in length and 15 feet wide. They are made using ancient techniques and principals passed down through families of carpenters. They are made from long planks of wood, known as Anjili, and held together by lenghty bits of rope made from cocconuts.\nThe hulls of the boats are made from jackwood which is abundant around theKerala backwaters. The lengths of wood are tied together using the coconut rope and then more coconut fibre is stuffed into the gaps. This framework is then coated with a caustic black resin extracted from boiled cashew kernels which lasts for an amazingly long time.\nThe Kettuvallams are motorised and steered by a huge rudder. Long bamboo poles or 'punts' are used to push the boat along in shallow areas. Bamboo beams sprouting off on the sides are used as foot holds for the same reason.\nBamboo is used for the framework of the roof and splits of bamboo are used for weaving mat for roofing. Cashew Nut oil is then used as a varnish to ensure a protection for the houseboats.","In a few words:\nThe squeri da sotìl – brick-pillared shipyards topped by a wooden roof for the building of elegant ships – situated at San Isepo (the local name for St Joseph) are a jewel of history awaiting re-discovery.\nIn the heart of Castello, one of the six historic districts of Venice, one can still find nineteenth-century tezoni – wooden-roofed structures set on brick pillars for the construction of ships in the Venetian tradition – later modified to meet modern needs and, as a result, almost totally disguising their original, historic structure.\nAt the core of this complex and out in the open, were the slipways for the hauling and launching of ships, which are now covered over.\nFor this reason, it is important to restore the original beauty and features of the squeri, in order to bring back to light the ancient skills of boat and ship carpentry in Venice. This would also give a new lease of life to the entire area of Castello, which is rich in art, history, culture and tradition.\nthe Centre for the Study and Enhancement of the Ancient and Traditional Maritime Crafts in Venice\nA new life for the squero grando (large shipyard): the aim is to bring it back to its original shape and make it operational, thus affording it the added function of being a teaching laboratory for the nearby nautical schools and an interesting additional to the experience of Venetian culture.\nFour Areas For The Enhancement And Development Of The Squeri\nThe Tezòn Grando\nThis, the large shipbuilding edifice, a brick structure with a surface area of roughly 200 square metres, will retain its original purpose for building ships.\nIn consequence, priority will be given to the demand from economic activities having the closest possible link with the lagoon environment. In other words, activities connected to boats.\nThe Tezòn of the Crafts – Teaching Laboratory\nThe teaching laboratory will offer the students of the nearby State Maritime Institutes “Giorgio Cini” and “Sebastiano Venier” the right place where to test their manual skills for the venetian artisan works of “squerariol” (gondolamanbuilder), “remer” (oarmanbuilder) and “forcoler” (oarlockmanbuilder).\nThe Tezòn of the Crafts – School of Venetian-style Rowing\nVenetian-style rowing school will offer any inhabitant and guest of the city the chance to experience the so called “venetian culture of oar”, even with the possibility to rent a rowing traditional venetian boat.\nThe Corte dello Squero – Shipbuilding Yard\nThe little boats’ existing slipway for hauling and launching will be maintained as it is functional to the didactic activity.\nThe building of a hut will have available a reception room and also a room for a small kitchen, suitable for convivial meetings “venetian-style”.\nThe waterfront’s edge of the “Corte” will be used for the activities of the venetian-style rowing school and for excursion with rowing traditional venetian boats for hire.\na rebirth of cultural tourism in Castello\nSix Targets For The Re-launch Of An Entire Historical District Of Venice\nRebirth of the old squeri and the crafts of carpentry and caulking\nThe traditions of the shipbuilding squeri are as old as Venice itself, the city being inseparable from its watery environment which requires the use of boats for transport. ‘Barca xe casa’, a boat is home, as Venetians have said for centuries. The etymology of the word squero may be linked to the local word squadra (a square), an essential tool for carpenters. It is also suggested that squero comes from the Greek word eschárion, i.e. boatyard.\nIn the past, Venetians referred to their crafts as ‘Arts’, which were understood to indicate ‘corporations’ in the original medieval meaning of the word. These were associations legally recognised by the Venetian Republic, and each of them included all workers and operators within the same trade or occupation. The workers engaged in various tasks in the squeri were called squeraroli, and among these were the carpenters and the caulkers, whose work was hard, and it required precision, so much so that an apprentice needed eight years before qualifying as a ‘master caulker’.\nThe creation of an important educational centre dedicated to old Venetian crafts\nDidactic aspect has the task of generating a virtuous interconnection between the typical Venetian craftsmanship of water and the audience of the potential juvenile apprenticeship represented in first instance by the students of the nearby State Maritime Institutes of “Giorgio Cini” and “Sebastiano Venier”. The technical support is ensured by the workers of the adjacent “squero”, where work is continued both for the ship engine part and for the construction / repair of wooden boats. To these two realities will then be joined “on call” also those of the other artisans linked to the production of boats. Shortly, everything that will be possible to widen the cognitive horizon of new generations.\nThe rebirth of Fitabatele – boats for hire\nAn important cultural aspect consists in the reintroduction in the city of the “fitabatele”, that means the possibility for inhabitants and guests to rent a typical Venetian rowing boats to enjoy the experience of sustainable lagoon navigation, or inside the large and unique network of the narrow “rii” (canals). This is also complemented by a learning path and knowledge of the working environment of the Venetian boatyard, the production technique of the different typical wooden boats, their protection and use in the lagoon environment.\nThe promotion of Venetian-style rowing through courses and events\nSocial aspect is guaranteed by offering anyone who so desires, the opportunity to learn how to rowing “Venetian-style”, the first step in preparation for an eventually enrollment with one of the many city rowing Societies. This activity adds up to a moderate physical effort, an unusual view of the city from the water, a constant relationship with the environment, a test of one’s degree of skill in leading the boat rowing in the various positions. In addition, of course, to the availability of typical Venetian boats, the presence of qualified technical personnel is guaranteed, in collaboration with the city rowing Societies.\nThe upgrading of cityscapes\nTrust us. Still exists an enchanting Venice, far from the massive invasion of tourists, a Venice that only the Venetians know and that allows you to experience an unique and unrepeatable atmosphere. It is the so-called “minor Venice”, indispensable for understanding the inner city, its history, its landscapes, but above all the authentic people who live there. A heritage of humanity that must be safeguarded, also thinking about the future and the redevelopment of the ancient places of work.\nGetting to know the Castello district\nThe “sestiere” is one of the six areas in which Venice is divided, a partition that dates back to the origins of the city. It roughly corresponds to the “neighborhood” of other cities, which ideally represented the fourth part of the Roman camp, an ideal scheme for the construction of a large number of inhabited centers in Europe.\nParticulary, the “sestiere” of “Castello” is the largest of the city and took its name from a fortress, now disappeared, around which the area developed in the early Middle Ages. Of great importance for the history of Venice are the church of Saint Zachary and, to the north, Saints John and Paul, which houses the tombs of numerous doges and, of course, Saint Peter of Castle, the patriarchal church before Saint Mark. Finally, a large part of Castle’s district is occupied by an area that was of vital importance to the Saint Mark’s Republic: the famous “Arsenal”.\neuros to be collected from crowdfunding to get the project started\nThe Most Important Steps\nEstimated net total of € 603,000.00\nFor the realisation of the project, the total estimated cost is approximately € 650,000.00.\nBy law, the Comune of Venice – the local government and land owner of the Arsenal – bears some responsibility for extraordinary maintenance.\nThe Tezòn Grando – € 270,000.00\nSuperfection demolition: € 25,000.00\nRoof covering shed (approx. 255 sqm): € 45,000.00\nConcrete spout to raise the height of the floor (mq. 224): € 20,000.00\nInternal masonry works: € 90,000.00\nScaffolding works: € 25,000.00\nBathrooms, dressing room, showers: € 50,000.00\nInstallations: € 15,000.00\nTotal sub “Tézon grando” net of VAT: € 270,000.00\nThe Tezòn of the Crafts – €191,000.00\nRoof demolition, internal mezzanine and metal support structures: € 25,000.00\nRoof covering shed (approx. 255 sqm): € 45,000.00\nConcrete casting to raise the height of the floor (mq. 196): € 16,000.00\nInternal masonry works: € 75,000.00\nScaffolding works: € 15,000.00\nInstallations: € 15,000.00\nSub total “Tézon of Crafts” net of VAT: € 191,000.00\nThe Corte dello Squero, the shipbuilding yard – €142,000.00\nRoof demolition, internal mezzanine and metal support structures: € 25,000.00\nConstruction of a hut and wood shed (9.00 × 5.00 × 3.5 m), with two rooms: € 80,000.00\nConcrete casting to raise the height of the floor (mq.168): € 12,000.00\nPlant (recycling and purification) of boat hull washing waters: € 5,000.00\nHauling and launching new crane: € 20,000.00\nSub full “Corte del squero” net of VAT: € 142,000.00\nYou can make a donation directly to the project by way of a credit transfer to the following IBAN number, stating its purpose as a “donation”:\nBank IBAN: IT50 D033 5901 6001 0000 0155 070\nPost office IBAN: IT64 L076 0102 0000 0001 4055 305\nThe Mutual Society\n150 years of history and traditional craftsmanship\nThe Society for Mutual Assistance of Carpenters and Caulkers – Società di Mutuo Soccorso fra Carpentieri e Calafati – was founded in Venice in 1867 and it is acknowledged as the oldest of the associations still in existence in the city.\nIn 2017, the Society celebrated 150 years of activity, making it the proud holder of the title of the oldest association in Venice.\nThe Society is the moral heir of its forerunners, the old schole picole, the ‘little schools’. These were devotional, charitable and occupational institutions to which workers and operators in the same craft belonged. In this case, the various categories of arsenalotti (Arsenal workers) belonged either to the Schola dei Calafai a l’Arsenal (School of Arsenal Caulkers) or to the Schola dei Marangoni da Nave (School of Ship Carpenters).\nThe Society’s main activity is mutual assistance for its members, based on a sharing of resources made available by its members through their annual subscription.\nThe Society’s patron saint is St Phocas (san Foca), who is also the protector of the ancient corporation of caulkers, the Arte dei Calafai de l’Arsenal.\nfrom the time-honoured skills of the Arsenal workers to the church of San Isepo, an experience of saints and boats\nThe squeri da sotìl at San Isepo, 800 hundred years of history\nThe historic squeri at San Isepo\nSince 1300, small to medium-sized boats were built in the historic district of Castello.\nThe boatyards there take their name from the nearby church of San Isepo, the Venetian name for St Joseph, the husband of the Virgin Mary.\nThe traditional squeri normally consist of an outdoor dirt track which slopes downwards to the water for the launching and hauling of ships, while the actual construction of the vessels took place underneath a teza (a wooden hut or shed supported by brick pillars), which sometimes had an upper floor of workers’ living quarters.\nThe careful conservation of these now very rare edifices of industrial archaeology with their notable value in terms of ethnography and the environment is of vital importance for historical study and Venice’s very survival – a city of ‘cultural heritage for humanity’.\nCastello, historic district of boats and crafts\nCastello is one of the greenest areas of Venice and is famous for being the seat of the imposing Arsenal, the hub of the naval industry of the Saint Marks’s Republic. Still today near the entrance gate one can see four majestic stone lions, which according to legend, in November 1719, came to life during some stormy nights, so as to induce the inhabitants of the Serenissima to believe that the place was magic.\nIt goes without say that an important industry like the Arsenal, brought with it the need to have in the neighborhoods a series of handicraft services that collaborated to the realization and completion shipowner of the powerful Venetian ships. Here then arise in Castello numerous building sites, both as support for the Arsenal and for the construction of smaller and lighter boats for lagoon navigation.\nSt. Phocas, patron saint of the Arte dei Calafati\nFoca lived in Sinope (Greece), where he lived between the first and second centuries; by profession he used to grow vegetables and he was therefore appreciated and loved by people for his great generosity and hospitality. Of these virtues of his, he was able to give a moving demonstration to the two soldiers who, tired and hungry, one day stopped at his door asking for information about a Christian who lived around there and against whom the death sentence had been pronounced .\nThe henchmen, who did not know him personally, came from Foca to sit at home, where he asked them to stay for lunch. While the two were refreshing, Foca moved into the inner garden and dug his own grave; at the end he returned back inside home and declared his identity to the soldiers, also asking them not to delay the execution. Legend has it that he was thrown into the grave along with numerous snakes, but that the reptiles refrained from biting him. Unable to grasp the sign of holiness and divine protection, the two soldiers killed him at last with their hands.\nInside Saint Mark’s church San Foca is portrayed on an ancient mosaic, embracing a rudder, the emblematic symbol of the ship but also the metaphor of the steadfastness of the route in faith.\nArzanà, Dante’s praise for the caulkers in his Divine Comedy\nOra siamo in un freddo mattino del 1300. Dante ci accompagna nella quinta bolgia dell’ottavo cerchio e, per farci capire le atroci punizioni riservate ai malversatori, descrive un luogo che gli è rimasto impresso (anche se non è certo che a Venezia ci fosse realmente mai stato). Come d’inverno, quando non si naviga ed è tempo di manutenzione delle navi, la pece viene fatta bollire nell’Arsenale di Venezia, così c’è chi costruisce nuove barche, chi tura con la stoppa le falle, chi ribatte la prua e chi la poppa, chi fabbrica remi e chi sartie, chi rattoppa la piccola vela di terzeruolo e chi la vela maggiore l’artimone.\nQuale ne l’arzanà de’ Viniziani\nbolle l’inverno la tenace pece\na rimpalmare i legni lor non sani,\nché navicar non ponno – in quella vece\nchi fa suo legno novo e chi ristoppa\nle coste a quel che più vïaggi fece;\nchi ribatte da proda e chi da poppa;\naltri fa remi e altri volge sarte;\nchi terzeruolo e artimon rintoppa –\n(Versi tratti da: Dante Alighieri, Inferno, Canto ventunesimo)\nThe initiative’s logo, a tribute to Jacopo de' Barbari\nThe bird’s-eye perspective view of Jacopo de’ Barbari, made with the xylography technique, describes the city of Venice in detail to the year 1500.\nIt is precisely this great masterpiece who has inspired the whole communication and the trademark of this initiative, where the “squeri” could already be seeing as still they are today. Given to its complexity, it is believed that the view is the result of a choral work, of various people with specific scientific skills: from relief, to drawing, to carving the woodcut matrix, to the press, coordinated by Anton Kolb, the customer.\nActually the view was taken over three years before 1500, year that has been marked inside the map. In the following decade several changes were made to update it and keep it in the market, as it is confirmed by the few documents preserved."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:030a78bd-98d4-4c19-9d81-974cd8d1eda5>","<urn:uuid:505e2c46-f787-4e6b-8a05-625b90fe8f7a>"],"error":null}
