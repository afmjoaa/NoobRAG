{"question":"Hey, i'm studying both french literature and philosophy - can u tell me how Sartre influenced literature writers in Haiti and what his key philosophical ideas about human existence were?","answer":"Sartre had a significant influence on Haitian writers while developing important philosophical ideas about human existence. In Haiti, writers like Tontongi admired Sartre for his stance against human oppression and imperialist domination, as well as his support of revolutionary leaders in their struggle for liberation throughout the Third World. Philosophically, Sartre established key existentialist principles: he believed that human existence precedes essence, meaning humans first exist and only afterwards define themselves through their actions and choices. He emphasized absolute freedom as a fundamental characteristic of human existence, arguing that we are responsible for creating our own personality and destiny through free choices. This freedom, however, leads to anxiety since we must constantly make choices without certainty about their outcomes. Sartre also developed the concept of 'nothingness' as central to human consciousness, and the idea of 'bad faith' - a form of self-deception where people deny their fundamental freedom and responsibility.","context":["La couverture de La Parole indomptée / Memwa Baboukèt.\nReviewed by Flore Zéphir\nFrom the very beginning, the title of this collection of essays, which translates to English as “the untamed or unmuted word,” informs the reader that the author will speak straightforwardly about his preoccupations. Poet, essayist, and social critic Tontongi places Haiti in the context of a “universal human project” that seeks to restore to the oppressed their rightful position in humanity (245–264).1 La Parole indomptée is a condemnation of oppression and exclusion in all facets of Haitian society. As a member of the literary community, Tontongi sees his role and duty as a keeper of collective memory, which for him is the conscience or the moral compass of a people. This moral compass is there to underscore wrongdoings, injustices, and inequalities and to spur writers to rectify them through their work. In Tontongi’s own words: “Une œuvre littéraire qui n’exprime pas l’humanité souffrante et qui n’en rend pas compte est un échec ontologique cuisant.” (8).\nOne of the mechanisms of exclusion in Haitian society has been the traditional relegation of Haitian Creole, the language spoken by 100 percent of the population, to simply vernacular status. Tontongi strives to correct the subordinate position attributed to the Haitian language. By dividing his book into two sections—one written in French (La Parole indomptée, occupying pages 7–154) and the other in Creole (Memwa baboukèt, 155–269)—he sends an “untamed” message to his readership that Haitian Creole is a perfectly legitimate language fully equipped to handle such sophisticated subjects as literary criticism. In fact, in both sections he discusses several of the literary figures (Haitians and non-Haitians) that made a profound impact on his own thinking about issues of social justice, liberty, and equality. For example, he discusses the ideas of French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre significantly and eloquently in both French and Creole. This should put to rest the question of whether or not Creole can offer the academic repertoire necessary to engage in such serious and substantive conversations. Indeed, the essays in Memwa baboukèt offer a powerful rebuttal to such claims. In La Parole indomptée, Tontongi removes the baboukèt or muselière (muzzle) that has been placed on Haitian Creole for too long. As he states, “Pour ma part, pour aider à reverser la situation d’oppression où l’on a tenu la langue et la culture créoles en Haïti, j’essaie de produire tant que possible des œuvres en créole haïtien, certaines en édition bilingue ou plurilingue” (15). In so doing, he also removes the muzzle from the mouths of the Haitian people, who should be free to raise their unmuted voices without fear as they fight for their basic human rights: equality, justice, and freedom from discrimination and oppression.\nLe quatrième de couverture de La Parole indomptée / Memwa Baboukèt.\nIn his strong desire to inscribe Haiti in a universal human project, Tontongi presents an overview of the authors he admires and respects the most for who they are (were) and for the level or “ideological comfort” that unites him with those authors (14). For example, he eulogizes Sartre for his stance against human oppression and imperialist domination and exploitation as well as for his support of revolutionary leaders (Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, among others) in their struggle for liberation throughout the Third World. According to Tontongi, if Sartre were alive today, he would have stood in solidarity with all the oppressed of the earth, including the Haitian people, in their arduous fight for the dismantling of an oppressive system that marginalizes them and takes away their human dignity (40–56).\nTontongi, of course, understands that a literary critic cannot honor Jean-Paul Sartre without honoring his life companion, Simone de Beauvoir. In the Creole section of the book, he calls de Beauvoir “yon fanm vanyan total-kapital” (190). He considers her to be one of the greatest bearers of the collective memory or the post-World War II era in France. Moreover, he admires her greatly for her work on feminism, especially the stance she took against sexism and the domination and exploitation of women. Just like Sartre, de Beauvoir was a social activist with an “unmuted” voice.\nIn a similar fashion, Haitian writer Paul Laraque, internationally known for his poetry and militancy, receives significant coverage in La Parole indomptée (51–79, 119–125). Laraque, who started writing in Haiti, was deeply troubled by the deplorable conditions in which a large segment of the Haitian population was living (and still lives). Poetry became his weapon of choice to speak out against the people’s misery and exclusion from social participation. Eventually, Laraque had to leave Haiti following the Duvalier crackdown on dissidents of his dictatorial regime. He migrated to the United States in 1961 and lived in New York until his death in March 2007. Tontongi met Laraque in 1977, and a profound friendship developed between the two compatriots. In La Parole indomptée, he admires how Laraque was a poète engagé, whose writings demonstrated an unwavering commitment to social justice and political freedom. Moreover, he applauds Laraque for having written several of his poems in Creole (some excerpts are reproduced in the Creole section) and thus sharing his own understanding that the language spoken by the entire Haitian population deserves the same respect as French. As Tontongi asserts, Laraque’s commitment was first and foremost to the people, their frustrations, their aspirations, their struggles, and their hopes (73).\nTontongi also mentions Paul Laraque’s brother, Franck Laraque, in La Parole indomptée, calling him “l’autre Laraque” (119 ). Like his brother, Franck spoke out against the subhuman conditions in which the masses of Haitian people live. For Tontongi, the Laraque brothers are the embodiment of a Haitian conscience and of collective memory, as they witnessed a great many devastating political events in Haiti—including the US Occupation—before going into exile in New York. They were, indeed, as Tontongi puts it “des intellectuels en marronnage” (109). This explains the ideological affinity he has with the two brothers, as they—just like him—are “unmuted” speakers or La Parole indomptée.\nBefore the Laraque brothers, there was, of course, Jacques Roumain. Tontongi chooses to recognize him by recalling the international colloquium organized by the State University of Haiti from November 28 to December 9, 2007, the year that marked the hundredth anniversary of Roumain’s birth (227–244). Tontongi tells the reader about presentations that described Roumain as a “literary genius” (228). At the same time, he hastens to add several papers focused on Roumain’s activism, particularly that against the US Occupation of Haiti. Others discussed his establishment of the Haitian Communist Party, whose objectives were profound changes to the political structures of the country. By including Roumain in his book, Tontongi furthers the objectives of the symposium, which sought to “remove Roumain from oblivion and silence” (236). He wants his readership to rediscover Roumain, “revizite zèv li, zaksyon li e panse li, se reatrape yon pati enpòtan nan noumenm, nan istwa nou, nan kilti nou, nan idantite nou, yon pati enpòtan nan imanite” (236–237). In short, Roumain is part of the Haitian collective memory that Tontongi endeavors to preserve.\nHaitian-American writer Edwidge Danticat also receives special attention in La Parole indomptée. As Tontongi explains to the reader, Danticat addresses many problems that afflict Haitian society: poverty, repression, and foreign (and domestic) domination (250). He focuses on Danticat’s 2010 book, Create Dangerously: The Immigrant Artist at Work, in which she reflects personally on her own development as an immigrant writer and realizes that it is her duty to relate the tragic events she knows about or witnessed personally. These range from the imprisonment and execution of Haitian political dissidents under the Duvalier dictatorship to the 2010 earthquake that ravaged Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas. By recounting these stories in this particular work (and others), Danticat gives a voice to the voiceless and exposes the sociopolitical ills of the country. In consequence, she contributes to the creation of historical memory, an endeavor so dear to Tontongi, who sees literature as an integral part of his broader opus about Haiti as a universal human project.\nIn his discussion of writers who “believe in literature with a conscience,” Tontongi devotes a couple of pages to African-American writer Toni Morrison, recipient of a Nobel Prize in literature in 1993 (197–200). In his view, Morrison consistently highlights issues that arc fundamental to the African-American community. Those include daily struggles for survival in an oppressive sociopolitical system as well as challenges caused by the sociohistorical past (198). Since earning the Nobel Prize, Morrison has continued to speak out on issues of racial injustice, including the recent shootings of young Black men by the police. It is fair to say that Tontongi, who had always hoped that Morrison would use the great honor bestowed upon her to serve the cause of liberty and equality for oppressed people, chose to include her as an untamed writer with a conscience (199)—as, indeed, she is.\nTontongi includes other Haitian-American writers in his book. For example, he mentions Patrick Sylvain, who writes some of his poetry in Creole (205–206). The excerpts that he presents persuasively underscore Sylvain’s cry for social justice. In Sylvain’s words: “Kouraj, chemen lajistis va louvri” (206). As Tontongi asserts, Sylvain uses his poetic language as a “combat weapon,” “a militant tool” to express his indignation at an oppressive sociopolitical system (206). He also applauds Danielle Legros-Georges for “jan li kesyone sa k alantou l” and for the “tension” in her words, which reveals the liberty that she claims for herself and for all people (217). A measure of the admiration that Tontongi has for Legros-Georges can be seen in the fact that he translated several of her poems originally written in English under the title Maroon into Creole. Obviously, he wants all his readers to know that Legros-Georges is a poète en marronnage.\nIt is interesting to note that Tontongi also includes in La Parole indomptée musician Emmanuel Charlemagne, known to all Haitians as “Manno” (80–86). This choice is not surprising, as Manno is a political activist who wrote most of his songs in Creole. His compositions are songs of protest that denounce the dictatorial regime of the Duvaliers (father and son) and the subhuman conditions to which the masses of the Haitian people were relegated. Manno, in many ways, represents the musical conscience of Haiti, and his songs tell the story of the misery of a people that live in fear but have the power to free itself from this cycle of misery. Manno is undoubtedly a militant musician; this explains the “ideological comfort” that Tontongi finds in him.\nTontongi ends his book with a poem written in Haitian Creole in memory of seven “extraordinary, political and literary great men and women” who died between 2012 and 2014 and had a profound influence on their times (265). Their names, he writes, “still resonate in the memory of all people: Nelson Mandela, Hugo Chavez, Amiri Baraka, Jayne Cortez, Pete Seeger, Maya Angelou, and Gabriel García-Márquez” (265). They represent for him legendary heroes of the freedom of the mind, who have an absolute knowledge of the human existence. He goes on to say that they exist in our collective memory and arc still with us (269).\nYet it should be noted that Tontongi included in his book two Haitian authors whose work he finds ideologically troubling. They are René Depestre and Dany Laferrière. Tontongi severely criticizes the former for the disdain he manifested toward Haitian Creole, which in his view, was “un simple patois inférieur” (117). Although Depestre might be considered a great writer, especially due to the lyrical beauty of his works, for Tontongi he will remain “minuscule” since he never articulated any vision that could move the country forward (118). In a similar vein, Tontongi reflects on what he calls “les implications malheureuses de Dany Laferrière à l’Académie française” (126–150). He worries about what contributions Laferrière, as a promoter of the French language, will make to advance the cause of educating all Haitians in the language that they all speak: Haitian Creole, not French. His strong criticisms of these two Haitian writers reflect his conviction that the Haitian Creole language “ne peut vérifier et démontrer son autonomie que si elle est intégrée dans la littérature écrite du pays”(15).\nOverall, in La Parole indomptée, Tontongi expresses his solidarity with the dominated segments of society. For him, literature should reflect civic engagement, in its broadest sense. The overwhelming majority of the authors discussed in this book are selected for the humanist quality of their works. Tontongi’s preoccupation with the human condition did not begin with the publication of La Parole indomptée: in fact, several of the essays that appear here were published separately elsewhere between 1984 and 2014. As such, this compilation is the culmination of a long literary journey that gives shape to his human universal project, in which Haiti is at the center. La Parole indomptée is truly the untamed cry of the conscience of Tontongi, l’écrivain indompté.\n—Flore Zéphir Professor of French and Creole studies at the University of Missouri\nThis review was first published in the Journal of Haitian Studies, Fall 2016, Volume 22, number 2\n1. All English translations of quotes are mine.","Existentialist Perception Of The Human Condition: With Special Reference To Sartre\nExistentialism is a contemporary trend in the sphere of Philosophy. It lays stress on the existence of man. Existentialism was a protest against the traditional notions of man. It purports to form a 'just' concept of man, rejecting underestimation or overestimation of Man's personality. The Chief tenate of existentialism is \"Existence precedes essence\". It thinks that the existence of the individual is the highest truth. To it existence is more important than essence, for in essence; we are not able to find out the individuality. A particular man who is a moral entity, who fights against life, he should be the center of life, not his essence. Sartre says \"Man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and only afterwards, defines himself\". \"In other wards, man first exists then he looks at the world, thinks\" of it and acts in it as an individual.\" His contemplation and his actions are possible only because his existence: Existence, thus is the first principle from which all else flows. It is only later, by living , thinking and acting that man defines his nature and forms what is called his essence-that which he is and will be .\" (2) Consequently, man is like a blank sheet. He never comes in the world as finished product, as readymade, as well defined, rather he defines himself in course of his life. Sartre believe that human existence is the result of chance or accident. There is no meaning or purpose of his life other than what his freedom creates , therefore, he must rely on his own resources.\nIn the Philosophy of Sartre, there is an accord between the feeling of anxiety and freedom. He thinks that existence manifest's itself in the choice of actions, anxiety and freedom of will. He does not accept any kind of determination. Our past does not determine the present and we build up our own future. Our existence is absolutely free and fit consists in developing our life in full freedom. Existence means separating myself from the world and understanding myself as such i.e. I have to realize that I am not the same with the objects of the world and through my freedom I determine my future . In this way the responsibility of building my future is in my hands, but the future is uncertain and so I have no escape from anxiety and despair. Sartre is of opinion that many paths are open before us and among them we choose one. But as we are not able to choose the other opportunities, we are always under the shadow of anxiety. Higher the man's responsibility leads to higher anxiety. It is deeply related to our existence.\nMan is characterized by freedom. This free individual is also a creative individual i.e. we create our own personality, situation by interpreting our environment and in this way we are also responsible. Existence involves freedom - creativity - responsibility. Man is always responsible for his choice. He blames himself and not the society for the consequence of his choice . Man through his free acts determines his own destination. Man in making his personality, is never complete through out his life, he develops by his own free choice. In this sense, Heidegger has said that, \"Dasein, it always its own possibility,\" (3) and Sartre said that \"it is true that the possible is- so to speak - an option on being and if it is true that the possible can come in the world only through a being which is its own possibility, this implies for human reality the necessity of being its being in the form of an option on its being.\" (4)\nSartre has written a number of existentialist novels, dramas, stories, philosophical articles and books. Here we choose his great philosophical work \"Being and Nothingness\" and his famous novel 'Nausea' for the better understanding of his existentialist philosophy and the existential perception of the Human condition. In \"Being and Nothingness\", Sartre has explained the most significant aspect of human reality, i.e. consciousness as Nothingness. This concept of Nothingness is central to the philosophy of Sartre because it holds the key to the solution of the problem of the relation between the Being -for-itself and the Being-in-self . The chief characteristics of Being-for-itself is Nothingness. Thus Sartre calls the human being Being-for-itself which may mean that for man, his being is to be realized . He calls material object Being-in-itself. It is through man that Nothingness comes into the world. The question then arises: What is it about the Being of man that occasion Nothingness? The answer is: freedom. Freedom is the nature of man. There is no difference between the Being- of man and his Being-free. This consciousness of freedom is disclosed in anxiety. There is thus an internal connection among nothingness, freedom and anxiety. These are inter related structural determinants of being of man.\nNothingness, freedom and anxiety provide the condition which make possible the movement of \"bad faith\". Bad faith is a form of self-deception which in making use of freedom denies it. Bad faith is again to lying, yet not identical with it. In lying one hides the truth from others. In bad faith one hides the truth from oneself. In the former there is a quality of deceiver and deceived: in the later there is a unity of single consciousness. Bad faith does not come from outside. Consciousness affects itself with it. In describing the pattern of bad faith Sartre develops the example of a woman who consents to go out with a man who loves her. She is fully aware of his intention and knows that sooner or later she will have to make a decision. An immediate decision is demanded when he caresses her hands. If she leaves her hand then she encourages his advances: if she withdraw it, she may preclude any future relationship with the man. She may decides, but she seeks means for postponing the decision. It is at this point that \"Bad faith\" comes into play. She leaves her hand in his, but does not notice that she is doing so. She becomes all intellect, divorces her soul from her body and transforms her body into an object or thing - into the mode of \"Being-in-itself\". Her hands becomes \"a thing\", neither consenting nor resisting. She objectivizes her body and ultimately herself, as in-self , and thus stages a flight or an escape from herself as for-itself. She looses her subjectivity, her freedom and her responsibility for decision. She exists in bad faith.\nThe pursuit of being leads to an awareness of nothingness, Nothingness to an awareness of freedom, freedom to bad faith and bad faith to being-of consciousness which provides condition for its possibility.\nBy illustration of 'bad faith' Sartre concludes that nothingness is the essential part of consciousness, since bad-faith would not be possible without it. Sartre says that bad faith is a risk built into the nature of consciousness. The act of bad-faith proves that we aim to evade our responsibility, but according to Sartre we are compelled to be responsible. For Sartre, thus absolute freedom means, absolute responsibility.\nIn his novel 'Nausea' Sartre contents that man as existent is a mystery, a paradox and his nature and purposes cannot be summed up neatly in any formula. Man does not live as pure existence, but he may become aware of himself as such in the experience of Nausea. Roquentin, discovers in Nausea: \"the essential is contingency. I mean that, by definition, existence cannot be identified with necessity. To exist is to happen without reason.... Every thing is purposeless. This garden, this town and myself.\" (5) Here Roquentin is immobilized by the feeling that his own life together with all the world, is meaningless.\nIn 'Nausea' the hero comes to the conclusion that human life is a perpetual striving. Tried of taxing and ceaseless efforts, the worldly people falter in their struggle to achieve lucidity and make decisions, then things no longer have a meaning and their existence seems \"dull, obscene, gratuitous\" They feel that they are superfluous \"I want to leave, to go somewhere, where I would really be in my place and fit in...But my place is no where: I do not belong\". (6)\nSartre states that man has no paramount reality, no pre-determined text: he creates his own reality. He is a Roquentin, who says \"I am in the midst of things, nameless things. Alone without words, defenseless, they surround them, are beneath me, along me. They do not impose themselves: they are there\". (7)\nExpressing the existentialist view the 'Nausea' portrays that we are \"trapped in existence\", leaving in a completely meaningless world. Not principles that we use for ordering or comprehending events have any basis. But we cannot escape having to deal with 'existence', having to make sense out of it. All that we can tell is that this world which are confronted with his utterly arbitrary when we realize the unintelligibility of the world, our inability to withdraw from contact with it, and our need for finding some principle of order or intelligibility, we are then ready for the existentialist message. One first has to be overpowered by the 'Nausea of existence', has to acknowledge that the pattern of our lives is due to totally arbitrary ways of living and that any others would do as well.\nAt this point, we are confronted with our \"dreadful freedom\", recognising that we are completely free to choose our world-view, our way of living in the world. More over since we are completely free, there is no way in which we can find guides for our choice, no way we can avoid making a choice and no way of escaping from the consequences of the choices - our basic decisions.\nThus, Nausea, Sartre's famous novel, Portrays most force fully this condition of man's plight . The hero has been moving through life on the basis of an unquestioned acceptance of a certain outlook. But his dis-satisfaction with events forces him to ask whether this is the proper outlook. The quest for some justification for his way of life brings about its disintegration into pure Nausea, as the arbitrary frame work into which he has previously organised his word disappears. All that he is left with is the complete confusion of his in escapable existence and the realization that it has no meaningful order. When he becomes aware that only by his decision can be find a means of organising experience and a way of life, he is overwhelmed with the magnitude of the predicament that confronts him. He cannot avoid being a free agent. He cannot act unless he exercise his freedom and chooses some arbitrary outlook and order to make sense out of his world. Possible most frightening of all, he is permanently burdened with all the consequences of his decision for which he and he alone is responsible, and this is a 'dreadful responsibility'. Man is involved inevitably in anguish because his decision is never grounded in an external authority upon which he can rest the responsibility for his action. He must bear it alone. And when Sartre says alone, he means absolutely alone, for not only is their no God to share the burden, but there is no structure a priori for values to rest upon. For Sartre, the God does not exist is a dreadful fact that makes an ultimate difference to the world and to man.\nThe philosophy of existentialism found a particular relevance during two world wars. The catastrophic collapse of Europe, the horrible experience of the Nazi dictatorship and occupation of France, have left people with a sense that their views and values are meaningless. The world in which they, and we, have to live not longer seems susceptible to rational examination. Instead, only arbitrary beliefs seem able to give us a key to how to live in the face of an unintelligible universe.\nTo the common criticism that Sartre's philosophy, and indeed existentialism in general, is pessimistic, he replies that such a charge can come only from those who are fearful of the truth that life is genuinely difficult. Sartre says that, \"Existentialism is nothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a coherent atheistic position\". The discovery that there is no God and that man is alone, is the beginning of a genuine humanism that dignifies man as the free creature of all values of a whatever meaning there is in human existence. Further, he clearly states that existentialism does not ignore the human society and that in taking a decision it decides on behalf of the whole mankind. Existentialism does not aim at plunging man into despair : its final goal is to prepare man through anguish, abandonment and despair for a genuine life, it is basically concerned with the human condition as a complete form of choice. The fundamental issue, therefore, is authentic meaning of life.\n(1) Sartre, J.P., Existentialism and Human (Methuen, London, 1948).\n(2) Walter Odajnyle, Marxism and Existentialism (Garden City, New York, Double day and Comp, Inc, 1965).\n(3) Heidegger, Martin, Being and Time (Harper Row Publisher, 1962), 68.\n(4) Sartre, Jean Paul, Being and Nothingness (Methuen and Company Ltd., London, 1969), 471.\n(5) Sartre, J.P., Nausea (Penguin Modern Classics, 1966), 238\n(6) Ibid , 159-160.\n(7) Ibid, 25."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8c6ff691-b860-4356-9e36-b81a005db148>","<urn:uuid:0e862d46-50f5-4ff8-8165-63034611648f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which requires more maintenance - stamped concrete driveways or epoxy floor coatings?","answer":"Stamped concrete driveways require regular sealing every 1-2 years to enhance the color, lock in release powder, and protect from moss, rain, dirt and oil. For epoxy flooring, the maintenance needs depend on the slip resistance level - more slip resistant epoxy floors are harder to clean due to their more angular aggregate surface profile that can tear cleaning equipment like mops. However, less slip resistant epoxy floors are easier to clean but provide less traction.","context":["What are the cheapest types of finishes available?\n*The most common types of concrete finishes are broom finish and exposed aggregate. Depending upon square footage and concrete yardage, pricing varies from project-to-project. Broom and exposed aggregate are exterior finishes typically found in driveways, walkways, and patios. Most city sidewalks are broom finish because the light broom marks used on the surface allow for excellent traction and do not wear as fast as other concrete finishes. Exposed aggregate is when you remove the layer of cement from the surface in order to \"expose\" the pea gravel rocks. This typically is the finish used in most neighborhoods because you can pour exposed aggregate in light rainy conditions. Builders love this finish because it allows them to build houses faster no matter the weather and get houses sold. However, exposed aggregate is not \"feet friendly\" and can be annoying to walk on for patios.\nWhat types of reinforcement should I use in my new concrete driveway?\n*Most people tend to think more reinforcement is better than less. In fact, builders and other concrete contractors sometimes don't use any secondary reinforcement because it takes time and adds to the cost of construction. The reason for secondary reinforcement is to keep your slab from settling / twisting and to keep cracks tightly held together. However, the #1 guarantee is that concrete cracks no matter how its designed or installed - that's the nature of the beast. Your only as good as the dirt your pouring on so make sure your sub grade isn't soft. Otherwise, you're setting this heavy mass of rock, sand and cement on something that won't support it. The idea is to control cracking. Most people tend to think the more rebar and wire mesh they install, the less cracking will occur. The problem is too much reinforcement leaves you with very little concrete and makes it difficult for the concrete finishers to work. So you have to consider both ends of the spectrum. Fiber mesh is another reinforcing alternative - mixing small strands of fiberglass into the concrete mix. However, the small strands can be annoying to people because it looks like the slab has hair in some instances. You can burn off the strands at a later date although this adds another day of labor. Fiber mesh does help with excessive shrinkage and is an excellent option for hard troweled slabs.\nWhat designs do you recommend for patios?\n*This is a loaded question because it depends upon your budget and what is cosmetically appealing. Most patios are used for entertaining and enjoying the weather. Always consider how your patio furniture will perform on the surface you select. No one likes shimming every leg of the table in order to keep it from wobbling. But, if you elect to install stamp concrete for the entire patio surface (and pick a cobblestone pattern) this can be an issue with furniture. Some of our most popular patio designs involve broom finished colored concrete with a simple stamp border with matching stamp steps. Its cheaper, look terrific and reduces the wobble effect. If you can, build a bigger patio than a small one because most people regret their small patio later. Also, you get more bang for your dollar when installing patios over 700 square feet because concrete manufacturer's and contractors charge more for smaller projects. A small patio can take the same amount of time to install as a larger one - something to consider. Also, consider smoother concrete surfaces than rough finishes (such as exposed aggregate) because the small rocks can make it uncomfortable walking from the hot tub to the back door of the house. Lastly, if your not planning on being at your house for the rest of your life, think about the effects of resale value. Exposed or basic gray concrete may be the cheaper alternative, however, your home will appraise for more if you have good looking hardscapes that appeal to buyers.\nWhat should we consider for driveway designs?\n*Driveways usually have the most square footage of all exterior concrete hardscapes. Most architects, builders and homeowners really want the driveway to create visual impact with people but don't consider all the pro's and cons. Although we are a concrete company, we seriously put thought into driveways because typically this is a big piece of concrete and you need to break it up so that it doesn't resemble a mall parking lot. On the other hand, you don't want your driveway to look like a checker board and focus your visitor's attention from the house onto the driveway - it should compliment the house. Consider more simplistic designs rather that running borders all over the place. Most people cannot afford to stamp their entire driveway and substitute stamp borders with basic gray concrete as an alternative. However, stamp borders that run the length of the driveway on both sides and intersect through the center of the driveway pose a logistical issue when installing that adds cost. Most people think by pouring basic gray concrete in between the stamp borders that they are saving cost. But, stamp borders with basic gray concrete in between requires (2) concrete pumps! Due to the massive increase in gas, concrete pumps can range between $650.00 - $1, 200.00 per day increasing your driveway installation. Most driveway installations (unless you have an extremely steep incline) should not require any pumps. In addition, stamp concrete requires a sealing process which enhances the color, locks in the release powder and protects the concrete from moss, rain, dirt and oil from your vehicle. Consider if you want to seal your driveway every 1-2 years and how much maintenance your ready to commit to. A more important concern for driveways should be traction. The more incline the driveway has, the more you should lean towards selecting a concrete surface with better traction - you'll be thankful in the fall and winter time.\nIs there any \"hidden\" costs to consider when installing an exterior hardscapes like a patio, entry or driveway?\n*All estimates are extremely accurate in most instances. However, most hidden costs involve landscaping or drainage which we do not specialize in and would require another contractor. When you demolish an existing concrete hardscape it's difficult for us to determine the actual thickness of the concrete. On some occasions, when we remove a driveway there can be surprises like a section which is well over 8\" thick an would require either additional fill material (recycled concrete or gravel) or you attempt to fill the holes with existing concrete from the demolition. Recycled concrete or gravel is fairly cheap to purchase and can be installed by ACDI. In some instances, we can purchase and install drains for patios, pool decks and driveways, however, its much cheaper to hire a contractor specializing in these fields than to contract us for drainage installation. As for landscaping, any plants or grass can be damaged during the installation because the finishers have to stand on the perimeter of the slab (we cannot hover). We recommend either figuring these costs into your budget or remove the plants before you install your concrete.\nWhat's the difference between colored concrete and broadcast colors?\n*Colored concrete is manufactured by your local concrete supplier and the color comes already mixed within the concrete. The suppliers usually have color charts and samples for you to review. Broadcast colors is exclusively used for stamp concrete and comes in buckets or bags. It's thrown onto the surface of gray concrete, troweled in and stamped with large rubber molds resembling various slate, stone and wood patterns. If your considering broom finish with stamp borders (all the same color with the stamp having a highlight tone - typically dark gray), you should pick colored concrete because it displays broom finishes much better than broadcast colors. If your stamping the entire slab, consider either option. Broadcast colors typically offer more color selections than colored concrete and allow faint hues of the gray concrete to come through offering a more authentic feel to the stamp work. The sell to the homeowner is that colored concrete is the same tone throughout the entire thickness of the slab. However, it's more like a fudge brownie.....lighter in color on the outside and darker in the middle. You can make easier repairs and match colors better if you use broadcast colors.\nWhat types of existing concrete surfaces can be overlayed?\n*There are some limitations to what you can resurface. If you have a driveway, don't even consider overlays because you can demolish and replace your driveway cheaper with ACDI than you can overlay. Patios, thick concrete entries, interior concrete floors and walkways are much better candidates for overlays. We only recommend stamp overlays for exterior concrete because most smooth applied overlays which are stained offer far less customer satisfaction. Stamp overlays can be very appealing but we always recommend you get a removal and replace cost before settling for an overlay. Some concrete slabs that have too many cracks or have settled at different elevations cost more to patch and repair than to replace and re-pour. So consider the alternatives. In some cases, removing concrete is too difficult because it may damage a pool or is installed on a steep incline. These are excellent candidates for stamp concrete overlays. Overlays can be as thin as 1/4\" thick making it easy to meet door elevations. Interior overlays can be stained and polished creating an excellent wearing surface that requires no wax or maintenance. In fact, you can install interior self leveling overlays onto wood sub-floors at 1/2\" thickness with minimal cracking, if any. ACDI's stamp overlay product is made of 100% color hardener and mixed with a polymer binder which makes the thin coating extremely flexible. We use the same color hardener in stamp overlays as we do when installing actual stamp concrete slabs. Color hardeners are a mixture of high strength cement, silia sands and pigments that are used to densify concrete surfaces.\nDo we have to hire ACDI to re-seal our concrete?\n*The answer is no. Sealing concrete doesn't take a scientist. In fact, most of our past client's re-seal their concrete on their own with little assistance from ACDI. The trick is making sure it's not going to rain, it's not under 50 degrees, the slab is clean and dry, and the temperature isn't hot outside (over 80 degrees). The same principles in painting work in re-sealing your concrete. If you purchase a 3-gallon Chapin concrete sprayer, you'll make sealing much faster and easier. Pour the sealer (roughly $100.00 for 5-gallon pale) into the sprayer (sprayer costs about $90.00), tighten the lid and pump up the can until the handle won't move. Lock down the handle and pull down the trigger on the sprayer wand which releases out sealer in a fine mist. Keep your sealer thin and use multiple coats. If you apply a heavier coat, you'll need to backroll the sealer in order to spread it over the concrete surface. Depending upon how porous the surface of the concrete is you may need more than (2) coats. Always check the weather forecasts in search of good weather. Never seal a dirty slab - you need to powerwash the surface before you apply sealer. Make sure its bone dry before applying. Contact local concrete stores (usually owned by concrete suppliers), such as Cadman Building Materials (Redmond, WA), about solvent based acrylic sealers they offer. Do not buy from Home Depot or any large hardware stores because their sealers are lower in quality and more difficult to apply. Always wear respirators graded for use with solvents.\nHow long can I expect for a typical patio or driveway installation?\n*It depends upon the scope of work and the size of the project. A bigger determining factor is the weather. If the weather cooperates, installations can be swift and scheduling is precise. However, all scheduling and start dates vary most of the time due to rain forecasts or temperatures (hot or cold). One of the most frustrating parts of our industry is how the weather affects our scheduling because we are at the mercy of Mother Nature. All scheduling is taken on a day-by-day basis because it constantly changes due to weather patterns. Concrete is destroyed by excess water creating major strength losses and damage which may require removal. Also, when temperatures become too cold it can freeze the dirt under the slab causing it to sink once the dirt thaws. If it's too hot, you risk concrete setting up faster than you can pour reducing finishing quality and increasing the speed of shrinking causing excessive cracking. Most patios and driveways can take a week or more but all scheduled projects are affected by weather - good or bad.\nWhat are concrete pumps?\n*There are (2) different typed of concrete pumps used by ACDI: 1) line pumps 2) boom pumps. Both transport the concrete from the truck to the installation site. Line pumps require hoses to be placed on the ground piece-by-piece and get connected running from the pump truck to the site. Usually, line pumps are cheaper than boom pumps but require more work to connect and disconnect the pieces of hose. You start at the farthest point of the concrete pour and disconnect the pieces of hose as you work towards the truck. Boom pumps are much larger and require more space to operate. They are the most expensive concrete pumps you can get and vary in size. The hose is permanently connected to the truck and the metal arm unfolds with the assistance of the operator. Power lines are definitely something to consider when ordering a boom pump. Boom pumps make it much easier to place concrete because there's no need for disconnecting any hose. However, sometimes the size of the truck cannot fit into small alleyways. Most patios require concrete pumps which allow ACDI to place the concrete within the forms without wearing out the concrete finishers. You can save money using good old wheelbarrows but you have to weigh the cost of the pump vs. the cost of tiring out workers. Pricing can vary because jobs are different sizes.\nWhat is sandblasting?\n*Sandblasting is typically used to expose the fine sands in the surface of the concrete. In some instances, it's used to remove existing sealers, paints and drywall from exterior slabs. The popularity of sandblasting is growing because it leaves new concrete with a timeworn effect resembling the surface of a \"sugarcube.\" It also mellows out brighter colors by exposing various gray sands and evens out blotchy slabs which can happen with colored concrete. It's an aged concrete effect that's being demanded by many consumers.\nArtistic Concrete Design, Inc.\nOffice / Fax: (425) 488-8184\nEstimating: (206) 390-4664","Understanding P and R Slip Rating in Epoxy Floor Coating\nUnderstanding P and R Slip Rating in Epoxy Floor Coating\nEpoxy resin flooring stands out from other flooring solutions for numerous reasons when it comes to picking new flooring systems for industrial usage, garage floor coating or any other outdoor surfaces. Epoxy flooring, also known as resinous flooring, is a versatile, long-lasting, environmentally friendly and aesthetic option for any surface. Epoxy flooring is appealing because of its resilience to high levels of wear and tear, making it one of the longest lasting flooring solutions.\nSafety of Flooring Solutions\nAdults walk 3 to 4 kilometres each day on average, taking approximately 6-8,000 individual steps. That’s nearly 2,750,000 individual steps in a year. With that many steps, most adults should be very skilled at walking, yet hundreds of individuals slip, trip, and fall every day, with some suffering serious injuries. People don’t plan on slipping or tripping and falling in public. Building owners do not anticipate consumers sliding, stumbling and falling when visiting their establishment. Every fall, trip and slip accident have a tale to tell and there are a lot of similar variables. One of them is the type of flooring solution used and the variable of slip resistance.\nWhat is Slip resistance?\nThe relative force that prevents the shoe or foot from sliding over the pathway surface is known as slip resistance. Slip resistance is determined by several elements, including the surface of the pathway, the bottom of the footwear and the presence of foreign objects between them. In this article, we will talk about the slip resistance rating of epoxy floors.\nWhat is the P rating in epoxy floor coating?\nWhen the flooring is moist, the P3 grade implies a moderate danger of sliding. This slip rating indicates that the product may be used on stairs without adding additional traction. P2 is the industry standard and signifies a high danger of sliding on damp flooring. A Pendulum Friction Tester and a rubber slider are used in the Wet Pendulum Test. The rubber slider material of the revised Standard has been changed to better simulate a worn and polished heel. This means that achieving greater levels of slip resistance in the test is more difficult than in prior editions of the Standard.\nWhat is the R rating in epoxy floor coating?\nSo, what precisely is an ‘R Rating’ on the floor? Architects, floor specifiers, builders and you may use the R9 to R13 Rating for Shod Feet (and an ABC Rating for Bare Feet) to measure the slip resistance of a surface before purchasing flooring. These R ratings refer to the non portable DIN Standard* Floor RAMP Test (the ‘R’ in Ramp Test). The Ramp Test involves attaching a certain floor type to a ramp and applying oil (For Shod Feet) to the ramp. The ramp is then elevated and the human test subject goes backwards and forward in little increments until they slide on the floor while wearing boots.\nHow Important is P and R rating in Epoxy Floor Coating?\nStandards Australia HB 197:1999 provides guidance for these, which has been recommended since 1999. A variable angle ramp walking test is used to rate the slip resistance of flooring, which ranges from R9 (low slip resistance) to R13 (high slip resistance). When determining the degree of slip resistance required, there is a trade off to be made. Cleaning your epoxy floor system becomes more difficult as it becomes more slip resistant, yet your floor is not slippery. Your floor becomes easier to clean as the slip resistance is reduced. For some applications, a less aggressive slip resistance with a higher emphasis on cleanability is required. The more aggressive the floor’s slide resistance, the more difficult it is to clean. This is due to the bigger and more angular aggregate that is disseminated onto the coating of an aggressive slip resistant component. The more angular the floor surface’s profile, the more difficult it is to clean. When a more extreme slide resistance, such as R12, is required, problems arise cleaning equipment, such as a mop, will be ripped to bits.\nIn an epoxy floor system, there are three approaches to regulate slip resistance:\n# 1 Rate of topcoat coverage\n# 2 Aggregate is added to the epoxy resin\n# 3 The natural finish of the topcoats\nAggregates, in general, are varied sizes and forms of oxide or silica sand; topcoat finish is the natural floor finish without aggregate, and rate of material coverage is computed by square metre per litre attained during application.\nIn locations where there is a lot of foot activity, you should choose slip resistant paint. In most cases, floor treatments are performed when the hard surfaces become slick when wet. To provide appropriate slide resistance in both dry and wet conditions, the use of epoxy flooring is highly recommended.\nHow does Epoxy Flooring Compare to other Flooring Solutions?\nEpoxy flooring, particularly epoxy mortar and flake epoxy floors, is meant to minimise sliding and skidding. Most varieties of epoxy flooring are anti slip, as mentioned in the previous section. Epoxy mortar and flake epoxy flooring are the ones that resist slippage the best. If you maintain the floor sufficiently dry, you should be able to walk back and forth without losing your balance or slipping all day. Epoxy flooring is a form of flooring that is commonly used in garages and other outdoor areas. Although many types of epoxy flooring are anti slip, if they are wet with water or oil, it is still possible to slip and fall. You may walk on your epoxy flooring safely any day by strategically installing synthetic mats and runners or purchasing a big containment mat.\nEpoxy flooring is less slick and more resistant to skidding than other smooth flooring materials. Epoxy coatings are also available with slip resistant versions, making them an excellent alternative for areas where slips and falls are a concern."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1ae8e52e-20d2-4612-9158-eb959d4c8611>","<urn:uuid:c8544c02-4ece-4195-9050-9d309f12cb8e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching historical palaces - could you compare the Royal Palace of Caserta and Peterhof's construction timelines and their respective roles during World War II?","answer":"The Royal Palace of Caserta's construction began in 1752 under Charles VII of Naples and was completed in 1780 by Carlo Vanvitelli after his father's death. During World War II, it served as a rest center for US Fifth Army soldiers and was the site of the German forces' unconditional surrender in Italy in April 1945, covering 600,000-900,000 soldiers. In contrast, Peterhof's construction started earlier in 1714 and was officially opened in 1723, though work continued for many years. During World War II, Peterhof faced a different fate - it was occupied by German troops who left it in ruins, and its reconstruction took over 60 years to complete.","context":["For your Business Stay choose the Hotel Olimpico\nSouth Coast of Salerno,\nLago Trasimeno street\nSalerno - Italy\nPh. +39 089 203 004\nFax.+39 089 203 458\n» Click and headd your phone number, (mobile phone included).

It was the largest palace and one of the largest buildings erected in Europe during the 18th century. In 1997, the Palace was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, described in its nomination as \"the swan song of the spectacular art of the Baroque, from which it adopted all the features needed to create the illusions of multidirectional space\".\nThe construction of the palace was begun in 1752 for Charles VII of Naples, who worked closely with his architect Luigi Vanvitelli. When Charles saw Vanvitelli's grandly-scaled model for Caserta it filled him with emotion \"fit to tear his heart from his breast\". In the end, he never slept a night at the Reggia, as he abdicated in 1759 to become King of Spain, and the project was carried to completion for his third son and successor, Ferdinand IV of Naples.\nThe political and social model for Vanvitelli's palace was Versailles, which, though it is strikingly different in its variety and disposition, solves similar problems of assembling and providing for king, court and government in a massive building with the social structure of a small city, confronting a baroque view of a highly subordinated nature, la nature forcée. The Royal Palace of Madrid, where Charles had grown up, which had been devised by Filippo Juvarra for Charles' father, Philip V of Spain, and Charlottenburg Palace provided models. A spacious octagonal vestibule seems to have been inspired by Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute in Venice, while the palatine chapel is most often compared to Robert de Cotte's royal chapel at Versailles.\nThe king's primary object was to have a magnificent new royal court and administrative center for the Kingdom in a location protected from sea attack.\nVanvitelli died in 1773: the construction was continued by his son Carlo and finished in 1780.\nThe palace has some 1,200 rooms, including two dozen state apartments, a large library, and a theatre modelled after the Teatro San Carlo of Naples.\nMain façade of the palace.\nThe Honour Grand Staircase.\nThe throne room.\nThe Diana and Actaeon Fountain at the feet of the Grand Cascade.\nThe population of Caserta Vecchia was moved 10 kilometers to provide a work force closer to the palace. A silk manufactory at San Leucio resort was disguised as a pavilion in the immense parkland.\nA monumental avenue that would run 20 kilometers between the Palace and Naples was planned but never realized.\nIn April 1945 the palace was the site of the signing of terms of the unconditional German surrender of forces in Italy. The agreement covered between 600,000 and 900,000 soldiers along the Italian Front including troops in sections of Austria.\nThe palace has a rectangular plan, measuring 247 x 184 m. The four sides are connected by two orthogonal arms, forming four inner courts, each measuring more than 3,800 m2 (40,903 sq ft).\nBehind the facades of its matching segmental ranges of outbuildings that flank the giant forecourt, a jumble of buildings arose to facilitate daily business. In the left hand arc was built as barracks. Here, later, during World War II the soldiers of the US Fifth Army recovered in a \"rest centre\".\nOf all the royal residences inspired by the Palace of Versailles, the Reggia of Caserta is the one that bears the greatest resemblance to the original model: the unbroken balustraded skyline, the slight break provided by pavilions within the long, somewhat monotonous facade. As at Versailles, a large aqueduct was required to bring water for the prodigious water displays. Like its French predecessor, the palace was intended to display the power and grandeur of an absolute Bourbon monarchy. A solecism at Caserta is that above the piano reale, the King's floor, is another floor of equal magnificence. The enfilades of Late Baroque saloni were the heart and seat of government, as well as displays of national wealth. Caserta provided a royal refuge from the dust and factions of the capital, just as Versailles had freed Louis XIV from Paris. The inland location was more defensible than the old Royal Palace in Naples, which fronted the Bay of Naples and hence was vulnerable to attack from the sea. To provide the King with suitable protection, troop barracks were housed within the palace.\nThe wide central entrance carriageway has, today, been incorporated into the city's automobile circulation.\n The park\nThe garden, a typical example of the baroque extension of formal vistas, stretch for 120 ha, partly on hilly terrain. It is inspired by the park of Versailles, but it is commonly regarded as superior in beauty. The park starts from the back façade of the palace, flanking a long alley with artificial fountains and cascades. There is a botanical garden, called \"The English Garden,\" in the upper part designed in the 1780s by Carlo Vanvitelli and the London-trained plantsman-designer John Graefer, recommended to Sir William Hamilton by Sir Joseph Banks. It is an early Continental example of an \"English garden\" in the svelte naturalistic taste of Capability Brown.\nThe fountains and cascades, each filling a vasca (\"basin\"), with architecture and hydraulics by Luigi Vanvitelli at intervals along a wide straight canal that runs to the horizon, rivalled those at Peterhof outside St. Petersburg. These include:\nThe Fountain of Diana and Actaeon (sculptures by Paolo Persico, Brunelli, Pietro Solari);\nThe Fountain of Venus and Adonis (1770–80);\nThe Fountain of the Dolphins (1773–80);\nThe Fountain of Aeolus;\nThe Fountain of Ceres.\nA large population of figures from classical Antiquity were modelled by Gaetano Salomone for the gardens of the Reggia, and executed by large workshops.","A symbol of St. Petersburg, a UNESCO World Heritage site and an absolute must-see for tourists - Peterhof, also known as \"the capital of fountains\", is reason enough to go to Russia and admire its unique fountains and palaces. The palace and park at Peterhof (also known as Petrodvorets) are often referred to as \"the Russian Versaille\", although many visitors conclude that the comparison does a disservice to the grandeur and scope of this majestic estate. Versailles was, however, the inspiration for Peter the Great's desire to build an imperial palace in the suburbs of his new city and, after an aborted attempt at Strelna, Peterhof - which means \"Peter's Court\" in German - became the site for the Tsar's Monplaisir Palace, and then of the original Grand Palace. The estate was equally popular with Peter's granddaughter, Empress Elizabeth, who ordered the expansion of the Grand Palace and greatly extended the park and the famous system of fountains, including the truly spectacular Grand Cascade. Improvements to the park continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Catherine the Great, after leaving her own mark on the park, moved the court to Pushkin, but Peterhof once again became the official Imperial Residence in the reign of Nicholas I, who ordered the building of the Cottage Palace in 1826. Peterhof combines several ornate palaces, a number of beautifully landscaped parks and a dazzling array of magnificent statues and fountains. The Great Peterhof Palace is one of the most beautiful palaces in Europe and one of the greatest monuments of the 18th century. It is an immensely luxurious royal estate, lying on the shore of the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea). No visit to St. Petersburg would be complete without a visit to this amazing and unique place.\nPeterhof was built in the early 18th century by tsar Peter the Great as a magnificent palace and park complex meant to rival France's Versailles. On an estate that covers more than six hundred hectares, Peter and his successors built some thirty palaces and pavilions in a mesmerizing display of wealth and power. Peterhof is situated some 25 km (16mi) west of St. Petersburg and can be reached with a hydrofoil that brings you here from the quay in front of the Hermitage.\nShortly after founding St. Petersburg in 1703, Peter the Great planned to build a country residence fitting for a ruler of his stature. But before he could start realizing his ambitions he had to secure the safety of St. Petersburg which was threatened by the Northern War of 1700-1721, during which Russia battled for supremacy over the Statues along the Grand Cascade at Peterhof in St. Petersburg Statues, Grand Cascade Baltic region with Sweden.\nDuring the war, Peter the Great regularly traveled to a remote place near the Gulf of Finland from where he could watch over the construction of fortifications in Kronstadt, on an island he had just conquered from Sweden. To reduce commuting time, his wife Catherine suggested building a small cottage, where he could reside during summertime. The cottage, built in 1705, made Peter the Great realize the site was ideal for the construction of a grand country residence.\nIntersting fact: All of the Peterhof fountains operate without the use of pumps, water is supplied from natural springs.\nAfter Russia's victory over the Swedish army in 1709 at Poltova and the naval victory at Gangut in 1714, the threat of a Swedish invasion had subsided and Peter started assembling a group of architects, engineers, landscape gardeners View of the Grand Canal towards the Gulf of Finland, Peterhof Grand Canal and artists to create his summer residence, Peterhof. Peter himself had already made a rough draft of his ambitious plans, which consisted of a centrally located palace surrounded by a large park dotted with numerous fountains, statues and cascades. After his visit to Versailles in 1717 his plans became even more grandiose.\nConstruction started in earnest in 1714 when thousands of workers, including soldiers and serfs were brought in so that the park and palaces could be created in a short timeframe. Building materials, decorations and plants - mostly from Western Europe - were transported over water and a grand canal was The Lower Park near the Marly Palace at Peterhof, Russia Lower Park dug between the main palace and the sea. The main palace was completed first, in 1721. Two years later, on August 14, 1723, Peterhof officially opened. Work would continue for many years on decorations and several smaller palaces on the estate. Peterhof became the favorite residence of the tsars, several of whom expanded and renovated the main palace.\nDuring the siege of the city during World War II, The Great Palace, Peterhof Great Palace Peterhof was occupied by German troops who left it in ruins. Reconstruction of the park and palaces lasted for more than 60 years.\nBaroque interiors of the 'room with harp' in the Grand Palace of Peterhof.\nThe main palace in Peterhof - also dubbed the Great Palace - was built between 1714 and 1721 after a design by architect Jean-Baptiste le Blond who followed Peter the Great's initial drafts that showed a large, two storeyed villa with two wings perched on top of a hill. During the reign of Empress Elisabeth, daughter of Peter the Great, the palace Chapel at Peterhof, St. Petersburg Palace Church was significantly altered and expanded by the Italian architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, who added an additional floor, a new palace wing and a small domed church. The interior was remodeled in a baroque style, although Peter the Great's study room was left intact.\nThe Palace was further embellished during the reign of Catherine the Great, when Yury Felten redecorated Throne Room - the largest room in the Great Palace at 300 sq m. The room is part of a series of opulent state rooms which can be reached via the magnificent ceremonial staircase, Ceiling above the Great Staircase, Great Palace, Peterhof Ceiling painting, Ceremonial Staircase created by Rastrelli and decorated with gilded statues. The adjacent Chesma Hall is embellished with wall paintings depicting the naval battle of Chesma between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. At the center of the palace is the Picture Hall - named for the portraits that hang on the wall of this large hall. The hall leads to the other wing of the palace where the spacious and airy Ballroom is the most magnificent. The windows and mirrors on either side of the room create the illusion of an even larger hall. Other notable rooms in the palace include the baroque Audience Hall, the blue Drawing Room, the white Dining Room, two Chinese study rooms and the original study room of Peter I.\nThe domain of Peterhof is divided into three separate parks; it includes the upper park, lower park and the Alexandriapark. Grand Cascade, Peterhof, St. Petersburg Grand Cascade The lower park is the most crowded due to its many attractions including the Grand Cascade, the Grand Canal, several small palaces and numerous fountains and sculptures. The fountains in particular are magnificent and attract throngs of visitors. The upper park is more formally laid out with flower beds arranged around large basins. The main highlight here is the Neptune Fountain. The Alexandria Park is the most romantic of the three and also the least crowded due to its remote location.\nThe star feature of Peterhof is the magnificent Grand Cascade, completed in 1724 as the centerpiece of the waterworks plan, which was created after Peter the Great witnessed the Grand Canal and fountains of the Versailles Palace. Samson Fountain, Grand Cascade, Peterhof Samson Fountain The plan consisted of a large cascade which runs from the foot of the Great Palace to a long canal that leads to the Gulf of Finland. Numerous other elaborate fountains were incorporated into the plan. Water was supplied by a natural spring nearby.\nAt the center of the famous Grand Cascade is the Samson Fountain, which shows the biblical hero Samson opening the jaws of a lion. The statue symbolized Russia's victory over Sweden at Poltava. The cascade alone is decorated with 39 gilded bronze statues and 75 fountains. On a terrace at the top of the cascade - which offers great views towards the sea - are a pair of Tritons and an array of gilded sculptures depicting ancient heroes adorn the 17 steps that lead to the Grand Canal. Marly Palace, Peterhof Marly Palace Bas-reliefs on the fronts of the steps further glorify the victorious Russian nation.\nSeveral subsidiary palaces were built throughout the park, with a distance of 3km (2mi) separating the Marly Palace at the western end of the park with the Cottage Palace at the eastern end. Marly Palace was built in 1720-1724 to accommodate important guests of Peter the Great. The palace has its own cascade, the Golden Hill Cascade. Dragon Waterfall, Peterhof, St. Petersburg Dragon Waterfall While not as monumental in ornamentation as the Grand Cascade, it is an aesthetically pleasing cascade flanked by a series of marble statues. Nearby is the Hermitage Pavilion, a small building with a white colored facade that was built in 1721-1725 near the waterfront.\nFurther along the waterfront stands the Monplaisir Palace, at the center of a small park that is divided into six differently themed gardens, including a Chinese garden and a labyrinth. This delightful palace is the oldest in the lower park, completed in 1723. The dragon waterfall nearby is named after the three statues of dragons that spout water onto a checkerboard patterned sloping plane.\nMore towards the Grand Palace is the Orangery, built to protect plants and flowers from inclement weather. Roman Fountain, Peterhof Roman Fountain In front of the Orangery stands the Triton Fountain and to the east are a couple of 18th century marble fountains known as the Roman Fountains.\nFurther east towards the Cottage Palace one can see the imposing contours of the Royal Stables, which seems out of place here with its Tudoresque style. At the park's eastern end, in the English styled Alexandria park, stands the even more curiously looking Cottage Palace. It was built in the early 19th century for tsar Nicholas I and his wife Alexandria, after whom the park was named. The Cottage was designed in an English Gothic style by the Scottish architect Adam Menelaws."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:21768f5c-7d6a-4b1b-85b6-a6b7309f0d6d>","<urn:uuid:6ef992cc-af67-4e48-b611-64eab714e3cf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do ozone generation methods work in industrial settings, and what are the implications of elevated surface ozone for air quality standards in India?","answer":"Industrially, ozone is produced through two main methods: using short wavelength ultraviolet radiations from mercury vapor lamps, or through cold discharge (corona discharge) using high electrical fields between two metal plates separated by air and an electrical insulator. For air quality in India, the ambient standards for surface ozone are set at 180 μg/m3 (92 ppbv) for 1-hour average and 100 μg/m3 (51 ppbv) for 8-hour average. Elevated surface ozone levels can cause serious health effects including persistent decrease in lung function, pneumonia, influenza, asthma, and can also decrease crop yields. Recent studies indicate that surface ozone levels have increased significantly in some Indian cities, with even concentrations below the ambient air quality standards potentially causing harmful effects in humans.","context":["RODO® – A UNIQUE AND PATENTED PROCESS\nIn order to control the proliferation of the ferrous-based ochre leading to expensive problems for our homes, “Solution Ocre Ferreux®” developed a unique and patented process called RODO®\nThis process consists of 4 stages :\n- Rinsing: We proceed with a very high-pressure rinsing of the drainage conduit, the backwater valve and the conduit connecting the home to the municipality.

This stage is important and is focused on the contact time between the oxidizing solution and the bacteria.\n- Ozoflotation: The ozoflotation is in fact the conglomeration in non-harmful flakes of the bacteria in suspension rendered inert by the oxidation and disinfection stages. The conglomerated flakes are evacuated from the circulation of water in the ground surrounding the drain and inside the drain, up to the evacuation conduit connected to the municipality. This last stage completes the cleaning following the previous stages of oxidation and disinfection.\nHOW DO WE GENERATE THE OZONE?\nWHAT IS THE OZONE?\nThe ozone is a chemical compound containing 3 atoms of oxygen (O3). Its structure is a resonance between three states. Metastable to ambiant conditions, tends to decompose naturally into dioxygen. At room temperature, it is a pale blue gaz. It liquefies at -111,9 °C in the form of a particularly unstable dark blue liquid and solidifies at -192,5 °C.\nContrary to the odourless dioxygen, the ozone is preceived by the human sense of smell; its smell is very characteristic, slightly pungent. It is toxic when inhaled in large quantities.\nThe ozone was first discovered in 1781 by Martin Von Marum, then the molecule was isolated in 1839 by the Swiss chemist Christian Friedrich Shonbein. He so called it by referring to the Greek root ozein (exhale a smell, to smell).\nTHE VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL USES OF THE OZONE\nAt the industrial scale, the ozone is produced using short wavelengths ultraviolet radiations emitted by a mercury vapour lamp or by a process of cold discharge (corona discharge) which uses a high electrical field. The discharge device is constituted by two metal plates separated by a layer of air and an electrical insulator of high dielectric constant. A high bias voltage is applied between the two plates, which entails the dissociation of the molecules of oxygen from the layer of air and their recombination in ozone. The ozone is an oxidizer and a powerful disinfectant. It presents certain advantages in comparison to other oxidizers usually used in the industry.\nPURIFICATION OF DRINKING WATER\nThe ozone presents a series of advantages with respects to the chlorine used for water treatment, which explains its use in spite of the often significant cost of a water ozonization installation. These advantages are as follows:\n- It does not remain present in the water;\n- It does not provoke the appearance of organochlorinated products, which can be carcinogenic;\n- It does not leave a bad taste unappreciated from consumers of drinking water\nBut it leaves a minimal blue tint to the water.\nThe ozone is used in the treatment of water for several functions :\n- Iron oxidation;\n- Performance improvement of sand filters;\n- Improvement of the flocculation (called ozoflotation);\n- Disinfection of the water;\n- Elimination of harmful organic compound, in particular pesticides and herbicides. For this application the ozone is generally injected upstream of an active coal-based filter.\nThis application is highly prevalent in Anglo-Saxon countries and less in continental Europe. The ozone is essentially used for the washing of white linen in commercial installations.\nThe ozone is used in the food-processing industry for two very different applications :\n- The ozonization of cold rooms;\n- The washing of food products in ozonated water.\nThe wafers intended for the manufacturing of integrated circuits are washed with ozonated water with the objective to eliminate potential traces of organic matter.","Research Article | Open Access\nInfluence of Stratospheric Intrusion on the Surface Ozone Levels in India\nThe surface ozone levels in some Indian cities have increased significantly in the recent years. Ozone being toxic to the living system and an important contributor to anthropogenic global warming, enhanced surface ozone may have adverse effects on the air quality and climate. Transport of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere causes stratospheric ozone to decrease and tropospheric ozone to increase, which can in turn have serious consequences for life on earth. Since stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) is an important factor influencing the ozone concentration in the troposphere, this paper investigates probably for the first time the possible contribution of STE events to the observed enhanced surface ozone levels for cities covering from north to south of India. It is concluded that apart from transport processes and in situ photochemical production, STE also influences the observed high-surface ozone levels in Indian cities to a small extent (8%–16%). STE events producing high-surface ozone levels are found to be higher at high latitudes.\nThe amount of surface ozone at any location depends upon the amount of its supply from the stratosphere, rate of photochemical production, transport from other regions, and the rate of its destruction on the earth’s surface either due to dry deposition or photochemical loss mechanisms [1–3]. Downward transport of stratospheric ozone [4, 5], called stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone is an important and significant natural source of surface ozone. The mechanisms leading to STE are tropopause folds, cutoff lows, and quasiadiabatic transports along isentropic surfaces [5, 6]. Ozone being toxic to the living system, intense exposure to surface ozone may result in persistent decrease in lung function, pneumonia, influenza, asthma, and decrease in crop yield. Transport of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere may cause surface ozone levels to increase resulting in adverse consequences for life on earth. The ambient air quality standards for surface ozone in India are 180 g/m3 (92 ppbv) for 1-hour average and 100 μg/m3 (51 ppbv) for 8-hour average .\nIt has been observed in the recent years that the background surface ozone levels have increased significantly in some Indian cities [8, 9]. Several studies suggest that rapid and deep STE events may be associated with severe weather [10–12] and cause ozone peaks at the surface [13, 14]. When compared with high-surface ozone episodes induced photo chemically near the Earth's surface, relatively little study has been reported for high-surface ozone cases induced by STE in India. Although these episodes are relatively uncommon, they have been reported to produce transient peak ozone concentrations of around 100 ppbv at sea level and concentrations in excess of 250 ppbv in mountain regions  in other parts of the world. In view of the above observations, this paper is aimed to identify the Indian cities where the surface ozone is likely to be affected by STE by examining all the case studies in detail over a period of 11 years from 1998–2008.\n2. Measurement Site and Data\nThe Indian subcontinent lies between 8°N–36°N latitude. The five surface ozone monitoring stations, namely, New Delhi (28.4°N, 77.13°E; 214.42 meters above sea level), Nagpur (21°N, 79°E; 310 meters above sea level), Pune (18.5°N, 73.5°E; 560 meters above sea level), Kodaikanal (10°N, 77.5°E; 2,133meters above sea level), and Thiruvananthapuram (8.28°N, 76.56°E; 60meters above sea level) extending from North to South India (Figure 1), have entirely different geographical morphology and hence different local climatic conditions. The topographic map of India depicting the measurement sites was obtained from the website: http://www.mapsindia.com/. The daily maximum surface ozone at New Delhi, Pune, Kodaikanal, and Thiruvananthapuram over the period from 1998–2008 and at Nagpur during the period from 2005–2007 measured by electrochemical method have been obtained from India Meteorological Department (IMD). 5-day back-trajectory at different pressure levels and potential vorticity at the tropopause (100 hPa) has been retrieved from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The vertical pressure velocity, relative humidity, and geopotential height maps have been retrieved from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis . Daily global gridded data of surface carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) were obtained from TES (Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer) on NASA’s EOS (Earth Observing System) spacecraft. Total Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column data from Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) was obtained from the website http://www.temis.nl/. Fire count data representing biomass burning from the ATSR World Fire Atlas has been taken from Ionia products of European Space Agency.\n3. Analysis and Results\nThe day characterized by maximum surface ozone concentration in each month was identified and the linear trend of this monthly maximum surface ozone data was plotted for the entire period of available data set. The surface ozone levels at Pune and Thiruvananthapuram indicated a small decreasing trend, while that at New Delhi, Nagpur, and Kodaikanal indicated a small increasing trend (Figure 2) over the period of study. Several studies in the recent years indicate that surface ozone, even at concentrations less than the ambient air quality standards, can flare harmful effects in human beings [17, 18]. Therefore instead of considering ozone episodes greater than the ambient air quality standard as critical, higher than normal ozone episodes were identified by employing the statistic mean control chart (MCC), and the causes leading to these episodes were investigated in detail.\nMCC is a time plot of observations with a statistically calculated control limit. If the variations in surface ozone follow a normal cyclic pattern throughout the year (due to seasonal changes), then all the points in the time plot should lie within the control limit. When an observation exceeds the upper control limit (UCL), some new and unanticipated source of variation (either natural or anthropogenic) is likely to be operating, and a search for the special cause should be initiated. The UCL for surface ozone at different Indian stations has been estimated statistically  from the MCC by using the monthly maximum surface ozone data for the entire period of available data set. The results are summarized in Table 1: where is the yearly mean surface ozone for months of the kth year. Range = (Maximum ozone—Minimum ozone) observed for the kth year. , 11 (years from 1998–2008 for New Delhi, Pune, Kodaikanal, and Thiruvananthapuram) and (years from 2005–2007 for Nagpur)\nThe value of constant corresponding to is 0.266 and is obtained from standard statistical control table . The days characterized by surface ozone concentration higher than UCL was identified from the monthly maximum surface ozone dataset for each station (Figure 3), and the possible association of this unusually high surface ozone concentration with STE was investigated. Potential vorticity (PV) is a measure of the spin of air. Stratospheric air is characterized by high PV and low relative humidity (RH). According to the WMO definition of dynamical tropopause , PV values exceeding 1.6 pvu (1 pvu = 10−6 m2 Kkg−1 s−1) at the tropopause indicate the presence of air masses having stratospheric origin. Therefore, the presence of air masses characterized by and has been considered as a signature of stratospheric air similar to that in the study by Cristofanelli et al. . To identify and exclude air masses possibly influenced by polluted air or biomass burning plumes, the CO, CH4, and NO2 concentration and fire counts were taken into account. The 5-day back-trajectories at 1000, 925, and 850 hPa pressure levels were examined to determine the place from where the air parcels had originated. This information was in turn used to check the possibility of horizontal transport of ozone and its precursors from these areas. The vertical pressure velocity (Pa s−1) was examined to confirm the downward transport of ozone from the stratosphere. As pressure decreases with altitude, positive values of vertical pressure velocity indicate sinking motion and negative values indicate rising motion in the atmosphere. The days characterized by higher than normal concentration of CO, CH4, NO2, and fire counts, vertical pressure velocity indicating upward transport of ozone and back trajectories from high ozone or ozone precursor areas were excluded from this study. Further, the geopotential maps in the upper troposphere were examined to detect the formation of cutoff lows. The total ozone concentration was examined for ±10 days from the day of STE event to investigate if the increase in surface ozone was due to tropopause folding.\nOne such case study at Pune on 24 November, 2006 is presented as an illustration (Figure 4). The geopotential height map at 850 hPa pressure level indicates the formation of a trough, which is typically preceded by stormy weather and colder air at the surface. The vertical pressure velocity at the tropopause indicated downward transport of ozone from the stratosphere. The PV value was >1.6 and RH at the tropopause were low (20%), indicating the presence of air masses having stratospheric origin. The fire counts representing biomass burning were absent at all places lying in and around the station under consideration and along the path of back trajectories. Similar results were observed on all high ozone days at all stations considered in the study. These characteristic features suggest that the enhanced surface ozone observed on these occasions may be a consequence of stratospheric intrusion.\nMultiple regression analysis (Figure 5) was used to determine the amount of dependence of STE events producing high-surface ozone levels on the order of latitude. A regression equation indicates the nature of the relationship between the variables and, in particular, the extent to which the variables are associated with one another. The regression equation and the respective correlation coefficients are noted in the plot. The coefficient of determination “” was found to be 0.8216, indicating that STE events producing high-surface ozone levels depend by an amount of 82.16% on the order of the Latitude. This is because deep STE events of ozone occur more frequently at high latitudes  compared to low Indian latitudes. Between October and May, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) is located to the south of Thiruvananthapuram . The vertical velocity profiles exhibit a strong ascending motion over the mean position of the ITCZ, and a strong subsidence between 10°N–30°N latitudes [24, 25], thus affecting the STE processes over India. It appears from Figure 5 that STE events influencing the high surface ozone levels in India decrease exponentially with increase in altitude. However, this may be because all the measurement stations having high altitude, which have been considered in this study, lie at low latitudes where deep STE of ozone is not very prominent.\nThis paper investigates the possible contribution of STE events to the observed higher than normal surface ozone levels for few Indian cities. It is concluded that apart from transport processes and in situ photochemical production, STE also influences the observed high-surface ozone levels in Indian cities to a small extent (8%–16%). STE events producing high-surface ozone levels are found to be higher at high latitudes.\nThe surface ozone data for Indian cities were obtained from the India Meteorological Department.

{"question":"¿Cuáles son los efectos metabólicos de la lactancia materna en la madre y qué requerimientos nutricionales específicos tienen las mujeres lactantes?","answer":"The metabolic effects of breastfeeding include a high energy expenditure of around 500 calories per day for milk production, which is even more than during pregnancy. This energy expenditure, combined with physical activity, can affect the mother's fertility through lactational amenorrhea when energy output exceeds energy input. Regarding nutritional requirements, breastfeeding mothers need approximately 330 additional calories daily above their baseline needs, accounting for some energy being supplied by weight loss (170 kcal/day). They require adequate calcium (1000-1300mg daily), vitamin D (600 IU), and omega-3 fatty acids (200-300mg daily). A well-balanced diet including fruits, vegetables, protein, grains, and limited fat is recommended, sometimes with a multivitamin supplement. Fluid intake should be guided by thirst, ensuring adequate hydration for milk production of 750-800mL per day.","context":["For many breastfeeding moms, lactational amenorrhea is a pretty darn nice perk. With my firstborn, I was one of the lucky ones—I went an entire year after my baby was born without getting a period thanks to breastfeeding. It would be an understatement to say I was delighted the entire time. In fact, I seriously considered adding in some extra pumping after year 1 just to keep that lovely little side effect.\nSecond baby, I was excitedly anticipating another 2 years period free—yippee!!! So imagine my surprise when at 7 and a half months postpartum, my period returned. I was supposed to get a full year—just like last time!\nNow, as I understood lactational amenorrhea theory at the time, the loss of fertility during lactation was due to the frequency of suckling or nursing intensity. According to this theory, the more often you feed the baby, the less likely you are to ovulate.1-2 While this makes sense in many cases, in my own experience it didn’t add up. As I was often home with him, I nursed my second baby much more often than I nursed my first (I was working full time and pumping), but my periods returned more than 5 months sooner.\nWhile researching lactational amenorrhea for a review article with colleagues, I came across a study with an alternate theory called the metabolic load hypothesis. Valeggia and Ellison found that in a group of Toba women in Argentina who had high nursing intensity and high nutritional status they could predict the return of menses by looking at a mother’s energy balance rather than just nursing intensity.3 They were looking at this equation:\nTotal energy taken in (eating) – Total energy used up (breastfeeding, exercise)\nWhen this equation came out to a positive number (more energy in than energy out), the authors could actually detect a rise in C peptide levels (a marker for insulin) in a women’s urine, and soon after, that woman “got her period back.”\nWhen I think about my situation using this theory, it makes a little more sense. With my first, although I went back to work full time at 3 months, my job as a graduate student in a cell biology lab was pretty physically active. Despite sitting down a bit here and there, I was frequently standing up, lifting, walking across the lab to get something and moving my body to conduct my experiments. In addition, I was pumping every 3 hours or so while I was away from my baby. My energy output was more than my energy input up until the time friends convinced me to stop pumping at work a little after my son was a year old. Within a month my period had returned.\nWith my second baby, I worked part time and had a more flexible schedule, allowing me to work at home often and be close by to nurse my son on demand much of the time rather than deal with pumping. While this situation provided for greater nursing intensity, my energy expenditure was much lower than it had been as a graduate student. In contrast to the constant movement I experienced working in the lab, as a professor I spent much of my work time sitting and writing on the computer, and sometimes snacking while I was doing that. Not a good recipe for expending energy!\nGiven the differences in my activity level while nursing my 2 children, the very different timing I experienced in return of menses starts to make sense.\nAlthough most of us (myself included) generally think about this in terms of the physical signals of menses–getting our periods back— what’s really happening is ovulation. You may have heard that high performance athletes often stop menstruating when they’re training really intensely? Scientists believe that intense energy expenditure or lack of food act as a signal to the body that it’s not a good time to reproduce, causing the body to shut down ovulation. Making and raising babies takes a tremendous amount of resources—not something mom has if she’s starving or expending huge amounts of energy, such as in training for the Olympics.\nAccording to the metabolic load hypothesis, lactational amenorrhea may work much the same way. Milk making in humans requires an average of 500 extra calories a day, even more than pregnancy. If mom is exclusively breastfeeding and active, her energy output through activity and lactation is likely to be greater than or equal to her energy input. If baby starts nursing less, mom becomes less active, or starts consuming more calories than she needs, her body gets the signal that there are ample resources to have more babies, and mom starts ovulating (and menstruating) again.\nThe average duration of lactational amenorrhea in exclusively breastfeeding (no formula, foods, or anything else) mothers in the US is about 6 months.4 This coincides fairly well with the start of the introduction of solid foods, which may begin to reduce nursing intensity. Before then, the lactational amenorrhea method can even be used as a form of birth control, believed to be about 98% effective provided you follow these rules:5-6\nLactational Amenorrhea Method\n- Baby must be less than 6 months old.\n- Mom must not have had a return of menses (defined as 2 contiguous days of bleeding, 2 contiguous days of spotting and 1 day of bleeding, or 3 contiguous days of spotting)\n- Mom is exclusively breastfeeding her baby with no more than 4 hours between daytime feeds and no more than 6 hours between night time feeds and no more than 10% of calories coming from supplementation with infant formula or complementary food5-6\nAs for me, I’m glad there’s data to explain my experience!\nWhen did you get your period back while breastfeeding? Did it differ between children?\n1. C.C.K Tay AG, A. McNeilly.

However, breastfeeding women do need an increased number of calories and nutrients to maintain their milk supply.\nIn most cases, the best way to get an adequate number of calories and nutrients is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, protein, grains, and a limited amount of fat, sometimes with a multivitamin supplement. The components of a healthy diet are discussed in depth in a separate topic review. (See \"Patient information: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nThis topic review discusses the nutritional needs of women who are breastfeeding, including recommendations for calorie intake, vitamin and mineral supplements, fluid recommendations, and guidelines for weight loss while breastfeeding. Foods, drinks, and medications that should be limited or avoided are also discussed.\nTopic reviews about the basics of breastfeeding and common breastfeeding problems are also available. This topic discusses how to prepare to breastfeed, including the benefits of breastfeeding. Additional breastfeeding topics are available separately. (See \"Patient information: Common breastfeeding problems (Beyond the Basics)\" and \"Patient information: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)\" and \"Patient information: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)\" and \"Patient information: Breast pumps (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nNUTRITION AND BREASTFEEDING\nCalorie recommendations — The total number of calories a woman needs depends upon the following factors:\nFor example, a 25-year-old woman who is not breastfeeding and is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and 140 pounds and is not active needs approximately 2190 calories per day. A woman who is older, shorter, who weighs less or who is less active would need fewer calories per day while a woman who is taller, younger, weighs more, or is more active would need more calories per day.\nThe energy and nutritional requirements of women who breastfeed are greater than those of women who are not breastfeeding. The energy cost of exclusive breastfeeding from birth through six months postpartum is 500 kcal/day. Because weight loss will subsidize this cost (approximately 170 kcal per day), the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for energy is set at 330 kcal per day.\nUsing the woman in the above example, the recommended total calorie intake would be approximately 2520 calories per day.\nFluid intake — The average woman who breastfeeds exclusively produces 750 to 800 mL (approximately 25 ounces) of breast milk per day. Many women wonder how much extra fluid they should drink given this relatively large loss of fluid. It is generally sufficient for a woman to drink when she is thirsty and to watch for early signs that she is not getting enough fluids (eg, dark-colored urine, infrequent urination, dry mouth). To encourage an adequate fluid intake, some clinicians recommend keeping a bottle of water or another non-caffeinated beverage nearby while nursing or working.\nWEIGHT LOSS AND BREASTFEEDING\nFollowing pregnancy, most women lose weight gained during pregnancy gradually. Losing a moderate amount of weight by eating less and/or exercising does not usually affect a woman's ability to produce an adequate amount of breast milk.\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL REQUIREMENTS WHILE BREASTFEEDING\nWomen who are healthy and eat a well-balanced diet that includes meat and fish do not usually need to take a vitamin supplement while breastfeeding. However, all women, including those who breastfeed, should ensure that they consume an adequate amount of calcium and vitamin D. (See 'Calcium' below.)\nVegans — Women who are healthy but who do NOT eat meat, chicken, fish, or dairy products need to take a vitamin supplement that contains vitamin B12. Most commercially available multivitamins contain an adequate dose of B12.\nCalcium — Pregnancy and breastfeeding cause a temporary decrease in bone mass. However, lost bone is usually regained after a woman stops breastfeeding. This loss cannot be prevented by consuming additional calcium during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. All adult women should consume a daily minimum of 1000 mg of calcium; adolescents should consume 1300 mg of calcium per day.\nThe primary sources of calcium in the diet are milk and other dairy products, such as hard cheese, cottage cheese, or yogurt, as well as green vegetables, such as spinach (table 1). If it is not possible to consume enough milk or other foods that contain calcium, it is reasonable to take a calcium supplement (table 2). (See \"Patient information: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nVitamin D — Absorption of calcium depends upon having an adequate level of vitamin D. Both breastfeeding and nonbreastfeeding women require an estimated 600 int. units per day of vitamin D. Vitamin D fortified milk is a good source of dietary vitamin D, with approximately 100 int. units per cup. A vitamin D or calcium plus vitamin D supplement is also a good source of vitamin D. (See \"Patient information: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nIron — Women who are not anemic after delivery and who breastfeed exclusively do not usually have a menstrual period for the first four to six months. Thus, there is little iron lost in menstrual blood. An iron supplement is not usually needed during this time.\nWomen who are anemic after delivery usually require an iron supplement; this may include an over-the-counter or prescription iron supplement. The recommended type and dose of iron should be discussed with a healthcare provider. (See \"Patient information: Anemia caused by low iron (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nFish — The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that nursing mothers take in 200 to 300 mg of omega-3 fatty acids per day . Women can meet this need with one to two servings of fish per week, such as herring, canned light tuna, or salmon. To reduce exposure to mercury, mothers should avoid predatory fish such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish, which have high levels of mercury.\nCheck local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas (www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/). If no advice is available, breastfeeding mothers may eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish caught from local waters, but should not consume any other fish during that week.\nMEDICATION SAFETY WITH BREASTFEEDING\nMost medications taken by mothers during breastfeeding are safe for their infants. However, there are exceptions. For this reason, it is best to consult with a healthcare provider, lactation consultant, or pharmacist if there is any question of a medication's safety while breastfeeding . It is important to be aware that the quality of information regarding medication safety in breastfeeding varies . A reliable source of up-to-date information is LactMed, which is available from the National Library of Medicine (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/htmlgen?LACT).\nSome medications are safe but can potentially affect the amount of breast milk produced. For example, combined estrogen/progesterone birth control pills may decrease the amount of milk a woman produces. For this reason, women who are breastfeeding are discouraged from using combination birth control pills. Progesterone-only birth control pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and injections are less likely to affect milk supply, although early placement of progesterone-containing IUDs has been reported to decrease breastfeeding duration . As a result, nonhormonal birth control methods are preferred as the first line of contraceptive therapy for breastfeeding mothers. (See \"Patient information: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)\".)\nOver-the-counter decongestants that contain pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) can also decrease milk supply .\nMedications to avoid while breastfeeding — Some medications are known to be harmful to infants and should be avoided by women who breastfeed if possible. Illegal drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), and heroin are not safe for a woman or her baby; women who use these drugs are advised to not breastfeed. There are limited data on the effects of marijuana in infants; we advise women who breastfeed to avoid use of marijuana.\nAlcohol — When a breastfeeding woman consumes alcohol, a small percentage of alcohol is transferred into her breast milk. The amount of alcohol considered to be \"safe\" while breastfeeding is controversial. A number of factors affect how much alcohol is transferred to breast milk and how much an infant absorbs.\nFor an average-weight woman, it takes about two hours for a single serving of alcohol to clear completely from her body. One serving of alcohol is 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor. To completely avoid any alcohol being transferred to the infant, experts recommend that a woman wait two hours after consuming a single serving of alcohol. If a woman drinks more than this amount, she should refrain from breastfeeding for an additional two hours for each serving of alcohol .\nCaffeine — Most breastfeeding women can drink a moderate amount caffeine without it affecting their infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics defines a moderate intake of caffeine as two to three cups of a caffeinated beverage per day . However, some young infants are sensitive to caffeine and become irritable or have difficulty sleeping, even with small amounts of caffeine. An infant's sensitivity to caffeine usually lessens over time because caffeine clearance is initially slow in newborns, but rises to adult clearance levels by three to five months.\nTobacco — Infants of parents who smoke have an increased risk of a number of conditions, including asthma, pneumonia, ear infections, bronchitis, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), among others. These risks still exist for infants who are breastfed and live with smokers. Cutting down or stopping smoking can decrease these risks. However, for women who are unable to stop smoking, the benefits of breastfeeding are thought to outweigh the risks of formula feeding. Smoking can reduce a mother's milk supply.

{"question":"What are the physical and mental health benefits of dancing, and how do some artists use dance to explore spatial awareness in public spaces?","answer":"Dancing offers numerous physical and mental health benefits. Physically, it can burn more than 300 calories per half-hour due to movements in all directions, comparable to running or swimming. Dancing also engages small support muscles and tendons through up-and-down and side-to-side movements. Mentally, it improves mood, reduces anxiety, and can enhance brain white matter integrity in older adults. As for spatial awareness exploration, artists like Mette Sanggard Dideriksen have investigated how people move through architectural landscapes and how repetition affects our memory in public spaces. Similarly, Jinyeob Lee explored the relationship between sociological context and sensuous experience of specific places, examining how different people experience reality in various ways.","context":["Sensing the City – interviews with artists in residence\nIn July 2019, six international artists lived and worked in Copenhagen as part of the month-long Metropolis Residency – Sensing the City.\nHere you can meet the six artists and hear their thoughts about working within a site-specific context in Copenhagen as well as watch some footage from their work-in-progress presentations:\nSarah Bostoen, Belgium\nSarah is a freelance dancer, choreographer and driving force behind compagnie Monica, a dance theatre company based in Ghent, Belgium. She graduated from Fontys Dance Academy Tilburg in 2007 and is currently studying Arts’ History and Theatre Sciences at University of Ghent in Belgium.\nSarah focused on mapping and presenting the inner world and thoughts of people by using so-called ”écriture automatique” (automatic writing or psychography) and then walking with her participants to create a distinction between ”walk-thoughts” and ”standing still-thoughts”. In the end she collected the output of her participants and fashioned these thoughts and feelings into a visual artefact.\nAnne Glassner, Austria\nAnne is a sleep performer and visual artist based in Vienna, who mostly works with interventions in public space, performance, installation, video, and drawing. She has a master’s degree in Fine Arts from University of Applied Arts Vienna as well as a master’s degree in Arts and Communication/ Teaching Studies from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.\nDuring her residency, Anne continued her research and artistic work about sleep, awareness, and silence. Through her performance, she asked questions such as how our bodies react to different architecture, who sleeps in public places, what a sleeping being becomes against the backdrop of a world that is lit 24/7, and where the borders between fiction and reality lie.\nMette Sanggard Dideriksen, Denmark\nMette is a designer based in Copenhagen. She studied at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts Schools of Design, Glasgow School of Art, and Fatamorgana. She is also a member of the art collective FUKK.\nMette has an interest in how repetition and stimulation leaves footprints in our memory. With her performance she questioned the regular and daily paths we all take and how we move through architectural landscapes. Her performance invited passers-by to get involved and created awareness of public space and the architectural choices that affect the body’s actions.\nFlóra Eszter Sarlós, Hungary\nFlóra is a choreographer, dancer and co-founder of Ziggurat Project, an art collective which focuses on site-sensitive and site-specific performances. She has trained and worked in the field of contemporary dance in various schools and workshops in Hungary and France. She has completed a master’s degree in Performing Arts at Paris VIII University, where her research focused on the relationship of contemporary dance to digital arts with a particular interest in choreographic installations.\nFlóra has an interest in the sensual perception of dance and created a performance centered around the physical and mental impressions of the participants. For her performance, Flóra created a sensual landscape to explore how imagination can play a role in the perception of dance, and if we are capable of imagine the movements without seeing the dancer.\nCaterina Moroni, Italy\nCaterina is a performing artist and a cultural and social activist. She focuses on art in public and unconventional space and on participatory processes. She graduated in Litterature and Art and with a master’s degree in Communication and Business Management. She attended the European Professional School for artists directed by Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio.\nDuring her residency, Caterina focused her research on the emergency of climate change, the sea, and the younger generations. She invited the audience to participate in a ritual to desperately search for a sense of the future. The participants were involved in a dramaturgy of public and private spaces, real and imaginary settings, in which physical and mental spaces merged into a personal story.\nJinyeob Lee, South Korea\nJinyeob Lee is a performance director from South Korea with a background in Theatre Design BA at Nottingham Trent University and MA Theatre Arts in 2006 in UK. She has worked as a set designer, a director and a producer and in 2009 she started a company called “Elephants Laugh” which specialize in creating site-specific performances which covers social issues and social minorities and challenge to develop independent and free thinking.\nDuring her residency Jinyeob investigated the new ways in which to uncover and understand the relationship between the sociological context and the sensuous experience of a specific place. Focusing on the visible and invisible layers of space, her performance was an exploration of how different people experience reality in wildly different ways.\nWatch pictures taken from the various work-in-progress presentations below:","Dance floors tend to be perspiring places for a factor. All of those shimmies as well as trembles shed power like you would not think– as well as feature several various other surprising health benefits, too.\nWhen you dance, you can expend more than 300 calories every half-hour, according to a record from the College of Brighton in the UK. That meets or exceeds the quantity of power you shed throughout a simple run or swim, the record shows. Also fairly tame forms of dancing shed concerning the same number of calories as cycling.\nDancing needs a great deal of power outcome since it involves “motion in all instructions,” states Nick Smeeton, a principal speaker at the University of Brighton and coauthor of that report. While running, swimming as well as various other propulsive types of exercise use rhythm and momentum to maintain you relocating, “there is a great deal of accelerating and also slowing down in dance, which the body is less able to do in an energy effective way,” Smeeton states.\nIf running resembles driving on a highway, dancing is a lot more like motoring with a busy city, he states. All of that starting, quiting as well as changing instructions burns a lots of gas although you’re not covering a great deal of ground.\nNaturally, the amount of power you use up has a lot to do with just how hard you’re pressing yourself. A gentle two-step isn’t mosting likely to measure up to an intense, hilly run. However torching calories isn’t the only benefit to dancing. Just as path operating and treking far better involve your lower-body joints and also muscles than straight-ahead, level-ground locomotion, the up-and-down and side-to-side motions of dancing may furthermore activate and educate a lot of your body’s little support muscles as well as tendons.\nLike other types of cardio workout, dance also seems to have mood as well as mind advantages. A 2007 research study located that hip jump dance improved energy, buoyed state of mind and also lowered stress and anxiety in methods similar to cardio workout.\nA more current research, published earlier this year in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, linked dancing to improved “white matter” integrity in the minds of older grownups. Your mind’s white issue can be taken its connective cells. That tissue tends to break down progressively as we age, which brings about a loss of refining speed as well as the reasoning and also memory problems that develop later in life, says Agnieszka Burzynska, an assistant professor of neuroscience at Colorado State University which research study’s initial author.\nBurzynska and her coworkers took a look at white issue adjustments among older adults engaged in normal strolling, extending or dancing programs. White matter stability decreased amongst the pedestrians and also stretchers, yet boosted among those that danced 3 days a week for 6 months. “We saw this benefit in one location of the brain, not almost everywhere, as well as our searchings for are initial,” she states. However the very early results are encouraging.\nThe mental advantages are additionally remarkable. For years, some therapists have recommended dance as a reliable treatment for those who experience social stress and anxiety or fear of public speaking. The concept: if you can loosen up sufficient to boogie in front of complete strangers, you’re a lot much less most likely to feel awkward when hanging out or talking before a target market. Research study dating back to the 1980s sustains the concept that dancing can suppress anxiety.\nDance additionally appears to urge social bonding and also what psychologists call “self-other combining.” Like chatting with an unfamiliar person as well as learning you both attended the very same school or matured in the very same community, moving and also grooving in rhythm with others illuminate mind pathways that obscure the obstacles your mind puts up in between on your own as well as a stranger, therefore assists you feel a feeling of link and sameness, recommends a study from the University of Oxford.\nFinally, the touch facet of dancing with a companion might provide some special rewards. Touch is the initial feeling that arises throughout infancy, and the more professionals take a look at the advantages of massage therapy, holding hands and also other forms of human-to-human physical contact, the more they locate that touching improves wellness and lowers stress and anxiety and stress and anxiety. Essentially, dancing with somebody else resembles exercise and also a hug rolled with each other.\nPlace all this with each other, as well as it’s clear we might all use even more samba, salsa or boot scootin’ in our lives."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6f332cbf-6958-48dd-80ac-1c35da155de8>","<urn:uuid:ad80c2e6-96bc-4714-9bef-fa6698035452>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuáles son las ventajas principales de utilizar un sistema de anzuelos en tándem (quick-strike rig) para la pesca del lucio?","answer":"There are three main advantages of using quick-strike rigs: 1) they increase the probability of hookups, 2) since pike are hooked shallower in the mouth, hook removal is easier which increases chances for survival, and 3) you can set the hook instantly rather than letting the pike run.","context":["Gear & Accessories Line Lures Northern Pike Pike & Muskie Pike Quick Strike Rigs Rob Neumann February 27th, 2014 | More From Rob Neumann Share0 Tweet Email Share on Facebook.Share on Twitter.Share on Google+In-Fisherman first introduced pike quick strike rigs, about 30 years ago, working off the elaborate European designs that were virtually unheard of on this side of the big pond. Although there were many variations, these rigs shared a fundamental design: A hook attached to the end of a 15- to 20-inch section of wire, with a second hook riding a few inches above. Doug Stange, In-Fisherman Editor In Chief, tested versions of these rigs in North America, eventually calling them “quick-strike rigs.” Results were convincing, setting a new stage in the theater of ice-and open-water fishing for pike. A typical North American pike rig consists of a big single hook or treble attached to a wire leader, with live- or deadbait impaled on the hook. This rig works, but it was apparent that tandem-hook rigs maximized efficiency for several reasons: 1) increased probability of hookups; 2) since pike are hooked shallower in the mouth, hook removal is made easier, increasing chances for survival; and 3) you can set instantly, rather then letting the pike run—hence the term “quick-strike.” Striker Systems Two hook designs remain standard for quick-strike rigging: the treble and two-tine designs. Stange recommends the Lazer Sharp 374 by Eagle Claw, finding that #4 and #6 size trebles have better hooking and landing rates than larger sizes. The 374’s beaked design helps hold in baits and hooks pike well. The Partridge VB, a unique two-tine hook, has a smaller tine opposite the larger one. The larger and smaller tines on the VMC Double Ryder are offset 90 degrees. The hook’s function on tandem rigs serves two purposes—to hold the bait and to hook the pike. With trebles, one tine on each of the hooks is inserted into the bait, leaving the remaining tines exposed for hook-ups. On the VB and VMC, the smaller tine is used to hold the bait. For either hook style, insert the end hook near the dorsal fin of a baitfish, and the upper hook in or near the tail. You also can set the end hook farther near the head, in the “shoulder” of the bait. If two trebles on a single rig are illegal where you fish, you can switch out the upper treble for a single hook, inserted through the mouth of the baitfish. Making a quick-strike rig starts with cutting about a 20- to 25-inch section of wire, allowing a few inches for crimps or wraps, and trimming. The standard wire is 18- to 27-pound uncoated stranded, strong enough yet thin. Sevenstrand and American Fishing Wire’s Surfstrand are both quality 7-strand wires that work well. Other wires to try include Cortland’s Toothy Critter and American Fishing Wire’s Surfstrand Micro Ultra (19 strands) and Micro Supreme (49 strands). Stranded wires tend to curl after icing a fish or two, so have extra rigs on hand to avoid having to make them in the field. I carry extra rigs on a Lindy Legendary Fishing Tackle Rigger X-Treme and store components in its built-in containers. On one end of the wire, thread on a 1/2-inch section of heat-shrink tubing followed by the upper hook, then attach the end hook with a crimp or wrap. Attach a swivel to the opposite end of the wire. Finish by heat-shrinking the tubing over the eye and a portion of the shank of the upper hook. The tubing holds the hook snugly, yet allows the position of the hook to be adjusted to accommodate different-sized baits and hooking locations. You also can make the upper hook adjustable by looping the wire through a crimping sleeve (don’t crimp), with the upper hook riding on the loop. In some states, adding a spinner blade is required to make a quick-strike rig legal. Legalities aside, the added flash and color are features we should consider regardless of the technical definition of a lure where you fish. Beyond spinner blades, experiment with hook and bead colors. HT Enterprises, Thorne Brothers, and Bait Rigs Tackle offer premade quick-strike rigs. HT’s Dual Hook Quick Strike Rig is available with #4 or #6 trebles on 27-pound-test wire. A fluorescent blade rides above an adjustable upper hook. The Quick Strike Rig by Thorne Brothers features #4 Gamakatsu trebles, an adjustable upper hook, and attractor beads on 30-pound wire. Their Bleeding version features red hooks and red beads. Bait Rigs tackle offers a selection of Tandem Quickset Rigs with VMC two-tine hooks from #8 to 1/0 on 20- to 40-pound-test wire. Pike aren’t particular if the bait hangs perfectly horizontal, either. Hooking a baitfish near the dorsal fin and near the tail results in a head-down bait position, which is perfectly acceptable, whether below a tip-up or a jigging rod. Alternative Tandems Another dual-treble rig that Digital Editoral Director Jeff Simpson finds effective is the Zero Rig–which Simpson created. Unlike quick-strike rigs where the hooks are attached inline on the wire, the Zero Rig has two trebles in a looped wire. Simpson, along with many other diehard pike anglers we know are convinced it has the highest hook-up percentage of any rig on the market. An advantage of the Zero Rig setup is that the hooks can be inserted in a baitfish so that the points run in opposite directions. Simpson often finds that by inserting one hook near the tail and one near the dorsal fin or head, with the hook-points facing each other along the long axis of the bait, hooking percentage is increased. No matter which way a pike runs, the points on one of the trebles pull in the direction of the hook-set. And because the hooks can slide freely in the loop, deadbait can be angled up or down, depending on your preference. A new tandem hook rig available from HT Enterprises is the Balance Tip-Up Rig. This unique design has two equal-length wire droppers about 4.5 inches long, each sporting bleeding red trebles and small spinner blades. While the rig is designed to balance baits, its strongest benefit is the option of hooking baits with trebles lying in the same direction or opposed. Make Some Noise Pike rely heavily on sight for feeding, but it makes sense that rattles activated by a struggling baitfish would help alert pike to a bait. The biggest advantage may be during low-light periods or when water clarity is reduced. The added signal also should provide an advantage when cover, like beds of aquatic vegetation, obscures a pike’s line of sight to a bait. Perhaps there’s a benefit even in clear, lighted conditions. Keith Lambert of Hertfordshire, England, says he often uses rattles on European rigs to attract giant wels (European) catfish. I asked Lambert about rattles for pike. “Obviously my main targets, at least during the summer months, are catfish, and I often incorporate rattles into the rigs as audible attractants,” Lambert says. “Unfortunately, this attracts so many pike that I have to ditch the rattles. They’re very effective for pike and I always try to incorporate them into my winter campaigns.” Lambert uses the clip-on Catfish Pro Rig Rattles, a ball-shaped design available in red, black, silver, yellow, or white. The rattles come open, the two half-chambers linked on a hinge. Add a few beads and snap the two halves together. The rattle snaps over line or leader. The ball rattles Lambert uses are available through the Catfish Conservation Group’s online shop (ccgonline.co.uk), though you’ll have to pay international postage—no comparable ball-shaped designs seem to be available from U.S. suppliers.

With spectacular sight-fishing, it’s a fly fisherman’s dream, he says. Fish remain shallow all year. Crystal clear water with bonus huge lake trout. Contact: Lac La Martre Adventures, <a href=\"http://www.nwtfishing.com\"target=\"_blank\">nwtfishing.com</a>, 810/334-9381. <h2>3 Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories </h2>Among the top spots in In-Fisherman Field Editor Matt Straw’s list is Trout Rock Lodge, on the north shore of Great Slave Lake. It’s located in an archipelago formed by hundreds of islands, which protect some of the most expansive far northern pike habitat on earth. Straw says you’ll find lots of “kraken,” as the locals call pike over 40 inches long. And he reports more 50-inch pike are caught here every year than anywhere he’s been. Contact: Trout Rock Lodge, <a href=\"http://www.enodah.com\"target=\"_blank\">enodah.com</a>. <h2>4 Athabasca Lake, Saskatchewan </h2>This massive water, stretching over 230 miles, with large connected rivers and plentiful pike habitat, has tremendous fishing for big pike, Penny says. Mostly known for big lakers, the pike fishing is overlooked. Lots of classic weedy bays with clear water. Some of the biggest pike in Saskatchewan await anglers.

More pounds per inch than anywhere else in North America, he says, the pike here are the toughest he’s encountered. Big walleyes, too, along with magnificent scenery. Contact: Aurora Nights Lodge, <a href=\"http://www.auroranights.ca\"target=\"_blank\">auroranights.ca</a>, 867/394-4001. <h2>6 Reindeer Lake, Saskatchewan </h2>At over 180 miles long and up to 60 miles wide, Reindeer Lake is full of classic pike habitat, with thousands of islands, structural elements, and weedy bays. Last season, Lawrence Bay Lodge recorded their largest catches of big pike from 18 to 35 pounds, and some over 35. Sight-fishing is a top strategy in some areas. Fishing deeper structure and weededges also produces giant pike at certain times. Bonus lake trout, walleyes, and grayling. Contact: Lawrence Bay Lodge, <a href=\"http://www.lawrencebay.com\"target=\"_blank\">lawrencebay.com</a>. <h2>7 Misaw Lake Lodge, Saskatchewan </h2>Straw says Misaw Lake in northern Saskatchewan has some of the most consistent trophy pike fishing he’s ever experienced. The Schwandt River, an excellent big-pike venue, runs out of Misaw Lake near Misaw Lake Lodge. Misaw produces pike over 50 inches long most years, and the lodge offers fly-outs and hikes to other lakes full of trophy pike that don’t get fished for years. Contact: Misaw Lake Lodge, <a href=\"http://www.misawlakelodge.com\"target=\"_blank\">misawlakelodge.com</a>. <h2>8 Wollaston Lake, Saskatchewan </h2>Wollaston Lake, the largest lake in the world that has outflows in two different drainage basins, produces numbers of trophy pike in the mid-40- to 50-inch range every year. Sight-fishing shallow is a top tactic for early season, with an endless number of points, bays, and neckdowns that hold pike through summer. The lodge accommodations and dining are first class, and seasoned and knowledgeable guides are at the top of their game. Contact: Wollaston Lake Lodge, <a href=\"http://www.wollastonlakelodge.com\"target=\"_blank\">wollastonlakelodge.com</a>. <h2>9 Rainy Lake, Ontario </h2>The location of numerous TV segments for In-Fisherman Television, Rainy Lake on the Ontario-U.S. border remains one of the top drive-to destinations in North America. Pike in the 10- to 15-pound range are common, with chances at 40-inch-plus fish. The weeks after ice-out find postspawn pike in shallow weedy bays—prime time to target pike with flies. Later into June, pike transition to deep weedlines, and many fish move to rocky structures in fall.

Last September, his friend Mike Stark caught a 461⁄2-incher just ounces shy of 30 pounds, a state-record caliber fish. All these reservoirs have 30-pound class fish that grow big on a diet of trout, he says. Guide Nathan Zelinsky specialized in trophy Colorado pike. He says peak times are May and late September and early October. Tactics include trolling with planer boards as well as casting jerkbaits, swimbaits and tubes. There’s also an amazing topwater bite in July or August, he says.

{"question":"What are the differences between Public Housing and Section 8 regarding lease terms and length of stay?","answer":"In Public Housing, residents can generally stay as long as they comply with the lease, though the HA may review whether families should remain if their income becomes sufficient for private market housing. For Section 8 housing, the initial lease term is specifically one year, after which it converts to a month-to-month basis. Both programs require signing a lease agreement and paying a security deposit, with Section 8's security deposit typically being approximately one month's rent.","context":["Everything You Need to Know About Public Housing\nPublic housing was set up by the federal government to provide safe housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) dispenses federal aid to state Housing Agencies across the country that manage public housing units. These funds cover property costs so that rents can be set at affordable prices to eligible tenants.\nWho is Eligible?\nPublic housing is reserved for low-income individuals and families. A local Housing Agency (HA) judges your eligibility based on:\n- Annual gross income\n- US citizenship of legal immigration status\n- Whether you qualify for reasons of age, disability, or income\nIf found eligible, the HA will check your references to ensure you will be a good tenant. If you are deemed a risk to the community or the property, the HA may deny your application.\nIn regards to income limits, there are varying standards. But public housing is generally reserved for those who earn less than 50% of the median income of the metropolitan area in which they will live. Your local HA will be able to provide you with exact figures regarding income qualifications.\nHow Do I Apply?\nIf you are interested in applying for public housing, contact your local HA. If you have trouble contacting the HA, contact the local HUD Field Office.\nHow Does the Application Process Work?\nThe application must be submitted in person. Either you or the HA representative will fill it out. Before applying, be sure to have the following information:\n- Names of all persons who will be living in the unit, their sex, date of birth, and relationship to the family head;\n- Your present address and telephone number;\n- Family characteristics (e.g., veteran) or circumstances (e.g., living in substandard housing) that might qualify the family for tenant selection preferences;\n- Names and addresses of your current and previous landlords for information about your family's suitability as a tenant;\n- An estimate of your family's anticipated income for the next twelve months and the sources of that income;\n- The names and addresses of employers, banks, and any other information the HA would need to verify your income and deductions, and to verify the family composition; and\n- The PHA also may visit you in your home to interview you and your family members to see how you manage the upkeep of you current home.\nAfter submitting your application, an HA representative will explain the public housing program and its requirements, and answer any questions you might have.\nWill I Need to Produce Any Documentation?\nYes, the HA representative will request whatever documentation is needed (e.g., birth certificates, tax returns) to verify the information given on your application. The PHA will also rely on direct verification from your employer, etc. You will be asked to sign a form to authorize release of pertinent information to the PHA.\nWhen Will I Be Notified?\nAn HA has to provide written notification. If the HA determines that you are eligible, your name will be put on a waiting list, unless the HA is able to assist you immediately. Once your name is reached on the waiting list, the HA will contact you. If it is determined that you are ineligible, the HA must say why and, if you wish, you can request an informal hearing.\nWill I Have To Sign a Lease?\nIf you are offered a house or apartment and accept it, you will have to sign a lease with the HA. You may have to give the HA a security deposit. You and the HA representative should go over the lease together. This will give you a better understanding of your responsibilities as a tenant and the HA's responsibilities as a landlord.\nAre There Any Selection Preferences?\nSometimes there are. Giving preference to specific groups of families enables an HA to direct their limited housing resources to the families with the greatest housing needs. Since the demand for housing assistance often exceeds the limited resources available to HUD and the local HAs, long waiting periods are common. In fact, an HA may close its waiting list when there are more families on the list than can be assisted in the near future.\nEach HA has the discretion to establish preferences to reflect needs in its own community. These preferences will be included in the HAs written policy manual. You should ask what preferences they honor so you will know whether you qualify for a preference.\nHow is Rent Determined?\nYour rent, which is referred to as the Total Tenant Payment (TTP) in this program, would be based on your family's anticipated gross annual income less deductions, if any. HUD regulations allow HAs to exclude from annual income the following allowances: $480 for each dependent; $400 for any elderly family, or a person with a disability; and some medical deductions for families headed by an elderly person or a person with disabilities. Based on your application, the HA representative will determine if any of the allowable deductions should be subtracted from your annual income. Annual income is the anticipated total income from all sources received from the family head and spouse, and each additional member of the family 18 years of age or older.\nThe formula used in determining the TTP is the highest of the following, rounded to the nearest dollar:\n- 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income. (Monthly Adjusted Income is annual income less deductions allowed by the regulations);\n- 10 percent of monthly income;\n- welfare rent, if applicable; or\n- a $25 minimum rent or higher amount (up to $50) set by an HA\nWhat is the Role of the HA?\nAn HA is responsible for the management and operation of its local public housing program. They may also operate other types of housing programs.\n- On-going functions: (a) Assure compliance with leases. The lease must be signed by both parties; (b) Set other charges (e.g., security deposit, excess utility consumption, and damages to unit); (c) Perform periodic reexaminations of the family's income at least once every 12 months; (d) Transfer families from one unit to another, in order to correct over/under crowding, repair or renovate a dwelling, or because of a resident's request to be transferred; (e) Terminate leases when necessary; and (f) maintain the development in a decent, safe, and sanitary condition.\n- Sometimes HAs provide other services, that might include such things as: homeownership opportunities for qualified families; employment training opportunities, and other special training and employment programs for residents; and support programs for the elderly.\nHow Long Can I Stay in Public Housing?\nIn general, you may stay in public housing as long as you comply with the lease.\nIf at reexamination your family's income is sufficient to obtain housing on the private market, the HA may determine whether your family should stay in public housing.","Frequently Asked Questions\n- What is Section 8 Housing?\n- What is the difference between Project Based Section 8 and a Section 8 Voucher?\n- Would I be eligible?\n- How do I apply?\n- How much would my rent be?\n- Can I have assets such as a savings account or a car and still qualify?\n- How much will my security deposit be?\n- Will I have a lease agreement?\n- Will I have to move if my income changes?\n- What happens if my family composition changes?\n- Can I have a pet?\n- Can I have a service animal?\n- Do you provide furnished apartments?\n- Do I pay my own utilities?\n- Do I have to pay for parking?\n- What is the Section 42 program?\n1. What is Section 8 Housing?\nSection 8 is the name of a housing program that is administered by HUD (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). This program provides rental assistance to seniors, people with disabilities, individuals, and family households.\n2. What is the difference between Project Based Section 8 and a Section 8 Voucher?\nWith Project Based Section 8, the assistance stays with the apartment and not the individual. An individual receives the assistance only as long as they live at that property.\nWith a Section 8 Voucher, the assistance stays with the voucher holder. This means that the voucher holder picks out a market rate apartment and uses their portable voucher to supplement the rent. When they move from the apartment, they take their voucher with them.\nIf an individual with a Section 8 Voucher wants to live at a Project Based Section 8 property the person may apply to the property but prior to moving in would need to give up their Section 8 Voucher.\n3. Would I be eligible?\nIn order to qualify for Section 8 housing you must meet certain income requirements that are based on the number of individuals in your household. Credit, criminal, and landlord background checks are run on all adult applicants.\n4. How do I apply?\nYou should determine which property(s) you would like to live at and complete an application for the specific property(s). It is very important that you answer all of the questions on the application. Submit your completed application right away so the application can be processed. Some of our properties have waiting lists and individuals are considered based on the date and time the completed application is received.\n5. How much would my rent be?\nThe rent for each household living in Section 8 is different. Your rent would be approximately 30% of your household's adjusted gross monthly income. Your gross monthly income amount is the amount you receive before any taxes or deductions are withheld.\nFor instance, if you were a family of three with two minor children and your gross monthly income was $500, your rent would be about $126 a month. Section 8 provides certain allowances based on your family composition.\n6. Can I have assets such as a savings account or a car and still qualify?\nYes. The income that your bank accounts may earn will be counted towards your annual income. Personal assets such as your car, clothes, etc. do not count.\n7. How much will my security deposit be?\nYour security deposit will be approximately one month's rent.\n8. Will I have a lease agreement?\nFor Section 8 housing, the initial term of your lease would be one year. After that, the lease is on a month to month basis.\n9. Will I have to move if my income changes?\nNo. Your rent will be adjusted based on an additional recertification of household income required when income changes occur. HUD wants to make sure that every household pays rent based on their current income, so they use a data matching system called EIV. This system reports Social Security, Wages, and Unemployment benefits. It helps to make sure that every household member's income is counted correctly in calculating the rent.\n10. What happens if my family composition changes?\nIf a household member is added, or one moves out, an additional recertification is completed.\n11. Can I have a pet?\nPets are allowed at properties designated for seniors and/or people with disabilities. Pets are required to comply with Meridian's Pet Policy and a pet deposit is required. A copy of the pet policy can be obtained directly from the property you're interested in.\n12. Can I have a service animal?\nService animals are allowed at all properties as they are not considered pets. They are animals that work, provide assistance, or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability, or animals that provide emotional support that alleviates one or more symptoms of a person's disability.\n13. Do you provide furnished apartments?\nOur apartments are not furnished but do come with kitchen appliances. Each apartment offers specific amenities which are outlined on this website.\n14. Do I pay my own utilities?\nMost of the properties require you to pay your own electric bills. Most properties with Section 8 units offer utility allowances or the heat and electric is included. The utility allowance is an amount taken off of the tenant's portion of the rent to help them pay their utility bill.\n15. Do I have to pay for parking?\nMost of the properties offer off-street parking at no additional charge. Some properties have covered parking or garages in which additional charges may apply.\n16. What is the Section 42 program?\nThis is an affordable housing program which is administered by the IRS. Many of the income requirements are the same as the Section 8 program. There are a few rules that are more restrictive with this program, especially pertaining to full-time students."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:33ed0367-0620-4778-ae99-557bed303b04>","<urn:uuid:84e3255a-ce23-4dd6-a4fb-22f076037612>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between ancient Filipino burial pottery and modern electric kilns in terms of their temperature capabilities and uses?","answer":"Ancient Filipino burial pottery and modern electric kilns differ significantly in their temperature capabilities and uses. Ancient Filipino burial pottery, made during the Metal Age (500 BCE-900 CE), was primarily earthenware used for burial purposes, featuring anthropomorphic designs with human facial characteristics. Modern electric kilns, in contrast, can reach much higher temperatures - up to 2350°F for porcelain and stoneware, 2300°-2000°F for low-fire ceramics, and 1400°-1700°F for specific applications like glass fusing and china painting. While ancient burial pottery served cultural and spiritual purposes, modern kilns are designed for specific technical requirements with different temperature ratings for various ceramic applications.","context":["Pottery is defined as the art or craft of a potter to manufacture material from which pottery ware is made. It can be made from earthenware, porcelain or stoneware. According to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), pottery is defined as all fired ceramic wares that contain clay materials. Pottery uses clay and may sometimes be mixed with other materials to form the clay body. Clay bodies differ in physical stages during the making of pottery. Earthenware, an example, is made of clay produced in a swampy area or in open fields near riverbanks.\nThe process of pottery involves forming or shaping a clay body into your desired shape. It is then heated to high temperatures in a kiln that removes excess water thereby hardening the clay and setting it to a permanent shape. For aesthetic purposes, the clay body may be decorated before or after the firing process. Kneading the clay body is an important step prior to shaping the clay.\nIt ensures an even distribution of moisture content and removes the air bubbles trapped within the clay body. Pottery is found in almost all archaeological sites. In fact, pottery has provided archaeologists with information about the past, mainly about trade and technology.\nSCOPE AND LIMITATION\nThe focus of this paper will be pottery and its evolution through time. The paper will be limited to Philippine pottery only.\nEMERGENCE OF THE FIRST POTTERY\nThe emergence of pottery in the Philippines indicates the complexity of cultural development during the Neolithic Period. Like the rest of the early people in other parts of the world, the early man and woman in the Philippines were also highly dependent on nature. Nature provided them with the basic necessities needed for survival. In earlier times, vessels such as leaves and tree barks were used in gathering food. Not long after, the early people learned to cook using the vessels. According to Valdes (Pang-alay), humans discovered the properties of clay and how it hardens when tempered with sand and fire.\nANCIENT RITUALS IN POTTERY\nBefore the Spaniards set foot in the Philippines and spread Christianity, the early Filipinos were pagan worshippers. Paganism refers to indigenous religious traditions wherein people worshipped animals and deities. The discovery of pottery led them to fashion effigies called tao-tao by the Visayans and likha or larawan by the Tagalogs.\nIn paganism, they offer special offerings of fruits and perfumes to appease the spirits they worship. It was believed that refusing to offer special presents to the spirits would anger them and bring illness and misfortune. The offerings were placed in earthenware pottery and offered in the fields for the spirits.\nThe early Filipinos also believed in life after death. For this reason, they took special care of the dead and gave “pabaon” for their journey in the afterlife. The bereaved brought food contained in clay vessels or palayok as offerings (Fox, 1959). The clay pots that were used as ritual vessels were the same pots used in their daily life. As time passed, the designs of the vessels became finer and more intricate.\nGOLDEN AGE OF POTTERY IN THE PHILIPPINES\nThe Golden Age of Philippine pottery was ascertained to be during the period when the use of metals flourished, about 2000 years B.C., but some of the earliest pottery discovered dated further back in the Neolithic Age when the development of horticulture and animal domestication dominated.\nThere is little of Philippine Neolithic pottery left extant as stated by Jesus T. Peralta in his work, “Pottery and Ceramics Excavated in the Philippines”. Some potteries excavated in sites widely spread in the Philippines indicate original designs and attempts for aesthetic designs in their construction. During this time, pottery was made to suit ones need whether for household or burial needs.\nPOTTERY IN THE METAL AGE\nThe start of the Metal Age marked the development of pottery technology estimated to be between 500 B.C.E. and 900 C.E. Specific typologies of pottery surfaced. Larger pieces of burial jars were said to have appeared during this age. Evidences of pottery with elaborate and intricate designs on their vessels that were prominent during this age were unearthed in Palawan. Apart from Palawan, the same markers were also found in Masbate, known as the Kalanay Complex site. The excavation was lead by Dr. Wilhelm Solheim II in the 1950s where they found earthenware pottery.Evidences of pottery dating back to the Metal Age were found in archaeological sites in Cebu by archaeologists from the University of San Carlos and the National Museum in the summer of 2011.\nPOTTERY AS USED FOR BURIALS\nFilipinos, in the past and in the present, heavily believe in the afterlife. Giving respect to the dead has been a custom from way back. Since Filipinos in the past believe in “pabaon”, the ceramic potteries they acquire from trading with other countries like China are buried together with their deceased loved ones. The ceramics were treated as valuables rather that for utilitarian purposes.\nBurial jars unearthed in the Philippines were dated back to the Neolithic Period. Anthropomorphism had become a dominant design. It is the personification or attribution of human characteristics to inanimate object, in this case, jars or pottery. These jars, made of earthenware, are designed like human figures complete with facial characteristics. The Mannunggul jar, Maitum Anthopomorphic potteries, and Leta-leta potteries from Palawan have greatly contributed to the understanding of burial customs during the early times.\nINFLUENCE FROM OUTSIDE\nEvidences of contacts with Mainland and the rest of South East Asia were evident in trade and cultural exchanges. The production of domestic pottery became competitive increasing the pressure on the international market in the South Seas (Peralta). Pottery trades with China were most evident.\nTraditional ceramics are composed of clay minerals (i.e. porcelain), as well as cement and glass. Ceramic artifacts have been useful in archaeology for understanding culture, technology and behavior of people in the past since they are among the most common artifacts to be found. Sherd is a term referred to small fragments of broken pottery.\nDuring the Pre-Christian era, highly-fired ceramic wares were evident in China. Ceramic technology in the mainland was very advanced and kaolin, very fine clay that can be fired to high temperatures, was the contributory factor. Kilns in China became known for their ability to produce temperatures well-above 1300°. Ceramics from China were deemed to be of superior quality and thus were preferred over low-fired ceramics from other lands.\nH. Otley Beyer mentioned the recovery of three-colored ceramic shards from Tang Dynasty in the Philippines that verified the early trade networks of the early Filipinos with Mainland Asia. According to text, the discovered shards were systematically excavated from sites giving way to a large drawback on the presence of Tang Dynasty ceramics. However, in the 1980s, a site in Laurel near the edge of Taal Lake in Batangas was excavated and shards of of polychrome glazed jars were recovered. Polychrome glaze, obtained by using coloring agents such as copper, iron, manganese, and cobalt, was a product of Tang Dynasty.\nPHILIPPINE POTTERY AT PRESENT\nWith the development of technology, modern ways on how to do pottery have been developed. Pottery equipment machines have been invented to make pottery for industrial purposes. Nevertheless, the art of pottery still struggles to live and strives to remain as a priceless piece of folk art.\nIn places across the country, the art of making pottery in the primordial way still lives on. In the province of Antique, potters of Barangay Bari in Sibalom still adapt the traditional process of pottery. The potters, known as “manugdihon kang kuron”, have been famous for making good quality and durable pottery. Likewise, in an area in Vigan, Ilocos Sur known as Pagburnayan, traditional pottery methods are also practiced by workers.\nPottery is one of the most primordial arts that helped developed our culture. Preserving the traditional way of making pottery and keeping artifacts intact will also help in preserving Philippine tradition and culture that will benefit the future generations.\nFox, Robert B., “The Calatagan Excavations: two 15th Century Burial Sites in Batangas, Philippines”, Philippine Studies, Vol. 7, Manila, Philippines; 1959 Valdes, Cynthia O.,“Pang-alay: Ritual Pottery in Ancient Philippines”, Makati City; 2003 Orton, Clive; Tyers, Paul and Vince, Alan, Pottery inArchaeology, Cambridge manuals in Archaeology; 1993 Ronquillo, Wilfredo P., Philippine Earthenware Pottery: An Overview “Pottery dating back to the Metal Age found in Cebu town”, Cebu Daily News; 05April2011 Callister, William D. and Rethwisch, David G., Materials Science and Engineering, 8th Edition, John Wiley & Sons; 2011 Eusebio Zamora Dizon, “An Iron Age in the Philippines?

Retrieved from https://studymoose.com/pottery-in-the-philippines-essay","How to Choose an Electric Kiln\nThe kiln you choose must be rated hot enough for the ware that you will fire:\n2350°F: Porcelain and stoneware\n2300° - 2000°F: Low-fire ceramics\n1400° - 1700°F: China painting, glass fusing, glass slumping, enameling, bead annealing\nIt is a good idea to buy a kiln that will fire hotter than you need it to. If you are firing glass to 1500°F, buy a kiln rated to 1700°F. If you fire ceramics to cone 6, buy a cone 10 kiln. As heating elements age, they draw less and less power. Generally, the higher the kiln’s maximum temperature rating, the longer the elements last. This is because even after the elements begin to wear, they still draw enough amperage to fire the ware. Another advantage to higher temperature capacity is that during periods of low voltage, your kiln will still likely reach the temperature you need.\nIn general, the larger the kiln, the lower the cost per cubic foot of interior space. Divide a kiln price by its cubic feet, and you’ll see what I mean. Will you want to fire many small loads or a few large ones? Some people prefer to fire frequent small loads to see how special effects turn out before spending time on other projects. Others prefer firing fewer large loads. This may be another factor in choosing kiln size. Choose a kiln that will fire the largest ware that you produce, and decide how often you want to fire the kiln. Figure how long it will take you to make enough ware to fill a kiln of a given size. Do you think your needs will expand later? Kiln owners will typically tell you to buy more capacity than you currently need, because you’ll probably outgrow your kiln later. Before purchasing a 10- or 12-sided top-loading kiln, visit a studio that has one. Reach down inside the kiln to be sure you are tall enough to load it. This is important. I know people who cannot touch the floor of their kiln, so they leave a shelf supported by posts in the bottom. If you have difficulty loading a studio kiln, consider the short and wide 12-sided, 22” deep kilns. If you fire ware of a particular size such as tiles or bowls, plan the kiln load on paper. Draw diagrams of different sized kiln shelves and determine how many pieces of ware will fit onto each shelf. You may find that the ware fires most efficiently in a particular size kiln. For instance, the 10- and 12-sided kilns can both fire 10 in. bowls. But since both kilns fire four bowls per shelf, the bowls fire more efficiently in the 10-sided kiln than in the 12-sided. The 10-sided kiln is also a good choice for those who need short firing cycles. Since 10-sided kilns are smaller than 12-sided, they can heat and cool faster. In addition, kiln shelves for 10-sided kilns are lighter than those for 12-sided kilns and are easier to lift.\nWill you need a new circuit installed for your kiln? This may affect your choice of kilns. Only a licensed electrician should install a new circuit. Use copper wiring, not aluminum. Homes in the U.S. and Canada usually receive 120/240 volts. If your studio is in a business district, strip mall, or school, it is likely that your voltage is 208, not 240. It is important that you know your voltage before ordering the kiln. 208 volt and 240 volt circuits use the same wall outlets, so you can’t visually tell them apart. Call your power company or electrician if you are not sure about your voltage or phase. If you fire a 240 volt kiln on a 208 volt circuit, the kiln will fire slowly and may never reach maximum temperature. This is an expensive mistake, because you will need to order new elements of the correct voltage and possibly have the switch box rewired. Contrary to logic, 240 volt kilns do not necessarily fire hotter or faster than 120 volt kilns. Some 120 volt kilns can reach 1000° F. in five minutes!\n4) Round or Square\nOn a per-cubic-foot basis, the “round” kilns (6-, 7-, 8-, 10- and 12-sided) are less expensive than the square because they are easier to build. Ceramists usually buy the round models while schools and potters sometimes buy the large square kilns, because they are especially durable and slow cooling.\n5) Top- or Front-loading\nFront-loading kilns are preferred for enameling, where pieces are removed from the kiln at 1450° F. This would be difficult with a top-loading kiln since the heat rises when you open the lid. Ceramists typically use the small front loaders for glaze testing and small pieces. Large front-loading studio kilns are easier to load than top-loading models because you don’t have to bend down into the kiln.\n6) Firebrick or Ceramic Fiber\nThough ceramic fiber heats and cools faster, insulated firebrick (used in most kilns) outlasts ceramic fiber. So each material has its advantages. In addition, heating elements are easy to replace in a firebrick kiln, because they are exposed in firebrick grooves. Most ceramic fiber kilns use elements embedded into the ceramic fiber. Therefore, these elements cannot be replaced. Instead, the ceramic fiber firing chamber and elements are replaced as a single unit.\n7) Insulating Firebrick Wall Thickness\nMost ceramic kiln walls are either 2½” or 3” thick. Kilns with 3\" walls and lid take slightly less energy to fire due to the extra insulation. However, their main advantage is that they reach a higher temperature than their 2½” counterparts. They also cool more slowly, which is important when firing heavy pieces prone to cracking and for special glaze effects. To fire stoneware or porcelain, buy a kiln with walls at least 3” thick.\n8) Manual or Automatic\nMost manual-fire kilns operate with infinite control switches, the type used on electric ranges. They contain a bi-metallic timer that cycles on and off. As you turn the switch clockwise, the heating elements stay on longer and longer. On High, the elements stay on continuously. Manual-fire kilns are gradually being replaced by automatic models. If you are planning on a manual-fire because that is what you are accustomed to, at least consider an automatic kiln. Once you understand them, automatic kilns are easier to use than manual kilns. Before making your final decision, ask your dealer to demonstrate an automatic kiln for you. Automatic kilns are of two general types: mechanical and digital. Mechanical automatics use timers to advance the switch settings and the Dawson Kiln Sitter to turn the kiln off. Digital kilns use an electronic controller. Some people think mechanical kilns are more reliable than digital kilns. It is true that the wiring of a digital kiln is more complicated than that of most manual-fire kilns. Digital kilns use a transformer and relays, which are often not needed in a mechanical kiln. However, digital kilns are reliable if designed properly. Ceramists have been firing them successfully for over two decades. Digital kilns are also easier to repair than some people think. The heart of the system is a small circuit board that, in a well-designed kiln, can be removed in minutes and repaired or replaced. The biggest mistake kiln operators make is assuming that an automatic kiln will shut off as it should every time. Every automatic kiln needs human monitoring, especially near the shut-off time. So even though the kiln you are buying is automatic, plan to be near it at the end of firing. If the kiln takes longer than expected, look through the peephole at the pyrometric cones on the shelf. The cones will warn you if the kiln has fired to maturity and should be shut off manually. Once you begin to understand the reasons for so many different types of kilns, choosing the best one for you will be easy.\n• • • • • • • • • • • •\nSo I bought a kiln… Now what?\nA guide to The Ceramic Shop’s kiln purchasing policies and procedures\nHow long will it take to get my kiln?\nAll kiln manufacturers make kilns to order, which means they will make your kiln specifically for you, to your specifications. This means if you have ordered a kiln online, you will be charged at that time, although your kiln will take anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks to build. Please note that most kilns are constructed closer to the 4-week time table; please take your studio needs into consideration when preparing to buy a kiln! Because lead times vary by manufacturer, don't hesitate to give us a call for a more accurate estimate.\nOccasionally, we do have smaller test kilns and sometimes even larger models in stock – in those cases, we can ship directly to you as soon as possible. When your kiln is complete and has been shipped, The Ceramic Shop or the kiln manufacturer will contact you. Please be ready for it on arrival! If you have ordered a kiln and haven’t heard from us, that doesn’t mean that we haven’t processed your order. Because the turn-around can take up to 4 weeks, we do our best to process all kiln orders within 24 hours of receiving them.\nWhat do I need for the arrival of my kiln?\nWell, you need to be available most importantly. Either The Ceramic Shop or your kiln manufacturer will be in touch with you once your kiln has shipped. Keep in mind that a 7-cubic-ft kiln packaged on a skid with a furniture kit can weigh up to 500 lbs! We suggest that you have a box cutter, drill, hammer, and at least one other person to help unbox and set up your kiln. Please keep in mind that it is NOT the responsibility of the trucking company to do anything but deliver the kiln to your address at the curb. This means that if you are having a kiln shipped to an address that does NOT have a loading dock, you need to make sure to order a lift gate service, which transports the freight from the truck to ground level. You can order this service through us here at The Ceramic Shop.\nWhat should I do when my kiln arrives?\nIt is in your best interest to thoroughly inspect the kiln for damage immediately. This means completely removing all packaging and inspecting the inside of the kiln, as well.\nWhat if my kiln arrives and it is damaged?\nUPON DELIVERY: All of our kiln manufacturers, including Skutt, Paragon, L&L, etc., pack their merchandise so that it will, ideally, arrive at its destination undamaged. However, accidents happen and you should be prepared to inspect the freight for damage right away – ideally, while the carrier is still present. If the freight – your kiln – appears to be damaged, you DO have the option of refusing delivery. Check to make sure that all of your items have been delivered, and note on the carrier’s delivery receipt any shortages. If any damage appears on the OUTSIDE of the package, have the driver inspect the packages and note on the carrier’s delivery receipt the damage. Immediately after delivery, open ALL cartons to determine if there is any concealed damage. If this is the case, retain all damaged items with their packaging.\nCall the freight carrier to report damage and request an inspection within 24 hours. If a call is made later than 36 hours, the carrier can deny your claim.\nConfirm your call in writing by registered mail and keep a copy for your records.\nUPON CARRIER INSPECTION: Retain your damaged merchandise even though the inspection has been completed. Damaged items cannot be used or disposed of without written permission from the carrier. Do not return damaged items to the shipper without written authorization from the supplier (in this case, your kiln manufacturer). If the damaged items are picked up by the carrier for salvage, secure the receipt.\nDOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR FILING A FREIGHT CLAIM:\nYour carrier's loss or damage claim form\nShipper's original invoice or copy\nOriginal bill of lading\nOriginal paid freight bill\nCarrier's inspection report\nREMEMBER: It is the customer’s responsibility to file any claim. Here at The Ceramic Shop, we are willing to help you in collecting claims but this does not make us responsible for collection of claims or replacement of materials damaged or lost. We apologize, but we cannot make freight claims for customers.\nI received my kiln a month ago and haven’t used it yet. When I opened it for the first time, I noticed that some of the bricks are cracked. I want a new one!\nIn the event that you discover possible damage well after delivery, The Ceramic Shop and your kiln manufacturer are no longer liable. Please be sure to thoroughly inspect your kiln as soon as you receive it. Carriers generally only extend a maximum time frame of 36 hours in which to file a claim following delivery of your kiln.\n\"How To Choose An Electric Kiln\" supplied by Paragon."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7ec81914-a9d9-42e2-aefe-7123b7183de0>","<urn:uuid:4c642bcd-2473-4c82-95f6-6e2216dadf16>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cómo se diferencia el propósito original de Heermance Farm del de West Pennard Court Barn? 📚","answer":"Heermance Farm was established to grow specialty and exotic produce specifically for NYC chefs, collaborating with them to grow unusual crops like galangal and Thai ginger. In contrast, West Pennard Court Barn served as a tithe barn for Glastonbury Abbey, designed to store tithes (agricultural taxes) collected from West Bradley parish, representing a traditional agricultural storage facility rather than a specialized growing operation.","context":["In the Hudson River Valley, there lives a farm loved by New York City chefs, growing produce not typically considered local. Heermance Farm cultivates crops like galangal, Thai ginger, Tulsi basil and salsify, working with chefs to continually add new produce to their repertoire.\n“Because we grow for chefs, we’re able to sort of be daring, and together we wanted to challenge ourselves to discover what was being overlooked,” says Farm Manager Kevin Ferry. “We’re very good at coloring outside of the lines, so we invite chef collaborators to the canvas. Every year or season these chefs are defining new trends in culinary expression, and we are always willing to explore.”\nEdible Manhattan caught up with Ferry to discuss what’s they’re currently cultivating, hydroponic farming and where you can try Heermance’s produce in NYC.\nWhat specialty vegetables are you growing right now?\nRight now, our greenhouses are full of specialty crops, from Malabar spinach and galangal to turmeric and lemongrass. But I’m really excited this year about a new set of epicurean rarities we’re growing that fell out of standard growing practices over many generations—crops like crosnes (pronounced croans), skirret and salsify, which were once medieval staples or even traveled on the old exploring trade routes from east Asia and adopted into French country gardens. We’re planning to save those seeds and propagate them, too.\nWe’re on the heels of the warmer summer months, so while we’re distributing the last of our winter storage crops, we’re seeding constantly. We’re really looking forward to seeing the results of this one squash trial seed we ordered from Dan Barber’s seed company Row 7. His seeds have been a real pleasure to grow because, as a chef, he’s looking for a squash that can be consumed at different stages of its growth, prepared with skin on, etc.\nHas Heermance always supplied produce to NYC restaurants? Did you notice more demand when you began offering specialty produce?\nIt’s sort of the other way around; we’ve always considered the specialty crops to be our main focus. The nice thing is that chefs are shopping for their staples, too, so they might come to Heermance for edible flowers or shiso, but they also wind up wanting our fingerling potatoes and other essentials.\nWhat are the top veggies Heermance sells to NYC chefs?\nIt depends on the time of year. Heirloom tomatoes are the queens of summer. But in the spring, everyone loves carrots‑little, tender baby carrots are vibrant and versatile. Also, broccoli and an array of Asian cabbages and greens. We actually grow all year long in our greenhouses, so in February, chefs want anything green because it’s hard to come by anything green locally in this region during those frigid weeks. This past winter the demand for fresh baby lettuce heads was higher than we’ve ever seen.\nIn terms of flavor or the quality of restaurant dishes, how does buying specialty vegetables locally impact dishes versus getting that produce imported from their countries of origin?\nThere’s no comparison. All it takes is one bite into a flavorless, watery beefsteak tomato that lost half its vitamins traveling across the country to know the value in ripe, local produce. Of course, there are things chefs can do to improve the taste, like roasting tomatoes to bring out the sugar, but it’s not the same.\nI would say the difference starts with the smell and then the feel. When you walk into our greenhouses and really take a full deep breath and pick fresh, aromatic Tulsi basil in March, it’s like seeing in color for the first time, like that scene in the Wizard of Oz. It’s like entering paradise, and we’re able to send part of that special place to our restaurants. I love it.\nHow many pounds of veggies do you guys sell to NYC chefs on a weekly basis?\nThat changes per season. In the winter, we’re selling a lot of kale, winter squash, heirloom potatoes, bok choy, lettuce and things that are just lighter. Most of our produce are in fresh pick units like pieces, cases or bunches or even edible flowers and microgreens in small boxes.\nWhat about the Hudson River Valley is good for growing these exotic vegetables?\nGrowing vegetables in general is something that the beautifully rich soils of the Hudson River Valley accommodate so well. But when I think of exotic vegetables, I think of ones that are grown in warmer climates. We’re USDA Zone 5b, and that’s only going to get warmer, but our outdoor growing season isn’t long enough to support something like a field of artichokes (although we do grow a few every year). So we grow our “exotic” vegetables in our greenhouses all year long, but our fields are always full of heirloom vegetables during the warmer months.\nHeermance Farm practices hydroponic farming. What does that mean, and what effect does it have on your produce?\nOne of our greenhouses is hydroponic, and a lot of people have this idea that hydroponics occurs in a sci-fi lab, but it’s actually a very natural environment full of life, the roots just don’t touch soil. We blend nutritious tea out of compost where our wriggler worms are thriving, we’ve used seaweed and molasses, which are rich in trace minerals and macro nutrients, respectively. We take hydroponics at its literal Greek translation which is “working water.” Based on the cultivar, we add a specific mixture of fertilizer nutrients.\nRight now, we’re harvesting hydroponic zucchini, broccoli, Romanesco, bok choy and lots of other things. We’re able to control the levels of nutrition the plants are receiving, so instead of undergoing a rainy period in the field where the plant is taking up a lot of water and not necessarily a ton of nutrients because they’re being lost in the runoff, we’re able to maintain a steady supply of nutrition that creates a more consistently nourished, and therefore more flavorful, vegetable.\nIn what restaurants in NYC can our readers taste your produce?\nWe’ve been really lucky to have developed a nice relationship with Daniel Boulud’s Dinex Restaurant Group, so you can find our produce at Daniel Restaurant, as well as Le Pavillon near Grand Central Station. We recently started selling to the Russian Tea Room, which is such an iconic place. We also sell frequently to Gotham on 12th Street and Frevo in Greenwich Village.\nFeature photo courtesy of Heermance Farms.","West Pennard Court Barn\nHistory, tourist information, and nearby accommodation\nThe barn belonged to Glastonbury Abbey and is one of 4 surviving barns once owned by the Abbey. It was probably built by the Sacrist of Glastonbury Abbey or his lessee and was intended to hold tithes from West Bradley parish. It is symmetrical in design, with a threshing bay in the centre.\nAt one end of the barn was a dovecote and you can still see remains of nesting boxes built into the barn gable end where the dovecote was subsequently lowered. The dovecote was altered in the 18th century to a calf house.\nThe keeping of pigeons was a status symbol, and only lords of a manor were allowed to maintain a dovecote. In this case, the Sacrist acted as lord of the manor. The West Pennard dovecote is unusual in that it was rectangular with gable ends, whereas most medieval dovecotes were circular.\nThe barn is built of blue lias stone with freestone dressing, under a roof topped with stone tiles on the bottom two courses and clay tiles above. There are porches in both the south and north walls. Each porch is supported by a pair of buttresses. The interior features cruck trusses set upon wooden blacks at the top of the walls, rising to collar beams and arch braces above.\nIn the Victorian period, the barn formed part of the rectory glebe. The barn was restored by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in 1938 and then granted to the National Trust.\nAdmission by arrangement only. Keyholder is nearby. Also note that the barn is located in a farm field which may be damp in wet weather, so good footwear is advisable.\nAfter many years of being looked after by the National Trust, the barn no longer appears on the Trust website and there are no details of current opening availability. We'll try to find out more and post an update on this page.\nIt appears that the barn is open, but only by prior arrangement with the keyholder, in the farm beside the barn. Please contact:\nCourt Barn Farm\nThe exterior of the barn is easily visible from Scott's Lane, or from a public footpath immediately south of the barn.\nAbout West Pennard Court Barn\nAddress: West Pennard, Glastonbury, Somerset, England, BA6 8LR\nAttraction Type: Historic Building\nPhoto Credit: Virginia Knight, licensed for reuse under the Creative Commons Licence\nWe've 'tagged' this attraction information to help you find related historic attractions and learn more about major time periods mentioned.\nHistoric Time Periods:\nFind other attractions tagged with:\nNEARBY HISTORIC ATTRACTIONS\nHeritage Rated from 1- 5 (low-exceptional) on historic interest\nGlastonbury Tor - 2.4 miles (Countryside)\nChalice Well and Gardens - 2.7 miles (Garden)\nGlastonbury Tribunal - 3.1 miles (Museum)\nGlastonbury Abbey - 3.2 miles (Abbey)\nWells Bishop's Palace - 5.4 miles (Historic Building)\nWells Cathedral - 5.5 miles (Cathedral)\nBurcott Mill - 5.5 miles (Historic Building)\nMilton Lodge Gardens - 6.2 miles (Garden)\nNearest Accommodation to West Pennard Court Barn:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0aa6fae2-8315-4344-88a2-77de9e8bccb7>","<urn:uuid:b88cb241-4867-456e-8c0f-67ea3ae721ba>"],"error":null}

{"question":"As someone studying WWII history, what were the contrasts between the treatment of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii versus the mainland US during the internment period?","answer":"There was a stark difference in treatment. On Hawaii, where the Pearl Harbor attack occurred, very few Japanese were rounded up as they were considered vital to the economy and war effort, and faced little discrimination. In contrast, on the mainland US, around 120,000 Japanese-Americans were forcibly moved to 10 relocation camps, with much of the resentment stemming from pre-war economic success of Japanese businesses. The mainland internment was done mainly out of war hysteria for propaganda purposes, not due to actual security threats.","context":["|Gwen Coffin with Senator Bob Packwood|\nFebruary 19 marked the 75th anniversary of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal of any or all people from military areas “as deemed necessary or desirable.” The military then defined the entire West Coast, home to the majority of Americans of Japanese ancestry or citizenship, as a military area. And although race or ethnicity were not mentioned in the order, the Japanese-Americans on the West Coast—citizens or no—were targeted for removal.\nIn the middle of a “just war” against Fascism and Imperial Japanese expansion over peoples across the Pacific, Gwen Coffin, the editor of the Wallowa County Chieftain, rose to challenge President Roosevelt and Executive Order 9066. From his far outpost in Wallowa County he spoke to remind people of who we are and why we were fighting. It was a brave thing to do. I remember him saying once, with a chuckle, that the barber would not cut his hair; I am sure there were more serious threats.\nIn the troubled times in which we live, when religion and national origin are again topics of the day, and again related to real battles with real bullets, it is worth carefully reading Gwen Coffin’s courageous words of April 8, 1943:\n“Much of the resentment on the West Coast toward the Japanese was not the outgrowth of the war but arose during peacetime as the Japanese achieved some success and prominence in their pursuit of agriculture and trade. Many employers preferred to see the Japanese remain in the ranks of the low paid wage earners. Others were resentful at the sight of Japanese prospering….\n“It is foreign to our conceptions of democracy, however, to distinguish between peoples on the basis of color or nationality. There should be only one test for the right to share in the opportunities which this country provides, and that is the test of belief in our democratic ideals and government, and a willingness to work with other Americans to further those ideals and to support this government.”\nThis anniversary reminded me that we addressed WW II in 1994, at the seventh annual Summer Fishtrap Gathering at Wallowa Lake. My vivid memories of that July meeting involve three people: Jean Wakatsuki Houston, Richard White, and Alvin Josephy. Houston had grown up during the War in a Japanese Internment camp in California, and written a book about it, Farewell to Manzanar. Manzanar is most widely known as the site of one of ten camps in the United States of America to which over 110,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly moved and then held under Order 9066 during World War II.\nAnd I remember historian Richard White telling us that the Japanese in America were not a threat—any with dangerous ties to the Japanese government were known to our government, and if Americans of Japanese ancestry were serious threats, those on Hawaii should also have been rounded up and incarcerated. They were not, because the Japanese there were crucial to the economy and our war effort.\nThe internment, White said, was done out of war hysteria for purposes of propaganda.\nAs it turned out of course, many Japanese-Americans served with great distinction in the European theater, no Japanese Americans were prosecuted for spying, and, in 1988, President Reagan apologized and awarded $20,000 to each of over 100,000 camp detainees still alive at the time.\nFinally, I remember Alvin Josephy playing his recording of the Marine landing at Guam. Alvin, a Marine Corps Combat Correspondent, had walked the last quarter mile with a microphone covered by a condom against the seawater, tethered to the recording machine in the belly of a halftrack by a 40-foot cord. He said later that he became numb as he talked his way to shore, passing bodies of comrades—over 20 of the 32 on his boat were hit in that quarter mile. On the day in 1994, tears in his eyes as he and we listened to a recording of shouts and cries, gunfire and engine noise, he rose and said that “some of us felt guilty about coming home alive.”\nHe stepped down from the stage, where Jean Wakatsuki Houston stood to give him a hug, tears in her eyes too.\nI replayed all of this in my mind as I listened to news reports on Sunday, February 19, the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066. World War II was a dangerous juncture in our nation’s history. Thousands of Americans and millions of Germans, Russians, French, English, Japanese and others died in that War.\nThere were heroes in the War, as in any war. Alvin Josephy would not have called himself a hero, but in my mind he was, putting his own life on the line to write about his fellow Marines, and to remind them and the American public of how and what they were fighting for. Gwen Coffin was a hero too, reminding us of our better selves in a time when it was not easy or popular to do so.\n# # #","Manzanar National Historic Site in California preserves a “relocation camp” but many would refer to it as an internment camp or even a prison camp – something we certainly hadn’t expected to see in the United States. 6200 acres in the Owens Valley surrounded by barbed wire, Manzanar housed over 10,000 people between 1942 and 1945 – over 70% United States citizens – in 36 blocks of military style barracks.\nAfter the bombing of Pearl Harbor, there was increasing resentment and fear of the Japanese-American population in California and the other western states. On February 19, 1942 United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing the Secretary of War to remove any or all Japanese from the west coast.\nSubsequently, 120,000 people were moved to 10 relocation camps in the interior of the country.\nNot convicted of any crime, other than their heritage, Japanese Americans and Japanese aliens were rounded up – men, women and children – and sent to these camps. They were told that they weren’t prisoners, even though surrounded by barbed wire. They were told that they were brought to these camps for their own protection, even though the guards had their guns pointed inward at the “residents” rather than outward.\nManzanar: The Good\nImagine – today you go to work or school, enjoy your home, visit friends and neighbors, live a simple life. Then, the government – your government – rounds you up and sends you far away to live in a 20 x 100 tarpaper shack. Multiple families sharing the same building with no privacy, where they had to endure communal bathrooms, “mess halls” with military-style rations and limited medical care.\nSo where is the good in this?\nWe saw it as a testimonial to the resilience and inner fortitude of people. Rather than simply give up, the people in these camps worked hard to make life better. They worked to plug the gaping holes in their barracks to protect themselves from the elements. They rigged blankets to separate their living spaces to get a little bit of privacy for their families. They built furniture from scrap lumber and discarded crates. And they planted gardens – a victory garden for food and relaxation gardens where residents could, even if just for a moment, forget their surroundings.\nThe kids went to school. They started clubs. They played baseball. They had a jazz band and hosted dances. They got married, had children. And they didn’t stop being Americans.\nOf course it was terrible, but they made the best of what they had – something we can only hope that we would do if we were faced with a situation like this. Its really a great example of the old saying: “When life gives you apples, make applesauce.”\nFar too late the American government finally did try to make it right. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act. This offered a formal apology and paid $20,000 in compensation to each survivor of the camps.\nManzanar: The Bad\nLooking at this from a different perspective, one of things we learned was that even though there was a very large population of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii, where the attack took place, there was very little discrimination there and very few of the Japanese were rounded up. There, they were considered part of the fabric of the community.\nMany say that on the mainland, much of the resentment had been building towards the Japanese because of their successful businesses. So it wasn’t just the war… that may have been the breaking point.\nThe sad thing was that everything that they did under the guise of Executive Order 9066 was against the constitution of the United States. These were citizens of the United States, imprisoned without due process of law. There were over a dozen protections guaranteed by the US constitution that were conveniently ignored.\nManzanar: The Ugly\nConditions in the camps sucked… When they first moved in, the barracks weren’t even complete. It was up to the first “volunteers” who arrived to finish them – seal the cracks in the walls, build steps up to the doors, fix the leaky roofs.\nThe location wasn’t chosen for comfort… the temperature varied from freezing and hot, with winds that blew the never-ending dust through every crack. Nothing about the camp made life easy.\nTerrible conditions, family separation, lack of privacy, loss of self-worth and hope did force some to suicide and others to resist. Finally the government began letting people leave, but only if they could show they had a job and a sponsor.\nQuote from Shizuo Hori, a resident / detainee: After being allowed to leave Manzanar, he went to Chicago. He wrote to a friend back in Manzanar and said: “Manzanar life is easy, but it isn’t living. Life out here isn’t easy, but it is life in America.”\nIn 1945 when the camps closed, those who remained were given $25, one-way train or bus fare and some food. Many left, but many had nowhere to go and refused to leave what had become the only home they had. So once again the government forcibly moved them.\nManzanar is a good reminder … as one of our friends said “those who don’t remember history, may well repeat it.” We hope not.\nWe would highly recommend it for a visit. It’s easily accessible off the 395. The visitor center is in the old dance hall, with a good movie and very interesting exhibits. We were particularly interested in the panels that talked about how Canada and Latin America also discriminated against the Japanese at that time. Many Latin American countries sent their Japanese to the US relocation camps. Canada expelled all of them from British Columbia, stripping them of their homes and businesses and sending them inland to internment camps and farms – some there until 1949. It was a part of Canadian history we weren’t aware of.\nAfter the visitor center, take a look around the reconstructed barracks, privies and mess hall. There are tons of interesting stories here.\nThen take the 3 1/2 mile self-guided tour around the periphery of the camp. It is still ringed by barbed wire and you can see the old guard tower at the gate. The drive really gives you a vision of how large it was.\nWe were there in 100+ heat, so we drove, but it would be a lovely walk or run in another season.\nNational Park Service Rangers\nBe sure to plan some extra time just to talk with the rangers. They were really interesting to talk with and helped give a much better perspective on what we had seen. They know so much more about the park than you can possibly learn by simply looking at the exhibits. We always try to engage them and hear what they find interesting about their park.\nOne of the interesting stories they told us was about the pay rates. Most of the people in the camp did jobs and were paid a pittance. The highest paid couldn’t make over what the lowest paid military member was paid, so the maximum pay was $19 per month. That’s what an internee teacher was paid, compared to a teacher coming in from outside the camp who was paid $250 per month!\nTen Relocation Centers\nIf you want to learn more about the Japanese interment, there were actually ten Relocation Centers, some of which you can still visit today.\n- Gila River War Relocation Center, Arizona\n- Granada War Relocation Center, Colorado\n- Heart Mountain War Relocation Center, Wyoming\n- Jerome War Relocation Center, Arkansas\n- Manzanar National Historic Site, California\n- Minidoka National Historic Site, Idaho\n- Poston War Relocation Center, Arizona\n- Rohwer War Relocation Center, Arkansas\n- Topaz War Relocation Center, Utah\n- Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, California\nResilience of another kind…\nWhile you are in the area, we highly recommend taking a detour to see the ancient Bristlecone Pines National Forest located 45 minutes east of the 395, south of Bishop, California.\nThese trees, growing only at 10,000 feet and above, are the oldest growing things on the planet. At least one has been dated to 4,600 years old and is still alive. They grow best when conditions are worst – taking root on Dolomite rock and thriving because nothing else can live there!\nTheir tough skin and resilience made us think of the Japanese who found ways to thrive in the harshest conditions."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:169ffa4d-1ce3-4837-b8ef-c9fbb4d1c2db>","<urn:uuid:d1604b37-7065-4cdb-b84c-9637fae29856>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do natural and cultural eutrophication differ in terms of their timescales and impacts on aquatic ecosystems?","answer":"Natural and cultural eutrophication differ significantly in their progression and effects. Natural eutrophication is a slow, gradual process that occurs as lakes age, allowing organisms time to adapt to changes. In contrast, cultural eutrophication happens very rapidly due to human-caused nutrient pollution, particularly from fertilizers and sewage rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. Because of its speed, cultural eutrophication doesn't give organisms time to adapt, leading to widespread death. This accelerated process triggers rapid algal blooms that block sunlight, causing underwater plants to die. As bacteria decompose the dead organic matter, they deplete oxygen, creating dead zones where fish and other oxygen-breathing organisms cannot survive. The dramatic ecosystem disruption from cultural eutrophication can lead to complete ecosystem collapse.","context":["Fertilizers cause problems with water quality when they runoff into rivers or percolate into groundwater. In fact, agriculture (including livestock agriculture) is the largest source of nonpoint water pollution in the US. (For information on water flows and water quality in the US, you can visit a web site maintained by the USGS - click water data.)\nThere are basically two types of water pollution, in terms of their sources, and each is responsible for approximately half of the water pollution in the US:\nPoint source pollution, which, as the name implies, is pollution that comes from a discrete source, such as where a pipe carrying factory wastes dumps into a river.\nNonpoint source pollution, again as the name implies, is pollution that comes from more diffuse sources, such as runoff from parking lots and roads, or from agricultural fields.\nNitrates (as in fertilizers containing NO3- ) are highly water soluble, and so move readily with surface runoff into rivers or with water percolating through the soil profile into the groundwater below. A 1998 assessment of nonpoint sources of N and P to waters in the US (conducted by the Ecological Society of America; see supplementary reading list) determined that only about 18% of the nitrogen that is applied to fields as fertilizers leaves the fields in the form of produce. This means that the remaining 82% is left behind as residue or in soils, where it either accumulates, erodes with soil (often to surface waters), leaches to groundwater, or volatilizes into the atmosphere (sometimes in forms that contribute to acidic deposition, formation of tropospheric ozone, or act as \"greenhouse gases.\"). [Elsewhere, I have read estimates that say that 40 - 60% of nitrogen applied as fertlizers is actually used by plants, with the remainder left being in soil or otherwise lost from the system....And, more recently, given improvements in efficiency of fertilizer application in the US, it appears that most of the applied nitrogen IS removed with the agricultural outputs [Science Vitousek article 2009] -- not so for China, however!\nMuch of the concern about fertilizers and water quality relates to nitrates, which can cause health problems in humans (as well as other problems, described below). When ingested, nitrates are converted into nitrite in the intestine, which then combines with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin. Methemoglobin has a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, and is particularly problematic in children, who are most readily affected by this \"nitrite poisoning\" or \"blue baby syndrome.\" Elevated levels of nitrate are common in groundwater in agricultural areas; maybe some of you use well water in your homes, and are familiar with the need to have the water tested for nitrate if you live in an agricultural region. (We drink well water at my home, and have our water tested fairly regularly for NO3 and other contaminants.)\nLevels of nitrate in water that aren't harmful to humans may be harmful to some species of amphibians. You may know that amphibians around the world are in decline -- much unexplained illness, death, reproductive failure, and deformity. Dr. Andy Blaustein here at Oregon State University is involved in studies of these declines, and points out that different factors are probably important to various degrees in various places. However, his lab group has reported that certain amphibians here in western Oregon are sensitive to nitrates and nitrites at concentrations that are considered very modest by human standards. It may not be coincidence that one of the species that has disappeared most alarmingly from much of its historical range [the Oregon spotted frog], which is lowlands that are now under intensive agriculture, is especially sensitive to nitrogen in the water.\nPhosphates are also applied abundantly in fertilizer, and contaminate water. Unlike nitrate, however, phosphate is not water soluble, so moves only with soil movement , as it adheres to soil particles. It is the least plentiful of the \"big three\" nutrients (N, P, and K), and phosphate shortages are already realities in some portions of the world (e.g., parts of Africa). When it erodes on soils from agricultural fields, it is essentially nonrecoverable, washing into sediments in oceans. Recent (2001) attempts to estimate the global P budget conclude that P is accumulating in the world's soils (that is, inputs, largely from fertilizers, animal feeds, and animal wastes, are greater than removals in harvested crops and meat). The result of this imbalance between input and output is that the net P storage in soil and fresh water ecosystems of the world is estimated to be about 75% higher than during preindustrial times. A large portion of this P accumulation is in agricultural soils, as might be expected. A major problem associated with this increased P content of soils is that any factors that increase soil erosion will also increase runoff of P with soil to streams, rivers, lakes and coastal regions.\nThe runoff of nitrate and phosphate into lakes and streams fertilizes them, and causes accelerated eutrophication (eu = true or well; trophy = food) or enrichment of the waters.\nEutrophication is a natural process that typically occurs as lakes age. However, human-caused, accelerated eutrophication (called \"cultural eutrophication\") occurs more rapidly, and causes problems in the affected water bodies, as described below. It is estimated that 50-70% of all nutrients reaching surface water (principally N and P) originate on agricultural land as fertilizers or animal waste. (In the US, farm animals produce about 130 times as much waste as the country's people do! As of 2006, hogs in North Carolina alone produced as much feces and urine daily as do the combined human populations of New York + Los Angeles + Chicago + Houston!) One clear example of agriculturally-related inputs is the Lake Erie basin, where farms (crop and livestock) are estimated to contribute as much nitrogen to the lake as would the sewage of 20 million people, twice the population of the Lake Erie basin!\nUrban and industrial runoff also contribute to eutrophication. You have probably heard of the bans on (or reductions in allowed amounts of) phosphates from detergents? Those bans arose because of concerns about cultural eutrophication. Sewage discharges also contribute to eutrophication. These are largely point sources though, and have been easier to control than nonpoint, diffuse sources such as agricultural runoff.\nIn general, excess N is particularly a problem in coastal marine regions, where N is often more limiting than P, whereas excess P is more threatening to freshwater systems.\nRich nutrient input stimulates growth of algae which change the lake or stream as their populations increase. This is particularly the case when they undergo population explosions, referred to as \"blooms.\" Basically, the fertilizers make the lake more productive, as they stimulate algal primary productivity.\nHowever, from a multiple use perspective, such stimulation has undesirable consequences:\n(1) Penetration of light into the water is diminished. This occurs because the algae forms mats as a result of being produced faster than they are consumed. Diminished light penetration decreases the productivity of plants living in the deeper waters (and hence their production of oxygen).\n(2) The water becomes depleted in oxygen. When the abundant algae die and decompose, much oxygen is consumed by those decomposers. Oxygen in the water is also lowered by the lack of primary production in the darkened, deeper waters.\n(3) Lowered oxygen results in the death of fish that need high levels of dissolved oxygen (\"DO\"), such as trout, salmon and other desirable sport fish. The community composition of the water body changes, with fish that can tolerate low DO, such as carp predominating. As you can imagine, changes in fish communities have ramifications for the rest of the aquatic ecosystem as well, acting at least in part through changes in food webs.\n(4) Further, some of the algal species that \"bloom\" produce toxins that render the water unpalatable.\nEssentially, the entire aquatic ecosystem changes with eutrophication.\nMany aquatic systems have been cleaned up dramatically as result of new and improved sewage treatment plants, the improved control over point sources of pollutants, and regulation of pollutants such as phosphate in detergents. (Much of the improvement came about as a result of passage and implementation of the US Clean Water Act in 1972.) A dramatic example in the US is the recovery of Lake Erie.\nThe Clean Water Act has, however, been unable to address adequately the control of nonpoint sources of pollutants, such as agricultural inputs. Further, it affects only the waters of the US. Hence, eutrophication and other water quality problems attributable to such sources continue to threaten aquatic systems.\nFor example, the Mississippi River carries so much nitrogen (and phosphorus) that each summer a \"dead zone\" the size of New Jersey forms in the Gulf of Mexico, where the river empties. The zone is usually most apparent between approximately May and September, when runoff from snowmelt and spring rains brings an accumulation of nutrients to the river and thus to the Gulf. The warmer, lighter river water spreads out over the heavier salt water, and, since the river water is so enriched with nitrogen and other nutrients, it feeds massive blooms of algae near the surface. When the algae die, sink to the bottom and are decomposed, the decomposers use tremendous quantities of oxygen, depleting its concentration in the water. This zone is devoid of bottom-dwelling fish and crustaceans, such as shrimp, which can't compete with the decomposers for oxygen. The low oxygen region isn't confined just to the depths, but in some years, extends to within several meters of the surface. The anoxic (zone with essentially zero dissolved oxygen) and hypoxic (< 2 ppm dissolved O2) zones dissipate later in the autumn, when winds, currents, and temperature conditions foster mixing of the water (the vertical temperature-induced stratification breaks up, allowing mixing of oxygen-rich surface waters with deeper, oxygen-poor waters). There are serious concerns that Louisiana's valuable coastal fisheries are imperiled-- as is true for the Chesapeake Bay and other regions where such dead zones occur.\n\"Dead zones\" have been reported from more than 400 areas around the world (Science 15 Aug. 08), with more than 245,000 sq km of ocean being affected. The number of \"dead zones\" has increased nearly exponentially since the 1960's -- approximately doubling every decade [UNEP 2003; BiioScience July '05].\nAs you may have heard, during several recent summers, beginning in ~ 2002, a zone of hypoxic waters (waters with low dissolved oxygen concentrations) has been reported off the Oregon and Washington Coasts. These events have adverse consequences for fisheries such as crabs, but the cause hasn't been clear, and river deposition of excess fertiity seemed unlikely as a cause. It appears that what happens is this: This region of the coast experiences frequent upwelling of nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor water from the deep, which fertilizes phytoplankton (floating algae) and causes their populations to grow rapidly (\"bloom\"). Typically, however, upwelling is interrupted every couple of weeks by a day or two in which the winds that drive upwelling slow, upwelling stop, and the organic matter that resulted from the nutrient enrichment can get carried out off the continental shelf to the deep ocean. These interruptions are known as \"relaxation events.\" In several recent years, however, there have been fewer relaxation events, so the decomposing organic material accumulates, decomposers consume oxygen, and you get the picture -- hypoxia results. In the summer of 2006, the hypoxia was particularly bad, and monitoring revealed that there was disappearance of fish and mass die-off of many bottom-dwelling marine orgnisms in near-shore rocky environments. The problem recedes in autumn, when winds shift direction and promote ocean currents that flush the hypoxic waters off of the continental shelf.\nA logical follow up question, of course, is \"what has caused the change in winds that drive upwelling?\" No one knows, with certainty at present. It is increasingly thought that the changing winds that have decreased the frequency of relaxation events may be the result of larger scale climate changes, in which case, may be essentially permament.\nStudies are ongoing to determine the sources of the excess nitrogen in the case of the Gulf of Mexico dead zone (and others, world wide). Sources of phosphorus are also being examined -- although phosphorus is generally less limiting to plant production in marine environments than is nitrogen, so less attention is paid to phosphorus in these cases. As nitrogen inputs cause nitrogen to be less-limiting, however, phosphorus can become limiting even in marine environments, such that enrichment with phosphorus can also be problematic [Science 2011, pg 505]. If we can learn sources for nitrogen or other nutrients, these problems can be controlled (with concerted efforts!), but you can imagine that it is difficult to do an accurate source apportionment, given the size of the Mississippi River watershed!\nThere is consensus, however, that much (if not most) of the nutrients (in the case of the Gulf of Mexico and most other similarly-affected regions) come from agricultural lands (including feedlots). Amazing as it may seem, the Mississippi River drains more than 55% of US agricultural lands! Other sources for nitrogen compounds include insufficiently-treated human wastes and the transportation and industrial sectors. A study by the US Army Corps on Engineers concluded that about 70 % of the nitrogen in the Mississippi River at its mouth comes from a six-state area in the cornbelt upstream (Cons. in Practice '02). The value of the excess N in the Mississippi River is estimated at ~ $750 (this being the amount that the equivalent amount of fertilizer would cost if purchased.) Oviously, it will pay farmers to keep the N in their fields rather than let it runoff or leach into the rivers.\nThe problem can be reduced by decreasing soil erosion (which carries fertilizer with it!) and increasing efficiency of fertilizer application. Various approaches include enhance vegetation buffers along the streams and rivers that feed this area; the plants should slow erosion and also take up some of the excess nutrients themselves. More efficient and well-timed application of fertilizers will also be important as a part of the control strategy. Wetland restoration and enhancement programs are also likely to be important, as wetlands are an important site of denitrification (the process by which bacteria reduce nitrates (NO3) to molecular N2 or N2O which are then volatilized into the atmosphere.) The Federal government might decide to provide funding to farmers to work on all of these efforts (maybe has, by now). See the article by Mitsch et al. (listed on the supplementary reading list for this part of the course) for more information on this issue.\nAll of these fertilizer-related problems can be minimized by more careful and efficient application of fertilizer and by soil conservation strategies (which decrease erosion and the associated transport of fertilizers) as we will discuss later when we explore prospects for alternative agriculture.\nTo move to the following section, which discusses consequences of fertilizer application for inherent soil fertility, click \">>\" at the bottom of this section; for reminders about general navigation, click \"Navigate,\" here.\nPage maintained by Patricia Muir at Oregon State University. Last updated Oct. 29, 2012.","What Is Nutrient Pollution of Water?\nA common way that humans pollute water is through the addition of nutrients (fertilizers and sewage) to water as nonpoint source pollution. These added materials are full of nitrogen and phosphorus, two nutrients that encourage the growth of aquatic producers, such as algae. The excessive growth of algae dramatically disrupts the entire ecosystem. Because this type of pollution results from excess nutrients, it’s called nutrient pollution.\nBodies of water naturally exist with different nutrient levels:\nWaters that have low levels of nutrients and, therefore, low numbers of producers and low biological productivity are called oligotrophic. Oligotrophic waters are clear without many microscopic algae plants.\nWaters that have high levels of nutrients and, therefore, high biological productivity with large algae populations are called eutrophic.\nThe transition from oligotrophic to eutrophic — called eutrophication —occurs naturally over time as a type of community succession in lakes and ponds. Additional sediment and nutrients enter the ecosystem via streams, rainwater runoff, and other sources. Eventually, the biological activity and plant growth in the lake or pond increase to a degree that it may no longer be a lake or pond, becoming instead a wetland.\nWhen humans pollute water with nutrients, this normally long, slow process of eutrophication occurs very rapidly and is called cultural eutrophication. The rate of cultural eutrophication is much faster than natural rates of eutrophication; as a result, the organisms in the ecosystem don’t have time to adapt to the changes and die. Here’s what the cultural eutrophication process looks like:\nPollution enters the water, adding sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus (the nutrients).\nThe added nutrients fuel algae growth; algae begin to reproduce in huge numbers, creating what’s often called an algae bloom.\nThe algae population continues to grow until it runs out of either nutrients or space — covering the surface of the water completely.\nExtensive algae across the surface of the water blocks sunlight from reaching organisms below the surface of the water, such as aquatic plants.\nUnderwater plants begin to die from lack of sunlight, while the large algae population, having reached its limit, also begins to die, sinking into the water where bacteria decompose it.\nDecomposition of dead plants and algae by bacteria consumes the dissolved oxygen in the water, creating oxygen sag conditions.\nFish and other oxygen-breathing organisms suffocate from lack of oxygen, and the entire aquatic ecosystem collapses, creating one big dead zone.\nCultural eutrophication doesn’t occur only in lakes. Coastal waters also experience the effects of nutrient pollution and cultural eutrophication. As a result, highly polluted areas of water become dead zones that don’t have enough oxygen to support a healthy aquatic ecosystem.\nOne of the most studied dead zones from nutrient pollution occurs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River flows into the gulf and brings with it nutrient runoff from agricultural fields in the Midwestern United States. For a long time, scientists didn’t understand what was causing huge numbers of fish to die off and whole regions of the Gulf of Mexico to display low levels of dissolved oxygen.\nAfter observing the ecosystem for a number of years, scientists realized that the worst dead zones occur after spring rains along the Mississippi River. These rains wash fertilizers and manure from agricultural fields into the river, which then carries these nutrients into the gulf. When these nutrients reach the gulf, the cycle of cultural eutrophication begins with an algae bloom and subsequent ecosystem disruption.\nThis pollution scenario isn’t unique to the Gulf of Mexico. It’s also common in other regions, such as the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. In most cases, the dead zones are a recurring event; after the ecosystem recovers, a fresh flow of nutrients occurs and the cycle repeats itself.\nMany cities have begun to monitor and limit the amount of nitrogen and other nutrients that enter nearby aquatic ecosystems in an effort to control nutrient pollution, oxygen sag, and cultural eutrophication. Another way to solve this type of water pollution problem is by finding ways to clean sewage and wastewater before it enters and damages an ecosystem."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a40fbe5d-f3eb-4b82-a4a4-a9eabdaec033>","<urn:uuid:59cb45f9-b7bc-4997-9944-bc70e867aaf1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"how does natural gas affect boiler heat compared to coal???","answer":"Firing natural gas causes a significant change to the boiler heat profile compared to coal. Natural gas nearly eliminates slagging and fouling of boiler tubes, causing heat to be absorbed lower in the furnace. This results in less heat available in the upper areas of the boiler for the superheater tubes, leading to lower superheat temperatures. Some boiler designs can operate with this reduction, while others need additional equipment like flue gas recirculation fans to maintain superheat temperature and boiler efficiency.","context":["Modifying an existing coal-fired boiler to natural gas firing capability, either to replace or to supplement coal as the primary fuel source, is an extensive – and expensive – project. Although each project is different, the scope of the conversion will ultimately determine the installation costs. Capital costs can be offset by several factors. First, natural gas systems have fewer “moving parts” such as coal conveyors, crusher/dryers, etc. For this reason, the maintenance and manpower costs associated with the natural gas systems are less expensive than the coal systems. Second, projected fuel costs between coal and natural gas show that natural gas will remain cheaper per BTU than coal for the foreseeable future. Finally, by ranking higher in the merit order, a natural gas powered unit may be called upon more frequently to be brought online to meet demand, thereby increasing revenue.\nThere are numerous factors which must be considered when evaluating the possibility of a coal to natural gas conversion project, such as cost (both short term and long term), access to fuel supply, emissions, and impacts to power plant performance. Each factor must be evaluated to determine if a fuel conversion is feasible.\nInitial cost is a large factor to be considered. Converting a coal fired boiler to natural gas requires extensive modifications to existing power plant equipment (including the internal structure of the boiler), the installation of new equipment, and the demolition (or retirement) of existing coal handling equipment. In some cases, existing plant equipment such as flame scanners may be able to be reused following the conversion. However, a careful evaluation of each system should be made to ensure that the equipment to be reused won’t have a negative impact on the performance of the power plant following conversion.\nAdditionally, the adequacy of the natural gas supply must be considered. Some sites may already have natural gas available, either to other units or as an ignition fuel source. In this case, the existing supply may be sufficient to meet the demand. However, if the existing supply is not sufficient, or there is no supply available, the addition of a new natural gas pipeline as well as the associated regulating and filtration equipment must be considered.\nFiring natural gas causes a significant change to the boiler heat profile as compared to firing coal. Because firing natural gas nearly eliminates slagging and fouling of boiler tubes, the heat released by burning natural gas is absorbed lower in the furnace. This results in less heat available in the upper areas of the boiler for the superheater tubes (pendants), which results in lower superheat temperatures. Some boiler designs are able to operate despite this reduction in temperature; others require additional equipment, such as flue gas recirculation fans, to raise the overall boiler temperature to maintain superheat temperature and maintain boiler efficiency.\nThese initial costs must be balanced with the long term financial benefits of natural gas firing. Fuel costs are one of the primary considerations in this long term analysis. The direct cost savings of natural gas verses coal are obvious; others may not be as readily apparent. Transportation of fuel, fuel handling (coal pile management, conveying, drying, crushing, etc.) are all eliminated. The need for post-combustion controls, such as ash removal and chemical injection for emissions control may be completely eliminated from the power plant processes. These processes are both labor and maintenance intensive, and by elimination, significant cost savings to operations can be achieved.\nAny new systems associated with the conversion will require modifications to the existing control systems, including changes to the burner management system to maintain boiler safety and to the combustion control system to maintain boiler load. Changes to power plant operating procedures, such as startup and shutdown, maintenance procedures, and qualification procedures for both present and future operators must also be considered.\nWhile design and construction of the conversion project is vital to success, choosing a company to develop a training and qualification program as well as operating and maintenance procedures is just as vital. Make sure that the company chosen to perform these aspects of the project has the expertise and experience necessary to develop and deliver an Operational Readiness Program that will meet those demands."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:42bde3de-b73d-4e29-9d49-11a7fa3a3821>"],"error":null}

In case of clarification from the supplier, ask for his visit.\n- This quality report should go to the purchasing department with the Chief Engineer’s remarks.\n- The purchase department will ask the supplier to visit the site.\n- The supplier has to make arrangements for taking back the material and necessary replacement.\nFOR MATERIAL FOUND DEFECTIVE DURING AFTER WORK IS OVER, EVEN THOUGH GOOD QUALITY REPORT WAS SUBMITTED\nThe Project in-charge after a detailed inspection should write a clarification report with the exact nature of the defect, the reason for not reporting it earlier, the inadequacy of the material for the required work, and alternate solutions, if any.\nSuppliers, at times, unload the material at the site without observing site rules and insist for challan eg. after the store is closed, on holidays, dump the material at unwanted locations for own convenience, do not accept the shortage in quantity, etc.\nIn any such case, the storekeeper should not sign the delivery challan.\nIf the supplier unloads the material without permission then it should be reported to the H.O. on the “Clarification Report”.\nInformation on such incidents can also be given to the purchase department telephonically.\nQUALITY TESTING OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AT SITE\nDuring excavation, it is necessary to check soil samples and finalize the bearing strength. Stratas at different levels are\nRed in color, absorbent in nature, turn to clay when it is dry and forms a hard lump that is not easily breakable. It cannot be powdered by applying finger pressure.\nTermed as good soil – approximately safe loading is 30 tonne/sqm (30 T/sqm).\nBLACK COTTON SOIL\nGreyish black in color, heavy clay content. Swells when wet, shrinks when dry, develops heavy cracks, termed as poor soil. Approximate safe loading is 5 to 10 tonne/sqm.\nIt is yellowish/whitish brown. A soil intermediate between clay and sand. Wet shadu contains moisture but when it is dry it may possess appreciable cohesion. However, its lumps are easily broken with finger pressure.\nTermed as moderate soil. Approximate safe loading may be considered as 10 to 15 T/sqm.\nBEARING CAPACITY OF SOIL\n- The bearing capacity of soil can be tested at the site as per standard test procedure.\n- A pit is excavated up to the strata that need to be tested.\n- The bottom of the pit is leveled, the bearing plate is kept and load is applied.\n- The load applied is normally four times the proposed design load. The settlement is recorded every 24 hours until no settlement occurs in 24 hours.\n- The settlement under the test load should not be more than 20 mm.\n- Loading can be done by using cement bags or sandbags.\nIt is red-brown in color, of irregular shape and size, and does not contain moisture when wet. Dry compacted deposits are treated as strong strata.\nApproximate safe loading is 20 to 46 T/sqm.\nIt is the lowermost layer of strata with immense strength.\nSafe loading for soft rock varies from 20T/sqm to 90T/sqm and above and that for other rocks from 100T/sqm.\n- Choose any bag at random.\n- Check the printed manufacturing date.\n- It is given as W-for week, M-for month, and Y-for year.\n- It should not be more than 30 days old.\nOpen the cement bag from one corner. Take a pinch of dry cement and rub between the fingers. It should feel silky.\n- Take a clean measuring glass jar.\n- Fill the jar with clear water.\n- Take some dry cement and add it slowly to the water.\n- Good cement floats for a while and then sinks slowly to the bottom.\n- Any lightweight impurities may remain floating even after the cement sinks. Heavier impurities sink immediately.\n- The quality of cement can be affirmed by the floating test.\n- Take any cement bag at random and test It for the presence of lumps.\n- Fresh cement should be in powder form only.\n- Any cement bag with lumps should be rejected.\nCUBE TESTING ON SITE\n- Prepare 5cm x 5cm x 5cm cube of cement paste.\n- Plastic or tin boxes can be used for this purpose.\n- Place the cube in water Immediately.\n- After 24 hours the edges of the cubes should remain sharp and should gain some strength.\n- Take I’m length from each diameter of bars belonging to different lots. Bend the bar by applying pressure at both ends with your hands.\n- Observe the bent portion, It should be smooth.\n- If the steel is not of good quality, it may break or develop cracks on the bent surface. Such steel should be rejected.\n- Take exactly the 1-meter length of each diameter of the bars on a random basis.\n- Weigh each sample on a weighing scale.\n- Compare the weights with the theoretical weights given.\n- The difference in weight should not be more than 5%.\nTEST FOR BULKING OF SAND\n- Take 250 ml. glass cylinder.\n- Fill up with damp sand up to 200 ml. mark.\n- Slowly pour some water. The sand settles to its actual volume which is less than 200 ml. Mark this level. Let us assume that it is Dml.\n- Then Bulkage is calculated by using the formula\n- % bulkage = 200 – D/D X 100\n- This bulking of sand should be known for proper correction to be applied when calculating dry sand requirements.\nSILT CONTENT OF SAND\n- Take a clean. 200 ml. measuring cylinder.\n- Fill with sand up to a certain mark ( say the reading is X). Add water above it up to 200 ml. and shake well.\n- Allow a period of 2 hours for settlement.\n- Clean sand will settle at the bottom with silt and clay impurities on top of the sand layer.\n- Now observe the top-level reading for sand. Assume that it is Y. Then the silt contains.\n- % silt content =x-y/x 100\n- Total silt content should not be more than 7% for good quality sand.\n- Observe the sand while unloading the truck.\n- Visual inspection shows colored particles other than sand such as shells, gravels, lime impurities, etc.\n- This should not be more than 1% of the total sand received.\nWATER ABSORPTION TEST\n- After unloading metal, collect small quantities of metal from different parts of the heap.\n- Mix these quantities and take exactly 2 Kg of metal in a container.\n- Add clean water to totally submerge the metal.\n- Let it be submerged for 24 hours.\n- Weigh the wet metal. The weight will be more than 2 Kg. Note down the difference in weight. Calculate the absorption by the following formula.\n- % Absoption = Difference in weight/Original weight X 100\n- For metal to be used in concrete work, water absorption should not be more than 5%.\n8. BRICKS BLOCKS\nWATER ABSORPTION TEST\nSelect 3 Nos. of bricks/ blocks of proper size and shape at random.\nWeigh each sample and note it down as\nTake the average as = W1+W2+ W3/3\nSubmerge the samples in water for 24. hours. Weigh the wet samples again as W1, W2, W3. Take the average\nCalculate the % absorption by the formula.\n% Absoption = Difference in weight / Original weight x100\nFor a good quality brick, this value should not exceed 20%.\nWater absorption of concrete blocks should not exceed 10%.\n- Choose a brick/block at random from the stacking. Hold t straight in one hand up to a height of 60 cm for brick and 90 cm for the block.\n- Drop it on a flat surface. A good brick should not break.\n- If any breakage is noticed, the lot should be immediately rejected.\n- In the case of the block, it should not break at all. Even corners and edges should remain intact.\n- This testing of blocks should be done after the curing period is over.\nNormally sanla is not put to immediate use atter receipt, So, the following test should be done to confirm it’s quality.\n- Choose one bag of sanla, Remove 2 trowels of sanla in one ghamela.\n- Slowly add water to get a paste of proper consistency.\n- Check this by rubbing between fingers. Good sanla will have a smooth feeling.\n- Inferior sanla will not give a consistent paste and will be rough to touch. Such a lot should be rejected.\nIf the consistency is good, use the paste to prepare a 5cmm x 5cm x 5xm cube.\nAllow it to set for 24 hours. Remove the cubes. The cubes should not crush easily into powder.\n10. FLUSH DOORS\nTEST FOR BENDING\nChoose a flush door at random, Check that there is no bend or twist.\nPlace the shutters on the flat face, on raised. block pillars with no other support for 24 hours.

Recheck for bending and diagonal etc. A good door frame will retain its shape without any changes.\n12. MOSAIC TILES\nWATER ABSORPTION TEST\n- Choose three tiles at random.\n- Take the initial weight and submerge them in water for 24 hours.\n- Weigh the wet mosaic tiles and note down the difference in weight.\n- Absorption = Difference in weight / Original weight X 100\n- This should not be more than 10% for good-quality mosaic tiles.\nTEST FOR STRENGTH\n- Choose a mosaic tile and check it for any cracks or bends.\n- Simply support the tile at four corners and apply the force in the middle and see the results.\n- Well-cured tile will not break easily.\nAlso, Read This\n- STORE KEEPING AND MATERIAL STACKING AT CONSTRUCTION SITE\n- BUILDING MATERIAL KNOW HOW AND REQUISITION PROCEDURE – INDENT (REQUISITION), WHAT IS MEANT BY REQUISITION, HOW TO WRITE RFQUIETION OF MATERIAL\n- ACCIDENTS AND SAFETY PRECAUTION AT CONSTRUCTION SITE -CAUSES AND PREVENTION, AWARENESS\nIF YOU LIKE THIS POST BUILDING MATERIAL QUALITY TESTING AND REPORTING PROCEDURE LIKE THIS GETTING GOOD INFORMATION SO PLEASE SHARE THIS POST-SOCIAL NETWORK EXAMPLE FACEBOOK, TWITTER SOCIAL MEDIA SITES SHARE IT","Mortar material is one of the indispensable and important materials in building construction. It consists of a mixture of cement, lime, sand, and water, and is used to bond and fill building materials. The quality and performance of mortar directly affect the quality and safety of buildings, so they must be highly valued in building construction.\nTable of Contents\nTypes of mortar materials\nAccording to the different constituent materials, mortar can be divided into various types such as cement mortar, lime mortar, gypsum mortar, and so on. Among them, cement mortar is the most widely used one. It has the advantages of high strength, high hardness, and strong cohesive force. Therefore, it is more commonly used in the foundation, wall, and ground of buildings.\nPerformance of mortar material\n- Strength: The strength of the mortar refers to its ability to withstand external forces. High-strength mortar can withstand greater pressure and tension, thereby making the building stronger.\n- Hardness: The hardness of the mortar refers to its ability to resist the impact of external objects. The mortar with high hardness is not easy to be damaged and can ensure the safety of the building.\n- Bonding force: The bonding force of mortar refers to the bonding strength between it and building materials. Mortar materials with strong bonding forces can effectively bond building materials together and prevent them from falling off.\n- Water resistance: The water resistance of mortar refers to its ability to withstand water immersion or erosion. Mortar with good water resistance can ensure the stability of buildings in humid environments.\nConstruction skills of mortar materials\nMixing ratio: The mixing ratio of mortar should be adjusted according to the types and properties of their constituent materials to ensure that their quality and performance meet the requirements.\nStir evenly: The mixing of mortar requires uniform stirring to ensure that all components are fully mixed and avoid unevenness.\nConstruction environment: The construction environment of mortar should be kept dry, clean and at a suitable temperature to avoid affecting the performance and quality of mortar.\nConstruction tools: use appropriate construction tools, such as spatulas, batch knives, etc., to ensure the even application and compaction of mortar.\nConstruction sequence: The construction sequence of mortar should follow the principle of top-down, inside-out to ensure the construction quality and effect.\nThe quality inspection of mortar materials\nTo ensure that the quality and performance of mortar meet the requirements, quality testing is required during construction. Common mortar testing methods include strength testing, thickness testing, cohesion testing, water resistance testing, etc.\nStrength testing refers to the determination of performance indicators such as strength and hardness by performing mechanical tests such as compression and tension on mortar; thickness testing refers to determining the construction quality and effect by measuring the thickness of mortar; cohesion testing refers to By testing the bonding strength between mortar and building materials, the bonding quality is evaluated; water resistance testing refers to evaluating the water resistance of mortar materials through immersion or scouring tests under different water quality and environments.\nThrough the quality inspection of mortar materials, problems can be found and corrected in time to ensure the quality and safety of construction.\nMortar material is one of the indispensable and important materials in building construction, and its quality and performance directly affect the quality and safety of buildings. Great attention should be paid to the selection, construction, and quality inspection of mortar materials, and scientific construction norms and standards should be followed to ensure that the quality and performance of mortar materials meet the requirements, providing a strong guarantee for the stability and safety of buildings.\nThere are other excellent articles on our website, please continue to browse."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d0bfc9da-2ecc-4798-996a-a80885dc93a2>","<urn:uuid:644282dc-3c6d-4e76-b10b-311454367374>"],"error":null}

Thankfully, there are simple steps you can take to keep your employees safe.\nEven if you do not consider your workplace to be dangerous, familiarizing yourself with common workplace injuries is a valuable exercise.\nSimilar to how the majority of car accidents occur within a few miles of people’s homes, accidents can happen in the most unassuming, seemingly non-hazardous workplaces.\nThe last thing you want as a leader is to deal with lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, and lost productivity as a result of an avoidable injury in the workplace.\nUnderstanding the main causes of common injuries can help you spot potential risks and prevent accidents altogether, saving you time, stress, money, and even the risk of an injury yourself.\nIn this article, you’ll discover workplace injury statistics, common types of workplace accidents, and four tips you can use to best prevent injuries in your workplace.\n4 Steps to Preventing Workplace Injuries\n- Communicate hazards\n- Enforce proper attire\n- Keep the space orderly\n- Generate awareness\nThe Most Common Workplace Injuries\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that there were 882,730 occupational injuries and illnesses in 2017. Considering there were 125 million full-time workers in 2017, this means that nearly 0.7% of full-time employees were injured in 2017.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nOf those injury cases, data indicated that:\n- 11% of injuries involved overexertion from lifting or lowering\n- 64% of bone fractures resulted from accidents in the service-providing industries\n- 26% of bone fractures result from accidents in the trade, transportation, and utility industries\n- 62% of slips, trips, and falls occurred on the same level\n- 20% of slips, trips, and falls involved a worker falling between two or more levels\n- 15% of all non-fatal workplace injuries involved workers being struck by objects or equipment while on the job\n- 35% of cases across all industries were sprains, strains, and tears\nThis data also showed that, across all industries, more than 25% of injuries were caused by slips, trips, and falls.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nWhether you work in an environment known for increased levels of risk, such as a construction site, or in an unassuming restaurant or office building, slips and falls are going to happen.\nFour Steps to Prevent Workplace Injuries\nWhile workplace accidents are impossible to eliminate entirely, there are a number of data-driven steps you can use to successfully prevent the majority of accidents.\nSource: Housecall Pro\nConsider applying the following tips to keep your employees and job site safe and secure.\n1. Communicate Hazards\nPosting adequate signage that clearly marks any obstacles must be a high priority. For example, clearly marking spills and dangerous machinery can decrease both falling and pinching incidents.\nSpecifically, for machinery, ensuring that all tools necessary for operation are accounted for is vital. Installing proper lighting can make certain that your job site is easy to navigate and remain safe in.\n2. Enforce Proper Attire\nMandating employees to wear slip-resistant footwear, hardhats, and warm clothing are effective steps in the fight against workplace injuries.\nPersonal protective and life-saving equipment, including eye and face protection, are also powerful tools.\n3. Keep the Space Orderly\nConnected to communicating hazards, containing spills quickly is a must-do. This requires having proper clean-up equipment readily accessible on site, as well as routinely checking for spills.\nA clean space can prevent accidents.\n4. Generate Awareness\nEducating employees about how to move through the workday and space safely is paramount. The system doesn’t have to be extensive, though that wouldn’t hurt either.\nSimple briefings at the start of the workweek (in the form of a standup) allow managers to relay known hazards and best practices to their teams.\nEducation won’t only benefit employees, though. It also has advantages for managers, some of whom may not be trained in how to communicate with employees about workplace safety.\nTraining for managers can focus on identifying ways to encourage employees to report accidents and ‘near-misses,’ which are often ignored. These sessions are also a good time to highlight incident investigation skills and proper reporting procedures.\nMake Your Workplace Safer\nNow, with an enhanced understanding of the most common workplace accidents, you’re aware of the risks that your business faces in the day-to-day environment.\nAnd, with the above tips for accident prevention, you can proactively put a safety plan in place that effectively prevents accidents and keeps your employees safe on the job.\nNo program is perfect right out of the gate, so understand that there will always be room to improve your company’s safety plan.\nAs long as you offer opportunities for employees to communicate their opinions, consider them carefully, and dedicate time to implementing effective fixes, you’re on the right path."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:edd07eb3-3a59-4923-97a3-a5d28cf5381c>","<urn:uuid:c1b6807c-e4f7-4d05-8658-ff1f39aff1a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which personality assessment focuses more on business applications - Discovery or Keirsey?","answer":"The Insights Discovery assessment is more explicitly focused on business applications. It provides specific business-relevant information in its reports, including details about body language, verbal style, work strengths and weaknesses, and communication style. It also includes specific information about managing people and how individuals will perform as managers, making it popular for team building and understanding team dynamics. The Keirsey Temperament Sorter, while it can be used in business settings, is described more as a general personality questionnaire focused on helping people understand themselves, without an explicit business focus in its framework or reporting.","context":["Disc vs Discovery Comparison\nWhen you’re looking for a personality assessment to use in your workplace, you’ll find that there are lots of different assessments, based on different psychological theories and providing different kinds of information. Two of the most popular assessment tools are Discovery (also known as Insights Discovery) and Disc (also written as ‘DISC’). In Disc vs Discovery we’ll talk about the similarities and differences between these two assessments so that you can see which one might best suit your needs.\nSimilarities between Disc vs Discovery\nBoth Disc and Discovery are psychometric tools that are used in business environments. They both sort people into simplified personality types based on self-reported answers to a range of questions, which can be both a strength and a drawback. Self-report allows for people to share their own perspectives on their own life, however, it also means that results from these assessments are only as reliable as the person who submitted the data when completing the assessment.\nThe tests work by giving the test taker a series of questions or statements for which they will choose the answer that feels most appropriate for them from a list of multiple choice options. These answers are then collated together and analyzed to produce a profile of the test taker. Often businesses will get teams or even whole departments to take the assessments at the same time so they can discuss the results together.\nThe Disc assessment\nThe Disc assessment is based on the work of psychologist William Moulton Marston, also known as the creator of Wonder Woman. The assessment determines people’s emotional style based on four traits: dominance (D), inducement or influence (I), submission or steadiness (S), and compliance or conscientiousness (C). Each individual will have one of these traits as their default approach, so you’ll hear people who have used this tool describing themselves as “high D” or “high I” and so on.\nAs well as these four traits, there are two dimensions provided by the Disc, which refer to the ways in which these traits are expressed in the world. These dimensions are firstly about personality traits (i.e. whether people are more reserved or more outgoing) and secondly about behavioral style (whether people are focused on goals and tasks or on other people). It is worth noting that the Disc is generally understood as a behavioral assessment and not a personality test – so it gives information about traits or behavior, but not about other aspects of personality such as values and beliefs.\nOne important thing to know about the Disc assessment is that it is not controlled, owned, or overseen by any one company or person. The theories of Marston that the tools are based on are publicly accessible, and anyone can use these theories to develop their own assessment tools. For this reason, you might find quite some variation in style between various Disc-based assessment tools.\nThe Insights Discovery\nThe Insights Discovery assessment is based on the work of Carl Jung and sorts people into four colors which represent four outlooks and corresponding goals. The four colors are cool blue (precise, exacting, and deliberate and seeking understanding), earth green (caring and patient and seeking harmony), sunshine yellow (fun and sociable and seeking recognition), and fiery red (driven and confident, and seeking achievement). These four aspects form the basis of the Insights Discovery assessment. Further assessment is then provided through looking at each person’s personality type based on the work of Jung. He proposed that there were four primary cognitive functions that people use when thinking and acting in the world. These cognitive functions include rational judging functions (thinking and feeling) and irrational perceiving function (sensation and intuition), and each one can be expressed in an introverted way (directed inside towards oneself) or an extraverted way (directed outwards towards others and the world). From these four functions and two expressions, eight psychological types can be identified which map onto combinations of the four colors described above.\nUnlike the Disc, the Insights Discovery concept is owned and managed by one organization, so there is a specific format to the questions used in the assessment and the report created for each person. The Discovery tool is geared towards business scenarios so the results report includes information on the body language, verbal style, work strengths and weaknesses, and communication style of each person. One useful aspect of Discovery in team building is its focus on how a person of a particular color or type would interact with people of different colors or types. The exercises can include information about identifying types in others and using this information to tailor your communication with them for better teamwork.\nThe report is in depth and includes information on managing that person and also how that person will be as a manager of others. This report format makes the Discovery a popular tool for departments who want to foster teamwork or understand the team dynamics of their staff more thoroughly.\nWhat these assessments are and aren’t meant to be used for\nIf you are thinking about using one of these assessments for your business, it is important to know what they can and can’t tell you. One mistake that is commonly made when looking at psychometric tests in a business context is thinking that an assessment can tell you who will be a good performer in their role and who will struggle. These assessments do NOT tell you about a person’s ability to succeed in their job – instead, they tell you about how a person approaches their work and how you can support that person in their development and communicate with them effectively.\nAlso, remember that these assessments only give you information about how the person perceives themselves, which is only as accurate as the person knows themselves to be. You should avoid stereotyping people or making assumptions about their abilities or aptitudes based on these assessments. Remember that the assessments give you suggestions about communication style and approaches, but not information on skills or values.\nAfter reading the Disc vs Discovery Comparison, click here to check out another comparison of a very popular assessment, the MBTI.\nLeave a ReplyWant to join the discussion?\nFeel free to contribute!","The Keirsey Temperament Sorter\n(KTS) is a self-assessed personality questionnaire designed to help people better understand themselves, first introduced in the book Please Understand Me\n.

ISBN 1885705034.\nAbout the sorter descriptions\nTemperament can be seen like the rings of a tree:\n- The inner ring - abstract versus concrete\n- According to Keirsey, everyone can engage in both observation and introspection. When people touch objects, watch a basketball game, taste food, or otherwise perceive the world through their five senses, they are observant. When people reflect and focus on their internal world, they are introspective. However, individuals cannot engage in observation and introspection at the same time. The extent to which people are more observant or introspective directly affects their behavior.\n- People who are primarily observant are more 'down to earth', more concrete in their worldview, and tend to focus on practical matters such as food, shelter and their immediate relationships. Carl Jung used the word sensing to describe concrete people. People who are primarily introspective are more 'head in the clouds', are more abstract in their world view, and tend to focus on global issues. Carl Jung used the word intuition to describe abstract people.\n- The second ring - cooperative versus utilitarian (pragmatic)\n- Keirsey uses the words pragmatic and cooperative when comparing the differing temperaments. People who are cooperative pay more attention to other people's opinions and are more concerned with doing the right thing. People who are pragmatic (utilitarian) pay more attention to their own thoughts or feelings and are more concerned with doing what works. There is no comparable idea of Myers or Jung that corresponds to this dichotomy, so this is a significant difference between the work of David Keirsey and that of Isabel Myers and Carl Jung.\n- This ring, in combination with the inner ring, determines a person's temperament. The pragmatic temperaments are Rationals (pragmatic and abstract) and Artisans (pragmatic and concrete). The cooperative temperaments are Idealists (cooperative and abstract), and Guardians (cooperative and concrete). Neither Myers nor Jung included the concept of temperament in their theories.\n- The third ring - directive versus informative\n- The third ring distinguishes between people who primarily communicate by informing others versus people who primarily communicate by directing others. Each of the four temperaments is subdivided by this distinction for a result of eight roles.\n- The directive roles are Operators (directive Artisans), Administrators (directive Guardians), Mentors (directive Idealists), and Coordinators (directive Rationals). The informative roles are Entertainers (informative Artisans), Conservators (informative Guardians), Advocates (informative Idealists), and Engineers (informative Rationals).\n- The fourth ring - expressive versus reserved (attentive)\n- The fourth ring describes how people interact with their environment. Individuals who primarily act before reflecting are described as expressive, whereas people who primarily reflect before acting are described as attentive. Each of the eight categories can be subdivided by this distinction, for a total of 16 role variants. These 16 role variants correlate to the 16 Myers-Briggs types.\n- The expressive role variants are Promoters (expressive Operators), Performers (expressive Entertainers), Supervisors (expressive Administrators), Providers (expressive Conservators), Teachers (expressive Mentors), Champions (expressive Advocates), Fieldmarshals (expressive Coordinators), and Inventors (expressive Engineers).\n- The reserved role variants are Crafters (reserved Operators), Composers (reserved Entertainers), Inspectors (reserved Administrators), Protectors (reserved Conservators), Counselors (reserved Mentors), Healers (reserved Advocates), Masterminds (reserved Coordinators), and Architects (reserved Engineers).\nThe following table shows how the four rings relate to one another and to the various temperaments.\nThe Four Temperaments\n- Artisans are observant and pragmatic. Composers, Crafters, Performers, and Promoters are the role variants contained within this temperament. Their greatest strength is tactical variation. Their most developed intelligence operations is either expediting or improvising.\n- Guardians are observant and cooperative. Protectors, Inspectors, Supervisors, and Providers are the role variants contained within this category. Guardians seek membership or belonging and are concerned with responsibility and duty. Their greatest strength is logistical intelligence. They excel at organizing, facilitating, checking, and supporting.\n- Idealists are introspective and cooperative. Healers, Counselors, Champions and Teachers are the role variants contained within this category. Idealists seek meaning and significance and are concerned with finding their own unique identity. Their greatest strength is diplomatic intelligence. They excel at clarifying, unifying, individualizing, and inspiring.\n- Rationals are introspective and pragmatic. Architects, Masterminds, Inventors and Fieldmarshals are the role variants contained within this category. Rationals seek mastery, and self-control and are concerned with their own knowledge and competence. Their greatest strength is strategic intelligence. They excel in any kind of logical investigation such as engineering, conceptualizing, theorizing, and coordinating.\nThe Eight Roles\n- Operators are observant, pragmatic, and directive. Crafters and Promoters are the two role variants of the directive Artisans.\n- Entertainers are observant, pragmatic and informative. Composers and Performers are the two role variants of the informative Artisans.\n- Administrators are observant, cooperative, and directive. Inspectors and Supervisors are the two role variants of the directive Guardians.\n- Conservators are observant, cooperative, and informative. Protectors and Providers are the two role variants of the informative Guardians.\n- Mentors are introspective, cooperative, and directive. Counselors and Teachers are the two role variants of the directive Idealists.\n- Advocates are introspective, cooperative and informative. Healers and Champions are the two role variants of the informative Idealists.\n- Coordinators are introspective, pragmatic and directive. Masterminds and Fieldmarshals are the two role variants of the directive Rationals.\n- Engineers are introspective, pragmatic and informative. Architects and Inventors are the two role variants of the informative Rationals.\nMyers-Briggs Types versus Keirsey's Temperaments\nThe type descriptions of Isabel Myers differ from the character descriptions of David Keirsey in several important ways:\n- Myers primarily focused on how people think and feel; Keirsey focused more on behavior, which is directly observable.\n- Myers' descriptions use a linear four-factor model; Keirsey's descriptions use a systems field theory model.\n- Myers, following Jung's lead, emphasized the extraversion/introversion dichotomy; Keirsey's model places greater importance on the sensing/intuition dichotomy.\n- Myers grouped types by ‘function attitudes’; Keirsey, by temperament.\nMyers grouped types according to cognitive function: the ‘thinking type’ grouping for those with dominant thinking; the ‘intuitive type’ grouping for those with dominant intuition; the ‘feeling type’ grouping for those with dominant feeling; and the ‘sensing type’ grouping for those with dominant sensing. Keirsey's temperaments correlate with Myers' combinations of preferences: Guardians with sensing plus judging (SJ); Artisans with sensing plus perceiving (SP); Idealists with intuition plus feeling (NF); and Rationals with intuition plus thinking (NT).\nMyers paired ESTJs with ENTJs, ISFPs with INFPs, INTPs with ISTPs, and ENFJs with ESFJs because they share the same dominant function attitude. ESTJs and ENTJs are both extraverted thinkers, ISFPs and INFPs are both introverted feelers, INTPs and ISTPs are both introverted thinkers, and ENFJs and ESFJs are both extraverted feelers. Keirsey holds that these same groupings are very different from one another because they are of different temperaments. ESTJs are Guardians whereas ENTJs are Rationals; ISFPs are Artisans whereas INFPs are Idealists; INTPs are Rationals whereas ISTPs are Artisans; and ENFJs are Idealists whereas ESFJs are Guardians."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:caa134d0-1d2d-48a5-bdfa-9135ab3c2228>","<urn:uuid:ed3ea903-1ec7-4140-9f8d-0e6f3bc8a76d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do occupational therapy interventions combine both direct treatment and family involvement, and what specific activities are employed to address sensory processing challenges?","answer":"Occupational therapy combines direct treatment sessions with family involvement for optimal outcomes. During 30-60 minute sessions, therapists work one-on-one with clients using specific activities like sensory bins, swings, and playdough exercises. They also provide home support by teaching parents and caregivers how to conduct effective treatments, as repetition helps cement these abilities. Treatment plans are tailored to individual needs and may include therapeutic listening, sensory diets, and the Wilbarger brushing protocol. Specific activities include making human figures to enhance body awareness, straw races for oral motor skills, and video clip analysis for social skills development. These interventions target various sensory systems and help the nervous system become more organized and controlled over time.","context":["Learn how to identify symptoms of vestibular dysfunction in a child with sensory processing disorder. Stimulation from this sense comes from the tiny hair cells in the inner ear that register every change in head position as related to balance and movement.\nAuditory dysfunction often occurs as well, due to both being perceived within the system of the ear. You may find that some children with this either passionately love or hate amusement park rides. The symptoms related to the vestibular sense may seem similar to signs-symptoms of autism because it can often cause a delay in toddler speech development.\nIt’s amazing that something so small can detect even the slightest bit of movement we make. In fact, all sensations are interpreted with reference to the vestibular system. The nervous system depends on this working properly in order to process sensory input from all of our senses. If there is vestibular dysfunction, then all other aspects of the nervous system will fail to function accurately as well.\nSigns of vestibular dysfunction include sensory seeking behavior, and/or hyper/hypo sensitivity to movement..\nA. Vestibular Disorder with Hypersensitivity to Movement:\n• Dysfunction causes resistance to moving playground equipment, such as swings, slides or merry-go-rounds\n• Desires stationary tasks and moves slowly and cautiously\n• Fear of heights and falling\n• Easily lose balance or referred to as a “klutz”\n• Avoidance of stairs, elevators, and escalators\n• Demand physical support from an adult\n• Lack of motivation to actively move\n• Swing for long periods of time without getting dizzy\n• Unaware of sensation of falling and failing to protect him/herself by extending hands or feet to catch him/herself\n• Loves amusement park rides\n• Described as hyperactive – always running, jumping, and hopping\n• Engages in rocking or rhythmic movements\n• Trouble sitting still or staying seated\n• May vigorously shake head or rock rhythmically\n• Crave intense movement including jumping, upside-down positions\n• Enjoy swinging very high\n• Loves seesaws, teeter totters or trampolines more than other children\n• Can’t seem to sit still\n• Likes spinning in circles\n• Limp or floppy body\n• Often “W sits” when on the floor\n• May have skipped crawling as an infant\n• Weak gross motor and fine motor skills\n• May seem to be ambidextrous, by often switching hand use\n• Struggles to mimic dance moves and exercises\nTreatment of sensory processing disorder is usually determined by an occupational therapist. The therapist would do an evaluation of the specific needs of your child then develop occupational therapy goals. If it is determined that the vestibular sense is mainly affected, then treatment is based on this determination.\nBecause our son primarily had sensory seeking vestibular dysfunction, his treatment has included therapeutic listening with a sensory diet and the wilbarger brushing protocol. As a result we have noticed immense improvements in his language, ability to transition to another activity, and sit still to focus on a task.\nAdditional Recommended Pages:\n1.

But how much will it help? Research suggests there is a correlation between treatment success rates and clinical severity of autism symptoms.\nOccupational therapy is a type of therapy that focuses on helping children with autism develop skills and abilities. Occupational therapists help children to improve their daily living skills, such as eating, dressing, toileting, social interaction, and self-care.\nOccupational therapy is a sort of treatment that aims to improve the lives of individuals who are recuperating from an accident or disease, or who have a condition like autism. Interventions are tailored to the requirements of individuals of various ages.\nThe treatment of autism is a frequent use of occupational therapy. It is often used in the therapy of children and people with autism in order to improve their cognitive, physical, social, and motor abilities.\nSensory processing difficulties are common among people with autism. They may get overwhelmed by ambient stimuli and lack the abilities to filter out the irrelevant information.\nStudents learn to better handle sensory input and navigate daily circumstances with less stress and anxiety via occupational therapy exercises.\nWhat Is Occupational Therapy and How Does It Work?\nOccupational therapy (OT) assists individuals of all ages in doing tasks that they want and need in order to get through the day. Occupational therapy (OT) improves health and helps individuals live better with injury, sickness, or handicap by using therapeutic everyday activities or vocations.\nOccupational therapy also enables disabled youngsters to engage more completely in school and in social circumstances.\nA typical occupational therapy curriculum contains the following components:\nAn initial assessment in which the client, their family, and the occupational therapist determine the client’s objectives.\nA tailored intervention plan to meet the client’s requirements and help them execute everyday tasks and achieve their objectives.\nOngoing assessments to ensure that the treatments are working and that the objectives are being met. Changes to the treatment plan are made as required.\nOccupational therapy is a research-based therapeutic method that offers a comprehensive approach to healing. The goal of therapy is to make the individual’s surroundings more conducive to their well-being. OT services involve assessing the client’s home, work, or school environment and giving suggestions for how to make these environments more accessible.\nOccupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with offer training on how to utilize adaptive tools such equipment and exercises, as well as information for family and caregivers on how to help the person in need. Occupational therapy is used to address these skills:\nOccupational therapy helps people live more independent and fulfilled lives by focusing on developing the abilities listed above. This treatment is suited for persons of all ages who need particular interventions to help them fully participate in their everyday life.\nOccupational Therapy & Autism\nDue to the high prevalence of sensory processing difficulties in children with autism, occupational therapy is a frequent intervention. Sensory processing impairment affects 60 percent to 70 percent of children with ASD.\nAutistic children and adults often fail to integrate information received via their senses, causing them to digest information more slowly. The quantity of sensory information that children with autism take in may overwhelm them, and they have no way of determining what information is unimportant.\nAutistic youngsters may have meltdowns or engage in problematic conduct as a consequence of this overload. They may retreat or shut down totally. Autistic kids learn how to better filter out extraneous information via occupational therapy exercises. Each sensory system is targeted with specific approaches.\nThe nervous system of a youngster grows more ordered or controlled with time and experience. The child’s performance at everyday chores increases as the nervous system gets more controlled.\nOccupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with\nOccupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with are master’s level therapists who have passed a national certification exam . They are formally educated and trained in the evaluation of a person’s current skill level, identifying their goals and creating a treatment plan to best achieve those goals. After passing the national certification exam, Occupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with must apply for state licensure.\nOccupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with work with autistic students, as well as their parents, siblings, and teachers. They observe the student and gather information through parent and teacher interviews. Once enough data has been collected about the child’s relationships, eating, self-care, and daily living skills, the therapist works with families to set goals and create an intervention plan .\nThe occupational therapist’s responsibilities include:\nDirect services are provided.\nConducting occupational therapy exams.\nOther people in the client’s life, such as other members of the treatment team, are consulted and collaborated with.\nMaking suggestions for further assessments and services.\nAdvocating for changes and revisions.\nBy fulfilling the above tasks, Occupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with support community inclusion of individuals with autism.\nThrough OT evaluations, Occupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with are often involved in the early detection of autism as well. When an early diagnosis is made, Occupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with have the opportunity to make recommendations that will support positive development and outcomes. Autism research continually shows that early intervention results in more successful treatment outcomes . Occupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with perform the above services in a variety of settings that include:\nEarly intervention programs run by the states.\nSchools and after-school activities are both important.\nIt is a private practice.\nPrograms for mental wellness.\nVocational programs are available.\nDaytime programs are available.\nWhat Happens During Occupational Therapy Sessions?\nA normal OT session lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Sessions are arranged on a regular basis, albeit the number of sessions per week may vary depending on the individual’s requirements and objectives. During a session, the therapist works with the client one-on-one to complete specified activities aimed at achieving the previously set objectives.\nAn occupational therapist will also promote skill practice outside of treatment sessions. The purpose of occupational therapy is to be able to use taught skills in a range of environments that a person experiences in daily life.\nParents and caregivers may get OT help at home to learn how to conduct effective treatments. This amount of family involvement is critical since repetition helps to cement these abilities.\nOccupational Therapy Interventions Examples\nOccupational therapists (OTs) are those who help people with are equipped with a large toolkit of interventions. When working with children, activities must be creative in order to keep kids interested and engaged while addressing their underlying conditions. For children with autism or sensory processing issues, example OT interventions that can be very helpful include:\nBins for sensory input. Make a sensory bin with a variety of shapes and textures using everyday home objects. Visual perception, language, and fine motor abilities are all improved by exploring the rubbish.\nSwings. Have the youngster lay down on their stomach on a platform or similar sort of swing and throw balls or bean bags into containers you’ve put around them while they swing. This form of action promotes body awareness, visual perception abilities, coordination, and muscular strength.\nClips from videos Choose social skills-related video segments from the student’s favorite cartoon. You may talk about what the characters were doing, how they felt, and what they could have been thinking after you’ve seen the video. This practice encourages perspective taking (the capacity to perceive things from someone else’s point of view) as well as an awareness of social skills.\nPlaydough. Playdough may be made with your kid or student. Working through the process with the kid allows them to learn following instructions, experimenting with different textures, and managing emotions like impatience.\nRaces with straws This practice is a fantastic oral motor exercise for youngsters with oral motor problems. Fill a huge container halfway with water, give each individual a straw, and have them compete to see who can blow their cup across the water the quickest. If the youngster is not ready for competition, the activity may be done without turning it into a race. The abilities of vision and coordination are also emphasized.\nSimon declares. This timeless game may be used to work on a variety of abilities. Lead the game and have your kid learn body awareness, coordination, creativity, and social skills via gestures. To foster perspective taking, the youngster may take a turn leading the game when they are ready.\nMaking a human being. Work with your youngster to create a person using a variety of art items. The youngster gets to choose the person’s appearance. You may also have a dialogue with the individual about how they are feeling. Body awareness, direction, visual abilities, fine motor skills, and emotional discussion are all enhanced by this practice.\nOccupational Therapy’s Effectiveness\nOccupational therapy is very helpful in helping children and people with autism acquire sensory-integration skills and treatments that enhance their quality of life. A variety of OT therapies have been demonstrated to be beneficial in encouraging favorable results in kids with autism in studies.\nOT may help with a range of things in life, and there are a variety of therapies that can be employed, including:\nSensory integration and sensory-based therapies are two types of sensory-based interventions.\nInterventions that are participatory and built on relationships.\nInterventions based on developmental skills.\nInterventions to improve social-cognitive skills.\nInterventions that are directed or facilitated by the parents.\nBehavioral therapies that are both intensive and long-term.\nResearchers discovered that occupational therapy is closely linked with the concepts of ASD treatments after reviewing papers and therapies. OT therapies have a history of reducing ASD symptoms and have been shown to be beneficial.\nIn order to establish successful intervention techniques, research supports the use of complete personalized evaluations of an individual’s present performance. Similarly, activity-based, family-centered, multidisciplinary programs that integrate play are particularly beneficial.\nOccupational Therapy Costs\nOT can be an expensive out-of-pocket service, but there are a few ways to get the costs covered for you or your child. Autism Speaks explains three different ways that the Occupational Therapy Costs services for autistic children are frequently covered. Depending on your situation, the costs of OT can be covered by:\nInsurance. OT is frequently a covered service through health insurance. Depending on your insurance carrier, you may need a doctor’s note stating that the treatment sessions are medically required. To check the details of your plan, contact your provider directly.\nA program for early intervention. If your kid is under the age of three and gets OT via the state as part of their early intervention programs, the cost of OT will be considerably reduced or even free, depending on your family’s budget.\nHow Can Occupational Therapy Help People With Autism?\nOccupational therapy is an important tool for children and people with autism who want to improve their performance at home, job, and school. Targeted OT therapies help to build social and behavioral skills. Occupational therapy, in the end, helps persons with autism improve their talents by providing a foundation.\nOT therapies may assist people of all ages on the autism spectrum. Occupational therapy may help persons with autism improve their overall well-being by teaching them the skills they need to live more independent and fulfilling lives.\nOccupational therapy is usually administered as part of a complete autism treatment regimen. Autism treatment programs often incorporate applied behavior analysis therapy and speech therapy. While autism spectrum disease cannot be cured, its symptoms may be significantly lessened, enabling people to live more balanced and prosperous lives.\nThe “occupational therapy for autistic teenager” is a treatment that helps children with autism. It can greatly improve the quality of life for these individuals, but it is not always necessary.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow effective is occupational therapy for autism?\nA: Thats a difficult question to answer. The effectiveness of occupational therapy for autism is largely dependent on the individual and his or her needs, as well as what that particular therapist does with it.\nHow effective is occupational therapy?\nA: Occupational therapy is a type of physical, mental or occupational intervention designed to help an individual adapt and perform tasks related to their occupation or hobby.

Ghanaian funerals are elaborate celebrations that can last days or weeks, featuring dancing pallbearers and synchronized performances as a strategy to help relieve the family's grief through entertainment. They emphasize community participation and celebration of life, with ceremonies costing around $20,000. In contrast, Muslim funerals are quick and solemn affairs, with bodies buried as soon as possible facing Mecca. Muslims discourage obvious signs of grief, believing they should accept God's will without complaint.","context":["More than an ironic response to the COVID-19 crisis, the meme introduced a powerful Ghanaian mourning ritual to the world and with it some relief.\nDressed in ornate tuxedos, big sunglasses and spotless white gloves, six men lift a coffin to their shoulders and begin an extravagant synchronized dance. They bounce in unison, wave white handkerchiefs and even crawl across the floor while expertly keeping the deceased safely in the air and funeral attendees dancing along.\nDespite the morbid subject matter, it comes as no surprise that the pallbearers, known as the \"Nana Otafrija Pallbearing and Waiting Service\" led by Benjamin Aidoo, have risen in popularity on a trajectory paralleling the pandemic's impact on our daily lives.\nAs people try to find ways to collectively come to terms with the loss of life, normalcy and human connection, the use of the meme has become a grieving process of its own, in the absurd way only the internet can produce. But while it's birthed a strange new online ritual, the origins of the video are linked to a deeply important cultural process for Ghanaians.\nFunerals worldwide have been majorly disrupted since March, with people streaming burials or skipping them altogether. For Ghanaians, it's been particularly difficult, as the funeral process is considered key to the spiritual health of the community.

Arhin-Sam when reached by phone in Canada. An academic studying Ghanaian funeral traditions, Arhin-Sam explains: \"We believe that the spirit lives on and helps to keep the community intact and offers protection to individuals.\"\nThe significance of the wider community in commemoration of the dead can't be understated. Certain customs are followed at funeral celebrations to ensure the spirit transitions seamlessly and it's the community's responsibility to make sure they're done correctly\nJudged by factors such as the number and social standing of attendees, food offered and spectacle of the ceremony, funerals are an expensive process with the average cost being close to $20,000 dollars. But having a successful funeral is crucial for the community, as Arhin-Sam illustrates. Customs after death, such as pouring libations and traditional dances (though not necessarily those resembling the coffin bearers), can be more complex and detailed in nature depending on the status of the person when they were alive—age, gender and cause of death all impact how the ceremony is performed.\nThe disruption of this process is especially damaging if the death is considered a 'bad' death. In Akan culture, 'good' deaths are based on the presence of a few key factors. Living to a good age (around 70); dying from natural causes; contributing to your society and having children. These factors allow for easier transitions and less detailed funeral plans, whereas 'bad' deaths, which include dying from infectious diseases, require more complex rituals.\nArhin-Sam explains that the cultural understanding of life and death creates this necessity, as \"it is key to [the deceased's] transition because when you come into this world there is no disease associated with you, so it's expected that continues into your death.\"\nDue to early government response, COVID-19 cases in Ghana have been minimal but lockdown has meant families haven't been able to give their loved ones the full ceremony after passing. Talking to Sulley Lansah, the BBC Africa journalist who produced the initial story on the pallbearers that later became a meme, he describes how some people have had to do much smaller private burials.\n\"Everything has been restricted to private burials of 25 people, even those are very few,\" says Lansah. \"They're very solemn affairs and straight to the point, it just takes 5-10 minutes and they are gone but before it would be a 3 day event.\"\nGhana's dancing pallbearers - BBC Africa www.youtube.com\nDespite this option many people are preferring to hold off on this smaller ceremony, electing to leave the bodies of loved ones in morgues and wait for the lockdown to be fully lifted to give the deceased a traditional send off.\nTo no surprise, the pallbearers' business has been greatly affected. \"Three years ago when I met Benjamin he usually had 10 to 20 bookings on the weekend, every weekend,\" says Lansah. \"...he'd be taking bookings from Thursday through Saturday. But now it's only one funeral a week and it has affected the money he is getting.\"\nFunerals are big business in Ghana. The industry is a lynchpin in the local economy, accounting for major tourism hikes from returning diaspora communities and responsible for an entire economic infrastructure around the tradition. Benjamin Aidoo and his band of pallbearers aren't the only workers in the industry being affected, the market for professional mourners—women who sell their sorrow at ceremonies—has become non-existent. Similarly work has dried up for custom coffin makers, importers of traditional funeral cloth, printers of brochures and insurers.\n\"For one, it's relief. Losing someone is hard, nobody wants to go through that. But [the dancing] is a strategy to help relieve the family of some of the emotions they're going through and now it's not just among Ghanaians—because it's international.\"\nAccording to Arhin-Sam, for Ghanaians at home and abroad, the disruption has been followed by the necessity to ad-lib and find ways to continue to honour those who have passed. \"People are improvising, but the cultural value is not lost in the tradition,\" she says. \"The meaning is already there even though we are not able to do it as we used to.\"\nThis also rings true for cultural funerals in Black communities in the US and UK. In Louisiana, the Black population has been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, with Black people making up 59 percent of deaths while representing only 32 percent of the population. As a result, second line jazz funerals in New Orleans have been cancelled. Typically upbeat affairs celebrated with brass band processions, dancing and singing, \"the second line\" has the same cultural significance for its community as traditional funeral ceremonies do for West Africans, with which they share a lineage.\nBut in the tradition of making a way when there is none, Brass-a-holics bandleader Winston 'Trombone' Turner has honoured those passed with a socially distanced version of the ceremony. Similarly, in the UK where black people are approximately 4x more likely to die from COVID-19, Jamaican communities have honoured the Nine Night ceremony—a tradition where relatives and friends gather at the deceased's families home on the 9th day after their passing—by gathering online to share the same compassion and community that the would have provided present in real life.\nFuneral Memes Compilation www.youtube.com\nDavid Kessler, the co-creator Kubler-Ross' 5 Stages of Grief, explains in a recent interview, the different types of mourning we're going through as a result of the Coronavirus, including something he calls \"anticipatory grief.\" Usually identified when the loss of a loved one seems inevitable, in this context, it's about the uncertainty of the future, a possible world where our regular traditions are at risk of disappearing. \"With a virus, this kind of grief is so confusing for people,\" says Kessler. \"Our primitive mind knows something bad is happening, but you can't see it.\" The invisibility of the threat makes it all the more difficult to accept, and near impossible to make sense of, making finding \"meaning\"—a 6th stage Kessler adds in the interview —such a difficult but necessary task.\nAs we come to accept the rupturing of the old world, we all will inevitably try to understand what we're living through, and find meaning in the things that the COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated. Sometimes those meanings present themselves in unexpected places. Arhin-Sam suggests, for some, the popularity of the pallbearers is down to people receiving some closure for the losses the world is experiencing.\n\"For one, it's relief. Losing someone is hard, nobody wants to go through that. But [the dancing] is a strategy to help relieve the family of some of the emotions they're going through and now it's not just among Ghanaians—because it's international. Everyone knows about them. So watching them, you're grieving but also in a way, excited about what they're doing. They're taking some of your grief away by providing a source of entertainment.\"","Burial and funeral customs are the methods and ceremonies used in the disposing\nof bodies of dead persons. People have always had a deep reverence for the dead.\nThe funeral ceremonies they have adopted have grown out of their views on death\nand the after life. The most common methods of disposing of bodies are;\ninterment (burial) and cremation (burning). Other forms of disposition include:\nmummification, bequeathing of the body, direct disposition, cryogenics, and\nvarious forms of natural decomposition. Many practices are based upon religious\nbeliefs, and may directly effect the disposition choice.\n|Disposal of the Dead\nBurial, the method most common in Western countries, is usually in a grave in a\ncemetery plot. Sometimes burial is in a vault, or chamber. There are burial vaults\nin some churches, and some cemeteries have buildings (often called mausoleums)\ncontaining vaults. Burial may also be in a stone coffin, or sarcophagus, which\nserves as a monument to the dead. Graves, burial vaults, and burial monuments\nare all called tombs.\nIn Western countries the body is usually placed in the grave on its back, with the\nlegs fully extended. Moslems are buried in the right side, facing holy Mecca. When\nBuddhists use burial they put the head to the north with the face upward, as\nBuddha was buried.\nEarly Christians adopted the custom of putting the feet toward the east so that at\nthe resurrection the reborn might hurry toward the sunrise. Many primitive\npeoples buried their dead in the fetal position, with knees drawn up toward the\nchin. There was a belief that death is related to birth, and that the body in the\ngrave is awaiting rebirth.\nIn former times almost every cemetery had elaborate and impressive tombstones.\nNow the trend is toward the simple, and often the stone is merely a marker.\n|This main topic focuses on all subjects,\nbut not limited to, topics dealing with\nmodern funeral traditions and customs\nfrom the U.S., and abroad. It also covers,\nfuneral etiquette, disposition options,\nReligious rites, wakes, vigils, traditional\nfuneral alternatives, as well as, mourning\nand grieving practices. It also includes\npallbearers, eulogies, processions,\nobituaries and more.\n|Additional Traditions Information\nBurial at Sea was once a common practice in the west. Now most ships have the\nmeans to preserve bodies until land is reached.

{"question":"How did Gen. Marmaduke's forces escape at the Battle of Chalk Bluff when they were surrounded by Union troops?","answer":"At the Battle of Chalk Bluff, when Confederate forces under General Marmaduke were surrounded by Union troops under Major General McNeil, Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson built a makeshift bridge and ferry to transport the men across the St. Francis River near Chalk Bluff, Arkansas, allowing them to escape.","context":["Brig. Gen. John S. Marmaduke led the forces that captured Capt. Richard M. Hulse at the Battle of Chalk Bluff. Image courtesy of the Library of Congress.\nEach month in 2014, the Library will commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Civil War in Missouri and Kansas with a post derived from the thousands of primary sources that are digitized and incorporated into this website. The Library and its project partners collaborated to assemble this rich repository from the collections of 25 area archives, combining it with interpretive tools and original scholarship produced by nationally recognized historians.\nFortifying a Missouri Town\n“I would rather work my men six months on fortifications to protect them from the Enemy than to be taken again prisoner,” Captain Richard M. Hulse wrote to his parents on May 7, 1864. Hulse referred to the efforts of 58 cavalrymen under his command in Company H, 2nd Regiment of the Missouri State Militia. Stationed in Dallas, Missouri, in the southeast part of the state, they worked to block off windows and barricade the doors of the Court House and secure their horses inside a fortification connected to that building.\nDrawing on his personal experience, Hulse had good reasons for setting up defenses at the Company H headquarters. As a whole, the state of Missouri suffered from recurrent battles and guerrilla warfare between the opposing sides, and the town of Dallas, which would be renamed Marble Hill in 1868, had already endured significant destruction from a small raid of 120 Confederates in 1862.\nHulse’s motivations, as revealed in the letter, especially stemmed from his capture and imprisonment at the Battle of Chalk Bluff on May 1-2, 1863. That battle took place in Clay County, Arkansas, and Dunklin County, Missouri, and resulted in a tactical victory for the Confederacy but a strategic victory for the Union due to significant casualties sustained by the invading Confederate forces. The heavy losses and weak tactical positioning prompted the general in command of the Confederate cavalry, John S. Marmaduke, to give up his invasion of Missouri before it could even get underway.\nMarmaduke had hoped to attack federal supply routes centered at Cape Girardeau, but he was repulsed and surrounded by Union troops under command of Major General John H. McNeil. Marmaduke ordered Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson to build a makeshift bridge and ferry to transport his men over the St. Francis River near Chalk Bluff, Arkansas, to escape. It was at the makeshift river crossing that Captain Hulse led his company against Thompson and ended up being captured along with 23 of his men, and he was later exchanged and released to fight again.\nHulse’s letter to his parents described the loss of two of his subordinates who died at Chalk Bluff, writing that, “it was a sad & mournful spectacle to see two of my best men [wrapped] in their Blankets at Chalk Bluff & laid in their final resting place.” What prompted memories of this incident from the year before was the recent loss of one of his men who died from pneumonia. Unlike the two men hastily laid to rest at Chalk Bluff, the recent one could at least be buried in a “respectable coffin” and “with honors of war.”\nHulse had clearly learned the lessons of war as he prepared defenses in May 1864. He described the “horrors of a Southern prison,” including the “Ignorant guards placed over [him].” Even at the town of Dallas, Hulse described a lack of provisions, explaining that “there is nothing in the country to eat” and “there are thousands suffering for the necessaries of life.” Given his company’s experiences, preparedness was of the utmost concern, as he described to his parents: “A burned Child dreads the fire & so with [Company H.,] they once have tasted the bitter fruit of Rebledom & do not intend trying a second [dose] without a Struggle.”\nAll Quiet in Kansas City\nMeanwhile, in Kansas City, the Unionist and Baptist Reverend Jonathan B. Fuller enjoyed a relatively calm respite from the strains of war. As he related in a letter to his father on May 23, 1864, “Things are quiet in a general way. We have bushwhackers in the county—but I think they are few in number and not likely to do any general mischief. I hope they will keep quiet—for my success in building up the church depends in great measure upon it.”\nFuller’s observation about greatly reduced pro-Southern guerrilla activity along the Missouri-Kansas border was undoubtedly accurate. Aside from the deep controversies surrounding several events from the summer of 1863—including the collapse of a prison housing women relatives of known bushwhackers in Kansas City, Quantrill’s Raid on Lawrence, Kansas, and General Order No. 11 in response to that raid—the unusually harsh measures taken by Union authorities against the rural population had at least succeeded in quelling much of the guerrilla violence and reprisals that had plagued the border since the mid-1850s.\nThe relative calm allowed the citizens of Kansas City an opportunity to resume more ordinary activities, albeit with the shadow of war hanging over them. Fuller would not be directly involved in the war again until later in the year, giving him time to focus on holding his congregation together and attempting to expand it. In his letter, he made a brief reference to his church services being attended by protesting “Campbellites,” who were followers of the reformists Thomas and Alexander Campbell. The Campbells led the Disciples of Christ movement, which wanted to follow a more literal or “primitive” interpretation of the New Testament, including the rejection of such practices as having musical instruments in church service. Fuller described their impact on his service as minimal, though, and he was mostly pleased with the attendance that filled three-quarters of the building.\nOn the previous Saturday, Fuller attended and spoke at a school picnic where the “Queen of the May” was presented. He was also planning to attend a picnic the following Saturday for his Sunday school, and he related an ongoing joke within his congregation about his physical attractiveness. All the while, he described a backdrop of unusually dry and hot weather, which made for dusty roads and dry vegetation.\nBut the Civil War was never far from anyone’s mind. At the picnic, Fuller led a prayer for the “strong men [who] were going out in battles wild rage to the warriors bloody doom—and while we with garlands crowned were meeting in joyous festal—pain and woe mutterable were darkening many a heart and home.” Furthermore, Fuller speculated on national events by referencing the beginning of General Ulysses S. Grant’s Overland Campaign, which began with the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House between May 5 and May 21, 1864.\nWhile historians recall Grant’s campaign as one that ground down General Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia through battles of attrition, many Northern citizens were shocked and outraged at the huge number of casualties Grant was willing to accept in order to push Lee’s army to the brink of dissolution. In the first two weeks alone, Grant’s Army of the Potomac lost 36,000 soldiers to death, wounds, desertion, or capture, and speculation was rampant that President Lincoln would lose his upcoming campaign for reelection in November.\nWriting in Kansas City in late May, Reverend Fuller could only comment that “News from the Potomac is not quite so encouraging as I could wish. But as Grant’s military renown is at stake, I am confident that Lee will have to stand a severe tug before the matter ends.” It would be another 11 months before General Lee’s surrender at Appomattox.\nAnticipating Another Destructive Summer\nLike Reverend Fuller, other Missouri residents could not overlook the sense of foreboding that came with the fourth spring season of the war. Writing to his fiancé from Calhoun, Missouri, the merchant and Unionist John A. Bushnell continued to live in fear of violence from pro-Southern bushwhackers and even referenced rumors of a large-scale invasion of Missouri being prepared in Arkansas.\nAs typical of Bushnell’s correspondence, he shared his extensive contemplations about religion and the war, on this occasion writing about “whether God had any thing to do with the war?” “Most surely,” Bushnell wrote, “He has a wise purpose in all this.” He went on to speculate about the war being a punishment for sins and wondered if famine and disease would follow the war’s end. He seems to stop just short of speculating that the coming of the millennium in the next century would fulfill the Book of Revelation and that the end times were being ushered in.\nBushnell continued the letter on the next day, May 17, in a less philosophical and more practical mood. He mentioned declining an invitation to go fishing and wrote that he would like to go fishing and also take a picnic, “but as times are I guess we will have to put it off for better times, when troubles or dread will not mar pleasure.” For years Bushnell had been cautious about bushwhackers, and this letter gives no indication that he had taken any risks of straying away from town or visiting his fiancé, Eugenia Bronaugh, in Hickory Grove, Missouri. Referencing the bushwhackers, he went on to warn her that she should “be careful, you know what the penalty is and what joy some of your neighbors would have to get a chance to burn your house & destroy your farm, so do not lay yourselves liable.”\nView Shelby's Raid in a larger map\nMore interesting is that as early as May 1864, rumors were starting to circulate about a possible invasion of Missouri. Bushnell had heard that General Marmaduke was already leading an expedition of 30,000 men into the state, with General Sterling “Old Pap” Price preparing an additional 60,000 men. Bushnell recognized that a combined force of 90,000 soldiers invading from Arkansas would have been a completely unrealistic figure, adding that “this we know is not so [but] I shall look for the papers this evening with great interest.”\nAn invasion force of 90,000 never emerged, of course, but Bushnell and his fellow Missourians did have sound reasons to be concerned about a large raid taking shape over the summer and fall. The previous year from September 22 to November 3, 1863, Colonel Joseph “Fighting Jo” Shelby led “Shelby’s Great Raid” into Missouri, disrupted Union Army operations in the state, and caused heavy property damage in towns including Boonville, Warsaw, Tipton, Stockton, and Neosho. The next year, on September 19, 1864, General Price led an invasion with the Army of Missouri (consisting of 12,000 cavalry men and aided by Generals Marmaduke, Shelby, and James F. Fagan) across the Arkansas-Missouri border on what would end up being the largest cavalry raid of the war.\nEven if their calculations were wildly inaccurate, Missouri citizens, including John A. Bushnell, were wise to prepare for the possibility of such an invasion by Sterling Price."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a012e93d-dc30-4fcb-903d-050066ba9d50>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does one properly implement cup feeding for infants?","answer":"To cup feed an infant: 1) Sit the baby upright on your lap, supporting their head with one hand behind shoulders and neck 2) Use a small medicine cup or shot glass for beginners 3) Gently place the cup's edge on the baby's lower lip 4) Bring the liquid to the baby's lower lip so they can lap it up like a cat 5) Maintain a consistent liquid level for continuous lapping 6) Proceed slowly while learning - do not pour liquid into the baby's mouth. This method can eventually become a fast and efficient feeding technique until the baby learns to take the breast, and it helps avoid artificial nipples and teats.","context":["Finger feeding is a technique the main purpose of which is to prepare the baby to take the breast when the baby is reluctant or refuses to latch on. See the information sheet The Baby Who Does Not Yet Latch. Though finger feeding can be used to feed a baby and thus avoid artificial nipples, this is not what it is meant to do really. Furthermore, if the baby is actually taking the breast (latching on) and requires supplementation, this supplementation should be given with a lactation aid at the breast not by finger feeding. See the information sheet Lactation Aid and the video clips. Too often finger feeding is used to feed the baby when a mother has sore nipples and the baby is taken off the breast. This is seen as not interfering with breastfeeding while, at the same time, the “nipples are given a rest”. Taking a baby off the breast for any reason, including sore nipples, should be a last resort only. See the information sheets When Latching, Sore Nipples, APNO (“all purpose nipple ointment”), Candida Protocol, Gentian Violet, Fluconazole and video clips showing how to latch a baby on.\nFinger feeding may be used if:\n- The baby refuses the breast for whatever reason, or if the baby is too sleepy at the breast to breastfeed well. It is also a very good way to wake up a sleepy baby during the first few days of life and there are concerns about intake.\n- The baby does not seem to be able to latch on to the breast properly, and thus does not get milk well. (However, if the baby is latching on, even not well, then it is better to use a lactation aid at the breast to give extra milk).\n- The baby is separated from the mother, for whatever reason. However, in such a situation, a cup is probably a better method of feeding the baby. Since finger feeding should be used primarily to help a baby take the breast when he is reluctant or temporarily unable, the best technique is not finger feeding if the mother is not present to breastfeed him.\n- Breastfeeding is stopped temporarily (there are very few legitimate reasons to stop breastfeeding. See the information sheets Medication and Breastfeeding and Illness and Breastfeeding.\n- Your nipples are so sore that you cannot put the baby to the breast. Finger feeding for several days may allow your nipples to heal without causing more problems by getting the baby used to an artificial nipple. However, see the first paragraph about taking the baby off the breast. Cup feeding is also more appropriate in this situation and takes less time. Taking a baby off the breast should be a last resort only but too often is done as a first resort. Proper positioning and a good latch help sore nipples far more than finger feeding (see the information sheet Sore Nipples). And a good “all purpose nipple ointment” will help as well. This so called “nipple holiday” is not advisable and if suggested within the first few days of life may be a terrible mistake. Taking the baby off the breast does not always result in painless feedings once you start again and sometimes the baby will refuse to latch on.\nFinger feeding is much more similar to breastfeeding than is bottle feeding. In order to finger feed, the baby must keep his tongue down and forward over the gums, his mouth wide (the larger the finger used, the better so using a baby finger to do finger feeding is not a good idea), and his jaw forward. Furthermore, the motion of the tongue and jaw is similar to what the baby does while feeding at the breast. Finger feeding is best used to prepare the baby who is refusing to latch on to take the breast. It needs to be done only for a minute or two, at the most, just before trying the baby on the breast if the baby is refusing to latch on. See video clip Finger feed to latch. If the mother is not present to feed the baby or if the baby still doesn’t latch on after the finger feeding is attempted, then feeding the baby with a cup is better than finger feeding which can be slow.\nPlease Note: If the baby is taking the breast, it is far better to use the lactation aid tube at the breast, if supplementation is truly necessary (See information sheet Protocol to Increase Breastmilk Intake and Lactation Aid). Again, finger feeding is not a good method of supplementation in the latching baby.\nFinger feeding (best learned by watching and doing).\nSee also the video clip Not Yet Latching; Finger feed to Latch\n- Wash your hands. It is better if the fingernail on the finger you will use has been cut short, but this is not necessary.\n- It is best to position yourself and the baby comfortably. The baby’s head should be supported with one hand behind his shoulders and neck; the baby should be on your lap, half seated. It may be easiest if he is facing you. However, any position which is comfortable for you and the baby and which allows you to keep your finger flat in the baby’s mouth will do. See the video clip Finger feed to latch.\n- You will need a lactation aid, made up of a feeding tube (#5French, 93 cm or 36 inches long), and a feeding bottle with an enlarged nipple hole, filled with expressed breast milk or supplement. The feeding tube is passed through the enlarged nipple hole into the fluid.\n- Line up the tube so that it sits on the soft part of your index, thumb, or middle finger. The end of the tube should line up no further than the end of your finger. It is easiest to grip the tube, about where it makes a gentle curve, between your thumb and middle finger and then position your index finger under the tube. If this is done properly, there is no need to tape the tube to your finger.\n- Using your finger with the tube, tickle the baby’s upper lip lightly until the baby opens up his mouth enough to allow your finger to enter. If the baby is very sleepy, but needs to be fed, the finger may be gently insinuated into his mouth. Pull the baby’s lower lip out if necessary by exerting some downward pressure on the baby’s chin. Generally, the baby will begin to suck even if asleep and as he receives liquids he will then wake up.\n- Insert your finger with the tube so that the soft part of your finger remains upwards. Keep your finger as flat as possible, thus keeping the baby’s tongue flat and forward. Usually the baby will begin sucking on the finger, and allow the finger to enter quite far. The baby will not usually gag on your finger even if it is in his mouth quite far, unless the baby is not hungry or he is very used to bottles.\n- Gently pull down the baby’s chin, if his lower lip is sucked in.\n- The technique is working if the baby is drinking. If feeding is very slow, you may raise the bottle above the baby’s head, but usually this should not be necessary. Try to keep your finger straight, flattening the baby’s tongue. Try not to point your finger up, but keep it flat. Do not apply pressure to the roof of baby’s mouth.\n- The use of finger feeding with a syringe to push milk into the baby’s mouth is, in my opinion, too difficult for the mother to do alone and definitely not more effective than simply using a bottle with the nipple hole enlarged and the tube coming from it. The idea of finger feeding is not to feed the baby! The idea is to train the baby to suck properly so that pushing milk into his mouth defeats the whole purpose of finger feeding.\nIf you are having trouble getting the baby to latch on to or to suckle at the breast, remember that a ravenous baby can make the going very difficult. Take the edge off his hunger by using the finger feeding technique for a minute or so. Once the baby has settled a little, and sucks well on your finger (usually only a minute or so), try offering the breast again. If you still encounter difficulty, do not be discouraged. Go back to finger feeding and try again later in the feed or next feeding. This technique usually works. Sometimes several days, or on occasion a week or more, of finger feeding are necessary, however.\n(best learned by watching and doing)\nCup feeding (and similar vessels like spoon, etc) is a method of feeding baby that has been around for a very long period of time. It should be used to feed a baby who is not yet taking the breast and is better than a bottle. This should not be used to supplement a baby who is taking the breast (see the information sheets Lactation Aid and The Baby Who Does Not Yet Latch).\n- Sit baby upright on your lap with baby’s head supported while you have one hand behind his shoulders and neck\n- Use a small medicine cup or shot glass when first learning how to cup feed\n- Place the edge of the cup gently on baby’s lower lip\n- Bring the liquid to baby’s lower lip so baby will lap it up like a pussycat. Do not pour the liquid in baby’s mouth\n- It is important to maintain the level of the liquid as best as possible so baby can continually lap it up.\n- Go slowly as the two of you learn how to do this. Eventually, this can become a very fast and efficient way of feeding until baby learns to take the breast, and this is a good method to use to avoid artificial nipples and teats.\nIf you are leaving the hospital finger or cup feeding the baby, make an appointment with the clinic within a day or so of discharge, or get other good hands-on help quickly. The earlier the better. Once the baby is taking the breast, he may still require the lactation aid to supplement for a period of time; because although the baby may take the breast, the latch can still be less than ideal, and the suck may still not be efficient enough to ensure adequate intake.\nThe information presented here is general and not a substitute for personalized treatment from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) or other qualified medical professionals.\nThis information sheet may be copied and distributed without further permission on the condition that it is not used in any context that violates the WHO International Code on the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (1981) and subsequent World Health Assembly resolutions.

{"question":"What's the key difference between how spiders and frogs explore their surroundings in nature vs literature?","answer":"According to the documents, spiders explore by launching filaments into the vacant surrounding space, as described in 'A Noiseless Patient Spider.' In contrast, frogs in literature like the wordless picture book 'Tuesday' are shown exploring by floating through the air on lilypads, which represents a fantastical rather than natural way of exploration.","context":["Speech and language therapy is all about talking, right? So why would you want to use wordless picture books for your speech therapy session? No written story, no text. Well… that’s exactly why!\n|Pancakes for Breakfast is such a fun wordless picture book for your next speech therapy session!|\nWordless picture books are magical for eliciting language!\nOf course, reading a storybook with text is a great speech therapy activity too. They usually have some fun pictures to talk about, but mainly rely on the text to tell the story. The story is “fed” to the child. That’s great if you’re targeting listening comprehension, “wh” questions, or introducing new vocabulary.\nWith wordless books, however, it’s the pictures that tell the story, offering magical opportunities for children to generate their own sentences, use their inventory of vocabulary, make inferences, and activate their background knowledge as they tell you all about the pictures. Expressive language? Oh yeah!\nWhat happens when you read a book and then you quiz a child about what you’ve read?\nFroggy Learns to Swim by Jonathon London is a storybook with text. You read the line: “So Froggy and his parents flopped outside to the pond- flop flop flop.”\nThe conversation with a child listening usually goes something like this: You ask: “Where are the frogs going?” You may get just a one or maybe a two-word response, “the pond.”\nNow, think about what happens if you have a conversation about the pictures instead of the text.\nLet’s look at the fun wordless book by David Weisner, titled Tuesday. If you ask a child to tell you about one of the pictures, it might go something like this: You: “Oh wow. Look at the frogs! You may get a whole sentence in response, something like this: “They’re floating up in the air with their lilypads!”\nCompare this sentence with an MLU (mean sentence length) of 11 to the sentence with an MLU of 2 in the example of Froggy Goes Swimming.\nWhen exploring a wordless book, you’re likely to get a whole lot more generative language!\nWordless books set up fantastic opportunities for:\n1. Increased sentence length and complexity in the child’s expressive speech. You naturally encourage more detailed responses when asking a child to tell you about a picture and what’s happening.\n2. Making inferences. You: “I wonder why the blackbird is flying away from the frog?” Child: “It’s scared because the frogs are flying!”\n3. Using descriptive words. “It’s dark outside.”\n4. Practice with present and past tense verbs. You: “What’s happening in this picture?” Child: “The birds see the frogs flying!” You: “Oh, no! What happened there?” Child: “The frogs crashed into the clothes!”\n5. A natural opportunity to practice pronouns. You: “Look at that frog!” Child: “It’s upside down!”\n6. Use of feelings words. You: “Look at his face! I wonder what the man is thinking?” Child: “He’s surprised! He’s thinking, What are those frogs doing outside my window?”\n7. Embedded opportunities to explore story elements of characters, setting, action, problem, and solution.\n8. Literacy skills: Sequencing and telling a simple narrative. Have the child tell you the story by describing each picture as they turn the pages.\n9. Toss in opportunities to practice conversational level articulation or fluency techniques as you explore and discuss the pictures together. Great in mixed groups. I think wordless books are a must-have in your speech therapy library!\nHere’s a list of 19 wonderful wordless books you absolutely should check out:\nI’ve added Amazon links for your convenience, I don’t get any commission or other consideration for the links, I just want to make it easy for you to check out these great books.\n- Goodnight Gorilla by Peggy Ratham is the story of a mischievous little gorilla in the zoo who steals the zookeeper’s keys.\n- Wave by Suzy Lee is the story of a little girl at the beach who plays with a wave at the beach that seems almost alive.\n- A Boy, a Dog, and a Frog by Mercer Meyer is the story of a boy and a dog who see a clever little frog and their misadventures when they try to catch him in a net.\n- Found by Jeff Newman is the story of a little girl who keeps a lost dog, then has to give him up when the owner is found.\n- The Umbrella by Ingrid and Dieter Schubert is the story of a little dog who finds an umbrella and while holding it, is blown away by a gust of wind, sending him on amazing adventures.\n- Float by Daniel Miyares is the story of a little boy and his paper boat.\n- Where’s Walrus? by Stephen Savage is the story of a sneaky walrus who escaped the zoo, and the zookeeper who can’t seem to find him- even when it’s right in front of him!\n- Wolf in the Snow by Matthew Cordel is the story of a little girl and a wolf cub who both get lost in a snowstorm and how they become friends.\n- Harold and the Purple Crayon by Crocket Johnson is the story of a little boy who uses a purple crayon to draw his way into exciting adventures.\n- Pancakes for Breakfast by Tomie dePaola is the story of a little old lady who craves pancakes for breakfast but runs into all kinds of problems when she tries to make them.\n- The Girl and the Bicycle by Mark Pett is the story of a little girl who sees a bicycle she wants to buy, but she has to find a way to get the money for it.\n- Tuesday by David Weisner is a story of strange happenings in the frog pond on Tuesday.

{"question":"How did Nixon and Carter differ in their approaches to Soviet relations?","answer":"Nixon pursued a policy of détente with the Soviet Union, visiting Moscow in 1972 and hosting Soviet leader Brezhnev in 1973, resulting in grain sales and strategic nuclear weapons limitation talks. Carter took a more confrontational approach, particularly after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, when he imposed a grain embargo, advocated boycotting the Moscow Olympics, and asked the Senate to table SALT II treaty consideration. Though Carter had initially signed SALT II in 1979, the treaty was never ratified by the U.S. Senate.","context":["Biography for Richard M. Nixon\nAfter finally achieving his dream of becoming president in 1968, Richard Milhous Nixon became the first U.S. chief executive to resign from office. It was a dramatic ending to a long and controversial political career marked by early unscrupulous election campaign tactics and later foreign policy accomplishments. Nixon was born on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California and grew up in Whittier. He graduated from the small Quaker-run Whittier College in 1934 and thanks to a scholarship and part-time work, managed to complete his law studies at Duke University in 1937. After serving as a town counsel and corporate tax lawyer, Nixon moved to Washington, D.C. in January 1942 to work in the Office of Price Administration. That August, he joined the navy and served in the Pacific as a lieutenant. After the war, Nixon entered California politics. In his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives, he branded his Democratic opponent, Jerry Voorhis, as a tool of organized labor because he had accepted campaign donations from the Congress of Industrial Organizations' Political Action Committee. Nixon also claimed that the committee was communist-dominated. The slander was unfounded, but voters responded to it and gave Nixon a solid victory. In Congress, Nixon won a national reputation for his aggressive behavior as a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee. In a famous trial, he supported the claims of Whittaker Chambers that Alger Hiss, a respected diplomat and president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, had been a member of the Communist Party before World War II and had spied for the Soviet Union. Hiss was eventually convicted of perjury. Capitalizing on his newfound notoriety, Nixon decided in 1950 to run for the U.S. Senate against Democratic representative Helen Gahagen Douglas. Once again, Nixon, relying on unsubstantiated evidence and innuendo, won the election by labeling his opponent a communist. Nixon's youth, anticommunist reputation, and California residence made him an ideal running mate for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. During the campaign, Nixon was almost forced off of the Republican ticket because of the discovery that a special campaign fund had been set up by wealthy supporters to help defer his Senate campaign costs. It was alleged that Nixon used some of the funds in an inappropriate personal manner. Nixon went on national television with his family. The group included a dog called Checkersâa gift Nixon said he would not return. His talk (thereafter referred to as the Checkers speech), an effective, tearful denial of wrongdoing, stymied efforts to force his resignation. Because of Eisenhower's illnesses and distaste for internal party politics, Nixon assumed the task of pacifying various Republican Party groups and took many overseas goodwill trips during his eight years as vice president. It was on one such trip to Moscow that he seized upon the opportunity to debate Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev about the benefits of capitalism over communism. This exchange, known as the Kitchen Debate because it took place in the kitchen appliance display at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, brought Nixon enormous popularity in the United States. In 1960, Nixon easily won the Republican nomination for president, but he was defeated in the general election by Democrat John F. Kennedy in a very close race. Many political analysts attributed his narrow loss to the mistake of agreeing to debate Kennedy on live television. The haggard and stony-faced Nixon, although a brilliant debater, was no match for the youthful and photogenic Kennedy. A majority of the television audience felt that Kennedy had won, but radio listeners felt that Nixon had. Two years later, Nixon ran for governor of California and after losing badly to the Democratic incumbent, held a news conference in which he attacked the press for its alleged anti-Nixon bias. He concluded with the sarcastic comment, \"You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference.\" Nixon moved to New York City and became a partner of a large Wall Street law firm. In 1964, when other Republicans refused to endorse conservative Barry Goldwater, Nixon campaigned on his behalf. This, plus frequent appearances for Republican candidates across the nation, enabled Nixon to make a remarkable political comeback in 1968. This time, running against Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey and third-party candidate George Wallace, he won. Nixon posed as a candidate of the \"silent majority,\" the average Americans whose interests had been ignored by a liberal Democratic Party preoccupied with the problems of African Americans and the media-grabbing antics of the nation's privileged, university youth. Nixon campaigned against more welfare for African Americans, against cultural permissiveness and political radicalism, and for law and order and respect for authority and tradition. His election, in retrospect, was a watershed in U.S. political history because it signaled the breakup and decline of the liberal coalition that had dominated U.S. politics since the New Deal. Nixon assumed the presidency in 1969 at a difficult time in U.S. history. High inflation, domestic civil rights protests, and the Vietnam War had split the nation along age, class, and racial lines. During his first term, Nixon gradually withdrew U.S. forces from South Vietnam. Under his \"Vietnamization plan,\" the South Vietnamese army was trained to take over the fighting and to use American air power to force North Vietnam to relinquish its quest for total victory. In 1970, American bombing of communist bases in Cambodia and Laos succeeded in disrupting enemy supply lines but unleashed a fury of domestic political protest. Undaunted, Nixon continued to alternate between increased bombing and a willingness to negotiate as U.S. ground combat forces were withdrawn. Finally, in January 1973, after massive American B-52 bombing attacks, North Vietnam agreed to a negotiated peace. This \"peace with honor\" turned out to be little more than an opportunity for the United States to pull out of a war it could not win, however. South Vietnam fell under the domination of the North in 1975. In addition, the bombing had dramatically enlarged the area of conflict in Indochina, undermining sources of stability in Cambodia and giving an opening for the Khmer Rouge and their policies of mass murder. Nixon's other foreign policy achievements were less controversial. Pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence called dÃ©tente, he improved relations with the Soviet Union. He visited Moscow in 1972, and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev came to the United States in 1973. Their talks resulted in a large grain sale to the Soviet Union by the United States and the beginning of talks on limiting strategic nuclear weapons. Nixon also visited the People's Republic of China in 1972, thereby opening communications with that country and substantially reducing tensions in the world. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Nixon administration, along with the Soviet Union, successfully pressured Israel, Egypt, and Syria to cease hostilities. With peace restored, Nixon made a friendly visit to Israel and four Arab nations in 1974. In domestic politics, Nixon's efforts to curtail the federal government's role in civil rights advocacy and social welfare provision met with mixed results. He dismantled many liberal programs of the 1960s, slowed down the progress of school integration, and appointed four conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. Yet the Democratic Congress blocked his legislation to prohibit forced busing, stymied numerous attempts to cut social programs, and refused to confirm two of his Supreme Court nominees. Nixon, moreover, sometimes initiated policies more liberal than conservative, as in his imposition of wage and price controls in 1971 and his Family Assistance Plan proposal of 1970, a bold welfare program that would have guaranteed each U.S. family a minimum annual income. Partially out of a desire to stop leaks of classified Vietnam War-related information to the press and out of a desire to ensure his own reelection in 1972, Nixon authorized the establishment of a team of agents (nicknamed the Plumbers) to tap telephones illegally and burglarize the offices of opponents. When they were caught in the Democratic Party's national campaign office in the Watergate building in Washington, D.C. in June 1972 and arrested, Nixon authorized the payment of large sums of campaign contribution money to maintain their silence and promised them clemency after the election. (He had previously authorized the infiltration of the student New Left and antiwar movements to spy on them and to provoke their members to ever more extreme actions.) In the fall, Nixon was elected by an overwhelming majority against his Democratic rival, George McGovern. Shortly after Nixon began his second term, his vice president, Spiro Agnew, was forced to resign for income tax evasion. Then the cover-up Nixon had authorized of the activities of the clandestine Plumbers operation began to unravel. Over the course of the next two years, Nixon and the nation experienced his gradual political destruction. A nationally televised Senate investigation piled up evidence of his guilt in obstructing justice and in abusing the powers and privileges of his office for personal and political gain. Finally, in August 1974, Nixon was forced by a Supreme Court decision to turn over tapes he had made of conversations in his office detailing his efforts to prevent the discovery of his involvement in the cover-up of the Watergate break-in. Faced with certain impeachment by Congress, Nixon resigned. One month later, President Gerald Ford granted Nixon a full pardon from any federal prosecution. Nixon accepted the pardon but never admitted that he had ever done anything illegal. In retirement, he continued to travel and write about foreign policy issues. Nixon's penchant for secrecy and illegality had the long-term effect of not only diminishing his achievements, but also diminishing the stature of the presidency. He died in New York City on April 22, 1994.","Jimmy Carter - Key Events\n01/20/1977: Carter inaugurated\nCarter is inaugurated the thirty-ninth President of the United States.\n01/21/1977: Draft evaders pardoned\nCarter pardons Vietnam War draft evaders.\n2/02/1977: Emergency Natural Gas Act\nCongress passes Emergency Natural Gas Act, authorizing the President to deregulate natural gas prices due to a shortage in supply.

The Camp David Accords are often considered the most significant foreign policy achievement of Carter’s administration.\nTension in the Middle East had continued unabated since the 1967 war between Israel and Egypt. In November 1967, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 242. The resolution called for the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories acquired during the war and for termination of all claims or states of belligerency between all nations or states in the area. Recognition by Egypt of the right of Israel to peaceful existence and the return of lands acquired by the Six Days War remained preconditions for peace in the region. Following the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, the Security Council issued Resolution 338, calling on the parties to begin negotiations toward establishing a “just and durable peace.”\nPresident Carter decided to act after Egyptian President Anwar Sadat of Egypt had traveled to Jerusalem and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin had returned from a reciprocal visit to Cairo. Carter invited the leaders to the United States to hammer out a peace treaty between the countries. They would also seek a framework for the resolution of the Palestinian crisis. The three met at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, from September 5 through September 17, 1978.\nThe Camp David Accords, signed by Carter, Begin, and Sadat, called for recognition of UN Security Council Resolution 242 and established the fundamental framework for peace in the region. The agreement called for:\nMutual respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of every state in the area and the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries;\nNegotiations between Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Palestinian representatives for the establishment of arrangements leading to an autonomous and self-governing authority for the West Bank and Gaza within five years;\nThe negotiation of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel within three months that recognized the right of Israel to exist and the return of territory taken by Israel in previous conflicts.\nThe peace treaty was officially signed in March 1979. It was a major breakthrough, perhaps the most significant by an American President dealing with Middle East affairs, and established a precedent for future high-level negotiations over these issues.\nWatch the video of President Carter's remarks after the Camp David Summit.\n10/15/1978: Congress passes energy, employment bills\nCongress passes a revised energy bill eighteen months after Carter proposed it.

The U.S. Senate never ratifies the controversial treaty, although both nations voluntarily comply with its terms.\n07/15/1979: A crisis of confidence\nCarter delivers what becomes known as his “malaise speech,” blaming the problems of the nation on “a crisis of confidence.”\nCarter Gives “Malaise” Speech\nOn July 15, 1979, President Jimmy Carter delivered what became known as his “Crisis of Confidence” or “malaise” speech to the American public on national television.\nIn the late 1970s, the United States faced a variety of challenges, including high inflation, rising interest and unemployment rates, and an energy crisis created by dependence on foreign oil and over consumption. In response, President Carter called together a gathering of American citizens at Camp David and spoke with them, as well as with others across the nation, to gain a sense of what ordinary citizens regarded as the main problems facing the country.\nWhen Americans tuned in to watch the President on July 15, most expected a talk on the energy crisis and administration plans to address it. Carter, however, targeted broader issues. He began by acknowledging that the country faced a “fundamental threat to American democracy.” The President identified the threat as a “crisis of confidence” that struck at the heart and soul of the national will. For Carter, the problem lay in the lack of respect Americans held for their public institutions and leaders. Restoring that faith and confidence, said Carter, was the “most important task” facing the nation.\nAlthough the speech also contained substantial energy proposals -increased domestic production, the restriction of foreign oil imports, and an excess-profits tax on energy income to pay for new alternative energy development- much of this was lost in the rhetoric of malaise that colored the address. That rhetoric backfired on the President. Public perceptions of Carter as weak-in effect, a belief that Carter was suffering from the very crisis he spoke about-grew, as many Americans blamed his administration for the problems he lamented.

{"question":"How do neutron and electron interactions with matter compare in terms of their penetration paths through materials?","answer":"Neutrons and electrons interact with matter very differently. Neutrons interact directly with the atomic nucleus and travel in straight paths, with their attenuation varying irregularly with atomic number. In contrast, electrons follow nonlinear paths through matter due to their small mass and charge, as they are easily scattered by atomic electrons. Electrons primarily lose energy through ionization, excitation, and bremsstrahlung radiation when passing through materials. Their range in air can be on the order of meters, while neutrons can penetrate deep into materials with their penetration depth depending on their energy level (thermal vs fast neutrons) and the target material's composition.","context":["In the short-wavelength world of matter waves -- past the UV portion of the spectrum and beyond x rays -- materials look very different and the rules of imaging are different than with photons. \"Neutrons show you things that x rays will never be able to,\" said Wade Richards of the Univ. of California/Davis research nuclear reactor in Sacramento, CA (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Neutron radiograph of a flower corsage shows the method's ability to image thin biological samples. Photo courtesy of Nray Services.\nThe ways that neutrons interact with matter are very different from the way x rays interact with matter. X rays interact with the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus of an atom. Neutrons interact with the nucleus itself. In general, x-ray attenuation increases as the atomic number of the target material increases; usually, the attenuation is greater for lower energy x rays. Some light elements (such as hydrogen, boron, and carbon) have high thermal neutron attenuation coefficients, while some heavier elements (such as lead) have relatively small attenuation coefficients. The methods can be used in a complementary fashion. And while the imaging materials are different, neutron radiography is similar to x-ray radiography: a beam of particles penetrates the target, and the shadow of the device is captured.\nPatrick Doty, Senior Scientist at Sandia National Labs. (Albuquerque, NM) said that because the intensity of neutron scattering varies irregularly with atomic number and neutron energies vary over a large range (and thus a wide range of useful wavelengths), neutrons can probe the structure of matter over many scales of length.\nNeutrons can be divided into several energy groups: cold, thermal, epi-thermal, fast, and relativistic. This article concentrates on thermal and fast neutrons. Thermal neutrons have energies of roughly 0.03 eV or less, whereas fast neutrons are 10 to 15 MeV. Fission reactors produce neutrons with a wide range of energies, but because most reactors also have large volumes of moderator (to slow the neutrons down so they will be more efficient at initiating new fissions), reactors are excellent sources of thermal neutrons.\nBeams of fast neutrons can be generated indirectly from particle accelerators (which accelerate charged particles into a target that gives off neutrons). \"Fast neutrons are very highly penetrating,\" Doty said. \"You can tailor the energies to look at a material, or you can look at shielded things -- you can look through lead shielding.\" Radioisotopes such as californium and amerecium-beryllium can generate fast neutrons as well, although this is not generally used for radiography. Thermal neutrons from reactors\nAt the McClellan Nuclear Radiation Center (MNRC) located just north of Sacramento, CA, Wade Richards, Tom Majchrowski and others use thermal neutrons from the small nuclear reactor for a variety of applications, including inspecting aircraft parts for corrosion.\nThe MNRC is a small nuclear reactor: whereas a power-generating reactor produces 2000 to 3000 MW, the McClellan reactor produces 2 MW. In nuclear reactors, neutrons are generated by fission in uranium. One neutron hits a 235U and two neutrons emerge. The neutrons emerge isotropically, heading in all directions. To use the neutrons for imaging, part of the shielding (10-ft.-thick concrete walls outside the tank of water in which the uranium sits) is removed. Pipes lined with neutron-absorbing and -scattering materials remove the particles that are too far out of line, providing a collimated beam of neutrons to the imaging bays. The reactor provides a flux of about 4 X 106 neutrons/cm2/s at the radiography plane.\nRichards said that in the 2D and 3D computer tomography neutron radiography systems in his facility, a converter screen uses gadolinium (which has a high cross-section for thermal neutrons), which emits beta particles when bombarded with neutrons, and the beta particles are caught by a fluorescing zinc sulfide material. Once the image has been converted to visible light, it can be captured on film or by a video camera sitting outside the neutron-beam axis. (Other converters can also be used, including lithium carbonate and plastic scintillators, depending on the application and neutron energies used.) A major application of neutron radiography at the reactor is for real-time imaging of military aircraft wings as a standard maintenance method to detect corrosion.\nThe McClellan site is the only facility in the world equipped with a robot stage and a video-camera radiography system that allows real-time imaging of objects 34 ft. long by 12 ft. high and as heavy as 5000 pounds.\nThere is always some concern about how much one can bombard the object before the nucleus becomes radioactive. For aluminum, Richards said there is a 2.5-minute decay time. \"Within 10 minutes, it's all gone.\"\nThermal neutron radiography\nFigure 2. Neutron radiograph of a handgun shows a wide range of contrasts within a complex mechanical structure.\nGlen MacGillivray at Nray Services (Petawawa, ON, Canada) described the complementary relationship between x-ray and neutron radiography: \"When one is looking for a flaw, the contrast between the flaw and the unflawed material is paramount. If the attenuation in the material is too large, then insufficient beam penetrates to allow inspection.\" For applications that require distinguishing materials that attenuate differently, usually one wants to find the higher attenuator within a bulk material of lower attenuation. \"So,\" MacGillivray said, \"finding lead in a paraffin block (or a needle in a haystack) would work for x rays while looking for paraffin in a lead block (or a straw in a needlestack) would work for neutrons.\"\nIn addition to imaging corrosion in aircraft wings, neutron radiography's ability to detect hydrogen and carbon yield other applications. Neutron computer tomography has been used to analyze flaws and misalignments in o-rings, which are used for sealing joints in rockets and other heavy machinery. The method allows researchers to look through the outer (usually metallic) materials to see how artifacts from the fabrication process sometimes put crimps into the rings when they are in place (work of this sort for NASA has been done at McClellan).\nIn a similar way, neutron radiography can be used for viewing lubricants or other details of interest within a metal structure (Figure 2), or for looking at explosives contained within metals.\n\"Thermal neutron radiography is limited to reactor-based sources for high-resolution production-rate work,\" MacGillivray said. Accelerator and isotopic sources of neutrons can be used for imaging, but with sacrifices in speed and/or resolution. Images are obtained using a variety of techniques, including direct to film from gadolinium foil, indirect to film from activated foils of dysprosium (Dy, atomic number 66) or indium, to a CCD device from a scintillator, or to an imaging plate from a scintillator. \"Imaging speeds of several thousand frames per second have been obtained,\" MacGillivray said.\nMacGillivray said the neutron flux required for imaging depends on the application. \"We have successfully used image-plane neutron fluxes ranging from 5 X 104 to 4 X 107 neutrons/cm2/s for film imaging,\" he said. MacGillivray will be presenting his invited paper, \"Imaging with neutrons: the other penetrating radiation,\" at the Penetrating Radiation Systems and Applications conference at SPIE's Annual Meeting in July.\nIn addition to the applications mentioned above, neutron radiography can be used with a contrast agent to look for residual ceramic core material inside jet engine turbine blades. Another application is an indirect method of inspecting nuclear fuel -- a very radioactive material that would, if inspected directly, fog the film.\nFast neutron radiography\nFigure 3. In addition to being gathered from nuclear reactors, neutrons can be generated by linear accelerators. This machine generates neutrons by accelerating protons into a beryllium target. The systems can generate from 108 to 1013 neutrons/second. Photo courtesy of AccSys Technology.\nBeams of fast neutrons, with energies from 10 to 15 MeV, offer different imaging capabilities than thermal neutrons. These energetic particles can be produced by linear accelerators.\nRobert Hamm of AccSys Technology (Pleasanton, CA) said his company generates neutrons from linear accelerators by knocking an electron off a proton or deuteron (usually from hydrogen gas), accelerating the positively charged particle, then bombarding a target (usually beryllium). The target then emits secondary radiation (neutrons), mostly moving in the same direction as the ion beam. (Figure 3). \"Fast neutrons penetrate matter very easily,\" Hamm said.\nFast neutron radiography can be used in prospecting for diamonds or other minerals, Hamm said. It also shows mineral inclusions in rocks. For this application, users shine two beams at the target, one after the other. One neutron beam is at a resonant energy for the mineral, the other is off-frequency. The difference between the images provides information about the interior of the rock.\nMeanwhile, James Hall and others at Lawrence Livermore National Labs (Livermore, CA) produce fast neutrons using a \"DD source.\" This is a system in which a deuterium beam is accelerated to the desired energies and hits deuterium with a pressurized gas cell (at 2 to 3 atm). The interaction creates neutrons mostly going in the same direction as the incoming beam.\nHall uses fast neutrons to penetrate steel, lead, or uranium. \"We can look at voids of a few cubic millimeters in size behind up to four inches of uranium,\" he said, \"and we can see it well.\"\nHall wants to create a system that will fit into a small laboratory and can image cubic-millimeter-scale voids or other structural defects in heavily shielded thick materials. The system should also be able to acquire tomographic image data sets, allowing users to gain a 3D image of the object.\nTo detect fast neutrons, Hall's group is using a rigid 4-cm-thick plastic scintillator indirectly viewed by a single commercial CCD camera. A thin mirror made of front-surfaced-aluminized Pyrex glass reflects light from the scintillator to the camera, which is well out of the neutron beam path. The camera's CCD is a cryogenically cooled thinned, back-illuminated 1024- X 1024-pixel CCD with an antireflective coating on its active area. The detector can be used for image integration times as long as an hour.\nApplications include looking at thick objects not well penetrated by thermal neutrons. Hall's group has imaged a 6-in.-thick uranium and polyethylene slab assembly (with features machined into the polyethylene). The group also imaged a set of nine conventional step wedges. The step wedges were fabricated from lead, Lucite®, mock high explosive, aluminum, beryllium, graphite, brass, polyethylene, and stainless steel. All were 0.5-in.-thick pieces with uniform steps ranging from 0.5 in. to 5 in. in width. All of steps in each of the materials within the detector's field of view could be discerned in the final processed image. A series of other imaging experiments, including tomographic imaging, have also been performed.\nYvonne Carts-Powell, based in Boston, MA, writes about optoelectronics and the Internet.","CHARGED PARTICLE IONIZATION AND RANGE Unlike the neutral radiations (e.g., neutrons and gamma/X rays), the charged particles (e.g., electrons, protons and alphas) are subjected to the coulombic forces from electrons and nuclei within the material through which they pass. Some of the various empirical relationships for charged particle ranges have been developed over time are presented herein. As a charged particle transverses a material, the particle slows as it loses kinetic energy. The loss of energy by charged particles traveling through a material is broken into two components based on the mechanism of energy transfer—either collisional or radiative energy loss. The total stopping power is\ndE dE dE dx dx col dx rad\nwhere (dE/dx)col is the electronic energy loss due to Coulomb interactions (i.e., the ionization and excitation), and (dE/dx)rad is the nuclear energy loss (e.g., due to emission of Bremsstrahlung or Cerenkov radiation, and nuclear interactions). Excitation raises an electron to a higher energy shell, whereas ionization completely removes the electron from the atom. Ionization creates an ion pair, which is the (now) free electron and the positively charged atom from which the electron was removed. The freed electron may possess sufficient kinetic energy to cause further ionization events (such energetic electrons are sometimes called delta rays). The term (dE/dx)col is also called the linear energy transfer (LET), i.e., the linear rate of energy loss (dE/dx) of a charged particle due to ionization and excitation.\nSome scientists define the LET in terms of dE/dx while others prefer to define the LET with respect to the material density (ρ) such that the LET units are, for example, MeV·cm2/mg. The mass stopping power (S) is the total energy lost per path length by a charged particle [MeV/g/cm²]\ndE / dx\nAnother quantity used to describe particle energy loss is specific ionization. The specific ionization is the number of ion pairs (i.p.) formed per unit distance traveled by the charged particle [i.p./cm]: S .I .\ndE / dx [eV/cm] w [eV/i.p.]\nwhere w is the average energy expended to create an ion or electron-hole pair. The energy required to create an electron-hole pair depends on the irradiated material. Experimental results have shown that the actual energy necessary to create an ion pair is about 2-3 times greater than the ionization potential. For instance, the ionization potentials of oxygen and nitrogen are 13.6 and 14.5 eV, respectively, whereas the mean energy to create an ion pair in air is 34 eV. Material Ion pair generation energy (w)\nsilicon dioxide (SiO2)\nExample: What is the charge transfer rate in pC/micron for a 37 MeV·cm2/mg particle traveling through silicon?\nSolution: First, obtain a conversion factor between charge and energy. The amount of energy required to create an ion pair is material dependent. Silicon requires 3.6 eV to create each electron-hole pair, so wehp 3.6 10 6 MeV/ion pair MeV 22.5 7 q pC 1.6 10 pC/ion pair\nNext, we can find the equivalent charge transfer rate given the density of silicon (ρ = 2.33 g/cm3) LET (37 MeV cm 2 /mg)(2330 mg/cm 3 ) pC 0.38 μm wehp / q (22.5 MeV/pC)(10,000 μm/cm)\nUniversally for silicon, 1 pC/µm = 97 MeV/(mg/cm2). Light Charged Particles (e.g., electrons, betas) For our purposes, light charged particles are electrons, positrons and beta particles. The terminology beta particle is intended to denote an electron originating from a radioactive decay process. When electrons pass through matter, several possible processes may occur: 1. Ionization and excitation in which the energy loss mechanism is similar to that for heavy charged particles; 2. Bremsstrahlung, which is the creation of X-rays from electron deceleration; 3. Elastic scattering from nuclear and electronic interactions; and 4. Nuclear excitation which is usually negligible. A single expression describing the radiative energy loss by electrons for a large range of kinetic energies is not available. The collisional energy loss (LET) for fast electrons may be computed from the Bethe formula. Electrons (betas) are easily scattered due to their small mass and charge. The electrons travel a nonlinear path and their range in air is on the order of meters. Beta Particle Range The maximum range, Rmax, (material independent) of a beta particle can be computed from an empirical formula given by Katz and Penfold:† 0.412 E 1.2650.0954 ln( E ) Rmax [g/cm ] 0.530 E 0.106 2\n0.01 E 2.5 MeV E 2.5 MeV\nwhere Eβ is the maximum beta energy in MeV. The ability to stop betas depends primarily on the number of electrons in the absorber (i.e., the areal density, which is the number of electrons per cm2). Hence, the range when expressed as a density thickness (g/cm2) of the material gives a generic quantifier by which various absorbers can be compared. With the maximum range known, the actual shielding thickness required can be computed t\nwhere ρ is the material density. Such an approach can be used to produce energy-range curves. A useful rule of thumb is that the range of a beta particle in g/cm2 is approximately half its energy in MeV. Beta particles from natural radionuclides are easily stopped by thin sheet of metal or glass. Oftentimes, aluminum is used to shield against protons and electrons. For example, the figure below shows that 2 mm of aluminum is sufficient to shield against 1 MeV electrons and 20 MeV protons.\nL. Katz and A.S. Penfold, Rev. Mod. Phys., 24 (1952), p. 28.\nMean ranges of protons and electrons in aluminum [Source: E.J. Daly, A.Hilgers, G. Drolshagen, and H.D.R. Evans, \"Space Environment Analysis: Experience and Trends,\" ESA 1996 Symposium on Environment Modelling for Space-based Applications, Sept. 18-20, 1996, ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands.] Example: Determine the copper thickness necessary to stop the beta particles emitted from Co-60. Solution: Cobalt-60 emits beta particles with a maximum energy of 0.3179 MeV, hence the maximum range of those particles is\nRmax (0.412) (0.3179)1.2650.0954 ln(0.3179) 0.08529 g/cm 2 Copper has a density of 8.933 g/cm3, so the actual shield thickness necessary is R 0.08529 g/cm 2 0.00955 cm thickness max 8.933 g/cm 3 Electron Range The average range of an electron from a monoenergetic beam of energy equal to E,max is greater than that of a beta particle because beta particles have a continuous energy spectrum from zero energy up to a maximum kinetic energy; in particular, the average beta energy is about one-third of the maximum beta energy ( E ,avg 13 E ,max ). To compute the electron range using the Katz-Penfold relation of Eq. (5), we\nutilize the kinetic energy of the monoenergetic electrons to find the range. Bremsstrahlung Bremsstrahlung—which is German for braking radiation—is secondary photon radiation produced by the deceleration of charged particles passing through matter. Bremsstrahlung is primarily electron braking radiation. Hence, beta rays and electrons can give rise to highly penetrating X-rays. When the negatively-charged electron passes near the nucleus, the high-speed electron is\n– – –\nrapidly accelerated toward the nucleus. Classical electromagnetic theory states that the electron loses energy, in the form of a photonic emission, in proportion to the square of the acceleration. The potential for bremsstrahlung creation increases with increasing particle energy as well as increasing atomic number (Z) of the absorber. The fraction of beta particle energy converted to X-rays is f 3.5 10 4 Z E\nwhere Eβ is the maximum beta energy in MeV. The fraction of electron energy from a monoenergetic electron source, such as an X-ray tube, that is converted to photons is f e 10 3 Z E e\nwhere Ee is the electron energy in MeV. Shielding must be properly designed to prevent bremsstrahlung (e.g., lead shielding for a strong beta/electron source could do more harm than good). In particular, the use of lower Z material is favored for electron shielding. Example: Suppose a 1 mCi Co-60 source is encapsulated in a spherical lead shield such that the thickness is just sufficient to stop all the beta particles emitted by the Co-60. What is the X-ray flux as a function of distance outside the spherical shield? Solution: For each decay, cobalt-60 emits a single beta particle at a maximum energy of 0.3179 MeV. Recall that the atomic number of lead (Pb) is 82, such that the fraction of beta energy converted is f (3.5 10 4 )(82)(0.3179 MeV) 0.009124\nThe source energy (SE) for the photons should be based on the average beta energy, which is about onethird of the maximum beta energy. decays MeV SE f A 13 E max (0.009124)(10 3 Ci)(3.7 1010 sec /Ci)( 13 )(0.3179 decay ) 35,773 MeV sec If the concern for the bremsstrahlung is based upon potential human exposure, the energy received per photon should be assumed to be the maximum possible (Eβ-max); otherwise, is may be assumed that each photon receives the average beta energy. We assume the former situation here, such that the photon generation rate is 35,773 MeV photons SE sec SX 1.125 10 5 MeV E X 0.3179 photon sec The latter assumption would have resulted in three times as many photons, but each having one-third the energy. Considering the overall shielded Co-60 to be a point source yields the following relation photons 1.125 10 5 sec SX (r ) 4 r 2 4 r 2 This does not include the gamma photons from the Co-60 decay. Heavy Charged Particles (e.g., protons, alphas) Heavy particles are defined here as those radiations having a rest mass significantly larger than that of an electron. Therefore, heavy charged particles include the proton (p), alpha (α), and other ions. Besides ionization, heavy charged particles can undergo nuclear reactions. Unlike the neutron, these positively charged particles must possess sufficient energy to overcome the repulsive forces of the nucleus for such reactions to occur. Heavy charged particles lose only a fraction of their energy in collisions with atomic electrons. Heavy charged particles are much more massive than electrons; therefore, such particles are only slightly deflected by the atomic electrons. Consequently, heavy charged particles travel in nearly straight lines through matter. Because of the small, gradual amount of energy transferred from the ion to the absorber\nmaterial, the particle passage may be treated as a continuous slowing down process. Near the end of its track, an ion experiences charge exchange between the absorbing material, and picks up electrons until it becomes a neutral atom. The heavy charged particles are the least penetrating radiations for a given energy. Because of the continuous slowing, ions have a much more defined range than the other radiations. Particle Range Relations If the range of a heavy particle can be determined in one material (e.g., air), then the BraggKleeman rule‡ can be applied to determine the range in a second material:\nR1 2 R2 1\nFor instance, if air is the medium for which the heavy particle range is known, then substituting the density (1.23×10–3 g/cm3) and effective atomic mass (14.6 g/mol) for air at 15°C and 1 atm yields: R 3.2 10 4\nFor a compound or mixture, the effective atomic mass can be found from M eff i\nwhere ωi and γi are the weight and atomic fractions, respectively, of the i-th constituent.\nThis figure shows the range (in microns) in silicon of several charged particles, including alpha (α), He-3, triton (T or H-3), deuteron (D or H-2), and the proton (p), as a function of their kinetic energy.\nAlpha Particle Range§ Alpha particles travel short, straight distances in materials. The range of an alpha particle in air is a few centimeters. The alpha particle range in air (at 15C and 1 atm) is closely approximated by:\n0.56 E Rair [cm] 1.24 E 2.62 ‡ §\nfor E 4 MeV for 4 E 8 MeV\nW. H. Bragg and R.

An alpha particle from a natural radionuclide is least penetrating of the radiations examined here, and the “natural” alpha is stopped by a sheet of paper or by dead layer of skin.

Between technical names and nicknames, it can be nearly impossible to know the right term to use when describing a horse! However, it is important to educate yourself on the proper titles for horses at various ages. Doing so will allow you to more effectively communicate with other equestrians and care providers.\nSo, what is a male horse called? A male horse over the age of four years old is called either a stallion or a gelding, depending on its ability to reproduce. Between the age of one-year-old and four years old, male horses are referred to as colts. You may also hear a male horse called a stud or a sire if it is used for breeding purposes.\nAs you can see, the terminology used to describe a male horse is slightly more complicated than that of a female horse. In this post, we will walk you through everything you need to know to properly identify a male horse. With this information in your back pocket, you will be prepared to interact with other equestrians and horse owners as you navigate the world of horses.\nWhat Do You Call a Male Horse?\nA male horse that has reached adulthood is called either a stallion or a gelding, depending on its ability to reproduce. The terms stallion and gelding are reserved for male horses that are over the age of four. In some cases, a male horse is called a stud or a sire when referring to breeding.\nMale horses between one year and four years of age are called colts. Before they reach a year old, all horses, both male and female, are called foals.\nIdentifying a Male Horse\nUnlike identifying a female horse, identifying a male horse is quite simple! A quick glance at the horse’s underside will reveal their genitals. A stallion is an adult male horse that is left intact and maintains the ability to reproduce. A gelding, on the other hand, is an adult male horse that has been gelded. Once the horse is gelded or neutered, they are no longer able to reproduce.\nMost male horses are gelded before they reach one year old if the owner knows that they will not be used for breeding purposes. Gelding a male horse is the best way to eliminate the aggressive behaviors that often begin to appear once the horse reaches sexual maturity around 2 years of age.\nIn order to ensure that you are using the right terminology for the male horse, you will also need to determine its age. This is best done by examining the horse’s teeth. If the horse has a full set of permanent teeth, they are likely over the age of five.\nHorses that are under the age of four will not have their full set of teeth, this fact alone confirms that they are a colt, whether they have been gelded or not. Of course, there are other, more accurate ways to determine the exact age of a horse. However, examining their teeth will give you the quickest results.\nHow to Tell the Difference Between a Stallion and a Gelding\nLet’s take a closer look at the factors that define a stallion versus a gelding. These terms are often used interchangeably when describing an adult male horse. However, it is important to understand the correct terminology to ensure proper communication.\nAny male horse over the age of four that is left intact and has the ability to reproduce is called a stallion. Stallions, while certainly necessary for the advancement of the equine population, often display aggressive behaviors that make them difficult to manage. For this reason, many horse owners choose to geld their male horses.\nGelding is a surgical procedure in which reproduction is made impossible through neutering. Most horses are gelded between the ages of 6 months to one year of age before they reach full sexual maturity. Not only does gelding eliminate some of the aggressive behaviors that the horse may otherwise display but it also eliminates unintentional breeding.\nAny male horse over the age of four that has been neutered and is not able to reproduce is called a gelding. A male horse that is between the ages of one and four years of age is called a colt. Because gelding commonly occurs before four years of age, there is some crossover in terminology. However, if the horse is younger than four years, colt is the most accurate term to use, regardless of their ability to reproduce.\nOther Names for Male Horses\nIn addition to the common terms used to describe a male horse, there are some other, more specific terms that you may come across. When in doubt, it is best to resort to calling a male horse a gelding or stallion as these are more broad terms.\nWhat is a Colt?\nAs we mentioned previously, a colt is a male horse that is between the ages of one and four years old. Before they reach their first birthday, both male and female horses are called foals. After a horse reaches five years old, they are no longer a colt and, instead, should be called a stallion or gelding.\nTo learn more about baby horses, check out my article What a Baby Horse is Called ( And More Fun Facts!)\nWhat is a Stud?\nA stud is an adult male horse that has been used for breeding purposes. Studs are often highly valuable and sought out by other horse owners for their bloodline and genetics. A male horse that has been used in breeding can be called a stud whether or not it has produced offspring.\nWhat is a Sire?\nOften confused with a stud, a sire is an adult male horse that has been used for breeding purposes and has produced offspring. The terms stud and sire have nothing to do with the number of times that a male horse has been used for breeding but rather the outcome of the breeding.\nShould You Geld Your Male Horse?\nThere is great debate amongst the equine community on whether or not you should geld your male horse. The general consensus is that if you are not planning on breeding your male horse, gelding is beneficial both for training and management.\nStallions are typically much more aggressive and unpredictable. They often present challenges when it comes to riding, training, and management. Additionally, you may need to house your stallion away from other horses to avoid aggressive behaviors or unplanned breeding.\nGeldings are much more calm and easy to manage. In fact, the majority of horses used for riding are geldings due to these favorable qualities!\nIf you are planning on gelding your horse, it is best to do so at a young age. For this reason, many experts recommend gelding a male horse before its first birthday. Doing so will eliminate any unwanted aggression or the development of bad habits. Additionally, gelding your horse at a young age typically involves fewer complications and a quick recovery time.\nRiding a Stallion\nThere is no doubt about it, the thought of riding a stallion holds a certain allure for many equestrians. While most stallions are quite temperamental, they can be well-trained and become rideable. In ancient days, in fact, warriors would ride stallions into battle!\nHowever, it is important to note that even the most well-behaved stallion is controlled by their hormones and can quickly become temperamental. For this reason, it takes an incredibly patient and advanced equestrian to properly manage a stallion.\nIf you are new to the world of horses, it is not wise to ride a stallion as this could result in injury to yourself, your horse, and others.\nRiding a Gelding\nMost of the horses that are used strictly for riding purposes are geldings! With less testosterone due to castration, geldings are much more docile and even-tempered. Compared to female horses, geldings are also much more constant in mood and temperament. For this reason, geldings are often the best choice for a new horse owner or beginning rider!\nIt is important to note that not all geldings have the same behavior. The age at which the horse was gelded will have a great impact on its future temperament and demeanor. For the new rider, it is best to consider a gelding that was castrated early on in life to eliminate the potential of aggressive behaviors.\nRegardless of the horse’s gender or reproductive abilities, you must take the time to get to know the horse you are riding. Just because a horse is gelded doesn’t mean you can assume that they will be calm and even-tempered. Likewise, just because a horse is a stallion does not mean that it will be aggressive and temperamental (although it’s highly likely).\nWe hope you are now equipped to use the correct terminology when referring to the male horses in your circle. Knowing the differences between colts, stallions, geldings, sires, and studs will allow you to communicate more effectively and progress in your equine journey.\nWant to know more about female horses?

It exists as three different varieties known as highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum), rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei), and southern highbush (Vaccinium formosum), and each variety thrives in different conditions and areas. The Highbush normally does well in cold climates and self-pollinates, but the size of the fruit and yield is better with cross pollination. The Rabbiteye prefers the warmer climate of southern United States, and does not self-pollinate. It requires two different plants for pollination. The Southern Highbush is a cross between the other two. It too self-pollinates but size and yield is better when there is cross pollination.\nBlueberries have long been accredited with longevity and wellbeing. Recent studies indicate that when compared to all other vegetables and fruits, blueberries offer the maximum antioxidants for health protection. These elements are known to inhibit cell damage that can lead to cancer, in addition to minimizing age related diseases.\nNative to North America, blueberry plants mostly grew in the wild along the eastern seaboard, starting as far north as Canada and extending all the way down to Florida in the south. The bilberry is a close cousin that is frequently mistaken for blueberries, as are ‘huckleberries’. One way to distinguish them is by colour. Blueberries are always blue, while huckleberries and bilberries are generally red or purple.\nBlueberries were mainly consumed by the Native American tribes and not very popular with the newcomers. The Hopi knew them as ‘moqui’ roughly meaning spirits of the ancestors. The native tribes dried the berries for use in puddings or even smoked them to use during the winter months when food was scarce. An amalgamation of fat, buffalo meat, and berries known as Pemmican, was used by the Native Americans for barter with companies trading in fur. A diet of Pemmican provided excellent nutrition with protein from the buffalo meat, energy form the fat, and vitamins from the berries.\nBlueberries gained popularity during the American Civil War, where canning started so that they could be dispatched to Union Soldiers. With the start of their cultivation in the twentieth century, blueberries became a major industry in Canada and the United States.\nBlueberries are a powerhouse of nutrients. Abound with vitamins A, C, E, and K, minerals potassium, iron, magnesium, and manganese, and phyto-nutrients Carotene-ß and Lutein-zeaxanthin. They are high in fibre and contain almost no saturated fats or cholesterol.\nThe large variety of antioxidants found in blueberries gives them many of the health benefits the berries are famous for. The Anthocyanins in the blueberries provide them with their characteristic blue colour which is water soluble. This turns the mouth, contact with skin, and fabrics blue upon contact. These antioxidants are found commonly in the plant kingdom, but blueberries have the highest concentration. Another antioxidant found in blueberries is Chlorogenic acid. It is believed to help fight free radicals and decrease the speed with which glucose is released into the bloodstream. Ellagic acid is thought to attach to cancer causing chemicals making them ineffective. Blueberries also contain plenty of catechins, the very same phyto-chemical that makes green tea a star. The antioxidant properties of catechins are believed to prevent plaque formation in arteries. Pterostilbene is still another antioxidant that is believed to help fight cancer and bring high cholesterol down. Finally there is Resveratrol. It offers a number of health benefits like anti-cancer, aging, plus inflammatory benefits along with life extending, and neuro-protective advantages. All this makes blueberries one of the best foods one can enjoy.\nHow to Use Blueberries\nWhile blueberries make a tantalizing addition to pancakes, muffins and cheesecakes, by far the best way to fully benefit from their nutritional value is to consume them fresh. This can be done in the following ways:\n- Combine fresh blueberries with yogurt for a nutritious breakfast or snack that provides plenty of protein, calcium, fibre, and vitamins. This will surely give you a great energy boost.\n- Add a cup full of fresh blueberries to breakfast cereal. Not only will this contribute to a well-balanced diet, but it will also give you with a great start to any day.\n- Blueberries can be eaten on their own, or they can be added to granola or trail mix for a delicious snack.\nBlueberries are naturally very sweet tasting and can even cover the flavour of some veggies that may be added to smoothies. Being dark coloured, blueberries usually turn smoothies into very appealing purple shades. These qualities make them ideal for combining with other products to create great tasting drinks. The blueberry & yoghurt rave recipe below is an example of one such treat.\nBlueberry & Yogurt Rave Recipe Ingredients:\n- 1 cup of blueberries\n- 1 cup of blueberry yogurt\n- 1 teaspoon of honey\n- 1/2 cup of ice\nPlace ice, honey and yogurt in a blender and blend for 30 seconds at medium speed. Add the blueberries and blend for another 30 seconds. That's all there is to it.\nA large number of independent clinical studies are being carried out on blueberries to fully understand their benefits. A study published by the Harvard School of Public Health, found consuming three or more servings of blueberries each week cut down heart attack risk in women by 33%. Researchers credited this to the high content of anthocyanin in the berries, which keep the arteries dilated to counter plaque accumulation.\nIn another study on the effects of blueberries and cognitive regression, Elizabeth Devore of Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, found that consuming blueberries on a regular basis helped to reduce cognitive weakening. The trial made use of over 16,000 women from one of the largest studies in the US on women’s health. The study concluded that eating as little as one serving of blueberries a week helped regress cognitive decline by many years.\nAccording to a study headed by Dr. Rui Hai Liu (a Professor in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.), it was determined that antioxidant activity of blueberries was better than two dozen other fruits tested. Among those fruits were pomegranates, cranberries, red grapes, strawberries and apples. Antioxidants are linked with cancer prevention, anti-aging and heart benefits.\nA number of studies relate the consumption of blueberries to cancer prevention. An especially difficult to treat form of breast cancer called Triple Negative Breast Cancer, was found to be inhibited with the use of blueberries by scientists at the Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, California, U.S.A.. In another study carried out at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, by Mary Ann Lila, Ph.D., found that constituents in blueberries may be valuable in inhibiting different stages of cancer.\nIntestinal bacteria play a positive role in our digestive and immune health. Researchers from Universities of Milan and Maine, headed by Dr. Stefano Vendrame, found through clinical trials that regularly consuming blueberry drinks favourably promoted the ‘good’ bacteria ‘Bifidobacteria‘."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a93af00a-48ac-4ca0-b83d-4ae0588fc0b1>","<urn:uuid:6cf770e1-ac36-4e3d-b61e-e15b9cbb8092>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the basic ways individuals can prepare for emergencies, and how have modern technologies transformed disaster response coordination?","answer":"Individuals can prepare for emergencies by learning about potential disasters affecting their community, creating family plans, assembling emergency kits with supplies for the first few days after a disaster, and practicing their emergency plans. As for technological transformation of disaster response, social media platforms have become crucial tools for emergency management, allowing officials to push out information, correct rumors, and coordinate responses. Apps like Zello enable citizen volunteers to coordinate rescue efforts, while sharing economy platforms like Airbnb offer free temporary accommodation to evacuees. Additionally, telemedicine technologies help provide medical care during disasters, particularly for children, by allowing virtual patient assessment when physical access is limited.","context":["Emergency preparedness means being ready if a disaster or emergency strikes. It is important to know what we can expect, and how we will respond to a disaster before it happens. This website was created to provide current information about the types of disasters we might face here in Perry County and what we all can do now to be ready.\nThe Perry County Health Department is taking steps to prepare and respond to emergencies, whether they are natural or manmade. We are refining plans, practicing them, and conducting trainings for our staff and volunteers to improve our readiness. Within this site you will find information and resources to learn more about potential threats facing our community and how we are preparing for these threats.\nEvery citizen has a role in emergency preparedness and can do something to make their families and communities safer, stronger and better prepared. Emergency preparedness should be a priority for every citizen. Even a small amount of preparation for an emergency can make a huge difference. Being prepared saves lives.\nEvery year, thousands of people are affected by disasters; the consequences can include injury, death and property damage. After a disaster strikes, relief-agencies and the local government will attempt to assist disrupted communities. However, there could be a delay before help is able to reach an affected area. By preparing ahead of time, you can lessen the fear, anxiety and losses that accompany a disaster.\nAre you ready for an emergency?\nEmergency Preparedness is being ready for a disaster or emergency; each one of us has to be accountable for our own readiness. If you are just starting to prepare, begin by:\n- Learning more about preparedness and what disasters could affect your community, be it natural disasters or terrorism.\n- Creating an individual and/or family plan.\n- Assembling an emergency kit to sustain you and your family for the first few days following a disaster. (Basic Emergency Kit List: http://www.ready.gov/america/getakit/index.html or load saved PDF) First Aid Kit: http://www.ready.gov/america/getakit/firstaidkit.html\n- Practicing and maintaining your plan.\nIn addition to directly affecting individuals and families, disasters have social and economic impacts on a community. Plans need to address those issues, as well as include sections for people with special needs and animals. Keep in mind that:\n- If you are a parent or guardian, consider the special considerations necessary for children.\n- If you own a business, you should ensure it is prepared to function during and after a disaster.\n- If you are responsible for a school, it is your job to have emergency plans in place to protect your staff and students.\n- If you have a disability or special need (or know of someone with a special need), you may need to take extra steps to prepare for an emergency. You may also want to consider joining our special needs registry.\n- If you own pets, you will need to make plans to care for your pet in an emergency or if you need to evacuate.\nWhat is the Emergency Response Staff doing?\nWe are Planning\nAt the heart of any effective emergency response is a plan. Perry County Health Department has a plan to help the County respond to and recover from many different types of Public Health disasters. Because we can’t know beforehand what events may befall us in a disaster, our plan takes an “All-Hazards” approach, allowing us to quickly put in place the parts of our plan necessary to react to unfolding events.\nThe PCHD Emergency Response Plan is an evolving document and we are constantly making improvements to our plan. As new information becomes available, or as new threats emerge that we must face, we incorporate them into our plan.\nThe PCHD Emergency Response Plan is a part of the overall Perry County Disaster Plan. Perry County Emergency Management Agency has the responsibility of coordinating the overall planning efforts for Perry County. They ensure that agencies work together to keep Perry County safe.\nWe are Practicing\nNo plan is effective if it sits on a shelf. It is important to us that the plans we put on paper are plans that can be executed if and when they are needed. That is why the Health Department is engaged in a exercise program. We conduct regularly scheduled exercises to test various aspects of our emergency response plan.\nOur exercises involve critical response partners from other agencies within Perry County and the Southeast Ohio region, as well as PCHD staff members.\nWe are Training\nThe Health Department will operate differently during an emergency than it does on a day to day basis. The exact changes will depend on the type of emergency we face. Specific training has been developed to teach PCHD staff the new roles they may need to fulfill during emergencies.\nAs part of the emergency response program, the PCHD Medical Reserve Corps has received training to better enable them in assisting the Health Department and the Perry County medical community in an emergency.\nWe are Educating\nEnsuring that we all understand what may happen in a public health emergency is important. We’re educating our staff about how to prepare for and respond to a public health emergency. If your group is interested in learning more about preparedness issues, the emergency preparedness team is available to speak to your group. Call the Health Department at 740-342-5179 for more information.\nWe are Recruiting\nIn a large scale emergency, volunteers will be needed to assist the Health Department in keeping the County safe and healthy. The PCHD and EMA are enrolling those who are willing to help. Medical and non-medical volunteers are needed.

In the ensuing chaos, mobile phone networks often overload or go down, electricity goes out and people are left disconnected.\nInnovation alone can’t protect people entirely from Mother Nature’s immense force. Floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes are tremendously dangerous, only sometimes possible to detect, and impossible to prevent.\nHowever, a range of technologies are altering the way people respond to emergencies, providing information, reassuring those affected and ultimately, saving lives. Here are four ways tech is helping those in need in managing disasters:\nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, Twitter didn’t exist. Facebook wasn’t open to the public. The iPhone hadn’t been invented. Yet a little over ten years later, social media is playing a large – and largely unexpected – role in emergency management.\nIn early 2011, Tropical Cyclone Yasi struck the coast of Queensland, Australia, leading to massive flooding. In the state, the fledgling social media team at the Queensland Police became the source of truth for the disaster.\nThey pushed out information, corrected rumours, live-tweeted press conferences and passed on messages from other agencies. The team hadn’t aimed to become a world leader in the use of social media during disasters. Their actions just seemed to make sense as a quick way of getting information out.\nIntuition proved correct. Queensland Police Service’s social following on Facebook rose from 17,000 likes to 100,000 in 24 hours¹. In 2013, after multiple examples of people and organisations using the platform in similar scenarios, Twitter itself rolled out an emergency feature allowing official agencies to tweet emergency alerts.\nAs the US and Caribbean are battered by flooding and storms following hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the transformative effect of social media as a means to communicate and coordinate has become self-evident. The City of Port Arthur in Texas has been using its Twitter presence to share locations for food, donation points and in one instance, going so far as to ask the wider world to come to their aid with boats.\nThe University of Western Australia’s Dr Billy Haworth, whose research focuses on citizen social media use during and before bushfires, points out that digitally volunteering information – such as updates from people in and around an emergency – is about more than just applying technology. Rather, it is “about people sharing their knowledge and mapping collaboratively as a social practice.”²\nThis social practice can be seen in the way apps are being used in disasters. In the wake of Harvey and lead up to Irma, websites began sharing lists of useful apps to download in preparation. Carpooling, gas-finding, first aid and apps to notify friends and family of safety were prevalent.\nSome apps, such as Serval Mesh and ZombieChat, allowed people to use their phones without Wi-Fi and/or network coverage. These apps utilise peer-to-peer Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to enable mobile phone use without the need for a provider’s network. This essentially allows people to connect via the power of the social collective.\nWalkie-talkie app Zello has enabled the Cajun Navy, a citizen’s brigade of volunteers and their boats, to crowdsource and coordinate emergency responders. It has quickly become the top app in the Apple app store (US), with over a million users downloading it in 24 hours³. Those in need of help can use it to broadcast their situation to the community. Volunteers then log, triage and liaise with the ‘navy’ to come to their aid. With official emergency responders stretched thin, every person able to help is a potential life saved.\nSharing economy platforms such as Airbnb, Uber and Lyft have also rallied their numbers around those requiring assistance. Airbnb, which has its own emergency response program, has reached out to nearby safe communities to offer free temporary accommodation to evacuees. Uber has capped their prices to stop unfair rises, and both it and Lyft offered free rides to evacuation shelters.\nGiven that people often don’t evacuate when instructed to do so because they have nowhere to go, no money to get or stay elsewhere, or a lack of mobility to move, the importance of such endeavours can’t be underestimated.\nin light of trauma\nOne area in which digital technology is having a profound effect is in medical treatment and the use of telemedicine. Evacuees are often in need of first aid and advanced medical treatment. Walking through floodwaters, for example, can expose people to all sorts of infection-breeding nasties. Prescription medicine runs out (or is forgotten in the rush to evacuate). A range of dangerous maladies can be brought on by the stress of the situation.\nAs in the case of Hurricane Katrina, medical evacuees are often hard to get to, isolated in pockets surrounded by floodwaters. An added complication, as reported in the case of Hurricane Harvey, is that most of the evacuees (by a ratio of almost three to one) are children4. Faced with an already traumatic circumstance, further alienating an ill child by taking them away from their families to an overrun emergency room is hardly ideal.\nMedics on the ground are often trained to treat adults, and not versed in the particulars of paediatric care. Telemedicine provides a solution, allowing virtual patient care. With an internet connection and a few enabled devices, paediatric doctors can assess the severity of a patient and advise next steps without needing to be at the site.\nConnected stethoscopes can be used to listen to a child’s breathing or heart and family histories can be gained from the family members sitting alongside. Meanwhile, doctors, in high demand in the ER, can switch from virtual to physical, efficiently caring for more people from the one location.\nPlus, tackling one of the common problems faced by emergency first-responders – a lack of trained physicians – telemedicine is simple enough that its administration, and physical coordination of its digital tools, can be carried out by non-medics. In the case of Hurricane Harvey, for instance, by the induction of Texas State Guard soldiers.\nThe use of drones in search and rescue has been much written about, but it has limitations. A drone requires a pilot and the know-how to coordinate a search. In a large area affected by a natural disaster, the sheer amount of people needed to be truly effective is difficult to come by, let alone organise.\nNew York’s University at Buffalo is working on a solution that would allow teams of drones to self-organise in swarms – autonomous as individual machines, but also as a collective – in order to map oil spills5. Collections of drones evaluate where they are flying – over oil, water or an edge – in order to quickly map out the size and location of a spill.\nThese drones need to be able to fly together and not into each other or physical objects, as well as ensuring they don’t go over an area that’s already been mapped. In a disaster, where one of the common hurdles in response is in evaluating the size and parameters of a catastrophe, this could be used to mobilise and respond effectively and quickly.\nAble to access difficult or dangerous-to-reach places, swarms of drones could be used to map destruction, evaluate infrastructure for safety, provide supplies, find missing or injured people and identify potential further hazards.\nAs with all technology, the value is in the application of its use. In managing disasters, there are multiple use-cases where this is proven.\nThe need for quick assessment of an event, access to those impacted, ability to get information to and from those people, and the requirement for further volunteers can all be addressed with technology, enabling a better and more effective response.\nAs an added benefit, it is in the use of these technologies – much of it organic and unofficial in nature – that the best of humanity can be seen."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a4340d1c-6ef7-44bd-bb26-04bebae2369f>","<urn:uuid:4a7cd50e-3dad-4a80-a2b7-5e48f4af1863>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the Yukon Arctic Ultra and Baikal Ice Marathon differ in terms of their course conditions and the challenges faced by competitors?","answer":"The Yukon Arctic Ultra and Baikal Ice Marathon present different challenges due to their unique terrains. In the Yukon Arctic Ultra, competitors face severe sleep deprivation leading to hallucinations, with participants like Christof Teuscher reporting seeing non-existent tents and 'monsters' in the snow and trees. Competitors must trek for 16-20 hours daily, sleeping only 2-3 hours per night. In contrast, the Baikal Ice Marathon takes place on Lake Baikal's frozen surface, where competitors face fields of 'hummocks' (ice rubble hills) and areas of highly polished ice similar to an ice-rink. The Baikal course is predominantly flat but features uneven surfaces and potential ice weaknesses due to geothermic springs and seismic activity. While Yukon participants navigate through forests and frozen lakes over multiple days, Baikal runners face a featureless landscape where the finish line is visible almost from the start, creating unique psychological challenges.","context":["Northwestern Canada: Hallucinations in a ‘frozen paradise’ at Yukon Arctic Ultra\nThe Yukon Arctic Ultra has reached the stage where competitors are seeing things that aren’t there.\n“Last night was terrible. So many hallucinations,” said Christof Teuscher on Feb. 8 as he set out from Pelly Crossing toward Dawson City. “Multiple times I saw a tent which I expected was the next station. But of course there was nothing there. And all these monsters in the snow and the trees. It’s fascinating what the mind can do,” he said.\nSome competitors have walked 430 kilometres from Whitehorse to Pelly Crossing over six days. This pace requires moving at night and the exhaustion sends the mind to strange places.\n“Last night was dark, literally and figuratively. I think if you would have asked me my name I would not have remembered it,” Teuscher said, nevertheless with a smile.\nThe Yukon Arctic Ultra is an annual competition that lets people test themselves. Competitors can choose their distance, from running a marathon all the way to a nearly 700 kilometre trek from Whitehorse to Dawson City.\nThey can go by foot, snow bike or skiis. They follow the same path as the dog mushers of the Yukon Quest.\n‘Really beautiful thing’\nScott Thomson is Australian and left his country during a record-breaking heatwave.\nHe’s competed in the Yukon Arctic Ultra before and said this year’s race is going well. Despite sleep deprivation, he has been managing to pull his sled 16 to 20 hours a day.\n“This place is a frozen paradise. It’s so different to where I come from and particularly with this sort of race where it’s a solo event, you are out by yourself day and night crossing frozen lakes —I think just that sense of peace and solitude that you have is just a really beautiful thing,” he said.\n‘The trail seems like it’s going forever’\nAnother competitor still in the race is Ahmad Fathi Junaidi, who said he’s been sleeping only two to three hours per night.\n“I am just so tired. It’s been tough. The trail seems like it’s going forever,” he said.\nLike other competitors, he said hallucinations are part of the trek.\n“It’s taking a toll, especially at the end now. You’ll be seeing all these snow creatures around. You see different things. You snap out of it after a while or you just go to sleep,” he said.\nDespite the fatigue Junaidi is still in the race and pressing forward.

This extraordinary event takes place in one of the most beautiful places of Lake Baikal, and is based in the small town of Listvyanka,65 km south of Irkutsk ( a major stop-over on the Trans-Siberian route). The Marathon is a part of a larger winter games held on Lake Baikal – the “Winteriada” Baikal Nordic Games Festival which includes a number of other events such as Baikal Kamchatka Ice Fishing Cup, Baikal Prize Open Ice Golf Tournament, Ice Safari Expeditions on 4-WD, sled dogs and snow-mobiles, Alpine and extreme cross country skiing championships, snow volleyball and football competitions, Baikal area hunters’ and outfitter’s festival and others…\nThe surface of the frozen lake Baikal is covered in fields of “hummocks”, small hills of ice rubble. Beneath the ice surface, geothermic springs and seismic activity cause localized melting that sometimes may weaken the ice to form holes ( though the average ice on Lake Baikal in this part is over 1 meter and a half which allows trucks and vehicles up to 10 ton in weight to drive on the ice). The race “Ice Captain” and his team of volunteers and the Baikal Ice Marathon support team have the task of plotting a safe course. To get well prepared for the laying of the ice course about a month and half before the Baikal Marathon the organizers of the Baikal Ice Marathon study satellite photos of the ice surface of Baikal to see how the lake freezes the current winter in order to locate possible stable ice cracks that sometimes can be up to 8 km long. A week before the Marathon we go on and lay preliminary Marathon course. The final course ( 42 km 195 m or 26 miles) is laid immediately preceding the race, otherwise movements in the ice can render the support team’s effort redundant. The course for the race of Baikal Marathon is also checked by the Emergency and Rescue Committee staff before being approved as safe to drive the vans and run on the ice.\nOn the Baikal Ice Marathon race day itself, competitors are ferried by vans from Listvyanka to Tankhoy train station, located on the opposite shore of Lake Baikal. Prior to the start of the race, competitors some years are required to partake in the precautionary ritual of “vodka sprinkling”, in order to pacify the spirits of the Great Baikal ( introducing the novel element of starting a marathon with a shot of vodka).\nThe course is predominantly flat, but the surface is hard at times and uneven. Although it’s mostly covered in a soft layer f snow, there’re areas of highly polished ice that create conditions similar to an ice-rink. Wind can add to the already bitingly cold temperature and provide serious resitance to progress across Lake Baikal. Though, often the weather is sunny and with no chill factor one can even get some sun tan.\nThe utterly featureless landscape gives little or no sense of perspective to competitors. The finish line at the port of Listvyanka can be seen almost from the start line. It is a long, cold, lonely ( if not to count the mobile 8 to 10 feed and drink stands) 42,2 km trail across the baren white landscape, where progress is marked only by checkpoints positioned at 5 km intervals ( with hot drinks, food and, for the brave< some more vodka).\n“The far reaches of Siberia may not be the first choice destinations for many endurance athletes, who may prefer instead the warmer, and more glamorous, climes. But for those that brave the splendid Russian winter, the reward is a fantastic race, in an area of outstanding natural beauty, on a one-off running surface of the Great Baikal\\\".

{"question":"What are the beneficial applications of friction in everyday life, and what techniques are used to increase frictional forces when needed?","answer":"Friction has several beneficial applications in daily life, including preventing shoes from slipping on footpaths, stopping car tires from skidding, and allowing bicycle brakes to grip and stop wheels. To increase friction when needed, there are two main methods: making surfaces rougher and increasing the object's mass. Specific examples include adding treads to vehicle tires to increase road grip, incorporating grooves in shoe soles for better traction, and gymnasts applying coarse material on their hands for improved grip. These methods are important in situations where increased friction is necessary for safety and proper functioning of equipment.","context":["The force that pulls things to the ground on Earth (and other planets) is called gravity.\nGravity also holds Earth and the other planets in their orbits around the Sun.\nGravity is a very useful force – It keeps us on the Earth, and keeps the Earth and the other planets revolving around the Sun. It holds everything together, which is why it has been called ‘The Universal Glue’.\nAlthough the force of gravity also exists on the Moon it is not as strong as it is here on Earth. This is because the Moon is much smaller than the Earth it is not as heavy as the Earth, and so gravity is much weaker there.\nIn the past people thought that heavier things fell faster than light things. Galileo, an Italian scientist from the 1600’s, conducted some experiments and found that things with different weight fell at approximately the same speed.\nFriction is a force between two surfaces when they are moving or sliding across each other. For example, when you try to push your hand across a table. Friction will make this difficult.\nFriction works in the opposite direction to which the object is moving. Friction always slows a moving object down, and may even stop an object from moving.\nThe amount of friction depends the two surfaces.. The rougher the surface, the more friction, the smoother the surface, less friction.\nFriction also produces heat. If you rub your hands together quickly, can you feel them get warmer?\nThe ways friction can help include:\npreventing our shoes from slipping on the footpath when we walk\nstopping car tyres from skidding on the road\nallowing bicycle brakes to grip and slow or stop a turning wheel\nSometimes we want to reduce friction. For example, we use oil to reduce the friction between the moving parts inside a car engine. The oil holds the surfaces apart and can flow between them. The reduced friction means there is less wear on the car’s moving parts and less heat produced.\nIce causes very little friction, which is why it is easy to slip over on an icy day.\nHowever, this is a good thing for ice skating and sledging.\nWhat makes our bikes go? what makes them stop when we brake? Why do apples fall from trees?\nAfter our experiments today watch this video and read through the following information.\nYou have probably heard the word “force” before. Here are a few examples: “the rocket had a lot of force at blast off” or “the force of the storm blew the roof off the building.” What is force? Force is defined as a push or pull on an object.\nWhen your foot pushes against the pedal of your bike the push makes the wheels of the bike move. When an apple falls from a tree, it is pulled to the ground by gravity.\nForces affect how objects move. They may cause motion; they may also slow, stop, or change the direction of motion of an object that is already moving.\nForce can change a number of things about an object. They include:\nboth direction and speed\nSome examples of force changing the direction of an object.\nA good soccer player can control the motion of a soccer ball by applying a force that changes the ball’s direction but not its speed.\nSwinging a ball on a string around your head.\nSome examples of force changing the direction and speed of an object.\nA tennis player returning a very fast serve.\nStarting on a swing.\nSome examples of force changing the shape of an object.\n‘The Macedonian recipes are very diverse.

Wear and tear of an object is not desirable as it reduces its life. This is more so in case of moving parts in automobiles and machinery. Therefore, efforts are made to reduce friction between moving parts.\nFriction between moving parts is usually reduced by introducing a substance between the moving surfaces. This process is called lubrication. The substance introduced is called a lubricant. Common lubricants are oil and grease.\nBall bearings are also used to reduce friction. Ball bearings change sliding friction to rolling friction. This is a very useful thing to do since rolling friction is much smaller than sliding friction. Ball bearings are used in most mechanical structures which have moving parts. Small metal balls made of stainless steel, brass, ceramic, etc., are placed between moving surfaces (the surfaces . can be flat or cylindrical) to reduce friction.\nOther than friction between solid parts, there can also be friction due to fluids (e.g., air and water). The force of friction due to air and water (and other fluids) is called fluid friction. When cars and aeroplanes move at very high speeds, their motion is opposed by friction offered by the air molecules surrounding them. The friction of air produces what is called drag, which opposes the motion of the vehicle. The same applies to ships and boats. To reduce drag, automobiles, ships, and aeroplanes are given a special shape, called a streamlined shape. An automobile with a streamlined body experiences minimum resistance when travelling through air. Even sea creatures like fish and shark have streamlined bodies, which makes it easier for them to move with great speeds in water.\nFrictional force can be reduced in the following ways\n- Use of lubricants: In machines, friction can be reduced by applying lubricants between the contact surfaces to fill the fine pores or depressions in the surfaces and make them smooth thereby reducing friction.\n- Polishing : unevenness of the surfaces can be reduced by polishing, thereby reducing the friction.\n- Use of ball bearings: In rotating machines, shafts are mounted on ball bearings. By doing so, rolling friction occurs lesser than sliding friction, thereby reducing the friction.\n- By streamlining: Air friction is reduced by designing streamlined bodies of cars or aeroplanes. Similarly, if the bodies of boats and ships are streamlined, friction of water can be reduced.\nMethods of Increasing Friction\nThere are two methods of increasing friction: one is by making the surfaces rough and the other by increasing the mass of the object that is moving.\nFor example, the tyres of vehicles have treads (these are the ‘designs’ that you can see on the tyre surface), which increase the friction between the tyre and the road. Similarly, the soles of shoes have grooves, in order to increase friction. Gymnasts often apply a coarse material on their hands to get a better grip by increasing friction.\nAim: To show that greater friction causes increased wear and tear.\nMaterials needed: A new eraser, a piece of paper from your notebook, a piece of cardboard, and sandpaper.\nMethod: Use the eraser to rub on the different surfaces mentioned above. Each time, make a note of the amount of wear and tear on the eraser.\nObservation: You will see that the rougher the surface, the greater the wear and tear.\nConclusion: Greater friction causes increased wear and tear."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9c5c765b-28aa-4da0-a59e-4207c51a2b5b>","<urn:uuid:96ad49c5-8cec-4816-8432-8a2ce584c947>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do single-trait genes like SlKLUH compare to quantitative trait loci in tomato breeding applications?","answer":"SlKLUH is a single domestication gene that specifically controls fruit size through cell division regulation and ripening delay, representing a simply inherited trait. In contrast, quantitative trait loci (QTL) are multiple genes that collectively influence complex characteristics like fruit yield, size, and flavor, with each gene having a small but cumulative effect. While SlKLUH's impact on fruit size is direct and well-defined, QTLs require molecular markers to track multiple genetic components that together contribute to desired traits, making them more complex to breed for but valuable for improving hard-to-breed characteristics.","context":["|Ohio State researchers clone a gene that regulates fruit size in vegetable, fruit crops|\n|Thursday, October 10, 2013 12:22 AM|\nWOOSTER — Do you enjoy big, plump tomatoes? If so, you should give thanks to a gene that arose thousands of years ago as early farmers in South America began domesticating this popular fruit, according to Ohio State University crop scientists.\nEsther van der Knaap, a geneticist with the university’s College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences, led an international research team that discovered and cloned a gene that regulates fruit size in tomato. This is only the second domestication gene involved in fruit size ever cloned in any vegetable or fruit crop.\nThe discovery was reported Sept. 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n“This work represents an important improvement in the understanding of the regulation of fruit size and how domestication played a role in the selection of this gene,” said van der Knaap, who is based on the Wooster campus of the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC), the research arm of the college.\nThe cloned gene, known as SlKLUH, impacts fruit size by increasing cell layers and delaying ripening. According to van der Knaap, this gene promotes extra cell divisions during the process of fruit development, immediately after fertilization. These extra cell divisions lead to enlarged fruit, while the delay in ripening is likely the result of an extension of the cell division stage.\nA majority of the research was conducted by Ohio State postdoctoral researcher Manohar Chakrabarti and Ph.D. student Na Zhang, working in van der Knaap’s lab. Other scientists based in the U.S., France and Spain collaborated as well.\nThe research team also identified a potential regulatory element in the promoter of SlKLUH that is hypothesized to control gene expression. The promoter is a region of DNA that is responsible for initiating the transcription of a gene.\n“Our findings suggest that the allele giving rise to large fruit arose in the early domesticates of tomato and became progressively more abundant upon further selections,” van der Knaap said.\nDomestication of crop plants some 10,000 years ago had a significant effect on the development of humans and their societies. However, even today scientists know little about the molecular mechanisms involved in changes in fruit appearance — size, shape and other factors — as a result of domestication and selection by early farmers.\n“Despite the importance of fruit mass in the evolution of fruit and vegetable plants, cloning of domestication genes of fruit and vegetable crops has lagged behind that of cereal crops,” van der Knaap said. “For that reason, insights into the molecular mechanisms that led to the transition of the fruit from small to large remain mostly unknown.”\nThe cloning of SlKLUH is expected to increase scientists’ understanding of fruit development processes, not only in tomato but in other crop species as well.\n“We show in this paper that the same gene may have been selected during domestication of chili pepper, leading to increased fruit size in this vegetable crop as well,” van der Knaap said.\nIn 2008, van der Knaap reported the discovery of a gene that controls fruit shape in the journal Science.\nThis basic research also has important implications for vegetable and fruit production, as it could allow breeders to manipulate genes to create new varieties with desired size and shape characteristics.","Foolad and Panthee (2012) give an excellent review of Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) in tomato breeding, providing more detail than intended here. Our goal is to explain the basics and give examples of how this tool can be used by tomato breeders, and how we are employing the technology in our breeding program.\nThere are various types of molecular markers that can be used in breeding (e.g. SNP, AFLP, SCAR, CAPS and SSR), but these all represent a short DNA sequence with a known physical location in the genome – essentially “mile markers” on the roadmap that defines structural characteristics of the plant DNA sequence. For example there are tens of thousands of SNP markers now placed on the physical map of the tomato genome. When one of these markers is adjacent to (or within) a gene of interest, such as a gene associated with resistance to a particular pathogen, the marker and the gene co-segregate – and selection for the marker is an effective surrogate for selection for the trait.\nPCR-based genotyping can be used to quickly confirm presence or absence of a particular molecular marker, and some marker types (including SNPs) can determine whether the plant contains one (heterozygous) or two (homozygous) copies of the marker. These assays are conducted on DNA extracted from a very small amount of plant tissue, and thus can be performed on very young seedlings.\nSome of the advantages are obvious:\n1) The presence of the molecular marker can be confirmed at the seedling stage, and not reliant on a trait phenotype that is expressed several weeks later (e.g. fruit color), or on a phenotype that is dependent on particular environmental conditions (e.g. disease resistance). Early selection allows early culling of undesirable plants based on genotype rather than phenotype. Early culling means that only those plants pre-selected for the desired trait or combination of traits go to field breeding nurseries or crossing programs.\n2) Trait stacking is the breeding process for combining multiple desirable traits into a single breeding line. The first step always involves using crossing to bring the multiple traits into a single breeding population. The second step, greatly aided by MAS, is to identify low frequency plants in the breeding population that contain all the traits of interest. For example: the cross AABBCC x aabbcc, where genes A and B control resistance to two independent tomato pathogens (e.g. ToMV and LB) and resistance is dominant, and c is a desirable recessive allele for a trait for fruit color (e.g. ogc/crimson). The F1 progeny will all be AaBbCc and in the F2 only one plant in 64 will have the desired stable genotype AABBcc. Now think about stacking 7-8 genes (which we are) - MAS allows the efficient testing of hundreds of F2 progeny to find the “needles in the haystack” combing the desired traits. When stacking more than 3 traits it will likely be necessary to do this in a stepwise fashion.\nHow is MAS being used today?\nMolecular markers have now been identified for many of the multiple genes associated with resistance to key tomato diseases and nematodes, and in some cases to the multiple races of the diseases now prevalent (e.g, all three races of Fusarium wilt). Commercial breeders have been successful at stacking resistance to most of these key pathogens in newer hybrids – with MAS being a critical tool in such stacking.\nMolecular markers have also been identified for a handful of other major genes controlling important traits – but it is a short list: tomato fruit color - red vs yellow and crimson vs red; fruit size - locule number; plant type - determinant vs indeterminant; and presence of the rin allele associated with delayed ripening. Some of the major genes controlling plant/fruit phenotype are shown below (photo courtesy of University of Newfoundland) - linked molecular markers are available for a few of these.\n|Map of major genes controlling plant/fruit phenotype|\nAll of the examples cited above involve major genes providing control of simply inherited traits. However we know that many important traits are quantitative traits, controlled by multiple genes – typically each with a small, but cumulative effect. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are molecular markers associated with genes/alleles contributing to a quantitative trait – such a fruit yield, fruit size and fruit flavor. MAS allows the effective stacking of QTLs that in concert have a major impact on a “hard to breed for” quantitative traits.\nHarry Klee and his colleagues at the University of Florida have been working to unlock the mystery of flavor in tomatoes. What are the multiple components of flavor, how do they interact, and what is the genetic control of these factors? I am confident this will eventually lead to QTLs associated with key flavor components – facilitating breeding for better tasting tomatoes.\nUniversity breeding programs and the larger commercial tomato breeding companies all have access to the tools required for MAS. Thankfully there are also a few commercial companies that conduct such activities on a fee for service basis, which allows the smaller players (FLF included) access to these tools. Such access is a significant incremental expense per se, but allows cost savings, and an accelerated timeline in the long run.\nOur breeding program started with crosses between heirloom types with a primary goal to improve flavor and plant health. After a couple years we started crossing these to a handful of commercial types, including a couple of the NCSU hybrids, to introduce improved disease tolerance and improved fruit quality.\n|Disease resistant X Great Flavor|\nWe are now using molecular markers to identify progeny from these crosses which combine resistance to multiple pathogens – and will follow that genotypic selection with phenotypic selection for flavor and fruit quality in our various breeding nurseries. The use of molecular markers and our recent access to facilities allowing 3 breeding generations/yr should allow us to soon commercialize new F1 hybrids with state-of-the-art disease resistance, best-in-class heirloom flavor, and in a rainbow’s array of colors and stripes.\nMAS-enabled multiple disease resistant F4 - a F1 parent \"in training\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9c5b05bc-031d-4cc0-ab70-856606d48bf5>","<urn:uuid:a597e8bd-fabe-4f8d-b3cd-39cdc1b36dfb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the function of the liver in the body, and what health risks can develop when it accumulates excessive fat?","answer":"The liver is the second-largest organ in the body and performs crucial functions including manufacturing proteins, synthesizing and processing fats, metabolizing carbohydrates, forming bile, eliminating harmful biochemical products, and detoxifying drugs, alcohol, and environmental toxins. When excessive fat accumulates in the liver (more than 5% of the liver's weight), it can interrupt these vital processes. While fatty liver can be reversed with proper lifestyle modifications and often causes no permanent damage initially, if left untreated it can become harmful. The condition is particularly concerning because it interferes with the liver's ability to process everything we eat and drink and remove harmful substances from the blood.","context":["The following are health and medical definitions of terms that appear in the medroxyprogesterone, Provera, Depo-Provera, Depo-Sub Q Provera 104 article.\nAbnormal: Outside the expected norm, or uncharacteristic of a particular patient.\nAcetate: A molecular ion derived from acetic acid.

There are many types of breast cancer that differ in their capability of spreading to other body tissues (metastasis). Treatment of breast cancer depends on the type and location of the breast cancer, as well as the age and health of the patient. The American Cancer Society recommends that a woman should have a baseline mammogram between the ages of 35 and 40 years. Between 40 and 50 years of age mammograms are recommended every other year. After age 50 years, yearly mammograms are recommended.\nBreast milk: Milk from the breast. Human milk contains a balance of nutrients that closely matches infant requirements for brain development, growth and a healthy immune system. Human milk also contains immunologic agents and other compounds that act against viruses, bacteria, and parasites.

(37 degrees C.), in practice a person is usually not considered to have a significant fever until the temperature is above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C.).\nFibroids: Fibroids are common, benign tumors of smooth muscle in the uterus (womb). Uterine fibroids are the most common reason for performing a hysterectomy. Fibroids do not produce symptoms in all women, but may lead to prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and rarely to infertility. In addition to hysterectomy, less invasive surgical procedures have been employed to remove uterine fibroids. Fibroids can be detected by radiologic testing, such as ultrasound, CAT scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\nGeneric: 1. The chemical name of a drug. 2. A term referring to the chemical makeup of a drug rather than to the advertised brand name under which the drug may be sold. 3.A term referring to any drug marketed under its chemical name without advertising.\nGlucose: The simple sugar that is the chief source of energy. Glucose is found in the blood and is the main sugar that the body manufactures. The body makes glucose from all three elements of food'protein, fats, and carbohydrates'but the largest amount of glucose derives from carbohydrates. Glucose serves as the major source of energy for living cells. However, cells cannot use glucose without the help of insulin. Also known as dextrose.\nHair loss: Hair loss is the thinning of hair on the scalp. The medical term for hair loss is alopecia. Alopecia can be temporary or permanent. The most common form of hair loss occurs gradually and is referred to as \"androgenetic alopecia,\" meaning that a combination of hormones (androgens are male hormones) and heredity (genetics) is needed to develop the condition. Other types of hair loss include alopecia areata (patches of baldness that usually grow back), telogen effluvium (rapid shedding after childbirth, fever, or sudden weight loss); and traction alopecia (thinning from tight braids or ponytails).\nHeart: The muscle that pumps blood received from veins into arteries throughout the body. The heart is positioned in the chest behind the sternum (breastbone); in front of the trachea, esophagus, and aorta; and above the diaphragm. A normal heart is about the size of a closed fist and weighs about 298 grams or 10.5 ounces. It is cone-shaped, with the point of the cone pointing down to the left. Two-thirds of the heart lies in the left side of the chest, with the balance in the right side of the chest. The heart is composed of specialized cardiac muscle, and it is four-chambered, with a right atrium and ventricle, and an anatomically separate left atrium and ventricle. The blood flows from the systemic veins into the right atrium, thence to the right ventricle, from which it is pumped to the lungs and then returned into the left atrium, thence to the left ventricle, from which it is driven into the systemic arteries. The heart is thus functionally composed of two hearts: the right heart and the left heart. The right heart consists of the right atrium, which receives deoxygenated blood from the body, and the right ventricle, which pumps the deoxygenated blood to the lungs under low pressure; and the left heart, which consists of the left atrium, which receives oxygenated blood from the lung, and the left ventricle, which pumps the oxygenated blood out to the body under high pressure.\nHeart disease: Any disorder that affects the heart. Sometimes the term \"heart disease\" is used narrowly and incorrectly as a synonym for coronary artery disease. Heart disease is synonymous with cardiac disease but not with cardiovascular disease which is any disease of the heart or blood vessels. Among the many types of heart disease, see, for example: Angina; Arrhythmia; Congenital heart disease; Coronary artery disease (CAD); Dilated cardiomyopathy; Heart attack (myocardial infarction); Heart failure; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Mitral regurgitation; Mitral valve prolapse; and Pulmonary stenosis.\nHives: A raised, itchy area of skin that may be a sign of an allergic reaction. It can be rounded or flat-topped but is always elevated above the surrounding skin. It reflects circumscribed dermal edema (local swelling of the skin). The hives are usually well circumscribed but may be coalescent and will blanch with pressure. A single spot is almost always gone by 24 hours but the process may stay for weeks to months. Approximately 20% of the population has experienced a bout of hives.\nHyperplasia: An increase in the number of normal cells in a tissue or an organ. Hyperplasia can represent a precancerous condition.\nHysterectomy: An operation to remove the uterus. Hysterectomies are most commonly performed as a treatment for fibroids, cancer or severe dysplasia of the uterus, and for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.\nImplantation: The act of setting in firmly.\nInfant: A young baby, from birth to 12 months of age.\nInsomnia: The perception or complaint of inadequate or poor-quality sleep due to a number of factors, such as difficulty falling asleep, waking up frequently during the night with difficulty returning to sleep, waking up too early in the morning, or unrefreshing sleep. Insomnia is not defined by the number of hours of sleep a person gets or how long it takes to fall asleep; it is a measure of satisfaction with sleep. Individuals vary normally in their need for and their satisfaction with sleep. Insomnia may cause problems during the day, such as tiredness, a lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and irritability.\nJaundice: Yellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) by abnormally high blood levels of the bile pigment bilirubin. The yellowing extends to other tissues and body fluids. Jaundice was once called the \"morbus regius\" (the regal disease) in the belief that only the touch of a king could cure it.\nLiver: The largest solid organ in the body, situated in the upper part of the abdomen on the right side. The liver has a multitude of important and complex functions, including to manufacture proteins, including albumin (to help maintain the volume of blood) and blood clotting factors; to synthesize, store, and process fats, including fatty acids (used for energy) and cholesterol; to metabolize and store carbohydrates (used as the source for the sugar in blood); to form and secrete bile that contains bile acids to aid in the intestinal absorption of fats and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K; to eliminate, by metabolizing or secreting, the potentially harmful biochemical products produced by the body, such as bilirubin, from the breakdown of old red blood cells and ammonia from the breakdown of proteins; and to detoxify, by metabolizing and/or secreting, drugs, alcohol, and environmental toxins.\nLungs: The lungs are a pair of breathing organs located with the chest which remove carbon dioxide from and bring oxygen to the blood. There is a right and left lung.\nMenstrual cycle: The monthly cycle of changes in the ovaries and the lining of the uterus (endometrium), starting with the preparation of an egg for fertilization. When the follicle of the prepared egg in the ovary breaks, it is released for fertilization and ovulation occurs. Unless pregnancy occurs, the cycle ends with the shedding of part of the endometrium, which is menstruation. Although it is actually the end of the physical cycle, the first day of menstrual bleeding is designated as \"day 1\" of the menstrual cycle in medical parlance.\nMenstruation: The periodic blood that flows as a discharge from the uterus. Also called menorrhea, the time during which menstruation occurs is referred to as menses. The menses occurs at approximately 4 week intervals to compose the menstrual cycle.\nMucus: A thick fluid that is produced by the lining of some organs of the body.\nNausea: Stomach queasiness, the urge to vomit. Nausea can be brought on by many causes, including systemic illnesses (such as influenza), medications, pain, and inner ear disease.\nNursing: 1) Profession concerned with the provision of services essential to the maintenance and restoration of health by attending the needs of sick persons. 2) Feeding a infant at the breast.\nOvary: The female gonad, one of a pair of reproductive glands in women. The ovaries are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and female hormones. During each monthly menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovaries are the main source of female hormones, which control the development of female body characteristics, such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. They also regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy.\nOvulation: The release of the ripe egg (ovum) from the ovary. The egg is released when the cavity surrounding it (the follicle) breaks open in response to a hormonal signal. Ovulation occurs around 14 or 15 days from the first day of the woman?s last menstrual cycle. When ovulation occurs, the ovum moves into the Fallopian tube and becomes available for fertilization.\nPregnancy: The state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus within the female body. This condition can be indicated by positive results on an over-the-counter urine test, and confirmed through a blood test, ultrasound, detection of fetal heartbeat, or an X-ray. Pregnancy lasts for about nine months, measured from the date of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP). It is conventionally divided into three trimesters, each roughly three months long.\nPrescription: A physician's order for the preparation and administration of a drug or device for a patient. A prescription has several parts. They include the superscription or heading with the symbol \"R\" or \"Rx\", which stands for the word recipe (meaning, in Latin, to take); the inscription, which contains the names and quantities of the ingredients; the subscription or directions for compounding the drug; and the signature which is often preceded by the sign \"s\" standing for signa (Latin for mark), giving the directions to be marked on the container.\nProgesterone: A female hormone, the principal hormone that prepares the uterus to receive and sustain fertilized eggs.\nProgestin: Any one of a group of steroid hormones that have the effect of progesterone.\nPulmonary: Having to do with the lungs.\nRenal: Having to do with the kidney. For example, renal cancer is cancer of the kidneys.\nRenal cancer: Malignancy of the kidney, the organ that is primarily responsible for the removal of metabolic waste products from the body.\nSecondary amenorrhea: The cessation of menstruation for abnormal reasons. Causes include anorexia nervosa, disease of the female reproductive tract, and overexercise. Secondary amenorrhea can also be caused by certain medications, notably the birth control medication medroxyprogesterone (brand name: Depo-Provera); in this case, amenorrhea is an expected effect.\nStroke: The sudden death of brain cells due to lack of oxygen, caused by blockage of blood flow or rupture of an artery to the brain. Sudden loss of speech, weakness, or paralysis of one side of the body can be symptoms. A suspected stroke can be confirmed by scanning the brain with special X-ray tests, such as CAT scans. The death rate and level of disability resulting from strokes can be dramatically reduced by immediate and appropriate medical care. Prevention involves minimizing risk factors, such as controlling high blood pressure and diabetes. Abbreviated CVA. Also known as cerebrovascular accident.\nTherapy: The treatment of disease. Therapy is synonymous with treatment.\nUterus: A hollow, pear-shaped organ that is located in a woman's lower abdomen, between the bladder and the rectum. The narrow lower portion of the uterus is the cervix (the neck of the uterus). The broader upper part is the corpus, which is made up of three layers of tissue. In women of childbearing age, the inner layer (endometrium) of the uterus goes through a series of monthly changes known as the menstrual cycle. Each month, endometrial tissue grows and thickens in preparation to receive a fertilized egg. Menstruation occurs when this tissue is not used, disintegrates, and passes out through the vagina. The middle layer (myometrium) of the uterus is muscular tissue that expands during pregnancy to hold the growing fetus and contracts during labor to deliver the child. The outer layer (parametrium) also expands during pregnancy and contracts thereafter.\nWomen's Health Initiative: A long-term national health study that focuses on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. This 15-year project sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) involves over 161,000 women aged 50-79.

It is normal to have a bit of fat in the liver, but if it is too much it can become a big health problem.\nThe liver is one of the most important organs in the body. It is the second-largest organ and its job is to process everything that we eat and drink and remove harmful substances from the blood. If there is too much fat in the liver this process can be interrupted. Fatty liver is described as when fat makes up more than five percent of the weight of the liver.\nFatty liver can be reversed with the proper lifestyle modifications. In some cases, a person with fatty liver will not have any symptoms. In addition, there is often no permanent damage caused by fatty liver unless it is allowed to progress.\nThe condition of fatty liver is actually quite common and affects anywhere from ten to twenty percent of Americans. Most cases occur in people between the ages of forty to sixty. If fatty liver is not\ntreated it can become quite harmful.\nHere are eight causes of fatty liver to consider.\nAlcohol consumption is one of the most common reasons that a person will develop fatty liver disease. Drinking too much alcohol is very hard on your liver and can cause all types of damage. For this reason, it is important to limit your alcohol consumption.\nIf you have some of the symptoms of fatty liver disease already, limiting the amount of alcohol that you drink is extremely important. In fact, it is a good idea to not drink any alcohol at all. This will give your liver more time to repair itself and some of the effects of the fatty liver could be reduced.\nThere are many health issues that arise from being overweight. From heart disease to strokes to breathing difficulties, being overweight is not good for a person. In addition, obesity can also cause the fatty liver to develop. As you gain more weight, the fatty deposits need a place to go.\nThese fatty deposits often gather around the liver. When this occurs it makes it more difficult for the liver to do its job, thus leading to many health complications. If you are currently overweight, losing weight in a healthy way can help alleviate many of the symptoms associated with fatty liver.\n3. Insulin Resistance\nWhen your cells do not take up sugar in response to insulin, there can be many issues that develop. Insulin resistance in the body can cause a lot of different health issues, including a fatty liver. A person who has developed insulin resistance should also make sure to have their liver checked.\nThis can help determine whether or not there are any issues with the liver. Often, making dietary changes can help alleviate these symptoms.\n4. High Blood Sugar\nHigh levels of sugar in the blood can be an indication of diabetes. This is known as hyperglycemia. A person who has prediabetes or types 2 diabetes is at more of a risk of developing fatty liver disease as well. Once again, a person who is diabetic is more likely to be overweight, which is one of the causes of fatty liver development.\nIf you have been diagnosed with prediabetes or type two diabetes, it is a good idea to have your liver checked as well. Listen to your doctor and make the lifestyle changes that are recommended to help alleviate the symptoms of these diseases.\n5. High Fat Levels in the Blood\nThe liver is responsible for filtering the blood. When there are high levels of fats in the blood, in particular, triglycerides, it can be more difficult for the liver to function and do its job correctly. When this happens, the liver may begin to store more fat around it, which causes the fatty liver disease to develop.\nChanging your dietary habits is recommended in order to help lower the amount of fat found in the blood. This will help alleviate the symptoms and issues caused by fatty liver.\n6. Hepatitis C\nHepatitis C is a common bloodborne infection in the United States. There are several factors that can increase a person’s risk of developing hepatitis C including hemodialysis, HIV infection, intravenous drug use, and being exposed to blood from a person who is infected.\nOne of the symptoms of hepatitis C is the inflammation of the liver. While there are many other things that can cause fatty liver disease, hepatitis C should be tested for if you are having symptoms of fatty liver.\n7. Sleep Apnea\nWhile it may seem weird, if you have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, you may be at a higher risk of developing fatty liver. Most people who have sleep apnea are often overweight. This pressure from the weight causes a person to stop breathing at times during the night.\nSleep apnea itself is something that needs to be treated by a medical professional. In addition, if you have sleep apnea, it is important to consider some of the symptoms of fatty liver to determine whether or not you have developed this issue as well.\n8. Thyroid Issues\nA person who has an overactive or underactive thyroid may develop many different health-related issues, including fatty liver. The thyroid is responsible for releasing hormones that help regulate many areas of the body.\nWhen it is not working properly, many different health issues may develop. A person who has hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, may gain or lose weight quickly. This development can lead to fat stores throughout the body, including in the liver."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:068a5ea5-9351-4bb4-89d2-857f98c4c38b>","<urn:uuid:c0821e9f-bf59-43ce-b499-eb80910bf5fb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm learning tatting and keep seeing references to 'split rings'. Could you explain what a single shuttle split ring is?","answer":"A single shuttle split ring is a technique where you tat half of the ring up to the climb out spot, then leave it half closed with a length of bare thread equal to the tatted side. Double stitches are then wrapped over the bare thread (without the flip/transfer), allowing you to climb out. This method was developed by Dora Young and uses the core thread on the wrapped side of the split ring as if covering a split chain.","context":["The Young Ladies' Journal. Complete Guide to the Work-Table.\n9th edition 1885. Tatting.\nPattern #21 with original pattern (mistakes and all) and modern tatting methods.\nAs I studied this book I read through pattern #21 and compared it to the illustration on page 104 of the guide. The pattern is tatted with only one shuttle. Instead of the familiar round center ring which could be used to climb out into the second round, this has a set of four outward facing rings. Originally the tatter was to cut the thread and tie on again or bring the shuttle thread to the back of the work and secure it to a picot and move into the second round. This method, of course, the leaves the shuttle thread visible and somewhat unsightly.\nThis is a perfect sample to modernize! But how to climb out? Only one shuttle, can't do a split ring. Or can we? Why, yes, we can! We could do a single shuttle split ring a la Dora Young. This uses the core thread on the wrapped side of the split ring as if one were covering a split chain. The ring is tatted half way to the climb out spot, then half closed leaving a length of thread that is bare and equal to the length needed to match the tatted side of the ring. Not always symmetrical. Double stitches (DS) are then wrapped (not tatted as the flip or transfer does not take place) over the bare thread and the climb out is accomplished.\nOr, we can use the loop tail ring method which I learned from Matthew Takeda. Here the first part of the ring is tatted normally up to the climb out spot. Then we pull out enough thread from the shuttle to make a large loop. Holding the bend of the loop, we use it as if it were a shuttle and tat the remaining ds needed. When done pulling one side of the loop will close the ring. Now if the shuttle starts moving, stop and pull on the other side. Next pull the loop over the ring and shuttle both to the opposite side. Remove slack and the ring is done leaving the shuttle thread at the top of the ring in perfect position to climb out.\nPattern #21 with original pattern (mistakes and all)\nBegin the square in the center, and work the four leaves, each consisting of ten double knots, one picot, 10 double knots. Fasten the thread, and loop it again on to the picot of a leaf, and work the eye, consisting of seven double knots, five picots separated by 3 double knots, seven double knots; draw them together, fasten the thread again to the picot at the starting-point; then work the large scallop lying to the left; eight double knots, five picots separated by 3 double knots, eight double knots. Leave the scallops sufficiently open, so that after the thread is fastened to the next leaf of the middle group the thread lying across may be tight without dragging. Repeat.\nModern tatting notation\nBegin with one shuttle in the center.\nR 10 - 3 - 3 - 10 close ring (clr) do not reverse work (DNRW), leave no bare thread space (BTS).\nRepeat twice more.\nLoop-tail ring or single shuttle split ring to climb out.\nR 10/ 3 - 3 - 10 climb out\nR 7 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 7 clr dnrw.\nBring thread to the next picot and join.\nR 8 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 8 partially close ring dnrw.\nBring thread to the next picot on next center ring and join.\nNote: if you added a helping loop (magic thread trick) to the climb out ring of the center, you can hide the tail in that ring.\nSuggestion: Instead of a shuttle lock join to the picot of the center rings, try a lark's head picot join!\nDagmar Pezzuto shared her new model for this vintage pattern."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:66646da8-1662-43df-b54f-90d7f377ae19>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare the construction timelines of Helsinki Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower? Both seem to be iconic landmarks in their respective cities.","answer":"The construction timelines of these landmarks were quite different. Helsinki Cathedral took significantly longer to build, with construction lasting from 1830 to 1852 (22 years). In contrast, the Eiffel Tower was completed much more quickly, taking only 26 months (2 years, 2 months, and 5 days) to construct.","context":["Helsinki Cathedral (in Finnish Helsingin tuomiokirkko or Suurkirkko, in Swedish Helsingfors domkyrka or Storkyrkan) is an Evangelical Lutheran cathedral of the Diocese of Helsinki, located in the centre of Helsinki, Finland. The church was originally built as a tribute to the Grand Duke, Nicholas I, the Tsar of Russia and until the independence of Finland in 1917, it was called St. Nicholas' Church.\nA distinct landmark in the scenery of central Helsinki, with a tall green dome surrounded by four smaller domes, the church was built in 1830-1852, in neoclassical style. It was designed by Carl Ludvig Engel, to form the climax of the whole Senate Square laid out by Engel, surrounded by a number of buildings all designed by him. The building has a Greek-cross plan (i.e. a square central mass and four arms of equal length), and is symmetrical in each of the four cardinal directions, each marked by a colonnade and pediment. Engel had intended to place a further row of columns on the west end to mark the main entrance (opposite the altar at the east end), but this was never realised. The building was later altered by his successor Ernst Lohrmann, whose four small domes make the architectural connection to the cathedral's model, Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, even clearer. Lohrmann also erected two separately standing bell towers and zinc statues of the Twelve Apostles at apexes and corners of the roofline.\nHelsinki, the capital of the Republic of Finland, is a modern city with over half a million residents and is situated on the Baltic Sea. In 2000 Helsinki was an official European City of Culture while celebrating its 450th anniversary. Helsinki together with the neighbouring cities of Espoo, Kauniainen and Vantaa forms the Helsinki metropolitan area with more than a million inhabitants.\nCapital where Eastern and Western cultures meet\nHelsinki is unique among Northern European cities. The lifestyle in the second-most northern capital city in the world is full of contrasts and activities in the form of hundreds of events and friendly people. Helsinki’s identity has been formed by cultural influences from both the East and West. The archipelago that surrounds Helsinki with hundreds of tiny islands creates an idyllic environment for cruises, for example.\nOver 450 years of history, several architectural layers and the impact of different periods can be clearly seen in Helsinki. Finnish design has also made the country’s capital city world famous. The beauty of the surrounding nature blends seamlessly together with high-tech achievements, while old traditions mix with the latest contemporary trends. The city centre has many beautiful parks, and the nearby forests offer an ideal setting for peaceful and quiet walks.(Source: Helsinki.fi & wikipedia)\nCritiques | Translate\nmikolaj_kawa (0) 2009-04-08 0:52\nHello George!

That is about 26 months in total.\n2.

Its Design Was Inspired by The Latting Observatory in New York City\nEiffel admitted that the tower’s design was American-inspired. The Latting Observatory was only around for a few years- between 1853 and 1856. It was made primarily of wood and was destroyed by a fire that started in a nearby shop.\n4. It Was Built As The Entrance to The 1889 World’s Fair\nThe tower was purposefully built as the centerpiece of the 1889 world’s fair to mark the 100th year anniversary of the French revolution. It was also built to be the tallest man-made structure at the time.\n5. It Was The Tallest Building In The World For Decades\nWhen it was constructed, the tower stood at 300 meters (984 feet)- the equivalent of a 75-story building. It was the tallest man-made structure on earth, overtaking the Washington Monument which was about half the Eiffel Tower’s height. It maintained this record for 41 years until 1930 when the Chrysler Building in New York was completed.\n6. Some Extra Height Was Added Decades Later\nThe tower is a little bit taller than what it was initially. In the 1950s, broadcasting antennae were added to its top and some extra work was done in the year 2000 that increased its height by 24 meters (79 feet). Its current height is 324 meters (1063 feet).\n7. It Was To Be Brought Down After 20 Years\nThe building was permitted to stay only for 20 years, after this, it was to be brought down. In fact, part of the design requirements from the city’s officials was that it should be easy to dismantle. The city decided against bringing it down when it had become a prominent symbol, and a useful communication tower.\n8. Gustave Eiffel Owned The Rights To Its Commercial Exploitation For 20 Years\nBecause Eiffel footed a huge chunk of the tower’s costs, he was given the commercial rights to this building for 20 years, after which it became the property of the City of Paris.\n9. It is The Most Visited Paid Monument in The World\nAbout 7 million people pay to visit this iconic mega-structure every year. Out of this figure, about 75% are foreigners. Also, more than 300 million people have visited it since it was first commissioned in 1889. This gives some insight as to how popular the tower is. Here are some tips to help you save money on a trip to Paris.\n10. There Were Protests Against its Erection\nNot everyone agreed with the city’s decision to permit the tower’s construction, in fact, prominent architects, painters, artists, and sculptors protested against it. In a publication, the tower was likened to the tower of Babel and even to a black factory chimney. There were huge concerns that it will dwarf other important artistic French expressions with its huge size and metallic design.\n11. It has 3 Floors Available To Visitors\nThe Eiffel tower is not just a huge metal structure, it has three floors that house exhibition rooms, restaurants, shops, and even a special room that recreates Eiffel’s office with wax figures of him, Thomas Edison and Claire- Eiffel’s daughter.\nThe first two floors can be accessed by elevators and stairs while the topmost floor can only be accessed by elevators.\n12. It’s Made of 7,3oo Tons Of Metal\nThe impressive tower is very heavy too. It was constructed with 7,300 tons of puddle iron, 18,038 iron parts, and 2.5 million rivets to put the structure in place. When you add the weight of its extra features like shops, rooms, antennae, and elevators, the combined weight is about 10,100 tons.\n13. It is Hand-Painted Every 7 Years\nOnce in about 7 years, 25 specialists paint the tower by hand. The painting typically takes about 18 months to complete and incredibly involves about 60 tons of paint. This is done to preserve the integrity of the metal and costs about 4 million Euros to accomplish.\n14. It was almost destroyed by Hitler\nDuring the Second World War, during the German occupation, the French resistance cut the cables to the tower’s elevators, making it less accessible to the Germans. When the allies were closing in on Paris, Hitler ordered the German governor of Paris to destroy the tower. Thinking Hitler was insane, the governor- General Dietrich von Choltitz didn’t obey this order.\n15. There Are More Than 50 Replicas Around The World\nThere’s a chance that you might have seen a structure that looks like the Eiffel tower in another city. While most of the replicas aren’t exactly the same design and height, they are usually very similar and on different scales. Popular examples are:\n- Blackpool Tower (UK)\n- Tokyo Tower (Japan)\n- Las Vegas Eiffel Tower (USA)\n- Eiffel Tower of Window of the World (China)\n- Paris, Texas Eiffel Tower (USA)\n- Eiffel Tower- Paris, Tennessee (USA)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8863bdac-39b8-41de-be4b-c7c72befcf81>","<urn:uuid:e921e7ed-8e3c-4e0f-9331-6f83e8ba7828>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does NFPA 72 testing differ between duct detectors and smoke detectors in apartment buildings?","answer":"For duct detectors, NFPA 72 requires testing with a manometer or Magnehelic gauge to ensure proper air sampling, where the pressure differential between input sampling tube and exhaust tube should be greater than 0.01\\\" of water and less than 1.2\\\" of water. For apartment smoke detectors, NFPA 72 requires inspection and testing before a new resident moves in, with detectors required to be placed outside each sleeping area and in common areas, and test records must be maintained.","context":["No Tie-In Needed\nMy company is installing a fire alarm sprinkler supervisory panel (DACT) with one outside horn, one smoke detector and one manual pull box. We will be connecting to switches installed by the sprinkler company for monitoring the supervisory devices (water shut-off valves) and waterflow alarm switch. The inspector stopped by and told one of our installers that we have to tie in the duct detectors, too. Is this correct? Also, I have supplied my installers with the new International Building Code (IBC). They want to know where the rules are found for testing duct detectors.\n—Heidi G. Sheik\nNo you do not have to tie in the duct detectors. You are installing equipment to comply with the “907.4 Sprinkler System Monitoring and Alarms” section of the IBC. Since the requirement for tying in duct detectors is in 907 “Fire Alarm and Detection Systems,” the duct detector rule (907.11) doesn’t apply to what you’re doing.\nTo understand how the IBC and IFC (International Fire Code) work, start by reading the “Scope” of the Fire Protection Systems section (Chapter 9) of the IBC. At the very beginning, IBC 901.1 states that this code covers the “application, installation, performance and maintenance of fire alarm systems and their components.”\n“Application” tells you where fire alarm systems are to be installed. “Installation” lists the equipment/devices and building locations where they will be mounted. “Performance” means that certain measurable objectives are to be met, such as audibility and visibility. “Maintenance” is only included by reference, because in Section 907.19 the IBC sends you to Chapter 9 of the IFC for the actual testing and maintenance requirements located in that code.\nThe IFC requires compliance with the testing and maintenance chapter of NFPA 72. In fact, all the IFC Section 907 rules are the same as in the IBC, except for the additional testing and maintenance rules.\nAs far as scientific methods for testing these devices, first, you must comply with the IBC/IFC as referenced in NFPA 72. Once in NFPA 72 (the National Fire Alarm Code), turn to the Testing and Maintenance” chapter. Under the “Test Methods” table, scan through the list until you find “Initiating Devices,” then “Smoke Detectors” then “Duct-Type.”\nSpecifically for duct detectors, the test method table states, “Air duct detectors shall be tested or inspected to ensure that the device will sample the air stream. The test shall be made in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.”\nA manometer or Magnehelic gauge is used to test the pressure differential across the sampling tubes. These gauges have two small hoses that connect on each side of the detector housing; one is labeled Low and the other High. The Low hose is connected to the exhaust tube. The High hose is connected to the sampling tube. Once connected, the gauge will give you a reading indicating the pressure differential between these two tubes. In the example below, the pressure differential between input sampling tube and exhaust tube should be greater than 0.01” of water and less than 1.2” of water.\nGreg Kessinger, SET, CFPS, president of an alarm installing company since 1981, teaches NICET training classes to fire alarm system designers and installers and continuing education seminars for Ohio’s fire alarm inspectors.

Risk management is often overlooked because we assume people know how to prevent hazards and what to do in the event of an emergency. This discussion assumes that the original design of the building in question and any equipment within it have been approved by a governing agency. If you have any questions or doubts that there has been official approval of your building or a remodeled component, you need to contact home office management.\nOne focus of risk management is fire prevention, detection, and protection. There are two categories of fire protection systems: active and passive. Active systems are automated and only work during an emergency. We do not actively rely on them on a day-to-day basis as we do other systems, like the elevator or the boiler. We know the boiler works because we get hot water, and we know the elevator works because we use it rather than walking up flights of stairs. With active fire systems, however, we assume they are functioning if they are not leaking or alarming. This leads to a false sense of security and makes us complacent. The only time we think of these systems is when that 1 in a 1,000 emergency occurs. This situation then becomes life threatening if the system we rely on is not working when we need it most. This is why fire detection and protection systems must be checked regularly and kept in good working order.\nActive fire system components include alarms, communications, sprinklers, fire extinguishers, procedures for boiler operations, and general fire prevention protocols.\nPassive fire protection systems, on the other hand, are not actually systems in the true sense of the word. They are no more than the proper design of the physical structure. Some cities classify residential buildings as either fire-resistive or non-fire-resistive structures. This classification refers to the buildings design and materials, which ideally limit the spread of fire from one area to another. Design features are best left unchanged for either classification. In other words, structural changes should not be made before evaluating the effects the changes would have in case of a fire.\nIt is important to protect the rest of the building from higher-hazard areas such as boilers, laundry rooms, and maintenance shops. To reduce risk, keep doors leading to the higher-hazard areas closed. Doors leading to apartments, offices, stairwells, and mechanical and storage areas must also be kept closed. Never prop doors open in any area. Doors to higher-hazard areas must be equipped with self-closing and self-latching mechanisms. The mechanisms must be kept in working order. A good risk management program will include a periodic check of all doors. Before making any changes to the passive fire system, consult with a professional who can evaluate the effect of the change in the event of a fire.\nAnother area that is commonly overlooked is the decor and design of common areas. Most people do not consider the impact of changing the furniture or type of carpet. All materials must be in accordance with local codes. All the materials used should be chosen with fire safety in mind. We must be especially mindful of wall, floor, and ceiling materials in common areas.\nManagement is responsible for properly maintaining the system in common areas, mechanical spaces, and vacant areas. This task must receive top priority. These are not systems to be left until later for repair. A system that is not functioning as designed is a hazard to all residents.\nThe National Fire Alarm Code NFPA 72 specifies the inspection, testing, and maintenance requirements of these systems. Some of the provisions of NFPA 72 require testing by licensed contractors, but staff can perform a few of the inspections and tests.\nFor example, when a fire alarm system is to be out of service or impaired for any reason for more than 4 hours in a 24-hour period, we must:\nNotifying occupants is a key element in the life safety program. Occupants that are hearing impaired need visible signals installed. At the communication point, a map is posted to help identify building zones, areas, and floors. Some cities require that all apartment buildings post a fire safety plan near the mailboxes, provide a copy of the plan to residents, and post evacuation procedures on the inside of each apartment door each year.\nSmoke detector placement is very important. Smoke detectors are required outside each sleeping area and other areas defined by local codes. Most buildings have smoke detectors in common areas. Some cities require that carbon monoxide detectors be installed within 15 feet of each bedroom or sleeping area.\nBefore a new resident moves in, all detectors in the apartment must be inspected and tested. A record of this inspection and testing should be maintained.\nThe detection, alarm, and communication inspection and testing program should follow local codes and NFPA guidelines.\nThe most effective tool in extinguishing a fire is the automatic sprinkler system. These systems have a history of keeping a fire under control so that occupants are less likely to be injured. Sprinkler systems must be maintained in good working order with a complete inspection, testing, and maintenance program. It is very easy to forget or neglect sprinkler systems, but this can lead to disastrous consequences if the system does not operate in a fire situation.\nIf the sprinkler system needs to be impaired due to repairs, maintenance, or modifications, the procedures of the Fire Protection Impairment Program provided by the loss control consultant should be followed.\nMost high-rise buildings have standpipes located in the building stairwells, which are for fire department personnel to attach fire hoses to without having to stretch long hose lines up many flights. Water for the fire main is supplied by a segregated portion of a water tank located on the roof. Fire engines provide a connection called a Siamese connection from a fire hydrant to a pipe that is located outside the building. Siamese connections and all standpipe valves should be inspected regularly.\nPortable fire extinguishers must be located in the boiler rooms, employee locker rooms, gift or retail shops, bulk laundry areas, smaller laundry centers, maintenance shops, storage spaces, trash collection rooms, and common areas of the building. There are several types of fire extinguishers used in different fire situations. All fire extinguishers are to be inspected monthly by staff and annually by a licensed contractor.\nBoilers create a fire as well as an explosion hazard. Buildings using boilers to provide building heat or hot water should have an established inspection and testing program. There should be a written procedure for the startup and shutdown of the unit that follows the manufacturers specifications. All affected employees should be trained on these procedures. All safety devices should be inspected and tested annually.\nRubbish and laundry chutes can also create a potential fire hazard to the building. A frequent problem found with rubbish and laundry chutes is a disabled automatic closing device.\nThe base point of the rubbish and laundry chute must be installed with an automatic closing door. The discharge door is originally installed with a fusible link designed to hold the door open. Common problems found during inspections include the fusible link being replaced with plain wire and the spring being removed from the door. Using a wire or disabling the door in any way is dangerous and strictly forbidden. Spare fusible links should be kept on the premises. The access door leading into the rubbish or laundry room on each floor must be self-closing and capable of latching shut. It is common to find the self-closing mechanism disabled, as residents and staff find them inconvenient. Thus, frequent inspections of the access doors on each floor must be preformed.\nGeneral fire prevention techniques include infrared surveys and written programs for work that poses a fire hazard.\nInfrared surveys of electrical equipment should be performed periodically. Electrical equipment failure and breakdowns are leading causes of fires. A licensed contractor should perform an infrared survey as often as practical, but no less than every 5 years. You may need to do surveys more often if the building is experiencing frequent electrical problems or if there have been changes in the operational or load conditions.\nEmergency lighting systems and illuminated exit signs provide protection for residents. These devices generally are powered by building 60-cycle power and have batteries that provide for a limited amount of illumination during a building power failure. We will discuss emergency lighting in more detail later.\nA self-inspection sheet is a convenient means of verifying that all stationary equipment has been reviewed. This sheet is the documentation of your efforts to maintain the building. Inspection reports should be periodically reviewed to identify trends and can be customized to your building. It is important to document identified deficiencies that have not been corrected. The ultimate goal is to correct all deficiencies that may expose residents and buildings to loss.\nGeneral liability, for our purposes, is the exposure for damages resulting from events that occur on the property. We will discuss a very broad spectrum of issues arising from alleged bodily injury and property damage that occurs to non-employees. There are endless combinations of conditions that can cause injury or damage, so only some of the major points will be discussed.\nThis training is not intended to replace your legal staff. It is only provided to help you identify some ways that allegations of bodily injury and property damage can occur and some potential hazards to look for when doing inspections. For other issues, such as leases, evictions, fair housing, and sick building syndrome, among others, consult with legal counsel.\nThe first point we will discuss is something called attractive nuisance. This is defined as any novel device particularly enticing and potentially dangerous to children. These types of hazards are significant liability exposures to the property owner. The major attractive nuisance is swimming pools. Another is playground equipment. Swimming pools are the most significant, as the potential for death is very real. The evaluation and maintenance of pool protection devices is of the highest priority. A swimming pool checklist must be used for the inspection.\nAnother major hazard area is trips and falls. These are the most common types of incidents in the apartment industry. The injuries associated with this loss source can be serious, such as broken bones or contusions . Worn floor coverings, poor housekeeping, and inadequately maintained interior and exterior walkways, stairs, parking lots, and other common areas can cause this type of incident. Properly maintained lighting is a key factor in helping people identify trip hazards. The property checklist should note acceptable conditions. All personnel should work to identify and remove trip and fall hazards daily.\nSlip and fall hazards are similar to trip and fall hazards in that floor maintenance is essential. Simply drying a wet floor is not sufficient. Slippery floor surfaces can be created from roof leaks, plumbing leaks, housekeeping operations such as mopping, and spills. In all cases, the condition should be corrected. The water source must be identified and corrected to remove the slip and fall hazard.\nWhen contractors are used, management is responsible for their actions and the tenants safety. Contractors activities on the premise can cause bodily injury or property damage. Only contractors that have liability insurance of their own should be used. Proof of adequate insurance must be obtained from every contractor that performs work in or around a property. Care must be taken not to lend, or allow contractors to borrow, any building equipment or tools, especially ladders, scaffolds, or safety devices. Lawsuits frequently arise from claims that equipment failed to operate properly.\nSecurity is also an area of liability concern. In some states, landlords are required to take at least minimal precautions to protect tenants against foreseeable criminal harm. Security is considered to have been compromised when it is proven that the criminal was an intruder in the building who took advantage of an entrance that was negligently maintained. Intercom systems must be maintained, tested, and quickly repaired when requested.\nKey control is another security issue that should be addressed during each evaluation of liability issues. Apartment keys must not be labeled with the apartment number or as the master key. A code or encryption should be used to label keys and should be kept in a secure box accessible only to authorized employees. Resident records should be locked, and computer records should be encrypted so that only authorized personnel are able to read them. Follow an attorneys advice in regards to what type of violent/criminal activity notifications need to be passed on to the residents, the method of notification, and proper wording for such notifications.\nThe general liability issues inspection checklist is used to identify trends and document more ways to make a building safer. Room for additional comments/suggestions was left in each category. When doing your first inspection, question everything. Do not omit items because they are common sense or obvious hazards. When you find a problem during the inspection and correct it, check the NO box anyway and describe your correction.\nOur last topic for discussion is the Life Safety Code. It defines means of egress as a continuous and unobstructed way of travel from any point in a building to a public way consisting of three separate and distinct parts:\n(1) The exit access\n(2) The exit\n(3) The exit discharge\nA life safety evaluation of a building does not consist of only checking exit doors; it must include the components of the egress system. Some of these components are:\nFire escape stairs have been grandfathered into the egress system but are not preferred. Other components that are approved but are not to be used by residents include:\nAll components of egress must be maintained in working order at all times. Disabling or hindering any of the components can present serious consequences.\nNo matter how well-maintained the egress system, we have to be able to see it to use it. All means of egress must be properly illuminated. An egress system is of no good if you cannot find it. Criteria have been set using the light levels required for each type of location in the egress system. The proper lighting level has been designed into the system.\nTo ensure that proper lighting levels are maintained, replace the original lighting only with lights of the same wattage and in the same orientation. Without light, distance is extremely difficult to measure. Add smoke and fire, and a lit emergency sign may be what guides you to safety and makes the difference between life and death.\nEmergency lighting systems must have a switchover time from regular power to backup power of 10 seconds or less.\nBattery-powered lights must be tested manually every month for at least 30 seconds and annually for 1 hours. Remember that the signs are part of the system. Visually inspect signs, exit markings, and lighting every 30 days.\nNow that we have checked the lights and signs and verified the power, we must be sure that the egress path is properly marked and that all signage is always in place. Visually inspect signage to ensure everything is still in place and legible. Keep in mind the following for marking egress routes:\nThere is more to a life safety inspection than just checking exit doors. These national standards are modified every two years. It is important to stay current with the Life Safety Code as many changes are made in response to lessons learned from events in which lives were lost. This concludes our discussion of risk management."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ab31efce-9f7f-4c1a-867a-f0cb2d214573>","<urn:uuid:75d61695-f0cf-4e6d-a2b9-3fb1be4c41c5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the source material used in restoring 'Destiny' compare to that of 'Metropolis' in terms of international collaboration?","answer":"Both restorations involved materials from multiple international sources. 'Destiny's restoration used a dupe-negative from New York's Museum of Modern Art, along with additional materials from archives in Russia, Munich, Prague, Toulouse, and Brussels. 'Metropolis' had a crucial discovery in Argentina, where a 210-minute 16mm reduction negative of the original cut was found in the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, which proved essential for restoring the missing footage that had long been considered lost.","context":["The news that Fritz Lang’s Destiny (Der müde Tod) was being restored has been met with great excitement in silent film circles. A highly elaborate and influential production, Alfred Hitchcock was among its fans.\nAnke Wilkening of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, which was responsible for the restoration, has kindly agreed to answer some questions about the process.\nThe Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung is noted for its impressive restorations. How do you go about choosing which films will be restored?\nThis depends basically on requests from outside, TV, DVD/BD labels.\nWhen did you first see “Destiny”? What were your impressions of the film? Were you able to see a fairly complete version at that time?\nThe film has always been more or less complete. Incompleteness was not so much an issue in this restoration.\nWhat was the condition of “Destiny” when the restoration project began?\nThe film was circulating in black-and-white prints. As it is a film from 1921, it must have been tinted and toned. This can be clearly observed for the numerous night scenes. They were shot either in studio, day-for-night, or – rarely – night-for-night. Hence, they vary in brightness. In 1921, defining the scenes as day or night was a post-production, a film laboratory task. Most outdoor night scenes were filmed during the day and appear as bright as day in the positives made from the negatives. Tinting the black-and-white positives with blue or green tones turned them into night scenes. The black-and-white prints provide a distorted view of the movie, because the night scenes are not recognizable as such in them.\nWhat were the challenges of this particular restoration?\nNo coloured print of DER MÜDE TOD has survived. Thus, the colors were simulated based on movies produced by Decla during the same period. As blue was a code for night and red was a code for fire during the silent movie era, the choice of color was evident for these scenes. There are also several references to the choice of yellow and ivory tinting for exterior scenes, or pink tinting for indoor day scenes, and orange tinting for interior evening scenes.\nThe question of what color the candlelit hall should be tinted was more complicated. There are no comparables in other movies for the presentation of the kingdom of the dead as a cathedral with stalagmite-like candles. To do justice to the effect of the bright candles in the darkness of the cathedral, we focused on scenes in other films that are set in dark rooms, but which were not explicitly night scenes. Examples for such scenes exist in DER RICHTER VON ZALAMEA (Decla-Film- Gesellschaft Holz & Co. 1920, directed by Ludwig Berger), in which dungeons are toned blue and tinted light green, or the opium den in the catacombs of the city in DIE SPINNEN (Decla-Film-Gesellschaft Holz & Co. 1919/20, directed by Fritz Lang), which is tinted yellow and also toned blue. In both cases, this color combination emphasizes a dark room with minimal light sources. To emphasize the effect of burning candles, the blue tint was combined with a yellow toning.\nCould you give an estimate of how many man-hours are required for a restoration of this kind?\nNot in hours. But, the works containing research, collating of film and non-film sources, creating a colour map at the Murnau-Stiftung and the technical realisation at L`Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna took 14-15 months.\nIs the new version entirely made up of German material or does it include footage from foreign versions?\nBasic source material was a dupe-negative from the 1940s from the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Additional material came from Gosfilmofond of Russia, Moskau Filmmuseum München, Národní filmový archiv, Prag, Cinémathèque de Toulouse, Cinémathèque Royale de Belgique, Brüssel.\nHow complete is the new restoration? Are there still scenes missing or are we seeing what exactly audiences would have enjoyed during its initial release?\nNobody can say how exactly the premiere print in 1921 was looking. We have no indication for missing footage.\nIf there is additional footage, do you feel that it improved the film overall?\nFor the first time we could add two before missing introductory titles, written in verse, in the framing story. So far only the first one out of three was existent. Originally, there were two more intertitles in verse within the framing story. Lotte Eisner quotes them in her book about Fritz Lang, based on the director’s recollections. Both intertitles were found again in the prints from Prague and Brussels, which had not previously been consulted. They are at the beginning of the second and sixth verses, and structure the timing of the old German episode. Over the course of the first verse evening falls, and finally night. The entire second verse, which shows the young woman’s desperate search for her fiancé and her transition into the realm of the dead, takes place at night and is also introduced with a title containing the mention of moonlight as a reference to the time. The sixth and final verse continues the background story. It is shortly before midnight, and Death gives her one last chance to win back the life of her fiancé.\nWhat aspect of the restoration are you proudest of?\nI am not proud, but happy that in the context of this project I had the chance to simulate the missing colours.\nMany thanks for sharing your time!\nDestiny will be available on DVD, Bluray and via streaming in North America on August 30, 2016. I’ll have an unboxing of the title posted this coming Monday. See you there!","Forget the Iron Curtain: Berlin Film Festival Raises Recycled Curtain on Metropolis\nImage: Metropolis, Original Film Poster, UFA\nDo you know which film inspired C-3PO in Star Wars? Or gave Superman's home its name? It is Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Lang produced his epic silent film in the brief period of stability and astounding intellectual productivity between the two world wars known as the Weimar Culture. With a budget equivalent to over $200 million in modern currency, Metropolis was the mega-blockbuster of 1927. But the film was too long for audiences and underwent a series of cuts and edits shortly after its original Berlin opening.\nFilm historians gave up on ever restoring the film to its original condition, as missing bits simply could not be found. Nonetheless, the film was the first ever to be recognized in UNESCO's \"Memory of the World\" register. Now it will open the Berlinale Film Festival next week--in its full, original version. To properly frame the significance of the event, Berlinale directors turned to American designer Christina Kim, renowned for selling eco- and human-friendly couture under the brand name dosa. The story of the recovery of Lang's film, and the details of the recycled art project grand enough to pull back the curtain on it, are as provocative and fascinating as the city which will once again premier the original cut of Metropolis.\nImages: Vorhang Auf -- The Curtain, Berlinale\nIn an attempt to capture all the magic and power of cinema in a single installation, artist Christina Kim (image) will recycle old film festival billboards, film footage, dvds, and other film-related materials -- interweaving them into a huge curtain which will be raised for the showing of Metropolis at the Brandenburg gate. Kim -- whose fashion-followers reportedly include Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, and Nicole Kidman -- has worked around the world developing organic textiles and creating economic opportunities for indigenous design.\nIn the tradition of Berlin, the curtain will be drawn back in front of the \"fan mile\" along one of Berlin's main boulevards, so that visitors from around the globe can join the fun of the star-studded event at the Friedrichstadtpalast Theater. The gala premier, accompanied by the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin playing the original score live, will be broadcast to a huge screen at the Brandenburg gate, the symbolic dividing point of the former East and West Berlin.\nWhere once the Iron Curtain cast its long shadow, 60 years of cultural progress will give testament to the power of creativity to survive adversity. The survival and restoration of Lang's original cut will echo that incredible message.\nThe missing footage certainly contributed to the mystique of Metropolis, keeping alive an irrepressible urge to recover the original. This living legend probably contributed to the discovery of a 210-minute 16 mm reduction negative of the original cut of the film in the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The museum curator and the director of the film department of the Museum of Latin American Art naturally thought of these missing scenes upon hearing an anecdote from a cinema club manager who remarked on the unusual length of the film. The footage was found buried in the archives and turned over to experts, who verified the authenticity of the find.\nMetropolis developed remarkable advances in special effects, including the use of mirrors carefully crafted to make actors appear as if they have been placed inside miniature sets. The design and visuals in Metropolis continue to influence modern film-makers as well as graphic novelist. A couple examples:\n- The special effects supervisor in Blade Runner used stills from Metropolis when lining up shots.\n- The climactic cathedral scene in Tim Burton's Batman parallel the cathedral scene in Metropolis.\n- Scenes from Metropolis influenced DC Comic's All-Star Squadron, Alan Moore's graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, and Japanese manga artist Osamu Tezuka's eponymous novel and anime film.\nThe return of Metropolis to the world stage at the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Berlinale will certainly weave itself into the fascinating tapestry of the history of this reunited city. Behind the scenes, Christina Kim is working to make certain that the upcycled fragments of film history woven into The Curtain will continue to serve a useful purpose after the festival.

{"question":"How does blockchain technology enhance audit processes, and what are the current regulatory challenges in implementing it?","answer":"Blockchain technology enhances the audit process by providing increased transparency and improved transaction tracking. When structured correctly with appropriate tools, it offers auditors a level of assurance not available with traditional clients. The technology enables permanent ledger availability for recomputations and tracing beyond the testing period, while auditors can rely on the completeness and accuracy of transactions. However, significant regulatory challenges exist, as different countries and economic zones have adopted varying positions on blockchain technology. Some jurisdictions are taking a wait-and-see approach, creating scenarios where identical transactions are treated differently across territories for legal and accounting purposes. This regulatory uncertainty is compounded by the rapid development of the technology and the volatility of various blockchain implementations. Additionally, there is currently a lack of standardized guidelines, with some practitioners proposing specialized International Auditing Standards specifically for blockchain audits, though literature on this subject remains largely unknown or unverified.","context":["- A member of the management team.\nThe audit domain is facing clients who are interested in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), crypto exchanges, digital wallets and other similar projects which will be requiring financial statement or other types of assurances services, raising various challenges both on the audit side and the regulatory side. The audit’s challenges are mainly due to a number of factors which will perhaps take longer to understand and adapt to, such that this article considers some of the salient particularities in auditing DLT-centric clients.\nDue to the particularities of DLT and blockchain technology, personnel forming part of the financial statements audit team will need to understand the technology itself, which often requires specialisation in IT auditing, cryptography and historical knowledge of the technology. In addition, legal considerations need also be taken into consideration, especially when auditing smart contracts and their derivatives.\nFurthermore system audits need to be performed by personnel that are aptly educated an experienced in or at the very least have a strong base in ITC, assurance and accounting and legal aspects of DLT technology.\nSome of the practitioners involved in the audit of DLT technologies have proposed specialised and specific International Auditing Standards (IAS) specifically for tackling DLT audits. To date, literature is largely unknown, and the few pieces which are available on the subject matter of auditing DLTs are by unknown and unverified sources.\nDeveloping industry-adhered guidelines in order to ensure that an adequate level of assurance is given to the public is a prerequisite. More so, regulators will need to understand that the development of guidelines will require adaptation and must remain flexible. Furthermore a hybrid of an auditor-software-engineer-lawyer role or a team of such professionals tightly-knit and working seamlessly will be necessary to cater for DLT-intensive clients from an audit perspective. Such a role or team would entail significant support and investment for audit entities as they would have to furnish specific training for their personnel.\nThe rapid development of the technology and also to a certain extent the volatility of some of the various implementations of DLT technology (cryptocurrencies) again pose substantial challenges from an audit perspective. A team composed of specialist DLT auditors is a must for the technology itself is also complex, touching on compound mathematics, cryptography, networking, economics and finance.\nMoreover, different countries and/or economic-cooperation zones have adopted different positions in relation to DLT technology, or are playing a wait-and-see game, which creates a scenario whereby the same transaction is treated differently in one domicile as against another for law and accounting purposes.\nWhile the above highlights some of the major challenges of auditing enterprises involved in DLT technology, the adoption of DLT by the client under review in itself could enhance the audit process. DLT technology is designed in such a manner where if structured correctly, with the right tools, it would provide an auditor a level of assurance which would otherwise not be available in reviewing non-DLT clients. The technology of itself could increase or enhance transparency , especially in tracing and tracking transactions through the audit chain, with the real possibility of the permanent ledger being available for recomputations and tracing beyond the period under testing, giving an auditor more options in testing data. In confirming the Ledger itself, an auditor should be in a position to place reliance on the completeness and accuracy of the transactions within, a unique advantage for an auditor.\nAlso, in the long run by embracing a number of tools the audit process could become more risk-focussed, while at the same time cheaper to conclude on.\nOn a general note, in order to cater for DLT clients and support our Blockchain Island, Maltese professionals, from auditors to lawyers, will need to continue investing significant time and resources in order to stretch and strengthen their skill set to prepare for what is surely to be an exciting time for the Maltese economy.","What is the Role of Blockchain in Accounting?\nImagine you wanted to rob a bank, but you needed a different key to open several doors until you reached the money. That would be quite the challenge! Blockchain technology in finance is just like this.\nBlockchain technology has been making waves in the accounting world, with enhanced security, transparency, and clarity of financial transactions. In this article, we'll discuss the role of blockchain in accounting, its benefits, how it works, its impact on the accounting industry, and real-world use cases.\nWhat is blockchain accounting?\nTraditional accounting practices exist for regular banking and hard cash systems, but there are also accounting practices for blockchain, which deals in cryptocurrencies. Pursuing ACCA courses or an industry-oriented accounting and financial management degree with roots in FinTech can help you learn more about this subject.\nWhat is blockchain technology?\nBlockchain is a revolutionary decentralised and distributed ledger technology (DLT) that records data in chronological order. In simple terms, a blockchain requires authentication and keys to open cash flow every step of the way in the financial pathway, thus making the system decentralised.\nTo understand its application in accounting, let's start with the basics of blockchain technology.\nAbout traditional accounting systems\nTraditional accounting systems have served us well for years, but they have limitations. They often involve intermediaries, slow processes, and a high potential for errors. Blockchain aims to mitigate these issues, altering the way financial transactions are recorded and managed for good.\nBenefits of blockchain in accounting:\nEnhanced transparency: Blockchain ensures all parties have access to the same ledger (accounting records/data), reducing fraud risks. According to a report by Deloitte, 53% of surveyed professionals believe that increased transparency is the primary benefit of blockchain in accounting.\nIncreased security: Blockchain is impossible to alter, duplicate, or forge making it extremely difficult for unauthorised alterations. A study by IBM found that blockchain can reduce data breaches by up to 80%.\nEfficiency gains: Transactions are processed faster and with fewer errors, saving time and resources. The World Economic Forum estimates that blockchain could save businesses USD 365 billion annually by 2030.\nReduced costs: Eliminating intermediaries helps companies cut down their fees and expenses. A PwC report suggests that blockchain technology can reduce transaction costs by 35% in financial services.\nAccurate auditing: Auditors can easily trace transactions using blockchain technology, leading to more accurate audits. According to a survey by EY, 95% of respondents believe that blockchain will simplify the auditing process.\nHow does blockchain in accounting work?\nBlockchain in accounting relies on a network of computers (nodes) that validate and record transactions. These transactions are grouped into blocks and linked together in a chain. Different types of blockchain can be used for various accounting purposes.\nTypes of blockchain in accounting:\n- Public blockchain: Open to anyone and highly transparent.\n- Private blockchain: Restricted access, often used within organisations.\n- Consortium blockchain: Shared among a group of trusted organisations.\nBenefits of blockchain in accounting:\n- Improved financial reporting: Real-time data access enhances reporting accuracy. A study by Accenture found that blockchain can reduce reporting errors by 67%.\n- Fraud prevention: Blockchain's security features deter fraudulent activities. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, organisations lose 5% of their annual revenues to fraud.\n- Smart contracts: Self-executing contracts automate processes, reducing the need for intermediaries (middle management). Research by MarketsandMarkets predicts that the smart contract market will reach USD 300 million by 2023.\n- Simplified reconciliation: Reduced discrepancies in financial records lead to smoother reconciliation processes. A report by McKinsey & Company suggests that blockchain can reduce reconciliation time by 80%.\nReal-world use cases of blockchain technology\nBlockchain technology is already making strides in accounting. It's being used for supply chain management, digital identity verification, and more.\n- Supply chain management: IBM's Food Trust platform uses blockchain to trace the origin of food products, reducing foodborne illnesses by 60%.\n- Digital identity verification: Estonia's e-Residency programme employs blockchain for secure digital identity verification, serving over 80,000 people globally.\n- Cross-border payments: Ripple, a blockchain-based payment platform, has partnered with over 300 financial institutions to enable faster and cheaper cross-border transactions. This technology can reduce cross-border payment costs by up to 60%, according to a report by McKinsey & Company.\n- Intellectual property protection: The WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization) uses blockchain to record intellectual property rights, providing creators with immutable proof of ownership.\n- Healthcare data security: MedicalChain utilises blockchain to secure and streamline medical records, ensuring patient data remains confidential and accessible to authorised personnel.\nHow will blockchain technology affect the accounting industry?\nBlockchain is set to transform the accounting industry in several ways as mentioned below:\n- Streamlined processes: Blockchain enables faster and more accurate transactions. A study by Juniper Research predicts that blockchain could save financial institutions up to USD 27 billion annually by 2030.\n- Career opportunities: Demand for blockchain-savvy accountants is on the rise. A report by LinkedIn shows that blockchain-related job postings have increased by 550% in recent years.\n- Regulatory changes: Regulations will evolve to accommodate blockchain technology. Governments worldwide are exploring how to regulate blockchain to ensure its safe and responsible use.\nFuture of accounting with blockchain\nThe future of accounting is undeniably intertwined with blockchain. Embracing this technology will be crucial for staying competitive and relevant in the accounting field. Deloitte predicts that blockchain will become a \"critical asset\" for financial institutions.\nAs finance professionals, it's essential to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of accounting and financial management. In this comprehensive guide, we've explored the fascinating world of blockchain in accounting. We've uncovered how blockchain technology enhances transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions.\nBlockchain offers exciting opportunities to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in accounting practices. Given all the advantages and merits of blockchain technology, the finance sector is rapidly evolving to be able to implement this on a global scale. It is safe to say that blockchain is the future of financial transactions.\nAs the accounting industry continues to evolve, consider embracing blockchain technology as a valuable skill set. By understanding its basics and potential, you'll be well-prepared for the future of accounting and financial management.\nOther news from Online Learning\nExplore ACCA applied skills exams: subjects, expert tips, and the importance of this module.

{"question":"Could you explain the key difference between Act-utilitarianism and Rule-utilitarianism in the context of the greatest happiness principle?","answer":"Act-utilitarianism judges individual actions based on their direct consequences for happiness, but faces problems because outcomes often can't be foreseen and well-intended actions might have negative results. Rule-utilitarianism, in contrast, judges general rules rather than specific acts - it considers whether following certain rules (like mothers caring for sick children) will generally contribute to the greatest happiness for the most people, even if individual cases might have negative outcomes.","context":["Greatest happiness principle\nThe greatest happiness principle is a moral tenet, which holds that the best thing to do is what contributes to the greatest happiness of the greatest number of people.\nDuring the Middle Ages it was widely believed that happiness is not possible in earthly life and that the basis of morality is in the word of God. These views were contested in the 'Enlightenment'; happiness came to be seen as attainable and morality was regarded as man-made. A lively discussion on the relation between happiness and morality emerged and in this climate an instrumental view on morality appeared, in which ethical codes are seen as ways of securing a happy life.\nMuch of that enlightened thought is reflected in Jeremy Bentham's (1789) 'Introduction to morals and legislation'. Bentham argues that the moral quality of action should be judged by its consequences on human happiness and in that line he claims that we should aim at the 'greatest happiness for the greatest number'.\nBentham defined happiness in terms of psychological experience, as 'the sum of pleasures and pains'. His philosophy is known as 'utilitarianism', because of its emphasis on the utility of behavioural consequences. 'Happyism' would have been a better name.\nWhen applied at the level of individual choice (Act-utilitarianism), this tenet runs into some difficulties. One problem is that often one cannot foresee what the balance of effects on happiness will be. Another problem is that the principle deems well-intended behaviour to be a-moral if it happens to pan out adversely. Imagine the case of a loving mother who saves the life of her sick child, a child that grows up to be a criminal; mothers can seldom foresee a child's future and can hardly be reproached for their unconditional motherly love.\nThe principle is better suited for judging general rules, such as the rule that mothers should care for their sick children. It is fairly evident that adherence to this rule will add to the happiness of a great number. Following such rules is then morally correct, even if consequences might be negative in a particular case. This variant is known as 'Rule-Utilitarianism'.\nWhen applied to public policy the principle is also called 'Political Utilitarianism' and holds that institutions, laws and social policy should maximize happiness. Bentham used the greatest happiness principle in that way and discussed the implications of that principle for property laws and the death penalty. Interest in such applications is rising today. Layard (2005) on these grounds pleas for higher income tax and more investment in mental health care.\nIn political utilitarianism, the focus is typically on average happiness. One can also give priority to the happiness of the least happy (negative utilitarianism) or to reducing inequality in happiness (egalitarian utilitarianism). An empirical analysis by Ott (2005) suggests that most social policies fit all these principles equally well.\nThis secular ideology met much resistance. In the 18the century the opposition came mainly from the churches, which were still quite powerful. In the 19th century there was also opposition from the liberal and socialist emancipation movements that were more interested in freedom and equality than in happiness. In the early 20th century much of the opposition came from the then-virulent nationalism that laid more emphasis on glory of the nation than on the happiness of its inhabitants.\nAll these ideologies lost power in the late 20th century, and partly for that reason the greatest happiness principle made a comeback. The recent emergence of happiness economics is part of that long-term ideological shift.\nThe ideological opposition against the greatest happiness principle gave rise to several intellectual arguments, in particular against political utilitarianism. Some of the objections draw on assumptions about reality and can be checked empirically. One of these arguments is that \"great happiness\" is hardly possible in the human condition and that \"greater happiness\" is fully out of reach. Another argument holds that attempts to further happiness will bring us from the frying pan into the fire because of the various negative side effects of happiness and its pursuit. Much of these qualms figure in Huxley's (1932) famous science fiction novel 'Brave New World', which describes a society in which people are happy subjectively, but miserable from objective points of view.\nThe available data show that the principle is feasible: happiness of a great number is possible in contemporary conditions and it is also possible to create more of it. The data also show that the promotion of happiness fits well with other ideals; happiness requires conditions that we value, such as freedom, and happiness fosters matters that we value, such as good health and civil behaviour. Though happiness can conflict with these values in theory, it appears to match them in practice.\n- Bentham, J. (1789). Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, London\n- Huxley, A.

{"question":"As an office sustainability manager, I'm curious about workplace composting practices and their cost implications. What materials are suitable for office composting, and how does this relate to the true cost of waste management?","answer":"For office composting, suitable materials include meat and bone (if accepted by municipal programs), dairy and eggs, paper eating utensils, raw or cooked vegetables and fruit, shredded paper, and coffee-related items (grounds, filters, tea bags). However, pet waste, smoking items, and synthetic corks cannot be composted. Regarding cost implications, waste management involves more than disposal fees - it includes energy used for processing, handling and storage costs, and the proportional purchase price of unused materials. The real cost to businesses can be significantly higher than just disposal costs, with some materials having purchase-to-disposal ratios as high as 425:1, as demonstrated in case studies.","context":["What Can and Cannot Be Composted at Work? (+Other Tips)\nWondering what can and cannot be composted at the office? Today’s post takes a closer look at your workplace composting program to unearth what should and what shouldn’t be composted.\nComposting at work is becoming increasingly common, with green teams leading the way on what to do with food waste and other compostable products. Once your team has conducted a thorough waste audit, you’ll be better positioned to streamline your composting program.\nOffice composting can be complex without this initial audit. So, make sure that your team knows what kinds of compostable waste are being created onsite. According to The Environmental Protection Agency 24.9 million tons of food and yard waste was composted between 2015 and 2018.\nStudies have said that most people would compost if its easy to do – which means your workplace composting process needs to be simple for employees to adopt. Use this handy list to determine what can and cannot be composted at work.\nWhat Can You Compost at Work?\nWorkplace composting is similar to composting at home with one caveat – a large amount of people are expected to contribute to the program. For this to happen effectively, the right educational practices must be put in place alongside regular company reporting to gain employee buy-in.\nTo compost at work, processes must be put in place focusing on the kitchen or cafeteria area. Food scraps are going to be the essential composting items here. Remember that this post is aimed at curbside composting programs that are picking up your office compost on a regular basis.\n- Meat and Bone\nWhether raw or cooked, meat isn’t always meant for the compost heap. In this case, when your business is composting in conjunction with a municipal composting program, you might get away with it. Most city programs accept meats from cafeterias whether they are on or off the bone.\nDouble check whether or not your city accepts raw meat and carcasses though, in case they don’t want anything that doesn’t ‘grow’ in your green cart.\n- Dairy and Eggs\nAnother typical no-go for home composting environments, city programs are happy to accept all dairy and eggshell waste in your workplace compost.\n- Paper Eating Utensils\nCan you compost paper cups? What about plates, napkins, and towels? While soiled or food smeared paper utensils are a no for the recycling bin, they’re welcome in the office compost. The next time you have cake for Rita in accounting, remind your team to compost the remains.\n- Raw or Cooked Vegetables and Fruit\nWhether chopped, peeled, half-eaten or cooked into starchy grains – feel free to get your employees to compost all vegetable and fruit items.\n- Shredded Paper\nBeen wondering what to do with all that shredded paper you can’t recycle? Put it in your green compost bin. Add a special green waste bin to your printing room and add it to your composting bin at the end of every week.\n- Coffee Grounds, Coffee Filters, and Tea Bags\nAs long as your employees are removing the staples from your tea bags, they usually accept all forms of caffeinated breakroom refreshment. From filters and bags to leaves and coffee grounds – having a compost bin in the breakroom is a great way to promote your program.\nWhat Cannot be Composted at Work?\nThere are some surprising no-no’s when composting at work. Beginners may not know that these items shouldn’t go in your workplace compost bin, so get your green team to put up posters or send out mailers detailing where these banned items should go.\n- Pet Waste\nIf you have a dog or cat friendly office, make sure your employees aren’t trying to compost their pet waste. This includes all fecal matter, cat litter and soiled paper items used in the disposal of animal waste. Experts say the risk is too high, with parasites and harmful bacteria present.\n- Smoking Related Items\nSome of your employees will nip outside for a smoke break, but can that waste be composted? Typically, cigarette butts and ash can’t be composted. Neither can vape cartridges, mouthpieces, atomizers, or batteries! These don’t go in your normal recycling either, they should be placed in an e-waste recycling bin for disposal.\n- Most Corks\nDo you have Friday drinks at the office? Most corks these days aren’t natural corks, so they can’t be composted. If you do happen across some natural cork then it can go in the composting bin – just make sure all wire, foil and aluminum are removed from it first.\nAs always you can’t compost plastics, aluminum, or glass of any kind. The general rule is that only organic materials can be composted.\nMake sure that you check with your local municipality so that your workplace composting program is in line with your city rules. Follow their rules and you’ll know what can and can’t be composted at work.\nLearn something new? Tell us below!","Good waste management starts with understanding the ‘real or true cost’ of material which ends up as waste. The real cost factors in the energy used to process the material on site, the handling and storage costs associated with the waste materials and the proportional purchase price of the unused materials. Taking into account all these costs, the real cost of waste to a business can be far greater than simply the cost of paying someone to take it away.\nThe first step to reducing waste in a business is to look in the waste bins to see exactly what is being disposed. Keep an eye out for high value materials because the ‘purchase to disposal ratio’ can be very high, and for wasted finished product, the real cost of waste can be hundreds of times the disposal cost (see case studies below).\nSegregation of waste is important as this allows a business to easily see what and how much is being wasted and, then, to identify what types of waste can be avoided. Segregation also separates waste to avoid contamination, making it easier for a business to either reuse wasted material in its operations or to sell the material for recycling.\nAt all times the key objective should be eliminating or reducing waste, especially high value waste materials. Actions a business could take to reduce waste include:\n- changes to operations or processes (see Ryan & McNulty case study)\n- improvements to how materials are inputted into process e.g. bulk loading systems (see plastic manufacturer Welvic Australia case study)\n- improvements to maintenance regimes, retooling or replacing equipment (see Mackay Industries and Devilee case studies)\n- better ‘nesting’ to reduce offcuts (see Pemara Printing case study)\n- reuse of waste material on site (see PACIA case study on Orica).\nFor unavoidable waste:\n- Look for opportunities to sell the material for recycling.\n- Review waste collection contracts. There is ‘no one size that fits all’ with waste contracts. Businesses should ensure that contracts suit the business’ needs, and there are significant savings that can be made.\n- For many businesses, especially retail, food and beverage industries, packaging can be a considerable cost. Business should look at reducing packaging or redesigning packaging to use fewer materials or so packaging can be reused. See Packaging for more ideas on how to reduce packaging waste.\nA resource assessment partly funded by Sustainability Victoria which reviewed the operations of clothing manufacturer Nobody Denim found that the real cost of disposed finished wasted garment was 425 times what the business was paying to dispose of it. Nobody Denim introduced changes to operations to reduce the amount of wasted ‘finished’ product. Read the Nobody Denim case study.\nA similar resource assessment of commercial printer Pemara Printing, found that the ratio of purchase price to disposal cost of its two key materials, ink and polypropylene plastic, was 70:1 and 55:1 respectively. Pemara introduced process changes including the optimising of layout of process. Read the Pemara case study.\nZero Waste SA's Waste Management and Reduction Guide for Retail Industry includes a number of case studies and sections on Identifying Waste Minimisation Opportunities (Section 4) and Marketing alternatives (economic advantages) (Section 6 ).\nThe USA EPA’s Business Guide for Reducing Solid Waste is a detailed guide providing step-by-step instructions designed to assist medium and large businesses to establish a waste reduction program. Key chapters include Getting Started and How to conduct a Waste Assessment. Overall emphasis is on avoidance and understanding the true cost of waste.\nThe Victorian EPA and Australian Industry Group have developed a step by step guide Developing a waste minimisation culture which summarises how to harness and enhance in-house knowledge.\nThe Australian Grape and Wine Authority’s publication The Lean Guide for the Australian Wine Industry discusses ways to better manage waste and to increase efficiency and productivity."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b9fe0b24-b937-40fa-8a49-f9fced313a5c>","<urn:uuid:16160651-06dd-4663-8bc6-e4c5cf0e683a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which farm experienced more significant financial challenges: Love Is Love Farm or Valley Dream Farm?","answer":"Valley Dream Farm faced more significant financial challenges. They had to sell their 90 head of registered Holsteins due to falling milk prices, forcing family members to work two or three jobs each to survive. They also dealt with family medical problems, including their son Jay's rare tumor that left him in a wheelchair. In contrast, Love Is Love Farm mainly faced initial capital challenges which they addressed through their CSA program that guaranteed year-round money for seeds, supplies, and household expenses.","context":["Planting yourself on the road to success requires a smart site and smart marketing.\nMany people are drawn to starting a small organic farm out of a desire to do good for the environment, promote healthy eating and lead a simpler life. However, farming is hard work and requires the same skills and commitment to succeed as any small business. Here are some tips to plant you on the road to making a living as the owner of a small organic farm.\n1. Find the Right Location for Your Organic Farm\nThe first step to a successful organic farm is finding land with fertile soil, good drainage, and access to sufficient good-quality water for irrigation, says Shane LaBrake, an organic agriculture consultant based in Accokeek, Maryland. If you plan to qualify for United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic certification, then it’s necessary to find land that has been free of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for at least three years.\nProspective farmers also should consider proximity to buyers, which often means urban centers around which land prices can be more expensive, LaBrake says. “People interested in organics generally are better educated, more affluent and concerned about the environment,” he adds.\nAtlanta-based Love Is Love Farm rents, rather than purchases, the land on which it farms. The farm launched at a more rural location in 2008, but moved in-town in 2011 to Gaia Gardens, which is owned by a 67-household homeowners association and is much closer to metro-area markets, says Joe Reynolds, who is co-owner with his wife, Judith Winfrey. Jem Farm, co-owned by John and Elizabeth Malaytar, is located in Rogersville, Tennessee, about a one-hour-and-15-minute drive between its two major markets in Knoxville and Johnson City.\n2. Get \"Certified Organic\" Status\nThe question of whether to certify comes down to whether you plan to use the term \"certified organic\" in your marketing, LaBrake says. If your gross annual sales are over $5,000 and you use the term \"organic\" versus \"natural\" or other language, your farm must be USDA-certified.\n\"Now when somebody at a farmer’s market\nasks me if a product is organic, I no\nlonger have to say it’s not certified,\nbut we do this and we do that,\" Reynolds\nsays. \"All I have to do is say 'yes.'\"\nLove is Love was not certified initially, but started being certified in 2011 because it was a requirement of the new landlord. While the record-keeping requirements are substantial, he finds it helps with sales. “Now when somebody at a farmer's market asks me if a product is organic, I no longer have to say it’s not certified, but we do this and we do that,” Reynolds says. \"All I have to do is say 'yes.'\"\nAny good farmer keeps extensive paperwork about fertilization, pesticide use, and other practices, so being organic is not necessarily much harder work in that aspect, Elizabeth Malaytar says. However, organization is key. She recommends a large filing cabinet as one of your first purchases. Farmers in some areas may face additional challenges because some states have fewer USDA-approved inspectors, she adds, noting that Tennessee currently only has one for the entire state.\n3. Begin Direct Marketing\nMost small organic farmers rely on direct marketing rather than selling to wholesalers or grocery store merchandisers. For example, Love Is Love farms a wide range of produce from arugula to sweet potatoes, which it sells at markets, to local restaurants and to members of its community-supported agriculture (CSA) program. Members subscribe to a CSA and receive a selection of seasonal produce twice a week. In the farm’s first few years when capital was a challenge, the CSA was especially important in guaranteeing the farm had money year-round to pay for seed, supplies and even household expenses, Reynolds says.\nJem Farm also produces a wide revolving variety of produce, as well as eggs, chicken, and pork. It has carved out a special niche by only farming heirloom and regional vegetables and herbs, ingredients for traditional Appalachian herbal medications and some woodland products. Jem makes most sales at markets, a small amount to restaurants, and recently started a CSA, but it also gets additional revenue by selling seeds to an heirloom seed company. \"Organic is a draw, but an even higher draw lately has been that we are able to say that we don’t feed our animals any GMO feed,\" Elizabeth Malaytar says.\n4. Seek a Mentor and Start Networking\nSome European countries have government programs to help organic farmers get started, but in the United States, there still are no comprehensive education programs for this growing niche, LaBrake says. One way to learn is to be mentored by an established organic farmer. Before launching Love is Love Farm, Reynolds worked at a certified organic farm, which allowed him not only to learn production techniques but also to observe the farmer’s certification process.\nLaBrake also recommends checking online and networking with other local farmers to find programs and trade groups in your area that provide education in both general farming skills and organic agriculture. Some examples include:\n- New England Small Farm Institute (NESFI)\n- Accokeek Foundation\n- Six-month ecological agriculture program at the University of California-Santa Clara\n(NESFI also offers a limited number of start-up plots on its 500-acre premises to beginning farmers.)","We love to share our farm, so please stop in and visit the greenhouse in the spring, the farm stand in the summer, or join us at one of our seasonal weekly meals so you can experience the fresh taste of our organic produce and enjoy the view, while learning about how we grow certified organic vegetables.\nWe believe a farm must be able to sustain the farmers to survive the challenges both in Agriculture and in our lives.\nWe are proud to be members of Deep Root Organic Co-Op. They market and ship our crops from Maine to Florida.\nIf you are interested in becoming an Intern with Valley Dream Farm, please visit our Farm Internship page.\nThe Tisbert Family:\nJoe, Anne, Jay, Becky, and Jon Tisbert,\nand Bella our friendly black lab\nA Little Tisbert Family History\nWe purchased the Farm in 1992 from Fred Trask and the American Farmland Trust. It was originally called “Sugar Bush Farm”, but the 90 acres of maple sugar trees were separated from the main farm and sold to our neighbors before our purchase, hence the need for a name change.\nWe began by milking 90 head of registered Holsteins, but falling milk prices forced us to sell the cows and find work off the farm. Working two or three jobs each, we played our own version of Survivor while trying to keep a family of six our first priority. Family medical problems compounded the struggle. Worst of all, a rare tumor initially robbed our 16-year-old son Jay of speech, sight and movement for months, and he remains in a wheelchair today. But we persevered. When Jay’s communication ability returned, as he went to college to study horticulture with Mom at his side.\nOur interest in organic farming started when we were offered a large quantity of chemicals to eradicate some serious weeds. We knew our water table and these harsh chemicals would eventually meet, so we declined the offer and ventured into the world of organic farming.\nAnne’s small scale business supplying vegetables to local restaurants rapidly expanded. The kids’ Organic Pumpkin Patch opened the door to our first wholesale shipment.\nJay graduated from VTC with a degree in Landscape and Horticultural design. He brought home all his knowledge of soils, plants, and greenhouses. Ashley has graduated with a Masters in Business and now works for Oracle. She is great with financial advise. Becky has graduated with a degree in Interior Design and is working at Bouchard Pierce in Essex and would help you design the kitchen of your dreams. She frequently assists at the farm. Jon works as manager at “Triple J’s” Bar-B-Q and pizza shop in Milton. His interests have varied over the years and we hope to have him work toward becoming one of our guest chefs. He and Becky live in the area and are found around the farm frequently helping with everything from hay rides to tossing bales of hay to sharing their farm background when dining with our guests at the weekly dinners. Joe loves being able to focus on our organic vegetable business. He is also very busy representing Vermont’s diverse agricultural farmers as the Vermont Farm Bureau President. In the winter he is often seen at the statehouse. The Farm to Table Dinners have taken off and are a very successful addition to our farm. Our guest continue to return year after year for a newly created meal which changes weekly with the diversity of our vegetables and the creative abilities of our wonderful guest Chefs each season. We are in the process of constructing a certified kitchen for our guest Chefs. It is such a unique agricultural experience and we enjoyed both our guests and our family life and farm work. We hope you can join us for an educational experience and a wonderful meal.

{"question":"Could you please explain what makes Bell's Invictus helicopter design different from Sikorsky's Raider X? I am curious about technical specifications.","answer":"Bell's Invictus is a conventional single-engine helicopter design and is the less complex of the two. Sikorsky's Raider X is a compound helicopter featuring a co-axial main rotor and pusher prop in the rear. While the Raider X is more complex, it's based on mature technology from their S-97 Raider, which has been flying since 2015.","context":["Bell And Sikorsky To Compete Head To Head To Make The Army's Future Armed Recon Helicopter\nThe Army wants to buy hundreds of examples of the winning design to fill the gap left by the early retirement of its OH-58D scout helicopters.\nThe U.S. Army has picked Bell's Invictus and Sikorsky's Raider X as the two prototype designs that will face off against each other under its Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program, or FARA. The two helicopters represent the most mature of the proposals that the service received and also stand at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of relative complexity.\nThe Army's Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team, which is managing FARA, announced that it had picked Bell and Sikorsky to proceed to the competitive prototype phase of the program on Mar. 25, 2020. The service is looking to fill a gap in its aviation capabilities left by the earlier retirement of its OH-58D Kiowa Warrior scout helicopters and it could ultimately replace nearly half of its AH-64 Apache attack helicopters with the winning FARA design.\n\"The selection of the Bell 360 Invictus to continue in the FARA program builds on our decades-long legacy as an innovator in reconnaissance rotorcraft supporting the maneuver force,\" Mitch Snyder, President and CEO of Bell, said in a statement. \"Our team has applied innovative thinking with tested technology to give the Army a low-risk option to fulfill its requirements on an aggressive schedule.\"\n\"We are honored the Army selected our game changing X2 Technology for Phase 2 of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Competitive Prototype (CP) program,\" Andy Adams, Vice President of Future Vertical Lift at Sikorsky, now part of Lockheed Martin, said in a separate statement. \"Through our mature S-97 RAIDER technology demonstrator, we continue to optimize our FARA solution, which will provide the Army with an integrated weapon system that combines speed, range, maneuverability, survivability and operational flexibility. This approach is driving down risk and will result in an aircraft solution that is capable of executing the Army’s joint all-domain operations.\"\nBell and Sikorsky beat out other offers from Boeing, a partnership between AVX Aircraft and L3, and from another team that included Karem Aircraft, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon. Airbus Helicopters had considered entering the competition and the Army had disqualified a proposal from MD Helicopters.\nBell's Invictus is a conventional single-engine helicopter design and was the least complex of the entrants. The company focused heavily on a low-cost, low-risk development strategy that leveraged work it had done on earlier helicopters, particularly on its Model 525 Relentless, including that helicopter's advanced fly-by-wire system. You can read more about Invictus in this past War Zone piece.\n\"To ensure the team stays on schedule and on budget, Bell is using a digital design-as-built process. The team is able to connect and collaborate in a real-time digital environment to ensure alignment among all trades to facilitate smoother manufacturing, improve sustainability characteristics, and mitigate schedule risks,\" Bell's statement added. \"This process has been used and refined on Bell commercial projects, as well as during the recent U.S. Army Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator program that produced the Bell V-280 Valor.\"\nSikorsky's offering is a compound helicopter design that features a co-axial main rotor and pusher prop in the rear. While it is more complex than Bell's Invictus, the Raider X design is also fairly mature, being derived from the existing S-97 Raider, examples of which have been flying since 2015. The S-97 was based on technology from the X2 compound helicopter demonstrator, which first flew in 2008.\nSikorsky had actually proposed the S-97 for the Army's abortive Armed Aerial Scout program, another effort to replace the OH-58D, which the service canceled in 2013. The S-97 and Raider X also share technology with the SB>1 Defiant, which Sikorsky developed with Boeing under the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstration (JMR-TD) program. You can read more about the S-97 and Defiant in this past War Zone story.\nEarlier this month, the Bell-Boeing team, as well as Sikorsky, received new contracts to continue work on their respective JMR-TD designs as a further lead-in risk-reduction effort to the separate Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) program. The Army is leading the FLRAA effort, which is primarily focused on finding a replacement for the UH-60 Black Hawk.\nFARA stands to be particularly lucrative for the company that wins the competition. The Army expects to acquire hundreds of the new helicopters to take the place AH-64 Apaches presently serving in its attack reconnaissance squadrons\nAt present, the Army hopes to have flying prototypes of both Invictus and Raider X ready to begin testing in the 2022 Fiscal Year. It then hopes to pick a winning design in the 2024 Fiscal Year.\nIf all goes to plan, the head-to-head competition between Bell and Sikorsky, which starts now, stands to significantly change the composition of the Army's armed helicopter fleets for years to come.\nContact the author: email@example.com\n- RELATEDNo, Bell's Invictus Armed Scout Helicopter Isn't Stealth But It Aims To Be Fast And CheapBell is pushing traditional helicopter design to its limits in an effort to offer the Army a capable, but low-risk and low-cost armed scout solution.READ NOW\n- RELATEDBehold Sikorsky's \"Raider X\" Future High-Speed Armed Reconnaissance HelicopterThe Army wants a survivable and fast \"knife fighter\" helicopter to fight in contested areas.

{"question":"I manage cybersecurity initiatives - which project has a larger user base to protect: the US federal government's identity management system or the Northern Great Plains ranching conservation program?","answer":"The US federal government's identity management system has a significantly larger user base, with over 2.7 million employees using thousands of secure applications. In comparison, the Ranch Systems and Viability Planning (RSVP) network in the Northern Great Plains focuses on ranchers who manage 70% of the remaining intact grasslands in Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota, which while substantial in terms of land area, involves a much smaller number of individual users to authenticate and manage.","context":["Strengthening Cybersecurity Through Improved Identity and Access Management\nIdentity, and Access Management strategies\nThe US Government is the largest employer in the United States with over 2.7 million employees using thousands of secure applications. Companies can gain valuable insight by learning about and participating in new Federal identity management policies and strategies. Improving cybersecurity through identity management modernization will help mitigate next generation threats for federal agencies and US companies.\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is proposing a new policy to improve Federal agencies’ implementation of Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) – the security disciplines that enable the right individual to access the right resource, at the right time, for the right reason.\nFederal agencies must be able to identify, credential, monitor, and manage user access to information and information systems across their enterprise in order to ensure secure and efficient operations. In particular, how agencies conduct identity proofing,establish digital identities, and adopt sound processes for authentication and access control will significantly impact the security of their digital services. Additionally, as information about individuals becomes more widely available through social media or through breaches of personally identifiable information (PII), it is increasingly important that all agencies adopt identity validation solutions that enhance privacy and mitigate negative impacts to delivery of digital services and maintenance of online trust. It is also essential that agencies’ Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) strategies and solutions are informed by risk perspectives and driven by targeted outcomes.\nImplementation of Effective Identity Management Governance\nEstablishing effective ICAM governance is an important part of the federal government’s continual efforts to promote robust cybersecurity. To ensure effective governance, agencies shall leverage the approaches and principles of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63, Digital Identity Guidelines. 2 Agencies shall also continue to follow Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12) requirements pertaining to the identity verification and credentialing of federal employees and contractors. To reach these goals, agencies shall:\n- Define and implement ICAM policies, processes, and technology solutions that encompass the agency’s entire enterprise, align with the government-wide Federal ICAM Enterprise Architecture, and meet Federal policies, standards, and guidelines;\n- Designate an integrated ICAM office, team, or other governance structure in support of its Enterprise Risk Management capability that includes personnel from the offices of the Chief Information Officer, Chief Security Officer, Human Resources, General Counsel, Senior Agency Official for Privacy, and component organizations that manage ICAM programs and capabilities. These offices, as well as program managers and acquisition offices, should regularly coordinate to ensure that the agency’s ICAM policies, processes, and technologies are being implemented, maintained and managed consistently. This includes coordinating the deployment of capabilities and functionality provided through the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) Program;\n- Outline enterprise-level performance expectations for cybersecurity and privacy risk management throughout each user’s lifecycle, including changes in the user’s access privileges;\n- Develop a mechanism to streamline and automate enterprise-level performance reporting. This mechanism should align with existing and planned reporting and analytics structures and tools, such as the CDM dashboards and FISMA reporting;\n- Incorporate Digital Identity Risk Management into existing processes as outlined in NIST SP 800-63, including the selection of Identity Assurance Levels (IALs), Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs), and Federation Assurance Levels (FALs) commensurate with the risk to their digital service offerings.\nModernization of Identity Management Capabilities\nIt is imperative that agencies implement and harmonize their ICAM capabilities, while ensuring that ICAM solutions are not fragmented or duplicative. To achieve this objective, agencies shall take the following steps to modernize their ICAM architecture:\nReduce Solution Overlap: Agencies shall establish authoritative solutions for their ICAM services, promoting the most effective solutions at an enterprise level.\nPromote Innovation through Modularity: Agencies shall ensure that deployed ICAM capabilities are interchangeable and developed based on open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and/or commercial standards to promote interoperability and enable componentized development.\nTo read more about this policy please visit the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer policy announcement.

Responding to this challenge, today the Walmart Foundation, Cargill and McDonald’s are investing over $6 million in an initiative led by World Wildlife Fund that aims to make lasting improvements to the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains.\nThe new program, known as the Ranch Systems and Viability Planning (RSVP) network, will support ranchers across the ecoregion—focusing primarily on Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota—with technical expertise, training and tools to help advance grazing practices that improve the health of the land. By improving management of one million acres over five years and avoiding conversion, this effort will result in increased carbon storage and sequestration, improved water infiltration and better outcomes for biodiversity.\n“Collaborative efforts like this can accelerate innovative, sustainable solutions and support ranchers in the beef supply chain,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, EVP and chief sustainability officer for Walmart and president of the Walmart Foundation. “Sustainable grazing practices that improve soil health, absorb carbon and reduce water consumption can help to protect the land and people who depend on it.”\nThis program supports the Walmart Foundation’s focus to bring more sustainable, regenerative practices to the beef industry. The Foundation aims to build connections that can accelerate systems change and form communities of practice with grantees and leaders to share learnings, advance best practices, foster collaboration and scale collective impact. Investing in conservation activities in the Northern Great Plains supports the stewards of those lands and contributes to climate resilience efforts.\nAs ranchers continue to adapt their plans to improve conservation and economic outcomes, and share peer-to-peer learning, through the RSVP network, WWF will work with ranchers on private and tribal lands to provide extension services in one-on-one and group workshops, offer ongoing technical expertise and provide cost share and monitoring to help ranchers design, document and implement ranch plans.\n“Ranchers are the most important stewards of the grasslands of the Northern Great Plains. As managers of over 70% of the remaining intact grasslands within this region, they hold the keys to its future,” said Martha Kauffman, managing director of WWF’s Northern Great Plains program. “The RSVP network will support ranching partners in planning and improving the resiliency of their operations, so they continue to provide habitat for wildlife, store carbon, filter clean water, produce nutritious food and support communities for generations to come.”\nThis partnership also supports McDonald’s ambition to use its scale and many relationships from the farm to the restaurant to help significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and evolve the food system for a resilient and sustainable future. As the first restaurant company in the world to set an approved science-based target on climate action, McDonald’s is partnering across the supply chain to employ a diverse set of strategies, which scale-up action across the industry.\n“I’m proud of McDonald’s investment in programs like the Ranch Systems and Viability Planning network. These partnerships bring producers, suppliers, NGOs and brands to the table to drive the widespread adoption of more sustainable and regenerative practices that reduce emissions, mitigate climate change and support livelihoods,” said Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s EVP, Chief Supply Chain and Sustainability Officer. “This innovative work is an important step toward scaling climate solutions across the supply chain, building resiliency and achieving McDonald’s science-based climate target to significantly reduce emissions across our offices, restaurants and supply chain by 2030.”\nThe project is also part of Cargill’s BeefUp Sustainability initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout the company’s beef supply chain by 30 percent by 2030, measured on a per pound of beef basis against a 2017 baseline. Earlier this year, Cargill launched two other programs to support this goal, including a grassland restoration effort and an initiative to implement proven soil health practices in cattle feed.\n“We believe beef cattle can be a force for good, and one of the ways we can address some of our shared challenges by preserving wildlife and drawing down carbon, said Heather Tansey, sustainability lead for Cargill’s protein and animal nutrition and health businesses. “This initiative is a testament to that. I’m inspired by the efforts of ranchers who live this belief each day, and grateful for our partners who join us lending scale, resources and experience to advance realistic solutions that address climate change.”\nThe Northern Great Plains ecoregion, which comprises approximately 25 percent of the total area of the Great Plains of North America, remains largely intact, thanks in part to its harsh climate, which has made agricultural expansion relatively difficult until recent decades. In fact, the NGP still supports 1,595 species of plants, which provide habitat for 300 species of birds, 95 species of mammals and 28 species of reptiles. The Missouri and South Saskatchewan Rivers, in addition to smaller prairie streams, riparian, and wetlands habitats, provide habitat for 13 species of amphibians and 121 species of fish. The remaining healthy ecosystems within this region are maintained largely by hardworking ranching communities. Grasslands have evolved to be grazed, and cattle grazing, when managed well, can deliver many conservation benefits, including healthy grasslands, improved soil, and the preservation of key habitats.\nAbout World Wildlife Fund (WWF)\nWWF is one of the world’s leading conservation organizations, working in nearly 100 countries for over half a century to help people and nature thrive.

{"question":"How do exposition techniques compare between case studies and traditional storytelling?","answer":"Exposition techniques in case studies and traditional storytelling serve similar purposes but are implemented differently. In storytelling, exposition is part of the plot structure and can be delivered through various methods like character dialogue, letters from the past, setting descriptions, or character thoughts. It provides background information gradually to avoid overwhelming readers, as too much exposition can slow down the story. In case studies, exposition is primarily delivered through the Time Context section at the beginning, which directly states when events occurred and can include supporting details explaining what happened during that period. For example, a case study might explicitly state 'The incident happened in June 2019' and then elaborate on key events, while a story would weave this information naturally throughout the narrative.","context":["An impressive case study clearly describes the important facts and details about the issue it analyzes. One of these details that must be considered is the time period when this issue happened. This is specified in the portion of the case study called the Time Context, or “Konteksto ng Panahon” in Filipino.\nWriting the Time Context of the case study requires careful analysis and decision-making, making it quite challenging for some students. For this reason, this article provides a comprehensive guide on how to write this portion and some examples that you may use as a reference.\nTable of Contents\n- What Is Time Context in a Case Study?\n- Why Should I Write the Time Context of My Case Study?\n- How To Write Time Context in a Case Study\n- Examples of Time Context in a Case Study\n- Tips and Warnings\nWhat Is Time Context in a Case Study?\nThe Time Context, which is located at the beginning of the case study, tells the reader the time during which the problem of the study occurred. In other words, it indicates the “scope” of your analysis in terms of the time period.\nThis is analogous to the “setting” of a short story. The setting of a story tells you when it happened. If you imagine your case study as a short story, the time context is its “setting.”\nWhy Should I Write the Time Context of My Case Study?\nThis portion allows your readers to determine exactly the problem you are referring to by indicating a vital detail: the time when it happened.\nSuppose that your study’s problem revolves around the decline in annual sales of a certain firm. If the firm experienced a decline in sales in different periods, the readers will have a hard time figuring out which one you’re referring to (e.g., are you referring to the year the sales declined in 2008, 2010, or 2020?) By indicating the time context, this ambiguity is resolved.\nFurthermore, this portion makes your analysis more focused by indicating the specific period where your analysis is bounded. For instance, If your time context is only the first quarter of 2020, then you are not expected to analyze the events that happened or factors that emerged during the periods beyond or even before your selected time context.\nHow To Write Time Context in a Case Study\nNow that you have an idea of the time context, it’s time to write it. Follow the steps below to learn how to write one.\n1. Identify When the Problem of Your Case Study Arose\nResearch the history of your case study’s subject (i.e., the firm/organization) to help you identify the time when its problem arose. This “time” can be a year (e.g., 2020), a month (December 2020), a quarter (Q2 of 2020), or a day (December 1, 2020).\n2. Specify the Exact Period That You Are Going To Analyze\nAfter you figure out the time when the problem of the firm or organization emerged, think about how long the problem continued to persist. The period from the date the problem arose to the date it was resolved is the time context of your study.\nSuppose the firm’s sales started to decline during the first quarter of 2008. If this problem was resolved eventually in the last quarter of 2008, then the time context of your case study is the year 2008.\nIf the problem of your case study is happening in the present, then the time context of your case study is the current year. It implies that your analysis will revolve around the current year’s events.\n3. Explain Your Indicated Time Frame\nOnce you have figured out your case study’s time context, you may now indicate it in your manuscript. You may add supporting details by explaining what happened during that period.\nMost case studies explicitly indicate the time period in this portion without including any explanation. Although the justification for your selected time context is optional, it is advisable to show one to make this portion more comprehensive.\nExamples of Time Context in a Case Study\nCase Study Topic: An analysis of how Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) handled massive public criticism during the “Toweljoy” incident wherein one of their customers received an improperly prepared fried chicken that violated the Food Safety Act.\nTime Context: The incident happened in June 2019. JFC responded by temporarily closing for three days the branch where the incident occurred and releasing an official statement acknowledging the issue. The incident became a trending topic days after it happened.\nThe example above provides a clear timeframe that indicates the coverage of the analysis, which is an event that took place in June 2019. Furthermore, it elaborates the indicated time context by briefly describing what happened during that period.\nCase Study Topic: Xelon Pastries struggles to accommodate a large volume of orders due to the holiday season. The management believes that the current number of staff and supplies are insufficient to meet the increase in demand. Failure to meet the overwhelming customer demand might lead to a loss of profit opportunities.\nTime Context: Xelon Pastries has to accommodate a notable 15% increase in daily orders in December 2015. It is expected that the volume of orders will further increase as the Christmas season approaches.\nNote how the example above provides a specific date during which the business faced the problem (i.e., December 2015). This implies that the analysis will be limited only to the said time period. In other words, the large volume of orders during other “holiday seasons” (e.g., December 2014) and the firm’s condition during the said periods will not be considered in the analysis.\nCase Study Topic: Netflix Inc. is struggling to keep up with the increasing market competition after it lost an estimated 200,000 subscribers and experienced a decrease in its market value with a decline in shares of 35%.\nTime Context: The first quarter of 2022 is a negative turning point for Netflix Inc. as it struggles with a declining subscriber level due to a variety of reasons, including an increase in “pay-to-watch” platforms and the company’s exit from the Russian market because of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict.\nTips and Warnings\n1. Ensure the Time Context is clear and not too broad\nFor instance, indicating that your Case Study’s Time Context is “the present year” is too broad since readers have no clue whether you’re referring to the year they are reading your case study or the year when it was published. So, it is better to make it more specific such as “the year 2017”. Furthermore, if you think the problem only occurred in a particular period of that year, make it more specific by indicating the quarter or the month (e.g., Q1 of 2017, August 2017).\n2. Creating a timeline is optional\nYou may also present your case study’s Time Context using a timeline. A timeline lists important events throughout the problem’s duration. It’s a sequence of events that happened between the date the problem emerged up to the date it was solved (or present date).\nTo make a timeline, state the date (or span of periods) when a specific event happened. This event must be relevant to your case study’s problem. Afterward, provide a brief description of what happened during that period. Do this approach for every “sub-events” of your timeline.\nNote that using a timeline is optional but you can use it to make this part more detailed.\nHere is an example of a case study that presents its Time Context using a timeline:\nCase Study Topic: Despite Netflix being the world’s leading streaming platform, it experienced slow revenue growth in early 2022 because of the following:\n- The increasing saturation of the “pay-for-view” market\n- Ukrainian-Russian conflict\n- Stagnant subscriber growth\n- Easing pandemic restrictions\nTime Context of the Case Study:\nJanuary 2022 – Investors are cautious of the slow growth of Netflix Inc. leading to a tail-off of about $45 billion in market value and 20% in shares.\nJanuary – March 2022 – Netflix Inc. lost an estimated 200,000 subscribers and a decline of 6.4% in its Quarter I net profit.\nMarch 06 – 07, 2022 – Netflix Inc. halted its operations in Russia. This is a response to the worsening crisis due to the Ukrainian-Russian conflict. This leads to a loss of about 700,000 paid subscribers in the region.\nApril 19, 2022 – Netflix Inc. released a note to its shareholders. It states some factors that contribute to its stagnant revenue growth. These include the following:\n- 100 million unpaid subscribers that enjoy shared household accounts\n- Increasing market competition\n- Macroeconomic factors including slow economic growth and rising inflation.\nApril – May 2022 – Netflix’s competitors HBO (and HBO Max) recorded an increase of 3 million subscribers. Meanwhile, Disney Plus garnered more than 7.9 million subscribers. These happened shortly after Netflix lost a significant number of subscribers.\nMay 17, 2022 – 150 US-based Netflix employees were laid off as a cost-cutting solution to the company’s decline in revenues.","What Are the Key Elements of a Story?All Posts\nWritten by Ashley Crowe\nProdigy English is here! Start playing — and learning — today.\n- Teaching Tools\n- Prodigy English\nThere are five key elements to every story: plot, setting, characters, point of view, and conflict. Whether your students realize it or not, they naturally include all these elements when they’re telling a story to their families or their best fr. It’s what creates the story’s flow, builds anticipation, and excites their listeners.\nWe can all be great storytellers. It’s in our nature to enjoy a good story and feel compelled to share our own. But when students sit down at their keyboards, or start to put pen to paper, it’s easy to freeze up. Why is writing something down so much harder than chatting up a friend?\nGood news — it doesn’t have to be! Encourage your students to take some time before you start writing to figure out their five key story elements. Need some help and direction? Read on for all the details they need to brainstorm the parts of their stories. With this newfound clarity, it’s easy to write a tale their whole class will love. Let’s get started!\nThe plot is the events or actions that drive your story — it describes the “what” of your tale. The plot lets the reader know what’s happening, describes the problems your characters are trying to solve, and gives the details on how they attempt to solve them.\nA strong, compelling plot is essential to any story. But that doesn’t mean it needs to be full of Michael Bay-type action. You don’t need crazy car chases or epic battles to construct an exciting plot. Strong emotions can also drive your story and give your characters plenty to talk about.\nHowever, your story does need several clearly defined plot elements to help you structure your tale’s events and keep the story moving forward.\nElements of Plot\nTo keep your reader engaged and interested, your story should include these plot elements: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Let’s explore each one.\nExposition gives the reader the background info they need to jump right into your story’s world. This is often found towards the beginning of your story. Even if you choose to jump right into the action, somewhere along the way your reader needs to get a crash course on your characters’ or setting’s history.\nExposition can be given in a variety of ways. Some examples include:\n- Character dialogue\n- Letters from the past\n- Setting or character descriptions\n- Point of View (aka POV, such as the narrator or main character’s thoughts)\nBut, as spoken by Officer Lockstock in the Tony award-winning Urinetown: The Musical, “nothin’ can kill a show like too much exposition.” This rings true whether you’re watching a play or reading a story. Don’t overload the reader with background info right out of the gate. Keep it natural and let it drive the story forward rather than stalling it while everyone catches up.\nLook to great worldbuilding novels, such as Lord of the Rings or Hunger Games, for excellent examples of setting the stage. These worlds were built from the ground up, but as a reader, it never feels labored. Find the common ground between your story’s world and the reader’s and work from there, cluing them into the big differences as you go.\nThe rising action is the moments in your story that lead up to the climax — choices your main characters have made and the events happening that are at odds with your characters’ goals. This is where your story builds and your reader begins to invest in your characters.\nThis is likely going to be the longest section of your story. A whole lot happens between the start of the novel and that moment, but often you’ll find yourself holding your breath and waiting to see what will happen. That is the power of rising action.\nThis is it — the primary turning point and what your story has been building towards. What are your main characters going to do? Will they succeed or fail?\nTypical climaxes include victories or defeats. The main goal of the climax is to resolve the conflict, but whether that positively or negatively affects your character is up to you. Or maybe it’s not that simple.\nNow that the main conflict is resolved, it’s time to begin wrapping everything up. The falling action is a great time to tie up any loose ends while also giving your characters a chance to deal with the aftermath of the climax.\nIt’s time to end your tale! If you still have unanswered questions in your plot, answer them now. The resolution is also the time to show the next step in your characters’ lives. Do they live happily ever after? Is a new era dawning? Or do they just continue on with their ordinary existence with a new experience under their belt?\nThe resolution of one story can also be the start of another. You can introduce a new conflict or raise more questions for your reader. Wrap it up, then begin again!\nThe setting of your story is both the physical location and point in time in which your plot takes place. For some stories (like the fantasy novels mentioned above) setting is a huge part of the story. You can build a whole new world with its own languages and creatures. In this case, the setting almost acts as its own character in your tale.\nBut, you don’t have to go all immersive like Tolkien to create a strong setting in your story. What best serves your main themes? Modern day New York or civil rights era Mississippi? Victorian England or Jersey in the 80s? There are so many places you can travel to, and so many interesting times to draw from. Choose your favorite (or multiple favorites if your characters have a time machine 😉) and dig in.\nThe characters are the people, animals, beings, or personified objects driving your story. A story can have many characters or just one main character as the focus. Going back to our example, The Hunger Games focuses on Katniss, but there are many supporting characters that play a major role in her story: Haymitch, Peeta, Gale, Rue, Primrose, and many, many more. On the other hand, Edgar Allen Poe’s poem “The Raven” has only three: the narrator, Lenore, and the raven. But that’s plenty for an exciting tale.\nYour story’s characters should be compelling. Whether good or evil, you need your reader to invest and care about their journey. So, what kind of characters does your story need?\nKinds of Characters\nThere are many different kinds of characters, but most stories include these two common types:\nThe protagonist is typically the ‘good guy’ in your story — the one the reader is rooting for. This main character is super important and central to your plot. They are often trying to overcome the conflict while finding themselves at odds with our next character type.\nThe antagonist of your story doesn’t have to be a single person. It can be any character, group, or force that is at odds with your protagonist. This doesn’t mean they have to be ‘evil’ or the ‘bad guy’, but the antagonist is often pushing the conflict onto our protagonist.\nLooking for a fun example? Check out the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz. She’s a classic antagonist in the original story. But in the musical Wicked, we’re told her background tale and she’s transformed into a protagonist the audience can’t help but love. That is the power of a good story!\n4. Point of view\nWhat changed in our two stories above about the Wicked Witch of the West? The point of view! Point of view (or POV) describes the lens through which the story is being told.\nIn The Wizard of Oz, the Wicked Witch is at odds with our protagonist Dorothy and her quest to return home. However, in Wicked, we get to see the green witch as a young woman going through the typical struggles of friendship and young love. And that is a whole other story.\nTypes of Point of View\nThe POV you choose can help shape your entire story. There are several different POVs to consider, but the most common are first person, second person, and third person.\nFirst Person Point of View\nA story told in the first person is most often told from the point of view of the protagonist. Our protagonist narrator will speak using first person pronouns (I, we, me, etc). And as the reader, we are privy to their innermost thoughts and feelings.\nThis is a great way to pull a reader into the story, and a very strong bond can be formed between the reader and the narrator. Our previous example, The Hunger Games, was told with a first person POV. As a reader, we never knew more than Katniss did about what was happening, leading to some great surprises and reveals as the story continued to unfold throughout the three book series.\nSecond Person Point of View\nYou won’t see second person used very often in literature, but it is an important POV to keep in mind. In the second person, the reader is addressed directly and may even become a character of sorts in your story. This point of view is written using second person pronouns (you, your, etc).\nThough you can find some books written in second person, most often you will see this writing in your digital reading, such as ads and blog posts — why, hello there!\nThird Person Point of View\nThird person POV is by far the most common point of view in fiction writing. In this kind of story, the reader is a bystander, observing the actions of the characters as told by an ‘outside narrator’. This POV used third person pronouns (he, she, they, etc). But how much we learn as a reader depends on which style of narrator you choose.\nThird Person Omniscient\nA third person omniscient narrator knows everything going down in the story. As a reader, we can learn the inside thoughts and feelings of all the main characters. The story unfolds in front of us, and we get to experience it through a variety of character lenses.\nThird Person Limited\nIn this POV, our narrator has access to only one character’s inside thoughts and feelings. As the reader, we typically follow this one character as our main character, learning only what they know and seeing the world through their eyes and experiences.\nThe conflict is the big problem of the story. What is your main character trying to overcome? That is the conflict.\nConflict comes in many different forms, but will almost always involve an antagonist of sorts. There can be one major conflict in your story, or your characters may encounter several throughout the tale. But more than likely there is one big theme driving the major conflict. So, what does that look like?\nTypes of Conflict\nThere are different types of conflicts you may choose to use, but the most common are character vs self, character vs character, character vs nature, and character vs society.\nCharacter vs Self\nIn this type of conflict, your main character must overcome something within themselves to achieve their goal. These internal conflicts may look like a doubt, fear, or grudge. It’s whatever is holding them back from their desires.\nThe Lord of the Rings provides a great example of character vs self with Aragorn. He is destined to be king, but his own doubts have taken him away from that path. One of the major plots of the story is Aragorn realizing that he is capable and worthy of this leadership role.\nCharacter vs Character\nIn a character vs character conflict, someone is standing in our protagonist’s way. This is a very common conflict type in superhero tales. There’s a ‘bad guy’ our main characters must defeat before the story ends.\nCharacter vs Nature\nCharacter vs nature conflicts pit our characters against some kind of natural force. It could be a natural disaster (tornado, hurricane, wildfire, avalanche) or any other kind of survival tale. Many post-apocalyptic stories involve both character vs nature and character vs character conflicts.\nAnother example of character vs nature is when our characters are battling forces of nature, such as in The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. In this heartbreaking story, two teens are fighting cancer diagnoses — a force of nature they have no control over. After falling in love, they are then left to battle time and death — two other powerful forces of nature.\nCharacter vs Society\nIn our final conflict type, characters are battling oppressive societal norms. In character vs society, our protagonist feels like they are at odds with the whole world. This can often be broken down into character vs character to get a strong emotional pull (such as a kid at odd with their parents) but the themes are much bigger than any one person.\nThe importance of incorporating these elements into your story\nWhen you’re helping students write their story, keep these elements in mind or encourage students to use them to outline their stories and major themes. Including these five elements will give their stories direction, structure, and a great flow, keeping their readers flipping those pages long into the night.\nNow, what are you waiting for?

{"question":"Which better preserves brain structure: meditation practice or Antarctic isolation?","answer":"Meditation practice better preserves and enhances brain structure compared to Antarctic isolation. Regular meditation induces positive changes, growing the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus, while improving memory and attention. In contrast, Antarctic isolation causes adverse effects on brain structure, specifically shrinking the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus and reducing BDNF levels, which negatively impacts spatial thinking and memory formation.","context":["Updated: Jul 26, 2021\nMeeting Your States of Consciousness\nPart II: Contemplation\nWe all need sleep, and for good reason—but all wish we could have that time back in our (conscious) life. Is there another state of consciousness that enhances our learning ability, balances our emotions, and repairs our body? If sleep is work, how about a career change?\nContemplation and Meditation\nContemplation; from the Latin contemplari, “to observe,” and meditation; from meditari, “to reflect” – together, they inform a mental practice which is distinct from ordinary thinking but is not exclusive from it. Contemplation and meditation are the meta-training for the mind: I wouldn’t meditate on a calculus problem but meditation, like sleep, makes learning and calculus an easier quest.\nBy endeavor, diligence, discipline, and self-mastery, let the wise man make (of himself) an island that no flood can overwhelm\n(Dhammapada, ‘sayings of the Buddha,’ Verse 25)\nContemplation and meditation—let’s just say, contempla-meditation—is taught in some form in every religion as a foundational practice for well-being. Brain scans and blood samples can never show the ineffable, inner experience of contempla-meditation, but we do have some grasp on how contempla-meditation transforms the mind. Contempla-meditation, like sleep, can take place in stages; in fact, being meta-training, these contempla-meditative stages correspond with certain cognitive modes:While I write this article, I am in “effortful processing” mode. I sustain my attention on the ultimate objective of synthesizing research on contempla-meditation, and I adjust my approach (and expectations) as I progress. Effortful processing can be trained by “controlled focus,” a contempla-meditation stage wherein the practitioner ruminates upon a selection of information. Catholicism teaches lectio divina, “sacred reading,” where the practitioner reads a passage of Scripture slowly and thoroughly and then hypothesizes its meaning by connecting the passage to other texts, by imagining one’s self in the scene described, by searching for subtext, and so on. Buddhism encourages similar practices, as in the famous lotus flower sermon: Gautama pulled a lotus up by its roots from a pond and held it aloft. His students gazed on the flower until one, Mahakasyapa, smiled—having understood the message of the lotus. Controlled focus elicits the same fast brain waves, gamma and beta (13-50 Hz), which signify effortful processing.\nRecall and reorganization of information without explicit problem-solving, or, planning, can be trained by open monitoring, where the practitioner permits their attention to wander around their sensory environment, their memories, or any experience at all. The practitioner engages with none of those thoughts. Lectio divina, Hindu Vedanta, Daoist Qigong, Zen Buddhism—most traditions encourage that controlled focus gives way to open monitoring.\nOpen monitoring, like planning, elicits theta brain waves (4-7 Hz), especially from the prefrontal cortex.\nWhen it seems that the mind ceases even to wander, the practitioner enters “self-transcendence.” The brain is still active: powerful alpha waves (8-12 Hz) surge throughout the default mode network (DMN). In waking life, large-amplitude alpha waves (10-12 Hz) suppress task-irrelevant processing and create an index or ‘ready’ state so that the brain can enter the other cognitive modes, and smaller alpha waves (8-10 Hz) signify mental imagery—usually, of the external world. In contempla-meditation, the focus shifts inward—effectively, the mind maps itself. DMN regions govern autobiographical reflection, including this mind-mapping, as well as theory of mind—our concept of how others think. Mental imagery filtered through this biographical-autobiographical scheme may explain the profound yet consistent perceptions of cosmic unity and interconnectedness which characterize self-transcendence.\nConsistent discipline in contempla-meditation induces progressive systemic changes in the form and function of the brain. A few months of practice grow the hippocampus, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia. Working memory and attentional capacity increase, and anxiety and fatigue markedly decrease when handling new tasks. Old memories are also sent back to the hippocampus and reconsolidated just as in sleep with help from the caudate nucleus, working from the striatum of the basal ganglia. The caudate nucleus flexibly assesses goal-directed behavior and recommends new plans to the executive regions of the brain—especially those which govern problem-solving, verbal reasoning, empathy, and sociability. Bolstering these three structures also lays the groundwork for the long-term impact of contempla-meditation.\nOver months to years, continued practice realigns the brain with the priorities set by the caudate nucleus. Additional growth occurs in brain regions governing metacognition and self-regulation, such as the left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Growth of the somatosensory cortices improves tactile acuity; coupled with improved processing in the insula, practitioners are able to consciously separate the emotional and sensory qualities of pain. Temporal lobe growth enhances visual imagery; with somatosensory improvements, this may augment spatial reasoning. So, whether you are a scholar, a student athlete, or a creative type—or all three—contempla-meditation can benefit you.\nThe hippocampus remains critical for the reassessment of old behaviors, and growth of the hippocampus, especially in glucocorticoid receptor density, further promotes emotional resilience and adaptability.\nStructural decreases are really only seen in specific nodes of the default mode network which are redundant in function to other nodes which increase in thickness. For example, the posterior cingulate cortex decreases, while the medial prefrontal cortex increases; both drive autobiographical recall and future planning, especially in regard to other people. Default mode network activity imbalanced in either direction results in mental dysfunction: hyperconnectivity correlates with depressive rumination, while hypoconnectivity correlates with avoidant patterns of attachment and autism.\nSo, all this sounds exciting—but will we have time for it? Can contempla-meditation replace the need for sleep?\nPartly. Total sleep deprivation will hurt contempla-meditation as much as it would hurt any form of learning, but up to three hours of sleep can be replaced by an equal time in contempla-meditation by experienced practitioners with no sacrifice in vigilance the next day. It’s equivalent to conventional sleep therapies like paradoxical intention and scheduled exercise. See, the brain activity elicited during contempla-meditation resembles the brain during sleep:\nWaking and dreaming (REM, rapid eye movement)) brain activity generate beta and gamma waves like in controlled focus, and intermediate NREM (memory consolidation) generates theta waves like in open monitoring. In fact, the augmented activity entrained during contempla-meditation redounds directly to the sleeping brain—and reappears.\nUsing an electroencephalographic map of the scalp, we can see differences between experienced meditators and novices emerge around the anterolateral regions of the cerebral cortex. The activity sites are consistent with the left rostrolateral and medial prefrontal cortices, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the middle temporal gyrus (which subsumes the hippocampus)—some of the cortical structures which develop most with long-term contempla-meditative practice. There could be a reciprocal relationship here: replicating the waking waves during sleep increases efficiency, and the efficient signaling during sleep assists the cortical growth.\nContempla-meditation cannot replace the deep delta-wave sleep, during which the body and brain repair themselves and clear out metabolic waste—but it’s clear that sleep and contempla-meditation are natural partners in creating a healthy, effective mind.\nWake up, go about the day, sleep, repeat—no more. Contempla-meditation serves as a perfect transition between waking and resting, adding a sense of calm and thoughtfulness to the day—and to ourselves!\nBasso, J., McHale, A., Ende, V., Oberlin, D., & Suzuki, W.

The researchers found changes to the dentate gyrus, an area of the hippocampus responsible for spatial thinking and memory. Results from their study have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\nSetting off on an Antarctic expedition to Neumayer-Station III, a German Antarctic research station run by the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), means having to face temperatures as low as -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit) and almost complete darkness during the winter months. Life at the research station offers little in the way of privacy or personal space. Contact with the outside world is minimal, and cutting one’s stay short is not an option – at least not during the long winter months. Emergency evacuation and deliveries of food and equipment are only possible during the relatively short summer. “This scenario offers us the opportunity to study the ways in which exposure to extreme conditions affect the human brain,” says study lead Dr. Alexander Stahn of Charité’s Institute of Physiology and Assistant Professor in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Working alongside Prof. Dr. Simone Kühn (Group Leader of the Lise Meitner Group for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development), and supported by the AWI, Dr. Stahn set out to determine whether or not an Antarctic expedition produces changes to the structure and function of the human brain.\nFive men and four women volunteered to participate in the study. They spent a total of 14 months at the Antarctic research station, nine of which were spent in isolation from the outside world. Before, during and after their mission, the participants completed a set of computer-based cognitive tests. These included evaluations of concentration, memory, cognitive reaction time and spatial thinking. Regular blood tests were carried out to measure levels of a specific growth factor known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein responsible for promoting the growth of nerve cells and synapses in the brain. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to determine brain structure in each of the participants before and after their mission. They did so in order to record changes in brain volume, paying particular attention to the hippocampus, a structure located deep inside the brain. “For this, we used a high-resolution methodology which makes it possible to take precise measurements of individual areas of the hippocampus,” says Prof. Kühn. A group of nine control participants underwent identical tests.\nMeasurements taken after the end of the exhibition revealed that the dentate gyrus, an area of the hippocampus with an important role in spatial thinking and memory formation, was smaller in members of the expedition team than in controls. These changes were also associated with a decrease in BDNF levels. After only three months in the Antarctic, levels of the growth factor had decreased to levels below those recorded prior to the start of the expedition and had not returned to normal one-and-a-half months after the expedition. Cognition tests showed effects on both spatial abilities and the so-called selective attention, which is necessary to ignore irrelevant information. Repeated testing is normally associated with improvements in test results. This learning effect, however, was reduced in participants whose dentate gyrus had decreased in volume, the reduction proportional to the extent of the volume lost.\n“Given the small number of participants, the results of our study should be viewed with caution,” explains Dr. Stahn, adding: “They do, however, provide important information, namely – and this is supported by initial findings in mice – that extreme environmental conditions can have an adverse effect on the brain and, in particular, the production of new nerve cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.” As a next step, the researchers plan to study whether or not physical exercise might be able to counteract the observed changes in the brain.\nArticle adapted from a Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin news release.\nPublication: Brain changes in response to long-duration Antarctic expeditions.

{"question":"Could you explain how Wilson's disease affects both the liver and brain, and what visible symptoms appear in the eyes?","answer":"Wilson's disease impacts the liver by causing damage to hepatocytes through copper accumulation, leading to symptoms like vomiting, weakness, fluid build-up in the abdomen, and jaundice. In the brain, copper accumulates in astrocytes, particularly affecting the brainstem and basal ganglia, resulting in symptoms like tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, mood changes, anxiety, and psychosis. A distinctive eye-related symptom is the Kayser-Fleischer rings, which appear as dark brown, golden, or reddish-green rings around the cornea, occurring in about 66% of cases, particularly in those with neurological symptoms. These rings form due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane, along with possible sunflower cataracts shown by brown or green pigmentation of the eye's membrane.","context":["Editorial, J Liver Disease Transplant Vol: 9 Issue: 3\nEditorial Note on Wilson’s disease\nDepartment of Pharmacy, St. Peters Institute of Pharmacy, Hyderabad, India\n*Corresponding Author: Anusha Polampelli\nMaster of Pharmacy, St. Peters Institute of Pharmacy, Warangal, India\nTel: +91 7386325335\nE-mail: [email protected]\nReceived: July 23, 2020 Accepted: July 28, 2020 Published: August 03, 2020\nCitation: Mallela S (2020) Editorial Note on Wilson’s disease.

Symptoms are generally associated with the brain and liver. Liver-related symptoms embrace emesis, weakness, fluid build-up within the abdomen, swelling of the legs, xanthous skin and cutaneous sensation. Brain-related symptoms embrace tremors, muscle stiffness, hassle speaking, temperament changes, anxiety, and mental disease. Wilson’s unwellness is caused by a mutation within the Wilson disease super molecule (ATP7B) factor. This super molecule transports excess copper into gall, wherever it is excreted in waste merchandise. The\ncondition is chromosome recessive; for an individual to be affected, they need to inherit a mutated copy of the factor from each folk. diagnosing could also be troublesome and infrequently involves a mix of blood tests, weewee tests and a liver diagnostic assay. Genetic testing could also be accustomed screen members of the family of these affected. Wilson’s disease is often treated with dietary changes and drugs. Dietary changes involve ingestion a low-copper diet and not victimization copper kitchen utensil. Medications used embrace chelating agents like trientine and d-penicillamine and metal supplements. Complications of hereditary disease will embrace liver failure, carcinoma, and urinary organ issues. A liver transplant could also be useful in those in whom different treatments\ndo not seem to be effective or if liver failure happens. Wilson’s disease happens in concerning one in thirty,000 people. Symptoms sometimes begin between the ages of five and 35 years. it had been 1st delineated in 1854 by German medical specialist Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs and is known as once British medical specialist Samuel Wilson. Signs and symptoms the main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently disease and medicine symptoms are the most options that cause diagnosing. individuals with liver issues tend to return to medical attention earlier, usually as youngsters or teenagers, than\nthose with medicine and medical specialty symptoms, WHO tend to bein their twenties or older.

She has expertise in the therapeutic areas of orthopedics, neurology, chronic pain, gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and rare diseases especially Ehlers Danlos Syndrome.\nWilson disease is a rare, autosomal recessive, inherited disorder that affects copper metabolism, leading to the excessive accumulation of copper in the body’s tissues, especially the liver, brain, and eyes.1\nGenetics of Wilson Disease\nHomozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ATP7B gene result in the development of Wilson disease.2 ATP7B encodes a P-type, cation, transmembrane, copper-transporting ATPase protein. Normally, this ATPase functions by using energy obtained from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport copper through hepatic cell membranes and secrete excess copper into the biliary system. ATPase also loads ceruloplasmin with copper.2-4\nMutations in the ATP7B gene result in the production of a dysfunctional ATPase that cannot sufficiently remove copper from the liver in bile, leading to excessive copper deposition within the liver, brain, and other body tissues.3\nWilson disease can be inherited when both parents carry an abnormal copy of the ATP7B gene. A child has a 25% chance of inheriting abnormal copies of this gene from both parents.1\nOver 600 genetic variations in the ATP7B gene have been identified. The most frequent ATP7B pathogenic variants involve single-nucleotide missense and nonsense mutations followed by insertions or deletions. Splice-site mutations are the most uncommon.2\nThe most common genetic variation causing Wilson disease in white individuals results in a histidine-to-glutamate substitution at the amino acid 1069 (p.H1069Q), which changes the orientation of the ATPase catalytic binding site for ATP, impairing ATP hydrolysis.2,5,6 Researchers have demonstrated that ATP7B mutations that cause substitutions of histidine at the amino acid 1069 for alanine, cysteine, or glutamine all directly impair ATP-dependent phosphorylation.6\nPathogenesis of Wilson Disease\nHumans ingest approximately 1.5 to 2.5 mg of dietary copper per day. Approximately 50% to 75% of dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and intestines, especially the duodenum, and is transported via circulating albumin to hepatocytes for regulation and excretion.2,5 Copper is an important component for metabolic enzymes such as lysyl oxidase, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c oxidase, and dopamine beta-hydroxylase. In the liver, copper is incorporated into these metabolic enzymes and loaded onto copper-binding proteins, including ceruloplasmin.5\nCeruloplasmin is a serum ferroxidase that transports copper from the liver through the circulatory system to other tissues in the body that require copper for normal functioning.7 ATPase sequesters 6 copper molecules in the trans-Golgi network, packaging them into apoceruloplasmin and secreting this into the bloodstream.2\nATPase transmembrane proteins sequester the excess copper remaining in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes into vesicles and secretes these vesicles by transporting them across the apical canalicular membrane into the biliary system—the main route for copper excretion to achieve normal copper balance in the body.2,5\nPatients with Wilson disease have impaired copper excretion via the biliary system and impaired incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin.5\nExcess copper accumulation within the liver causes damage to the hepatocytes secondary to free radical formation, resulting in lipid and protein oxidation. Signs of hepatic disease such as steatosis, hepatitis, liver fibrosis, and acute liver failure are often the initial manifestations of Wilson disease.3\nExcess copper accumulation is toxic, resulting in oxidative stress, gene expression modification, protein inhibition, and mitochondrial impairment.3 As copper gradually accumulates and reaches certain levels in the liver, copper levels in the bloodstream also eventually increase, allowing copper deposition to occur throughout other organ systems, such as the brain and the cornea of the eyes.1,5,8\nCopper accumulates in astrocytes in the brain, disrupting the blood-brain barrier and leading to neuronal and oligodendrocyte injury, particularly in the brainstem and basal ganglia, which are the most susceptible to copper toxicity. Damage to these brain regions results in symptoms indicative of movement and psychiatric disorders.3\nKayser-Fleischer rings are dark greenish or brownish rings surrounding the irises of the eyes that form secondary to copper deposition within Descemet’s membrane and are often indicative of liver diseases. Most patients with neurological involvement due to Wilson disease also exhibit Kayser-Fleischer rings.9\n- Wilson disease. National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD).

{"question":"I have chronic kidney disease and I'm curious about how nephrons function in healthy kidneys versus what lifestyle changes I should make to protect my remaining kidney function. Could you explain both aspects?","answer":"Nephrons are the functional units of kidneys, consisting of glomerulus and renal tubules. In healthy kidneys, they filter blood through three layers (endothelium, basement membrane, and epithelium) and process it in three steps: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and secretion. The proximal convoluted tubules reabsorb 70-80% of electrolytes and water, while the collecting duct concentrates urine and maintains ionic balance. To protect remaining kidney function with CKD, you should take prescribed blood pressure medicines (especially ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) daily, maintain healthy blood sugar if diabetic, follow dietary modifications as recommended, and avoid NSAIDs like ibuprofen and naproxen. These lifestyle changes can help slow disease progression.","context":["Table of contents\n- Excretory organs in variety of organisms\n- Human excretory system\n- Urine formation\n- Function of the tubules\n- Regulation of kidney function\nPlants and animals produce harmful substances formed due to metabolic reactions which must be removed from the body. It includes, urea, uric acid, ammonia, carbon-dioxide, water, ions etc. the 3 most important nitrogenous waste that should be removed from the body are urea, uric acid and ammonia. Out of these, ammonia is most toxic. Animals excreting ammonia as nitrogenous waste are known as Ammonotelic, such as most bony fishes, most aquatic amphibians etc. The excretion of ammonia occurs via diffusion. The organisms which excrete urea as nitrogenous waste, they are known as ureotelic. For Example, Mammals, Amphibians etc. are ureotelic. Those organisms which excrete uric acid as nitrogenous waste, they are known as Uricotelic. For Example, Birds, Reptiles, Snails etc.\n- Amoeba and Paramecium have contractile vacuole for excretion.\n- Sponges have canal system for excretion.\n- Hydra have coelenteron.\n- Platyhelminthes have flame cells for excretion.\n- Annelids have nephridia for excretion.\n- Prawns have green glands for excretion.\n- Insects have malpighian tubules for excretion.\n- Scorpions have Coxal glands for excretion.\nHuman excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra. Kidneys are bean shaped structure located in the abdominal cavity. Towards the center of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum. Ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter through hilum. Inner to the hilum is a funnel-shaped space known as Renal Pelvis with projections known as Calyces. Kidney is divided into two zones known as - Outer Cortex and Inner Medulla. The medulla is divided into conical masses known as Medullary Pyramids. Extension of renal cortex which separates the pyramids is known as column of Bertini.\nThe structural and functional unit of kidney are nephrons. Each nephron is made up of two parts- glomerulus and renal tubule.\nGlomerulus is the cluster of capillaries. The blood enters the glomerulus via afferent arteriole and leaves the glomerulus via efferent arteriole. Glomerulus is enclosed in a cup- shaped structure known as Bowman’s Capsule. Bowman’s capsule together with glomerulus is known as Malpighian body or renal corpuscles.\nFig. 2. Structure of the nephrons\nThe tubule continues to form a highly coiled structure known as Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT). The next part of the tubule is Henle’s loop which consists of ascending and descending limb. The ascending limb continues to form Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT). The DCT opens into collecting duct.\nThere are two types of nephrons- cortical nephrons and medullary nephrons. When loop of Henle is short and extends only little to medulla are known as Cortical Nephrons. When loop of Henle is long and extends into the medulla are known as Medullary Nephrons.\nIt involves three main steps- glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and secretion.\nGlomerular Filtration- During this process blood enter the glomerulus via afferent arteriole. Water and nitrogenous waste move into the glomerulus and blood cells, proteins exit the glomerulus through efferent arteriole. On an average, kidney filters about 1100 ml to 1200 ml of blood per minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood through 3 layers- endothelium that surround the glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane in between these two layers. The epithelial cells present in the Bowman’s capsule are known as Podocytes which are arranged in an intricate manner to leave some minute spaces called Filtration Slits or Slit Pores.\nThe amount of filtrate produced by the kidneys per minute is known as Glomerular Filtration Rate.\nFig. 3. Steps of urine formation\nTubular reabsorption- it involves the absorption of required molecules or ions such as sodium ions, glucose, amino acids etc. Some of the substances are absorbed actively and some are absorbed passively. Glucose, amino acids are absorbed actively whereas water is absorbed passively.\nThe last step of urine formation is secretion. Potassium ions, hydrogen ions, ammonia are secreted out to maintain the ionic and acid balance of the body fluids.\nProximal Convoluted Tubules (PCT) is lined by cuboidal brush border epithelium. 70-80% of electrolytes and water are reabsorbed in PCT. Secretion of hydrogen ions, potassium ions, ammonium ions also occurs into the filtrate.\nHenle’s loop, very less reabsorption occurs in ascending limb. It is impermeable to water, but permeable to electrolyte. Descending limb absorbs most of the water, making the filtrate concentrated. Descending limb is almost impermeable to electrolyte.\nFig. 4. Function of the tubules\nDistal convoluted tubule, reabsorption of water, bicarbonate ions and sodium ions occurs. Secretion of potassium ions and hydrogen ions to maintain the electrolyte balance of the fluid.\nCollecting duct, reabsorbs large amount of water to make the urine concentrated. Secretion of hydrogen ions and potassium ions also takes place in collecting duct. It maintains the ionic balance and pH of blood.\nKidney function is regulated by hypothalamus, Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA) and heart. Changes in the blood volume, ionic balance activates the osmoreceptors in the body. This stimulates the hypothalamus to release Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH), also known as Vasopressin. This helps in the reabsorption of water from the tubules and prevents diuresis. This increase the blood volume and switch off the osmoreceptors for negative feedback mechanism.\nThe JGA is activated during fall in glomerular blood pressure. Juxtaglomerular cells release the renin which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I which gets further converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, so it increases the glomerular blood pressure. Angiotensin II also acts on adrenal cortex to release aldosterone to increase sodium ion and water reabsorption from the distal tubules. This mechanism is known as Renin-Angiotensin Mechanism.\nFig. 5. Regulation of kidney function by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\nHeart release Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF) which causes vasodilation to decrease the blood pressure. It acts as a negative feedback mechanism for renin-angiotensin mechanism.\nUrine formed in the nephrons is carried to the urinary bladder where it is stored until voluntary signal is given by the central nervous system. When urinary bladder is stretched, it gets filled with the urine. Stretch receptors present on the walls of the urinary bladder sends signal to the central nervous system. CNS initiates the contraction of the smooth muscles of the bladder allowing relaxation of urethral sphincter to release urine. This process of release of urine is known as Micturition. An adult human excretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 liters of urine per day. The urine formed is a light yellow colored watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0) and has a characteristic odor.\nWatch this Video for more reference","CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE\nWhat is chronic kidney disease?\nChronic kidney disease is when the kidneys stop working as well as they should. When they are working normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water.\nIn people with chronic kidney disease, the kidneys slowly lose the ability to filter the blood. In time, the kidneys can stop working completely. That is why it is so important to keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse.\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic kidney disease?\nAt first, chronic kidney disease causes no symptoms. As the disease gets worse, it can:\nMake your feet, ankles, or legs swell (doctors call this \"edema\")\nGive you high blood pressure\nMake you very tired\nDamage your bones\nIs there anything I can do to keep my kidneys from getting worse if I have chronic kidney disease?\nYes, you can protect your kidneys by:\nTaking blood pressure and other medicines every day, if your doctor or nurse prescribes them to you.\nKeeping your blood sugar in a healthy range, if you have diabetes.\nChanging your diet, if your doctor or nurse says you should.\nAvoiding medicines known as \"nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,\" or NSAIDs. These medicines include ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve). Check with your doctor, nurse, or kidney specialist before starting any new medicines—even over-the-counter ones.\nWhat are the treatments for chronic kidney disease?\nPeople in the early stages of chronic kidney disease can take medicines to keep the disease from getting worse. For example, many people with chronic kidney disease should take medicines known as \"ACE inhibitors\" or \"angiotensin receptor blockers.\" If your doctor or nurse prescribes these medicines, it is very important that you take them every day as directed. If they cause side effects or cost too much, speak to your doctor or nurse about it. He or she might have solutions to offer.\nWhat happens if my kidneys stop working completely?\nIf your kidneys stop working completely, you can choose between 3 different treatments to take over the job of your kidneys. Your choices are described below.\nYou can have kidney transplant surgery. That way, the new kidney can do the job of your own kidneys. If you have a kidney transplant, you will need to take medicines for the rest of your life to keep your body from reacting badly to the new kidney. (You only need 1 kidney to live.)\nYou can have your blood filtered by a machine. This treatment is called \"hemodialysis,\" but many people call it just \"dialysis.\" If you choose this approach, you will need to be hooked up to the machine at least 3 times a week for a few hours for the rest of your life. Before you start, you will also need to have surgery to prepare a blood vessel for attachment to the machine.\nYou can learn to use a special fluid that has to be piped in and out of your belly every day. This treatment is called \"peritoneal dialysis.\" If you choose this type of dialysis, you will need surgery to have a tube implanted in your belly. Then you will have to learn how to pipe the fluid in and out through that tube.\nHow do I choose between the different treatment options?\nYou and your doctor will need to work together to find a treatment that's right for you. Kidney transplant surgery is usually the best option for most people. But often there are no kidneys available for transplant.\nAsk your doctor to explain all of your options and how they might work for you. Then talk openly with him or her about how you feel about all of the options. You might even decide that you do not want any treatment. That is your choice.\nNEW PATIENT REGISTRATION\nThe American Heart Association recommends a diet based on DASH. Learn More //\nA healthy lifestyle is key to a long life.

{"question":"How does the sugar content of wine grapes at harvest compare to the productivity levels needed for economic viability in semiarid vineyards?","answer":"Wine grapes at harvest typically contain about 260 grams of sugar per liter (24 Brix), which is needed to achieve 13-14% alcohol content in wine. In terms of economic viability in semiarid conditions, vineyards need to maintain yield ranges between 8100-9000 kg/ha and water use efficiency between 9-10 kg/m3 to achieve a viable balance between productivity and quality. Below these levels (specifically with WUE under 9 kg/m3 and yields under 8128 kg/ha), production becomes economically unfeasible at current grape prices of 0.326 €/kg, despite potentially producing higher quality grapes.","context":["Wine Grapes and Grape-y Wines\n© Donald A. Dibbern, Jr.\nAs I was biting into a juicy, aromatic Muscat grape at a recent Wine & Spirit Education Trust tasting, it occurred to me that wine lovers don't often have the opportunity to taste the grapes tht go into our favorite wines. When was the last time you tasted a ripe Chardonnay grape, or a Pinot Noir grape?\nPerhaps surprisingly, most wine-grape varieties aren't normally used as table grapes, and vice-versa. This is primarily because wine grapes and table grapes are selected on the basis of different characteristics.\nThe ideal table grape should be easy to eat out of hand without making a mess, so fruit growers choose table varieties with thin skins and either no apparent seeds or only tiny, edible seeds. In grapes destined for wine, however, much of the flavor and tannins and virtually all of the color comes from the skin. (Many wine enthusiasts don't realize that, with rare exceptions, the juice of black, purple and red grapes is \"white\" or clear.) So, for wine, thick-skinned grapes are desirable because they produce robust, flavorful, tannic and long-lived wines. Seeds are left behind in the \"pomace\" of pressed grape skins, stems and seeds after the grapes have been pressed. This isn't much of a problem, although wine makers know that the grapes must be pressed gently, not roughly, as breaking the seeds will release bitter oils into the wine, a bad thing.\nThe ratio of sweet, juicy pulp to inedible matter in the grape is economically significant as well. The Asian Red Globe variety, for instance, is popular as a table grape because it is large. A small, dense berry may seem like more trouble than it is worth to eat, but it's ideal for making rich complex wines, as the juice macerates the skins, extracting and soaking in the flavors.\nIndeed, if the grapes are too large, winemakers sometimes must even \"bleed\" fermentation vats of some of their juice - a process called saignée - to increase the ratio of skin to juice. This can happen, for example, if there are heavy rains at harvest and the berries are swollen and waterlogged.\nA few grape varieties, notably the Muscat I mentioned - can do quite nicely as either a table grape or a wine grape. In this case, the decision may be simply economic, depending on the local market and prices offered for table grapes, raisins or wine grapes.\nSo, what do wine grapes taste like? This brings to mind a startlingly brazen scene from the movie Mondovino, in which the filmmaker's camera caught a tourist apparently casually snacking on grapes right off the vine at Domaine de la Romanee-Conti without permission.\nNot surprisingly, perhaps, wine grapes rarely taste exactly like the wines they make, since you don't generally eat the skins of these varieties. While volunteering at local wineries here in Oregon, I have had the opportunity to taste ripe Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes at harvest and crush. I found both quite delicious, intensely sweet and much juicier than the usual Thompson Seedless (Sultana) table grapes. They did not, however, necessarily show the characteristic green-apple flavors of Chardonnay wine or the red fruit flavors - cherries, raspberries, plums - commonplace in Pinot Noir wine.\nMuscat does indeed taste \"grapey,\" and Concord, the Vitis labrusca native grape variety that's widely grown in the Eastern U.S. and Canada, has a pronounced candied grape-jelly flavor in both the grape and the wine. The term \"foxy\" is often used for labrusca variety wines, confusingly not referring to an animal scent, nor used as a slang term of approval, but to this characteristic aroma and flavor of grape juice or jelly. Apparently this term comes from the common name for these wild American vines as the \"fox grape,\" which itself possibly derives from Aesop's famous fable of the Fox and the Grapes. And we won't even discuss the fact that Vitis vulpina is known as the \"frost grape,\" instead of the fox grape, despite vulpina being Latin for vixen.\nWhy do ripe wine grapes taste so sweet? Simply put, sugar is a virtue in wine grapes, because it takes sugar to produce alcohol. Wine brapes are usually picked around \"24 Brix\" at harvest, to use a technical term, which translates to sugar content of about 260 grams per liter (roughly 24 percent). If the wine is fermented to dryness - converting all the sugar to alcohol so no sweetness remains in the finished wine - this result in a final alcohol level of 13 to 14 percent. Before it ferments, though, this juice is seriously sweet. In comparison, Welch's 100 percent Concord grape juice contains 40 grams of sugar per 8-ounce (240 ml) serving. This translates to about 165 grams per liter, only about half as sweet as the juice of unfermented wine grapes at harvest.\nWine, of course, can be made from any grape (and from most fruit juices) simply by the action of yeast fermenting the sugar to alcohol. Even Thompson Seedless (Sultana) grapes are used to make wine, primarily as a neutral and relatively inexpensive \"filler\" for inexpensive jug wines.\nSome wines are even made from dried grapes - essentially raisins. Wines of this type, including the Italian Amarone, Recioto and Vin Santo and the French vins de paille. Wines of this type often carry intense, \"cooked\" raisin flavors into the resulting wine. Indeed, at least in the novelty realm, things come full circle with fine wine grapes like Chardonnay and Pinot Noir occasionally turning up in fancy, upscale and expensive jams and jellies!\nI hope this topic has given you food for thought, the next time you sit down to a glass of your favorite grape beverage.\n© copyright 2007 by Donald A.

One of the main necessary measures of adaptation of the vineyards in these areas will be the irrigation and the implementation of water-saving irrigation strategies and technologies to save water and to improve WUE (water use eﬃciency). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the long-term economic viability/proﬁtability of diﬀerent deﬁcit irrigation techniques such as regulated deﬁcit irrigation (RDI) and partial root-zone irrigation (PRI) with low water volume/fertilizer applied in a Monastrell vineyard in Southeastern of Spain to plants grafted on different rootstocks and to assess the productive, social and economic efficiency in these semiarid conditions. Through a cost/benefit analysis, socioeconomic and environmental criteria for the selection of optimal deficit irrigation strategies and tolerant/water use efficient rootstocks for the vineyards in arid environments are proposed.\nThe grapevines (Vitis vinifera L., var. Monastrell, syn. Mourvedre, a local red wine variety) were 20+ years old and were grafted on five different comercial rootstocks, each with a different vigor and drought tolerance: 140Ru, 1103P, 41B, 161-49C and 110R (Figure 1). Each rootstock was drip irrigated for six consecutive years (2012 -2017) using two diﬀerent deﬁcit irrigation techniques: Regulated Deﬁcit Irrigation (RDI) and Partial Root zone drying Irrigation (PRI). All combinations were irrigated with similar annual water volumes and application of the same designed deﬁcit irrigation strategy (Table 1).\nThe economic and eﬃciency indices such as Net margin/Total cost (MN/C) (%), Net margin/operating cost (NM/c) (%), NM/investment (NM/K) (%), break-even point (kg ha−1), WUE (kg m−3), water productivity (€ m−3), and economic eﬃciency (€ m−3) were signiﬁcantly higher in 140Ru compared to the other rootstocks, and the lowest (negative values for NM/C,NM/c, NM/K, and economic eﬃciency; not viable economically) for 161-49C, while other rootstocks showed intermediate positive values of these economic/eﬃciency indexes (Table 2). In relation to the social importance of the crop, the results indicate that the most vigorous and productive rootstock (140Ru) generated more employment (0.16 UTA/ha) and social eﬃciency (AWU hm−3) and had a signiﬁcantly higher WVT (water viability threshold) (2.16 € m−3) (water price in which income and costs are equal) compared to the other rootstocks, due to an increased labor requirement and cost of pruning and harvesting. In contrast, less productive rootstocks (16149C and 110R) generated less employment and signiﬁcantly lower social eﬃciency and WVT (Table 2).\nOur analysis also shows a clear conﬂict between productivity and quality in wine grape production. Productive and economic indices, such as yield, productive WUE (kg m−3), economic eﬃciency (€ m−3), break-even point (kg ha−1), and water productivity (€m−3), were inversely related with berry quality. Besides, the relationships between WUEyield, production costs, and QIoverall berry indicate that in the current wine market conditions, maximum productive eﬃciency is closely related to low productive costs and QIoverall berry (Figure 5). In contrast, maximum berry quality is closely related to lower WUEyield and higher production costs (Figure 5).\nThe analysis shows that in the very high WUEyield range, between 10 and 25 kg m−3, production costs are quite low, even below the current average price, due to very high productivity, making this option very proﬁtable economically overall in high vigor and productive rootstocks such as 140Ru. In contrast, with lower WUEyield, (between 5−10 kg m−3), production costs start to increase sharply in an exponential way, whilst also increasing progressively the berry quality in a linear way (Figure 5). Below 5–6 kg m−3, production costs increase a lot, with little eﬀect on berry quality. In these conditions, the rapid increase in production costs due to very low productivity makes this option economically unfeasible. In this situation, it will be diﬃcult to implement optimized deﬁcit irrigation strategies and a sustainable irrigation water use, and the pressure on water resources will increase in semiarid areas. According to this analysis, maximum QIoverall berry (≥12) was reached at a WUEyield of around 7.3 Kg m−3 (161-49C), which supposes a low yield, around 7256 kg ha−1 year−1, similar to the yield range obtained with 161-49C PRI, and within the yield range allowed by O.D. Bullas. Unfortunately, with the current low grape price in this area (0.326 € kg−1), this maximum quality option is unfeasible economically. In this situation, everything that supposes a production cost higher than the current grape price is not viable economically. According to our results, this corresponds with a WUEyield < 9 kg m−3 and a yield < 8128 kg ha−1. Thus, to maintain low production costs and high berry quality, the analysis aims for yield ranges between 8100 and 9000 kg ha-1, thus not exceeding the range allowed for D.O. Bullas wines (yield range 7500–9000 kg ha−1), and WUEyield between 9 and 10 kg m−3), which, with the current price of the grapes, could be a good compromise between productivity, quality, and returns for the growers.\nPublic policies should encourage vine growers to invest in producing high-quality local variety grapes as a diﬀerentiating character, as well as to develop agronomic practices that are environmentally and socially sustainable, by the grapes more adjusted to their real quality and production costs. Only in this way we can implement agronomic measures such as optimized low-input DI (deﬁcit irrigation) techniques and the use of eﬃcient rootstocks to improve WUE and grape quality in semiarid regions in a context of climate change and water-limiting conditions.\nPascual Romero, Biologist, PhD.

{"question":"I've observed that many animals appear blue in nature. How do the blue poison dart frog and the Linckia laevigata sea star differ in their methods of producing their distinctive blue coloration?","answer":"The blue poison dart frog and the Linckia laevigata sea star use entirely different mechanisms to produce their blue coloration. The frog's blue color comes from structural effects in its skin - it has a layer of cells called iridophores that scatter blue light, combined with reduced yellow pigment-producing cells (xanthophores). In contrast, the Linckia laevigata sea star is one of the rare animals that produces blue through actual pigmentation - it creates a specific carotenoprotein called linckiacyanin, which is composed of multiple carotenoids that give it its blue color.","context":["Most animal species in the world have developed some sort of natural camouflage that helps them find food and avoid attack. The specific nature of this camouflage varies considerably from species to species.\nThere are several factors that determine what sort of camouflage a species develops:\n- Camouflage develops differently depending on the physiology and behavior of an animal. For example, an animal with fur will develop a different sort of camouflage than an animal with scales, and an animal that swims in large schools underwater will develop different camouflage than one that swings alone through the trees.\n- An animal's environment is often the most important factor in what the camouflage looks like. The simplest camouflage technique is for an animal to match the \"background\" of its surroundings. In this case, the various elements of the natural habitat may be referred to as the model for the camouflage.\n- Since the ultimate goal of camouflage is to hide from other animals, the physiology and behavior of an animal's predators or prey is highly significant. An animal will not develop any camouflage that does not help it survive, so not all animals blend in with their environment the same way. For example, there's no point in an animal replicating the color of its surroundings if its main predator is color-blind.\nFor most animals, \"blending in\" is the most effective approach. You can see this sort of camouflage everywhere. Deer, squirrels, hedgehogs and many other animals have brownish, \"earth tone\" colors that match the brown of the trees and soil at the forest ground level. Sharks, dolphins and many other sea creatures have a grayish-blue coloring, which helps them blend in with the soft light underwater.\nThere are two ways in which animals produce different colors.\n- Biochromes, which are microscopic, natural pigments in an animal's body, produce colors chemically. Their chemical makeup is such that they absorb some colors of light and reflect others. The apparent color of a pigment is a combination of all the visible wavelengths of light that are reflected by that pigment.\n- Animals may also produce colors via microscopic physical structures. Essentially, these structures act like prisms, refracting and scattering visible light so that a certain combination of colors are reflected. Polar bears, for example, actually have black skin but appear white because they have translucent hairs. When light shines on the hairs, each hair bends it a little bit. This bounces the light around so that some of it makes it to the surface of the skin and the rest of it is deflected back out, producing white coloration. In some animals, the two types of coloration are combined. For example, reptiles, amphibians and fish with green coloration typically have a layer of skin with yellow pigment and a layer of skin that scatters light to reflect a blue color. Combined, these layers of skin produce green. To learn more about coloration and light, check out How Light Works.\nBoth physical and chemical coloration is determined genetically; they are passed on from parent to offspring. A species develops camouflage coloration gradually, through the process of natural selection. In the wild, an individual animal that more closely matches its surroundings is more likely to be overlooked by predators, and so lives longer. Consequently, the animal that matches its surroundings is more likely to produce offspring than an animal that does not match. The camouflager's offspring will likely inherit the same coloration, and they will also live long enough to pass it on. In this way, the species as a whole develops ideal coloration for survival in their environment.\nThe means of coloration depends on an animal's physiology. In most mammals, the camouflage coloration is in the fur, since this is the outermost layer of the body. In reptiles, amphibians and fish, it is in the scales; in birds it is in the feathers; and in insects it is part of the exoskeleton. The actual structure of the outer covering may also evolve to create better camouflage. In squirrels, for example, the fur is fairly rough and uneven, so it resembles the texture of tree bark. Many insects have a shell that replicates the smooth texture of leaves.\nCamouflaging coloration is very common in nature -- you see it to some degree in the majority of species. But it is much less common for an animal to be able to change its coloration to match a changing environment. In the next section, we'll look at a few of the animals that use this sort of adaptive camouflage.","Animals Wildlife 12 Elusively Blue Animals: The Rarest Critters of All Most creatures cannot make blue pigments, but there are a few exceptions. By Catie Leary Catie Leary Writer and Photographer Georgia State University Catie Leary writes and curates visual stories about science, animals, the arts, travel, and the natural world. Learn about our editorial process Updated September 7, 2022 Share Twitter Pinterest Email Suzanna Ruby / Getty Images Animals Wildlife Pets Animal Rights Endangered Species Blue is the most popular color in the world, with a plurality of people picking blue as their favorite color when surveyed. However, blue is also one of the rarest occurring pigments found in nature. Sure, the sky and the ocean are blue, but while there are an abundance of green, yellow, and red animals, almost no blue animals exist. The main reason why blue is so elusive is because of the relatively narrow range of pigments that cause coloration in animals. Some colors are common among animals due to those animals' abilities to either produce pigments of those colors or absorb them from the food they eat. For example, melanin is one of the most common pigments produced by animals and is responsible for the brown or black colors of most mammals' hair or fur and some birds' feathers. Meanwhile, red and orange pigments are produced by carotenoids in plants and algae, which are then consumed by animals like shrimp and lobsters, giving them their distinct pink and red colors. Flamingos also gain their pink coloration from carotenoids found in the shrimp that they eat. While some plants can produce blue pigments thanks to anthocyanins, most creatures in the animal kingdom are unable to make blue pigments. Any instances of blue coloration in animals are typically the result of structural effects, such as iridescence and selective reflection. 1 of 12 Blue Jay Kevin Pihlaja / Getty Images The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) produces melanin, a black pigment, meaning that its feathers should appear black. However, tiny air sacs in the bird's feathers scatter light, making them appear blue to our eyes. This scattering of light within the blue jay's feathers is very similar to Rayleigh scattering, the phenomenon responsible for the answer to the age-old \"why is the sky blue?\" question. Thus, since the distinctive blue color of the blue jay's feathers is not caused by pigments, it is possible to change the color of the bird's feathers back to black by altering their structure. In fact, damaged blue jay feathers do appear black as all traces of blue disappear when the light scattering is disrupted. 2 of 12 Blue Iguana Flavio Vallenari / Getty Images The blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi), endemic to the island of Grand Cayman, has one of the longest lifespans of any lizard, living up to 69 years. When the lizards are born, they are intricately patterned but barely blue, with only some parts of their bodies maintaining a pale blueish-gray color. As they mature, they become bluer in color. However, mature lizards have the ability to change color and usually make themselves gray in order to blend in with the rocks that are found throughout their habitat. A blue iguana will only make itself blue when it comes in contact with other members of its species either to communicate with them or to establish its territory. Males of the species also tend to have a more pronounced blue color than females do. 3 of 12 Glaucus atlanticus S.Rohrlach / Getty Images Glaucus atlanticus is a bizarre-looking species of nudibranch, and just like many other nudibranchs, it is notable for its bright coloration. The species floats upside down in the water and feeds on the dangerous Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis), which is infamous for its venomous stingers that can kill fish and sometimes even humans. The blue color of Glaucus atlanticus serves as a form of camouflage, allowing the sea slug to blend in with the blue of the ocean and making it difficult for predators like seabirds flying over the water to spot it. If its blue coloration wasn't protection enough, this sea slug is also able to absorb the stingers from the man o' war that it eats and use them itself either for defense or to hunt its prey. 6 Fascinating Facts About Blue Dragons 4 of 12 Mandarin Dragonet fenkieandreas / Getty Images The mandarin dragonet (Synchiropus splendidus) is a brightly-colored fish from the Pacific Ocean that is one of only two vertebrates whose blue coloration is a result of cellular pigment rather than structural coloration. The only other vertebrate with blue cellular pigment is the picturesque dragonet (Synchiropus picturatus) from the same genus. The mandarin dragonet's skin contains cells known as cyanophores that contain organelles called cyanosomes that produce blue pigments. The cyanophores are not the only pigment-producing cells in the fish's skin, however, which explains the orange stripes that decorate their bodies. Due to their bright, colorful patterns, mandarin dragonets are popular fish for aquariums. 5 of 12 Blue Poison Dart Frog ferdinando valverde / Getty Images The blue poison dart frog (Dendrobates tinctorius \"azureus\") is found in the forests of southern Suriname and northern Brazil in South America. The frog's blue coloration warns predators that it is poisonous, a phenomenon known as aposematism, and is caused by the structure of its skin cells. Frog skin has a layer of cells called xanthophores, which produce yellow pigments and rest on top of a layer of cells called iridophores. When light hits a frog's skin, it passes through the layer of xanthophores to the layer of iridophores, which then scatter the blue light back through the xanthophores. Since the xanthophores produce yellow pigments, the yellow mixes with the blue light scattered by the iridophores, making frogs appear green. However, the blue poison dart frog has reduced xanthophores, meaning that almost no yellow pigment is produced in its skin. Thus, the blue light scattered by the iridophores never mixes with yellow pigment, making the frog appear blue. 6 of 12 Blue Morpho PATSTOCK / Getty Images Butterflies in the genus Morpho, commonly called blue morphos, are notable for their beautiful blue wings. The butterfly's blue coloration is caused by the structure of its wings, which contain microscopic scales that have ridges shaped like Christmas trees with alternating thin layers known as lamellae. The nanostructure of these scales scatter the light that strikes the butterfly's wings, making them appear blue. Since these structures are only present on the dorsal side of a blue morpho's wings, the ventral side of the butterfly's wings are actually brown. Furthermore, for many species of morphos, males tend to be more blue than females, and for several species, only the male butterflies are blue while the females are brown or yellow. 7 of 12 Sinai Agama Christoph Dieterle / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 4.0 The Sinai agama (Pseudotrapelus sinaitus) is a species of lizard that is found in deserts throughout the Middle East. The lizard's skin is usually brown, allowing it to blend in with its environment. However, males become bright blue in color during the lizard's breeding season in an effort to attract females, making the Sinai agama one of only a few blue reptiles. During this time, females remain brown but may also have some red markings on their sides. 8 of 12 Linckia laevigata Marnie Griffiths / Getty Images Linckia laevigata is a species of sea star that is found throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. The sea star is notable for its blue coloration, which ranges from a light blue to a dark blue depending on the individual. Occasionally, individuals may be other colors as well, such as orange or pink. Linckia laevigata is one of the few blue animals whose coloration is caused by a pigment rather than by structural coloration. The species produces a carotenoprotein known as linckiacyanin, which is made up of multiple different carotenoids, giving the sea star its distinctive blue color. 9 of 12 Carpathian Blue Slug Bogdan Khmelnytskyi / Getty Images The Carpathian blue slug (Bielzia coerulans) is found in the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe. While the species is best known for its dark blue coloration, the slug is not always blue. As juveniles, these slugs are actually yellow-brown in color. As they mature, they become blue, and adults range in color from bluish-green to fully blue or even black. 10 of 12 Indian Peafowl Richard I'Anson / Getty Images The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is an iconic bird endemic to the Indian subcontinent that is famous for its intricate, brightly colored feathers. Only male peafowls, known as peacocks, possess such bright blue and green feathers. Female peafowls, known as peahens, have only a few green feathers on their necks and are mostly dull brown in color. Peahens also lack the massive, colorful train of tail feathers that males possess. The bright coloration of the males is likely a result of sexual selection, as brightly colored peacocks are more attractive to peahens and are thus more likely to find mates. Peacocks also engage in elaborate courting displays during which they display and shake their large trains to attract peahens. Like those of blue jays, peacock feathers contain the black pigment melanin, and their blue coloration is derived from their structure. Peacock feathers contain a crystalline lattice of microscopic rods that reflect light, causing them to appear blue. Their green feathers receive their coloration from a similar structure. 11 Colorful Peacock Facts 11 of 12 Blue Lobster Enoc Dooley / EyeEm / Getty Images Lobsters are almost always green or brown, but on extremely rare occasions—around one in two million—a blue one will appear. This coloration is caused by a genetic mutation that causes the lobster to produce an excessive amount of a particular protein that gives it that color. Lobsters eat plant material to get astaxanthin, an antioxidant that helps them cope with stress. (It's the same compound that gives salmon its orangey-pink color.) As Dr. Michael Tlusty explains at the New England Aquarium, \"When the lobsters eat the astaxanthin, the red pigment goes it into the skin, and that's where it shows up as being red. Then, the pigment gets moved up into the shell. And when it stores it in the shell, proteins grab the pigments and twist it around, and it actually turns to a blue color. And then later on, they get twisted again, and they turn yellow.\" When you look at a lobster, you're seeing those stacked layers of pigment—yellow, red, blue—all muddling together to create a brown color. But if a lobster isn't getting enough astaxanthin, thanks to its genetic mutation, then there's not a visible red layer—which means you'll see more of the blue, rather than the \"muddy\" blend of pigments. 12 of 12 Spix's Macaw p z / Getty Images The stunning Spix's macaw, native to northeastern Brazil and famous for its role as the lead character Blu in the popular 2011 film \"Rio\", nearly went extinct in the wild, with a single male believed to be the only living specimen in the mid-1990s. Fewer than three dozen others lived in captivity, which led to an ambitious, two-decade-long project to reestablish a population of Spix's macaws in the wild. The color of its feathers range from brilliant turquoise on its front to dull bluish-grey on its head. As with other birds, the color is created by structural differences in the feather. \"When white light strikes a blue feather, the keratin pattern causes red and yellow wavelengths to cancel each other out, while blue wavelengths of light reinforce and amplify one another and reflect back to the beholder’s eye,\" says Smithsonian magazine.

You can talk to them about your alternatives and pick the best one for you.\nHowever, CISSP classroom courses are relatively expensive. The cost of classroom-based training is substantially more than that of online or self-paced choices; therefore, this kind of training may increase the total cost of your CISSP certification.\nWhat Are the CISSP Certification Exam Requirements?\nThe CISSP certification has two primary prerequisites. The first and most important thing to remember is to complete the exam. In a moment, we’ll go into greater depth on this.\nIn the meantime, let’s talk about the other requirement: work history. (ISC)² mandates that CISSP certifications be for experienced professionals only, as indicated above. CISSP certification requires five years of full-time job experience in two of the eight CISSP domains listed above to be eligible for certification. A year of experience can be substituted for a college degree or another (ISC)² approved certification, and internships and part-time work can contribute towards this criterion. The fine print can be found on the (ISC)² website.\nTo earn and retain your CISSP certification, you’ll have to pay fees, which we’ll discuss later in this article.\nWhat are the CISSP domains?\nThe subject matter that the CISSP certification covers is called CISSP domains. CISSP is an advanced certification. Thus, it isn’t for everyone who wants to pursue it. Experienced cybersecurity practitioners, managers, and executives can use it to certify that they have a thorough understanding of the various principles of cyber security.\nThe domains in the CISSP certification are:\n- computer security\n- communications and network security\n- information security – operations\n- information security – design\n- physical (environmental) security\n- legal, regulations, policy, and governance\n- business continuity management; risk management\n- applied cryptography\n- software development security.\nWho should get a CISSP Certification?\nThe “gold standard” of security certifications, the CISSP, has been referred to by some as just that. You’ll typically find a CISSP is a requirement or at least highly recommended while screening cybersecurity positions. It’s beneficial if you’re considering a United States federal government career. The CISSP certification is a sign of an infosec generalist because of the wide range of technical expertise it requires.\nCISSP isn’t for everyone, however. A CompTIA Security+ certification may be a better option for those just starting in their careers in CISSP due to its lower entry-level requirements in terms of technical knowledge and work experience. The CISSP exam also tests your knowledge of management and technical skills, which is why you’ll need some work experience before you begin the CISSP path.\nTips for Passing the CISSP Certification Exam\nThe CISSP exam is notoriously difficult. You must score at least 700 out of a possible 1,000 points to demonstrate your knowledge and expertise in each topic and pass the certification.\nCISSP certification exams are difficult to study for; therefore, here are the tips for passing the CISSP certification exam to help you succeed:\nLocate a Variety of Research Resources\nAn outline, a study guide, sample tests, and more are all available to help you prepare for the (ISC)2 certification exam. Download an official study software, buy the official textbook and use the CISSP flashcards for additional preparation options. Even though all of these resources are beneficial, passing the exam on your own is difficult.\nTo succeed on the CISSP exam, you’ll need to use various study methods, including self-study, CISSP Boot Camp, and formal CISSP Training. CISSP Courses can be taken in a classroom with other professionals, in a small group with friends, or privately with an instructor.\nForm a Team With Your Friends\nStudying in a group can lead to wonderful group conversations and help you better understand subjects you don’t understand. Attending a CISSP training course lets you meet others going through the same subject as you.\nYou can also search for discussion forums online or start your study group. Attend meetings for security professionals to make new friends and learn from others who have already passed the exam.\nMaintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance\nThere is a lot of work involved in preparing for the CISSP exam. You’re probably juggling your studies with a full-time job and other commitments outside of school. Scheduling particular study times is the most effective technique.\nTo be fully prepared for the exam, it’s essential to balance studying and completing practice exams. The week before your exam, plan to study for at least a month to avoid cramming in the last few days.\nThe CISSP exam\nThere are about equal numbers of questions from each domain listed above in the CISSP exam. The CISSP exam outline includes a breakdown of the content and a description of what to expect on test day. “Advanced inventive things” are referred to as multiple-choice questions. Identifying diagram elements and dragging and dropping responses from one side of the screen to boxes on the other are two types of questions that sound more difficult than they are.\nThe exam is computer-adaptive, and this is how it is administered in English (CAT). Essentially, this means that when you take the exam, a computer monitors your progress and adjusts to your questions. In this version of the test, there are between 100 and 150 questions, and it takes around three hours to complete. There are 250 questions, and it takes roughly six hours to complete the test in all other languages, which is linear (meaning that the questions are the same no matter how you answer). A 700-point minimum is required to pass either type of test.\nIt’s easy to schedule your exam with the help of (ISC)²’s resource page, which also provides information on exam formats and what to expect when you take the test. Check out Dex Yuan’s LinkedIn article and the (ISC)2 community forums and Reddit if you’re looking for real-world test-takers reports on how the exam experience went. It’s nice that you can see a preliminary result of your performance at the testing location so that you can plan accordingly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:093b25ae-2272-46c9-a759-a39636b35c2d>","<urn:uuid:455e73c3-285d-4ec5-9eeb-ab099891d50c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the main differences between Jehoshaphat and Baruch ben Neriah in terms of their historical roles and archaeological evidence?","answer":"Jehoshaphat and Baruch ben Neriah had quite different roles in biblical history. Jehoshaphat was the 4th king of Judah who reigned for 25 years (circa 873-849 BC) and was known for his religious reforms, public instruction initiatives, and judicial institutions. Archaeological evidence of Jehoshaphat comes mainly through references to the Davidic dynasty in extra-Biblical sources. In contrast, Baruch ben Neriah was a scribe and disciple of the prophet Jeremiah, who recorded Jeremiah's prophecies. Archaeological evidence for Baruch is more direct, with several bullae (clay seals) bearing his name being found in the archaeological City of David. One particular bulla bears the inscription 'Baruch ben Neriah the Scribe' and even contains what is likely his thumbprint on the upper ridge. These bullae were found in strata contemporary with Jeremiah's time period.","context":["Biblical Archeology and independent sources confirm the existence of the major and minor Biblical characters and the events in the Biblical accounts from Moses, Joshua, David, through Jeremiah and Baruch and their successors.\nBulla of Baruch ben Neriah\nHow lonely sits the city that was once full of people! She has become like a widow! She, that was great among the nations and a princess among the provinces, has become a tributary. Lamentations 1:1\nThose melancholy words of the prophet Jeremiah were composed from the dismal confines of a dungeon cell. The prophet of God dictated the words of doom while his protege, the scribe Baruch ben Neriah, carefully recorded them on a scroll. Baruch read the words of Lamentations before the king of Judah, Jehoakim. The thought of losing his kingdom so angered the king that he cut the scroll into pieces and threw the scraps into a fire as though that would alter the divine decree.\nTwenty-four hundred years later, a small lump of clay was discovered in Jerusalem bearing the seal of Baruch ben Neriah. The disciple of Jeremiah was suddenly and tangibly brought to life. When a document was to be authenticated and rendered tamper-proof, the document was rolled up and bound by a length of cord. The knot was encased in a small lump of clay, called a bulla, which was held steady with one hand while the other hand embossed the seal onto the clay. When the bulla dried, the document was ready for delivery. It was not unusual for the fingerprints of the person holding the clay and seal to be impressed onto the sides of the bulla. A thumbprint can be seen on the upper ridge of Baruch’s bulla, most likely the print of Baruch himself. Once again the imagination begins to roam. Could there be any DNA residue of Baruch on the hardened clay?\nBelow is an impressive list of 61 Biblical persons, some are kings, some are prophets, some are heroes while others are enemies.

Son of Ahilud, \"recorder\" or annalist under David and Solomon (2 Sam. 8:16), a state officer of high rank, chancellor or vizier of the kingdom.\n(4.) Solomon's purveyor in Issachar (1 Kings 4:17).\n(5.) The son and successor of Asa, king of Judah. After fortifying his kingdom against Israel (2 Chr. 17:1, 2), he set himself to cleanse the land of idolatry (1 Kings 22:43). In the third year of his reign he sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the law (2 Chr. 17:7-9). He enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people \"in their basket and their store.\"\nThe great mistake of his reign was his entering into an alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, which involved him in much disgrace, and brought disaster on his kingdom (1 Kings 22:1-33). Escaping from the bloody battle of Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu (2 Chr. 19:1-3) reproached him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of God and in the righteous government of the people (2 Chr. 19:4-11).\nAgain he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted (2 Chr. 20:35-37; 1 Kings 22:48-49).\nHe subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land (2 Kings 3:4-27).\nThe last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in 2 Chr. 20. The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court of the temple, \"O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us.\" Amid the silence that followed, the voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son Jehoram (1 Kings 22:50). He had this testimony, that \"he sought the Lord with all his heart\" (2 Chr. 22:9). The kingdom of Judah was never more prosperous than under his reign.\n(6.)

His history is to be found among the events recorded in (1Ã‚Â Kings 15:24; 2Ã‚Â Kings 8:16) or in a continuous narrative in (2Ã‚Â Chronicles 17:1; 2Ã‚Â Chronicles 21:3) He was contemporary with Ahab, Ahaziah and Jehoram. He was one of the best, most pious and prosperous kings of Judah, the greatest since Solomon. At first he strengthened himself against Israel; but soon afterward the two Hebrew kings formed an alliance. In his own kingdom Jehoshaphat ever showed himself a zealous follower of the commandments of God: he tried to put down the high places and groves in which the people of Judah burnt incense, and sent the wisest Levites through the cities and towns to instruct the people in true morality and religion. Riches and honors increased around him. He received tribute from the Philistines and Arabians, and kept up a large standing army in Jerusalem. It was probably about the 16th year of his reign, B.C. 898, when he became Ahab?s ally in the great battle of Ramoth-gilead, for which he was severely reproved by Jehu. (2Ã‚Â Chronicles 19:2) He built at Ezion-geber, with the help of Ahaziah, a navy designed to go to Tarshish; but it was wrecked at Ezion-geber. Before the close of his reign he was engaged in two additional wars. He was miraculously delivered from a threatened attack of the people of Ammon, Moab and Seir. After this, perhaps, must be dated the war which Jehoshaphat, in conjunction with Jehoram king of Israel and the king of Edom, carried on against the rebellious king of Moab. (2Ã‚Â Kings 3:1) ... In his declining years the administration of affairs was placed, probably B.C. 891, in the hands of his son Jehoram.\n- Son of Ahilud, who filled the office of recorder of annalist in the courts of David, (2Ã‚Â Samuel 8:16) etc., and Solomon. (1Ã‚Â Kings 4:3)\n- One of the priests in David?s time. (1Ã‚Â Chronicles 15:24)\n- Son of Paruah; one of the twelve purveyors of King Solomon.

See separate article.\n(2) Son of Ahilud. He was recorder under David (2 Sam 8:16; 20:24; 1 Ch 18:15) and Solomon (1 Ki 4:3).\n(3) Son of Paruah, and Solomon's overseer in Issachar to provide victuals for the royal household for one month of the year (1 Ki 4:17).\n(4) Son of Nimshi, and father of Jehu, king of Northern Israel (2 Ki 9:2,14). His name is omitted in 9:20 and 1 Ki 19:16, where Jehu is called \"son of Nimshi.\"\n(5) the King James Version (but not Hebrew) in 1 Ch 15:24; the Revised Version (British and American) correctly JOSHAPHAT (which see).\nDavid Francis Roberts\nJEHOSHAPHAT (2) [ISBE]\n- je-hosh'-a-fat (yehoshaphaT, \"Yahweh judges\"): The 4th king of Judah, son of Asa. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi, of whom nothing further is known. He was 35 years of age at his accession, and reigned 25 years, circa 873-849 BC. Th e history of his reign is contained in 1 Ki 22:41-50\nand in 2 Ch 17:1\nthrough 21:1. The narrative in 1 Ki 22:1-35a\nand in 2 Ki 3:4\nff belongs to the history of the Northern Kingdom. The absence from Ki of the details contained in 2 Chronicles affords no presumpt against their truth. Neither do high numbers, embellished statements, and the coloring of the writer's own age destroy the historical perspective.\n1. His Religious Policy:\nThe reign of Jehoshaphat appears to have been one of unusual religious activity. It was, however, characterized not so much by striking religious measures as it was by the religious spirit that pervaded every act of the king, who sought the favor of Yahweh in every detail of his life (2 Ch 17:3,4). He evidently felt that a nation's character is determined by its religion. Accordingly, he made it his duty to purify the national worship. The \"sodomites,\" i.e. those who practiced immorality in the worsh ip of Yahweh in the temple precincts, were banished from the land (1 Ki 22:46). The Asherim were taken out of Judah (2 Ch 17:6; 19:3), and \"the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim were brought back unto Yahweh, the God of their fathers\" (2 Ch 19:4). Because of his zeal for Yahweh, Jehoshaphat is rewarded with power and \"riches and honor in abundance\" (2 Ch 17:5).\n2. His System of Public Instruction:\nBelieving that religion and morals, the civilization, suffer from ignorance, Jehoshaphat introduced a system of public instruction for the whole land (2 Ch 17:7 ff). He appointed a commission, composed of princes, Levites and priests, to go from city to city to instruct the people. Their instruction was to be based on the one true foundation of sound morals and healthy religious life, \"the book of the law of Yahweh\" (2 Ch 17:7-9).\n3. His Judicial Institutions:\nNext in importance to Jehoshaphat's system of public instruction, was his provision for the better administration of justice. He appointed judges to preside over courts of common pleas, which he established in all the fortified cities of Judah. In addition to these local courts, two courts of appeal, an ecclesiastical and a civil court, were established at Jerusalem to be presided over by priests, Levites, and leading nobles as judges. At the head of the ecclesiastical court of appeal was the high priest, and a layman, \"the ruler of the house of Judah,\" headed the civil court of appeal (2 Ch 19:4-11). The insistence that a judge was to be in character like Yahweh, with whom there is \"no iniquity .... nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes\" (2 Ch 19:7), is worthy of note.\n4. His Military Defenses:\nAccording to 2 Ch 17:2, Jehoshaphat began his reign with defensive measures against Israel. Furthermore, he built castles and cities of store in the land of Judah, \"and he had many works,\" probably military supplies, \"in the cities of Judah\" (17:13). He appears to have had a large standing army, including cavalry (1 Ki 22:4; 2 Ch 17:14 ff). However, the numbers in 2 Ch 17:14 ff seem to be impossibly high.\n5. His Foreign Policy:\nGodliness and security at home were followed by respect and peace abroad. The fact that the Philistines and the Arabians brought tribute (2 Ch 17:11), and that Edom had no king (1 Ki 22:47), but a deputy instead, who possibly was appointed by Jehoshaphat, would indicate that he held the suzerainty over the nations and tribes bordering Judah on the South and West Holding the suzerainty over the weaker nations, and being allied with the stronger, Jehoshaphat secured the peace for the greater part of his reign (1 Ch 17:10) that fostered the internal development of the kingdom.\n6. His Alliance with Ahab:\nIn contrast to the former kings of Judah, Jehoshaphat saw greater benefit in an alliance with Israel than in civil war. Accordingly, the old feud between the two kingdoms (1 Ki 14:30; 15:6) was dropped, and Jehoshaphat made peace with Israel (1 Ki 22:44). The political union was cemented by the marriage of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, to Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. Shortly after the marriage, Jehoshaphat joined Ahab in a campaign against Syria (2 Ch 18:1-3). In view of the subordinate position that Jehoshaphat seems to take in the campaign (1 Ki 22:4,30), and in view of the military service rendered to Jehoram (2 Ki 3:4 ff), Judah seems to have become a dependency of Israel. Nevertheless, the union may have contributed to the welfare and prospity of Judah, and it may have enabled Jehoshaphat to hold the suzerainty over the neighboring nations. However, the final outcome of the alliance with the house of Omri was disastrous for Judah. The introduction into Judah of Baalism more than counterbalanced any political and material advantage gained, and in the succeeding reigns it indirectly led to the almost total extinction of the royal family of Judah (2 Ki 11:1 ff).\n7. His Alliance with Jehoram:\nIn spite of the denunciation of the prophet Jehu for his expedition with Ahab, thus \"help(ing) the wicked\" (2 Ch 19:2), Jehoshaphat entered into a similar alliance with Jehoram of Israel (2 Ki 3:4 ff). On the invitation of Jehoram to join him in an expedition against Moab, Jehoshaphat was ready with the same set speech of acceptance as in the case of Ahab (2 Ki 3:7; compare 1 Ki 22:4). For the details of the expedition see JEHORAM, (1).\n8. Victory over the Moabites and Ammonites:\nThe Chronicler has given us a very remarkable account of a victory gained by Jehoshaphat over the Moabites and Ammonites. No doubt he made use of a current historical Midrash. Many find the historical basis of the Midrash in the events recorded in 2 Ki 3:4 ff. However, the localities are different, and there a defeat is recorded, while in this case we have a victory. The story in outline bears the stamp of probability. 1 Ki 22:45 seems to suggest wars of Jehoshaphat that are not mentioned in Kings. The tribes mentioned in the account are represented as trying to make permanent settlement in Judah (2 Ch 20:11). In their advance through the South of Judah, they were doubtless harassed by the shepherd population of the country. Jehoshaphat, according to his custom, sought the help of Yahweh. The invading forces fell to quarreling among themselves (2 Ch 20:23), and destroyed one another. The spoil was great because the invaders had brought all their goods with them, expecting to remain in the land.\n9. Destruction of Jehoshaphat's Fleet:\nThe destruction of Jehoshaphat's fleet is recorded in 1 Ki 22:48,49 and in 2 Ch 20:35-37. However, the two accounts are quite different. According to Kings, Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to sail to Ophir for gold, but the vessels were wrecked at zion-geber. Thereupon Ahaziah offered to assist Jehoshaphat with seamen, but Jehoshaphat refused to enter into the alliance. According to Chronicles the alliance had been formed, and together they built ships at Ezion-geber, which were destroyed because Jehoshaphat had made an alliance with the wicked king of Israel. In view of Jehoshaphat's other alliances, the Chronicler may be in the right. Chronicles, however, misunderstood the term \"ships of Tarshish.\"\n10. His Death:\nJehoshaphat died at the age of 60. Josephus says (Ant., IX, iii, 2) that he was buried in a magnificent manner, for he had imitated the actions of David. The kingdom was left to Jehoram, who inaugurated the beginning of his reign by causing the massacre of his brethren.\nS. K.

{"question":"How does the temperature tolerance of Type T thermocouples compare to AMD Ryzen processors?","answer":"Type T thermocouples are limited to operating temperatures of about 370°C due to copper oxidation, while AMD Ryzen microprocessor chips cannot handle temperatures above 95°C. Despite both having temperature limitations, Type T thermocouples can operate at significantly higher temperatures than the AMD Ryzen processors.","context":["Making a Non-Electric Rover For the Venus Planetary Surface\nA rover which can see, move and communicate all without electricity. Sounds impossible? Turns out non-electric solutions exist for all these challenges.\nWe have sent several robotic missions to Mars, yet despite being closer there are no robotic rovers roaming around on the surface of Venus.\nWhy is that? For those who have followed my writing, you probably already know it is because the surface temperature of Venus is over 460 °C, and the pressure is 93 bars on average. Oh and by the way, it rains sulfuric acid. Under these conditions lead will melt and form pools.\nHowever making the physical structures to withstand this is actually not that difficult. Steel melts at 1370 °C. And if we really wanted to be certain we could just use Tungsten which melts at 3422 °C.\nThe problem is that regular electronics is not made to operate at those temperatures. An AMD Ryzen microprocessor chip e.g. can’t handle temperatures above 95 °C.\nFluidics devices performing computations using fluids can operate at almost any temperature because you can make them out of any material:\nMy 3D printer story basically explain how to build and control machinery operating on air or some other fluid alone. So we got that part covered.\nThat leaves three major challenges:\n- How can the rover figure out where it is, if you can’t use a a camera, laser or radar, which all require electrical circuits?\n- How would you control it remotely. How would e.g. the humans in their aerostat habitats above the Venus cloud tops communicate with it and give it instructions?\n- Where would the rover get energy to move from without a battery or solar cells?\nRemote Communications Using Acoustic Signals\nWe do in fact have fluidics amplifiers for sounds. Meaning a fluid signal can be controlled by sound. That opens up the possibility of sending and receiving information using sound waves. This is not as crazy as it sounds. There are people who have already patented a communication system based on this principle.\nThat means our Venus rover instead of an antenna sending an electromagnetic signals we would have speakers broadcasting sounds to be received by our human colonists controlling the rover.\nSeeing Like a Bat\nBats are essentially blind, but they can still “see” using echolocation:\nEcholocation — the active use of sonar (SOund Navigation And Ranging) along with special morphological (physical features) and physiological adaptations — allows bats to “see” with sound. Most bats produce echolocation sounds by contracting their larynx (voice box).\nThe sounds bats emit are however ultrasound so we can’t hear it. The sound is so loud that bats have to close their ears when they emit the sound. Then they have to open them again to listen to the echo. Depending on whether the bat wants to scan a whole cave or just look at a prey close by it will alter the frequency of emitting sound and listening to the echo. If you send out sound too rapidly then there is no time to pick up the reflection of sound from further away places.\nA Venus rover could use the same principles. It could broadcast sounds and listen for reflections at different frequencies depending on whether it is scanning the landscape or analyzing a rock or boulder close by.\nWe already have a lot of experience with sound based “seeing,” through the use of ultrasound for looking at a fetus to using seismic for looking at the rock layers in the ground. The granularity of these systems can vary a lot. E.g. there are ultrasound sensors, which are just used to measure the distance to the closes objects, but which doesn’t give you any details about the shape or orientation of the object.\nHowever you could combine multiple ultrasound sensor or continuously rotate them to get a form of seeing. Here are some Arduino projects exploring that.\nDimitris Platis uses multiple ultrasonic sensors to scan observe his surroundings in this project.\nExample of using a rotating ultrasonic sensor to detect surroundings.\nUnlike Mars, Venus actually has a very thick atmosphere which makes the utilization of wind power possible. The blades of say a windmill could power an air compressor. Compressed air thus serves the same function as a battery in traditional electrical rover.\nThe compressed air is used to power the pneumatic motors driving the belts or wheels of the rover. It is also used to drive the fluidics computational devices which controls the rover.\nExisting Alternative Designs Proposals\nWhen researching this topic, I came across some NASA ideas for Venus rovers, e.g. the AREE project.\nThese utilize wind power as my suggestion but base their design on a combination of electronic and mechanical computers for autonomy. The AREE project seems strongly wedded to the idea of using mechanical systems for computation, in the spirit of Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine. Sophisticated mechanical computation devices have been used all the way up to modern times. E.g. the Russians used the IMP Globus instrument to find the orientation of its spacecraft until 2002, which a very sophisticated mechanical device, as you can see from all the gears inside:\nReading through the AREE proposal I can’t find any ways of scanning the landscapes. They propose mechanical bumpers to avoid obstacles.\nThey also propose using many different systems. E.g. communications is done with some sort of radio signals using vacuum tubes. Vacuum tubes can handle high temperatures but the vacuum seal may eventually break in the high pressures and temperatures.","What type do I need?\nOf all the temperature sensors used in industry and research, the thermocouple is the sensor of choice on grounds of temperature range, speed of response, ruggedness and cost.\nThough there are other important sensors the eight most commonly used thermocouples known are Types J, K, T, E, N, S, R and B. These letter designations, now used world wide, follow the recommendations of the IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), the ISA (Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society), the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and the ANSI (American National Standards Institute).\nType J is useable up to 720°C . It is not very susceptible to aging up to about 540°C. It is very cost effective and is the thermocouple of choice in the plastics processing industry where temperatures rarely exceed 400 °C. The iron conductor is subject to oxidation at higher temperatures and when unprotected.\nIndustrial Thermocouple with Thermowell and Signal Converter\nType K is useable up to 1150°C in an oxidising atmosphere. Metallurgical changes can cause a calibration drift of 1 to 2°C in a few hours, increasing to 5 °C over time. A special grade of Type K is available that can maintain special limit accuracy up to ten times longer than the regular grade.\nType E – Chromel/Constantan is useable up to 820 °C. It has the highest mV output\nof all the thermocouples and has similar calibration drift to that of Type K so the same precautions are recommended.\nType N - Nicrosil/Nisil is useable up to1260°C. It was developed to overcome several problems inherent in Type K thermocouples. Aging in the 300 to 600 °C range is considerably less. Also Type N has also been found to be more stable than Type K in nuclear environments, where Type K has been the sensor of choice.\nType T – Copper/Constantan. Oxidisation of the copper limits the useable temperature to about 370 °C. It has been the thermocouple of choice for applications down to – 200 °C.\nTypes R – (Platinum 13% Rhodium. Platinum) and S (Platinum10% Rhodium/Platinum) are usable up to 1480°C. They are extremely stable but reducing atmospheres are particularly damaging. This type should be protected with a gas-tight ceramic tube and a secondary tube of porcelain, silicon carbide or metal outer tube, as conditions require. Type R delivers some 15% more mV than type S.\nType B Platinum-13% Rhodium/Platinum 6% Rhodium) is usable up to 1700 °C, ). Also easily contaminated, and damaged by reducing atmospheres. The same protective measures for R and S shown above apply to type B thermocouples.\nWire Size and Atmosphere. The upper temperature limits and life expectancy of all thermocouples are very dependent on atmosphere and wire size. Don’t count on going to the above limits in most applications. For longer life and higher temperature use, choose the larger size wires. For speed of response choose the smaller sizes; but note that a protection tube will dominate response time. With the platinum alloys the high cost and the long life of the materials usually dictate small wire sizes, typically 0.35mm.\nConstruction Basic:.Take two wires, join them at the hot end, measure the mV at the other end; who needs more? Often nothing wrong with that. Poke it in a duct or a non-aggressive liquid, or clamp it to the process under a screw and washer or a hose clip.\nFor protection from damage, abrasion and corrosion I’ll give a few choices here. But for the hundreds of real workable answers look in the many excellent supplier catalogs and web sites. Here are just a few design examples:\n1.Twin or quad bore alumina with the wires inside. The junction may be exposed, given a non-aggressive environment. Otherwise it may be fitted in metal or ceramic outer tube to protect from atmosphere or damage.\n2. Fiberglass or ceramic-fiber insulated wire inside a stainless steel tube; hot junction welded to the closed end. This is a very common on plastics machinery and good for fast heat transfer.\n3. The metal clad MgO (magnesium oxide) compacted design is very rugged, easily bent and good for protection from aggressive media. There is a wide choice of sizes and metal sheath grades for different media.\n4. The thermowell is a tough handy fitting for giving access to the contents of a vessel or pipe. You can slip your thermocouple inside it and still get to it for service or replacement without draining the contents. The hot junction stops short of the closed end of the well. To aid heat transfer you might use a blob of electrically insulating, thermally conducting material at the tip. Thermowell assemblies can be big, strong and slow so can mess up your control system response. Keep them small as possible.\nResponse Times of thermocouples. Time constants go from 0.1S (e.g. exposed tip in a fast stream) to some 15S (e.g. a thermowell in a tank). Time constant is the time taken to reach 63% of the final value. Watch that you don’t hurt the control response by putting a slow thermocouple on a lively process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:30dbd43b-5fc8-489c-9c5f-ec245fae3cce>","<urn:uuid:77ba26d1-b89d-42d9-be45-4dc83f442f81>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Canada's nuclear strategy address both climate change goals and indigenous community engagement, and what specific economic opportunities does it present?","answer":"Canada's nuclear strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with nuclear power already providing 15% of the country's power mix. The strategy emphasizes indigenous engagement as a core principle, stating that no energy project can succeed in Canada without community buy-in and meaningful indigenous partnership and benefit sharing. On the economic front, the SMR market in Canada is estimated to be worth $5.3B between 2025 and 2040. The strategy particularly benefits remote communities and mining operations - there are some 70 First Nation populations in Saskatchewan alone, many in remote areas, and the mining sector could significantly reduce operational costs by switching from diesel to SMR power generation. Additionally, Saskatchewan's uranium production (20% of world's production) provides a guaranteed local supply chain for nuclear projects.","context":["Director, Nuclear Energy\nGovernment Of Canada\nNov 9, 2020\nNuclear’s Role in Fighting Climate Change (0:27-9:00)\nDiane Cameron shares her initial thoughts about nuclear energy and why she changed her mind, committing her career to the technology\nQ: How did you get into the nuclear sector to begin with?\nA: Diane Cameron is Director of the Nuclear Energy Division of the Government of Canada. She has worked on climate change for the past 20 years from different angles, including the private sector and government. Diane’s driving force is to do her part to make the world a better place and address climate change. At some point, she found herself as a graduate student at MIT where she worked for the Laboratory for Energy and the Environment under Dr. Ernie Moniz, who later became Secretary of Energy under the Obama administration. In that time, Dr. Moniz utilized his graduate students to do the analysis and policy work that would inform his ideas about the future of energy and American energy policy. Diane was not part of the nuclear team, instead working on supply chain issues and network-level modeling. At the time, she was a nuclear skeptic, partly shaped by Fukushima, which happened while she was in graduate school. Diane eventually adopted the same view debated in that context, which is that it will take all non-emitting solutions to address the existential threat of climate change, but also that each option has its own costs, benefits, and risks. Within the carbon budget and time available, there is no credible pathway to our net-zero emissions without significant build-out of safe and secure nuclear. It took Diane several years to consider the evidence from the credible, international models showing the amount of carbon displaced by existing global installed nuclear capacity is needed to displace carbon. There were psychological effects from Fukushima, which caused real fear for people. The radiological effects have been able to be managed and responded to in a responsible and appropriate way, but the psychological effects have not been insignificant. Many lessons learned have driven the wave of innovation towards passive safety and inherent walk-away safety features. Canada feels an enormous sense of opportunity and optimism about nuclear innovation which will help non-emitting technologies get rolled out to be a step change in terms of public confidence.\nCanada’s Nuclear Action Plan (9:00-19:30)\nA review of Canada’s nuclear roadmap and how Diane helped it evolved into an action plan with a timeline\nQ: When you joined the Nuclear Energy Division, was there a roadmap and how is this new generation of technology going to be introduced into the commercial sector?\nA: Diane Cameron became the Director of the Nuclear Energy Division of the Government of Canada in 2014. At this time, a Government of Canada agenda that prioritized restructuring Atomic Energy of Canada and labs to introduce private sector presence through a government owned-contract operated contracts was coming to an end. CANDU Energy, Inc. was divested from the government into the private sector. This process aimed to get Canada’s domestic house in order to harness globalized supply chains and private sector competitive spirit, rethinking the role of the government and the role of the private sector. Part of Diane’s mandate was to rebuild the nuclear policy team and rebuild a vision for Canada to re engage on nuclear policy nationally and determine what the future of nuclear in Canada looked like. She grew the team from two, in 2014, to 24 in 2020. In that time, Canada’s leadership, vision, and influence has been reestablished, including initiatives around small modular reactors (SMR). Diane served as chair of Canada’s SMR roadmap. The provincial and territorial governments, power utilities, industry, labs, regulator, academia, civil society, and indigenous engagement were engaged to determine if there were markets, customers, and framework for different SMR technologies. This process instilled a sense of passion and optimism in Canada and ramped up the supply chain for SMR technology. Earlier this year, the Minister of Natural Resources announced Canada will be reconvening to turn the SMR roadmap into an action plan to reiterate the vision and the path forward. This action plan will include a statement of vision, explaining what Canada wants to achieve, and a statement of principles, explaining how Canada will achieve that vision. One of those principles is focused on indigenous engagement and meaningful indignous partnership and benefit sharing. Without community buy-in and indegenous partnership, there is no energy project that will be successful in Canada. Each partner will include submissions in the action plan. The federal government submission will respond to all the recommendations from the roadmap and identify new actions based on how the landscape has evolved since the roadmap. One evolution since the roadmap, by natural market forces, is a new framework for SMR’s in Canada. On Stream One, Ontario Power Generation and SaskPower are leading the charge on streamlining near-term grid-scale SMR’s. This stream of work is driven by a legislative mandate to fully phase out traditional coal by 2030. Saskatchewan is going to deploy wind and solar to a maximum, but there will still be a gap, which can be filled with either natural gas or SMR’s. Ontario is an experienced nuclear operator with a licensed site at Darlington and can be a partner for the West which does not have a nuclear power generating jurisdiction. Ontario is investing in the refurbishment of their power fleet which has ramped up the supply chain. This supply chain can then pivot to SMR’s by 2030.\nGaining Community Buy-in for Nuclear Projects (19:30-28:55)\nWhy Canada values its relationships with communities and stakeholders and how it impacts decision-making across the nuclear sector\nQ: What level of supply chain overlap is there between the refurbishment of CANDU style reactors and small modular reactors (SMR)?\nA: Regardless of which small modular technology (SMR) technology is built, there is a level of precision and regulatory compliance required in the nuclear sector. This culture and discipline is entirely transferable between the supply chain for refurbishment of CANDU reactors and SMR’s, but will still require some retooling in manufacturing. Canada is very proud that the regulator is flexible to innovation and is a responsible risk-based regulator instead of taking a prescriptive approach. Stream Two is Canada’s advanced Gen IV play, which New Brunswick Power is championing for Canada. Canada has a strong interest on the back end of the fuel cycle and technologies that can close the fuel cycle, both burners and potentially breeders. The interaction between the technology value proposition, as it relates to recycling and reducing spent fuel stockpiles, and what that means for public confidence. The public’s number one concern is the waste, followed by safety and security. Stream Three is focused on off-grid microreactors. Canada has an enormous, vast geographical landscape and all of Canada’s off-grid mining is nearly 100 percent reliant on diesel. Diesel is costly, has dirty emissions, and logistically complicated, so the mining sector is very excited about strong alternatives. The advantage is in combined heat and power. In heavy industries that need high quality steam or high temperature process heat, it is very inefficient to achieve these temperatures with electricity. This provides a real market for off-grid, co-gen microreactors in Canada. The first market is mining, and the second potentially being the hundreds of remote communities throughout Canada that are reliant on diesel and looking for alternatives. Some communities want to consider SMR’s in their options.\nGoals for New Operational Nuclear Power (28:55-41:21)\nDiane highlights some of Canada’s timelines for establishing new nuclear power technologies on and off the grid\nQ: When is the soonest Canada could have a brand new reactor built and operating somewhere in the country?\nA: On Stream One, Ontario Power Generation (OPG) is driving towards having the reactor built and power on the grid by 2028, followed shortly thereafter by Saskatchewan having one or more reactors online by 2030. There is a down selection of technology that is taking place and a group of utilities, coordinated by OPG, is shortlisting six or seven technologies. RIght now that shortlist is being down selected to the top two or three technologies and the selection will be made within 12-18 months. Canadians are very practical and there is a good amount of due diligence to be done to select the project by 2022 and get electrons on the grid by 2028 for a first-of-a-kind, grid-scale reactor. The first one will take more time to get licensed by the regulator, but Canada is committed to reducing the regulatory timeline going forward. No other countries are coming in faster while maintaining the standards of public engagement, transparency, safety, and security. The process of community engagement and building public buy-in cannot be rushed. Even with the perfect technology, the project will not succeed without public buy-in. Canada’s deep geological repository (DGR) is being advanced through Nuclear Waste Management Organization, which is funded by the waste owners in Canada. Before an organization can turn a reactor on and begin generating waste in Canada, they must first put money into a trust to pay for the long-term storage and waste management and disposal costs. Canada has a lot of great geographical and geological locations that would be great for repositories. The process for choosing the DGR site started out with a call inviting communities to volunteer to be the site for Canada’s deep geological repository. Over 22 communities volunteered to be considered for the DGR. Over the last 10 years, a thoughtful, deliberate process was executed and the list has been narrowed down to two sites. The process started with people first, followed by technology. Stream Two has more of an innovation play, so the timeline might be a little longer, but Stream Three will move more quickly in Canada. The demonstrator reactors, the microreactors, are between 5-15 MW electric in size and have simple designs. There are some leading technologies becoming front runners. Canada might pursue two microreactor demonstrators at the labs, or there might be mining companies willing to entertain and drive first-of-a-kind deployment on their site. Diane Cameron is confident that Canada can have two microreactor demonstrators by 2025. The single greatest threat facing the planet is climate change. There is a moral obligation to come up with solutions to leave the world in a more sustainable state. All the credible models show that nuclear innovation and nuclear capacity is needed to reduce the risks of failure and the costs of addressing climate change.","Saskatchewan nuclear secretariat to study economic impact of SMRs\nThe sparsely-populated Canadian province of Saskatchewan is creating an around five-person secretariat to examine the potential of small modular reactors (SMRs) and the economic impact of introducing nuclear power to the region.\nThe secretariat will be formed over the next few months from internal and external candidates and will concentrate on nuclear power’s position in the province in terms of necessary workforce training, regulation, communications and the country’s climate change plan, says Environment Minister Dustin Duncan.\n“The plan for the 2020s is to pair natural gas with wind and solar energy and augment additional hydro capacity from Manitoba, but from 2030 the picture gets a lot fuzzier and, in the event that SMRs are part of that plan for the province, we have to start now to get in to a position to ultimately make that decision,” Duncan told journalists at the end of June.\nCanada has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 and have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and is already leaning heavily on nuclear power, the second most used generating source providing 15 percent of the country’s power mix.\nMuch of Canada’s nuclear is concentrated in Ontario and has yet to reach Saskatchewan which generates 84% of its power from natural gas, coal and coke.\n“The face of the industry is changing pretty rapidly and plans that seemed to be solid not that long ago are back on the drawing board,” Duncan said, adding that a large deuterium uranium (CANDU) reactor is not on the cards and that SMRs are the main focus.\nThe Canadian Ministry of Natural Resources’ (NRCan) 2018 SMR Roadmap Projects studied on-grid and off-grid applications for SMRs and found that oilsands producers and remote mines would benefit from medium-term options for bulk heat and power such as that produced by the small reactors.\n“Canada has one of the world’s most promising domestic markets for SMRs. Conservative estimates place the potential value for SMRs in Canada at $5.3B between 2025 and 2040,” the report said.\nAt first look, the technology would be a perfect fit for Saskatchewan. Mining provides over a quarter of the gross domestic product of the province which is also home to some 70 First Nation populations, many in remote communities, and has a total population of just under 1.2 million people spread across an area a little larger than France.\nSince the report’s release, Canada Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) has announced its intention to have a demonstratable SMR at its national labs by 2026 while Ontario aims to have one running by 2028 at its Darlington site.\nThere are currently four project proponents at various stages of development as part of CNL’s invitation process with Global First Power’s proposed SMR design (a 5 MWe high-temperature gas reactor) at stage three of a four stage process.\nSaskatchewan mining companies are especially interested in SMRs. Off-grid power demand in many of the hard-to-reach mines is provided by expensive, subsidized, diesel-fired plants with fuel transport issues in some locations inflating prices to several hundred dollars per MWh.\nThe report estimates they could cut the cost of electricity by 20-60% by making the switch to 10-80 MWe generators from diesel generators.\n(Source: CNL Nuclear Review)\nSome 20% of the world’s production of uranium is mined and milled in northern Saskatchewan while much of the refining and conversation to make nuclear fuel takes place in Ontario, giving any project in the province a guaranteed local supply chain.\nSaskPower, the provinces’ main utility, has been working closely with Bruce Power and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) while assessing the business case and strategy for SMRs in the province.\n“The signing of an MOU earlier this year between Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan is an important first step for small modular reactor development. It demonstrates a critical willingness from these three governments to bring forward a technology that is cost effective and also addresses environmental and climate change concerns in a very meaningful way,” says Director of Corporate Communications at Bruce Power John Peevers.\nBruce Power’s 15-year Major Component Replacement (MCR) project for its 6.5 GW power plant in Ontario to replace the remaining six of the plant’s eight reactors to extend its life by 30-35 years to 2064 has recapitalized the country’s supply chain giving it a competitive advantage, Peevers says.\nMeanwhile, following the MOU, OPG says it has been working closely with SaskPower, Bruce Power and New Brunswick Power on feasibility studies for the deployment of SMRs in their respective markets both on- and off-grid.\nOPG has been working closely with SaskPower and the province’s Ministry of the Environment on technology due diligence to find an SMR design that would work as part of a pan-Canadian “fleet approach” to on-grid SMRs, the company says in an emailed response to questions.\n“We’re proud to be working with them, and excited to see their government taking the step of establishing their own SMR secretariat to coordinate the planning, licensing, and related work that needs to be done to ensure a successful deployment of SMRs in Saskatchewan,” the company says.\nBy Paul Day"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:edafc3ae-bd51-4a20-8531-9160c8adadf0>","<urn:uuid:3c054243-406d-49cc-9f36-0206b9de6640>"],"error":null}
