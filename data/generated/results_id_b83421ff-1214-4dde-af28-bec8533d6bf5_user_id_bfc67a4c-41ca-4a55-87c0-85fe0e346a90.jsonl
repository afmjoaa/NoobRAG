{"question":"How does the weight carried by Marines in Force Company's mission compare to the equipment load of Rangers in Best Ranger Competition?","answer":"Marines in Force Company's reconnaissance mission carried more than 100 pounds of gear through swamps and marshes, while Rangers in the Best Ranger Competition carried over 70 pounds on their backs while covering 60 miles nonstop. The Marines' load was notably heavier, though both groups carried substantial weight during their respective missions.","context":["Operating 'Swift, Silent, Deadly'\nMarines.mil | Mar 17 2014\nMARINE CORPS BASE CAMP LEJEUNE (March, 5, 2014) - Marines and sailors with Force Company, 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, used jumping out of a V-22 Osprey as their method of infiltration during a three-day, field exercise starting Feb. 18, 2014, aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, N.C.\n\"The main purpose of the mission was to rehearse reconnaissance and surveillance operations,\" said Sgt Michael Blair, an assistant team leader with the unit, and native of Franklinton, La. \"Primarily what [the mission] entails is being able to clandestinely get eyes on the objective and send a report on it, with pictures and information of any and all activities that are going on with the objective.\"\nMarines used two different styles of jumping from the aircraft to conduct their insertion, static line and High Altitude Low Opening. A static line jump is when the static line cord is attached to one end of the aircraft and the other end to the top of the jumper's deployment bag, where the canopy is packed into. When the jumper exits the aircraft it causes the static line to pull the deployment bag out of the container, automatically releasing the canopy. The static line and deployment bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the aircraft by the crew. In the HALO jumps, the Marines open their parachutes at a low altitude after free-falling for a period of time.\nStatic line jumpers exited the aircraft from around 1,500 feet in the air, and the HALO jumpers from around 12,000 feet.\n\"There is always that sense of realism when you are getting ready to jump out of an aircraft,\" said Sgt Collin Johansen, a point man from Midlothian, Texas. \"But once you actually jump and go through your procedures correctly, you remember your training and it all falls into place.\"\nOnce the Marines landed, they immediately readied their rifles, pulled out a compass, radioed their location and began to pack their parachutes in order to regroup.\nThe tactically efficient men immediately continued to the next part of their mission and headed for the tree line, each carrying more than 100 pounds of gear.\n\"It was rough,\" said Johansen. \"We were patrolling through swamps where some parts were ankle deep to waist deep. Some parts we decided not to move through because it was chest deep and that is not really feasible while carrying a 100 pound rucksack.\"\nThey spent hours finding the best route through the swamps and marshes to reach their next objective more than five miles away. Once the objective is reached, the Marines have to gather intelligence without being detected by a notional enemy.\nThe Marines' mission included collecting and reporting intelligence of actions on a bridge that provided access inside the objective where opposing forces were based, as well as obtaining visual confirmation of the American hostages. Collecting intelligence can prove to be just as challenging as getting to the objective.\n\"The biggest thing is reporting, because it is a lot harder than it sounds. Getting eyes on the objective and sending up exactly what is going on; you have to paint a picture with your words. Unless you're taking pictures but then you have to get a lot closer,\" said Blair.\nWith the field exercise considered a success the Marines began their exfiltration from the mission.\n\"We met every single information requirement that was sent down by the command. We got pretty good pictures, which helped them out a lot,\" said Blair of his team's performance.\nMarines.mil is the official website of the United States Marine Corps and is maintained by the Marine Corps' Division of Public Affairs.","2010 - EPISODE 1:\nTensions are high as Soldiers prepare for 59 hours of grueling competition.\nIn 2009, elite Army Rangers converged on Fort Benning, Georgia, to determine the best of the best.\nSergeant First Class Simms and Sergeant First Class Stackpole took on the toughest course in recent history. In 59 hours, these highly trained soldiers would attempt to endure and conquer what a student takes 60 days to learn. Battling harsh elements, braving unimaginable physical challenges, testing the limits of mental anguish, these select few competed in one of the harshest trials known to man. Many succumbed along the way to mental attrition and brute exhaustion. Many others staggered to the finish through sheer will, completely spent, but only one team, Stackpole and Simms, emerged on the other side, victorious.\nSergeant First Class Chad Stackpole: Once again, we’re back here at Fort Benning, Georgia, where 84 qualified Rangers that make up the 42 Ranger buddy teams are here to compete for the title of Best Ranger.\nThe United States Army makes up less than one percent of the nation’s population and less than one percent of the Army makes up the Ranger community. Each year less than a hundred qualified Rangers accept the challenge. Of those who compete, only half make it through the first day. For the next three days, each Ranger will carry more than 70 pounds on their back while covering over 60 miles nonstop with virtually no sleep. This is the Best Ranger Competition.\nLast year, Team 5, Malchow and Collins, from the 75th Ranger Regiment, finished third. This year, they are the highest finishing team from the previous competition.\nSergeant Jesse Collins: We just went into it trying to do the best we could, go for top ten and we ended up getting third.\nSergeant Michael Malchow: Hopefully, this year we’ve learned from last year quite a bit, and we’ll be able to take it this year.\nStackpole: Readily why display, the intestinal fortitude required to fight under the Ranger objective, and complete the mission, “Though I be the lone survivor.” Sergeant Jeremy Billings of the 75th Ranger Regiment has made that commitment. He has competed in the previous three Best Ranger competitions.\nSergeant Jeremy Billings: Competing in this competition four times, it just, something I feel like I have to do until I win it, even if it takes 10 times.\nFor Sergeant Major Moran, it is also his second attempt at winning. He is looking to become the second two-time winner of the overall competition. This competition is contagious in the fact that every Ranger is hungry to win.\nCaptain Aaron Chonko: This is my second year, and this is the ultimate competition, and it gives you a sense of accomplishment at the end, when you completed the grueling three days.\nStackpole: In preparation for the competition, each one of these Rangers will be issued a standard Colt M4 Carbine. It is up to them to zero it in. They will all be given time to familiarize themselves with the weapons they will encounter during the competition.\nThe next area in which the Rangers will be familiarized is the Tri-Tower. It is a 60-foot wall that will test the Rangers’ confidence on the second day.\nAs the third and final familiarization, each team must prove their proficiency by exiting a UH60 Black Hawk helicopter. This is to certify them for the Spot Jump event during Day 1.\nIt’s looking to be another great competition. Forty-two teams have assembled here at Fort Benning, Georgia, in an attempt to earn the title of Best Ranger. Who will it be?\nNext up, we’ll hit the grueling Buddy Run and the Ranger Irvin obstacle course. If you think you’re tired after that, well, the competition has barely started.\nBack To Top"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:01d61eb6-4ce8-4f99-8dc2-034c8a1d954c>","<urn:uuid:b7d6c687-2dde-4c27-8ce1-c9b85340af3c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the challenges faced by independent filmmakers during the pandemic compare to those encountered by documentary makers in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, particularly regarding safety protocols and access restrictions?","answer":"Independent filmmakers during the pandemic faced strict safety protocols including mask requirements, cleaning procedures, and SAG testing rules that limited shooting to one week to avoid budget strain from repeated testing. The possibility of production shutdown due to illness was a significant financial risk. Meanwhile, in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, filmmakers dealt with military border guards, radiation safety concerns, and strict regulation of the 1000 square mile Dead Zone, which remains one of Earth's most radioactively contaminated places. Both situations required careful navigation of safety measures, though the specific hazards differed - viral transmission versus radiation exposure.","context":["Filmmaker Elias Plagianos and his team had won the second-annual Science and Tech Script Competition at the North Fork TV Festival for “Superuser Do,” a movie anthology following technologists throughout their personal and professional trials. Along the way, it looked at the influence of technology giants on our lives.\nThe anthology debuts this weekend at the North Folk Festival and after winning the prize, Plagianos decided the script needed a rewrite. It was wrong, in his eyes to tell a story about students without looking at the pandemic and how that has altered our world, in this case, learning via Zoom. Before production, he scrambled to re-write the script.\nServing as editor, writer and director, Plagianos wanted to tell an authentic story. He talked to Variety about reframing the narrative and adapting to the safety guidelines as an independent filmmaker.\n“The writers have won the Alfred P. Sloan award at the North Fork festival, and we’re producing it. It follows this group of diverse technologists through their personal and professional trials, and along the way looks at how tech giants have this huge influence on our lives,” he said.\nThe logline is about a student losing their scholarship due to their involvement in the Black Lives Matter movement, and this was a story you put together in the pandemic.\nThe world has really changed, it’s something we have to address and so we addressed that in our story. It’s not just the social upheaval, it’s things about going back to school, wearing a mask and learning via a laptop. So, it felt inauthentic to do this story and keep it in the original world. So, I did my rewrite and looked at what I wanted to talk about and what are some of the topics, I think we have a unique chance to dramatize, and that’s how I approached it.\nThere’s so much talk about diversity within crews and here you are with an 80% diverse crew.\nWorking within the indie world for the last ten years, I’ve connected with more of a diverse crew.\nI looked at my crew list and it was either someone is diverse or female and that just happened organically.\nIt’s so exciting because what happens in the Indie world often translates to the studio world, and I really hope it continues where it really matters – within the studios.\nSo much focus is on the studio world and how productions have to work with smaller crews, but what is it like for working on an independent film and working with smaller crews in a pandemic when that’s the norm for you anyway?\nYou hit the nail on the head. This is how we’ve been making films for years now, and this is the second project that I’m shooting.\nAs soon as production could begin in New York, I shot one project with Jessica Hecht and Richard Kind, and yes, we were a bit nervous. But I reduced my crew to just a sound guy, a cameraman. The set ran smoothly, and almost like a play, the actors came up with unique performances.\nBut that said, the safety protocols definitely make it harder to do my job because you’re always wearing a mask and cleaning everything and you create this environment that sometimes takes actors out of the performance.\nHow long did it take to shoot and did the new protocols have an impact on your shooting schedule?\nThe major problem we had was with testing because the Screen Actors Guild has very strict rules, and you could only use very specific tests. We could not shoot for more than a week because then the entire crew would have to be tested. We had to get it done in that week, otherwise, it would then be about our budget being spent on testing.\nIf you think about it before when someone showed up sick to work, the crew and the cast would power through it. But now, the entire production is shut down. So, it’s an incredible risk from a financial standpoint to do these things too, if you’re a smaller film.","The Babushkas of Chernobyl\njourneys into the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone several decades after the world’s worst nuclear disaster in April 1986. The tightly regulated 1000 square mile Dead Zone remains one of the most radioactively contaminated places on Earth, complete with military border guards.\nSurprisingly, a defiant, spirited group of elderly women scratches out an existence in this lethal landscape. The resilient babushkas are the last survivors of a small community who refused to leave their ancestral homes after the Chernobyl disaster.\nThe film follows the women for over a year, capturing their unusual lives in the Dead Zone, as well as other extraordinary scenes -- from radiation spikes just a few feet from the nuclear reactor, to a group of thrill-seekers called “Stalkers” who sneak into the Zone illegally to pursue post-apocalyptic video game-inspired fantasies.\nScientists in the area describe the extent of contamination in the Exclusion Zone and the continuing danger of radiation poisoning. Journalist Mary Mycio, author of Wormwood Forest: A Natural History of Chernobyl\n, studies the long-term impacts on humans, animals, and plants. A visit to the reactor itself shows a containment sarcophagus under construction, which will need to last longer than the pyramids in Egypt to prevent further radiation releases.\nWhile the babushkas' spirit mirrors the determination of the Ukrainian nation – a country that continues to survive despite its ongoing conflict with Russia – it remains unlikely Chernobyl will be repopulated anytime in the foreseeable future\nFILMMAKER AVAILABLE FOR SCREENINGS\nFilmmaker Holly Morris who spent 3 years filming in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is available for speaking engagements with the film.

{"question":"How do the special effects for showing multiple versions of the same actor differ between Mannequin (1987) and Dead Ringer (1964)?","answer":"The films use different techniques given their different time periods. In Mannequin, multiple mannequins of Kim Cattrall were physically created - six mannequins for close-up shots and around 20 for stunts, all sculpted by artist Tanya Wolf Ragir. For Dead Ringer, cinematographer Ernest Haller used a combination of body doubles and split-screen trickery to show Bette Davis playing twins, which was quite convincing despite the lack of CG technology in the 1960s. Haller had previous experience with this technique, having shot another film called A Stolen Life in 1946 where Bette Davis also played twins.","context":["What’s lost isn’t always lost. Sometimes a researcher sifts through a dark corner of a storage unit and uncovers a forgotten artifact. It’s been happening a lot in Philadelphia, of all places, this month. Earlier this month Cambridge University fellow Jason Scott-Warren posted on his blog that the Free Library of Philadelphia’s annotated copy of the First Folio was once John Milton’s.\nYou don’t really need to have ever opened a book to know that finding the writer of Paradise Lost’s notes on a first edition of William Shakespeare’s plays is a pretty big deal. In case you need to place this, imagine that if in 400 years, a historian found Lady Gaga’s annotated copy of The Immaculate Collection. But what if I told you there was an even bigger historical mystery taking place in Philadelphia this very same month?\nIt concerns Emmy, the mannequin from Mannequin. It involves a clothing shop involved in a Twitter back-and-forth with Kim Cattrall. Offline, it’s all taking place at a new mall in Center City Philadelphia that’s the latest attempt to rejuvenate a section of downtown Philly. And for one week, it took over my life.\nThe news about Emmy also came to the world via blog post, this one by Marisa Magnatta, a producer for WMMR’s longtime Preston & Steve morning show. She wrote that South Fellini, a Philadelphia novelty clothing store, had acquired a mannequin from the movie Mannequin. It would be on display in the store’s new second location in the Fashion District of Philadelphia, a rehabbed mall in Center City (for those of you who don’t speak Philadelphian, this is what other cities would call “downtown”).\nSome backstory: Mannequin was a 1987 movie, filmed mostly in Philadelphia, starring Kim Cattrall as Emmy (the titular mannequin) and Andrew McCarthy as mannequin designer Jonathan Switcher. Jonathan creates Emmy the mannequin, but gets fired from his job for spending too much time on her. He makes his way to the department store where Emmy ends up, and gets a gig as a stockboy. Emmy comes to life at night, and the two turn around the flailing store’s fortunes with their elaborate window displays. Jonathan is promoted to VP and saves Emmy from the clutches of the evil rival department store owners. She comes to life for good at the end and they get married.\nBut that’s all, erhm, window dressing. The real plot of the film, as lovingly described by Seanbaby, is “ancient cursed woman has noisy sex parties with Andrew McCarthy every night in a department store.” Mannequin also stars Meshach Taylor as a gay stereotype, Estelle Getty as a department store owner, James Spader as an evil department store manager, and G. W. Bailey as a night watchman. The film actually posits that Jonathan’s incredible window displays take 89 percent of business from other local department stores, in case you’re wondering if this movie about a mannequin that comes to life is realistic. Oh, and Emmy is actually an ancient Egyptian princess who has been Forrest-Gumping through history, having dated both Michaelangelo and Christopher Columbus before settling down with Jonathan. Mannequin makes Today’s Special look like Bicycle Thieves.\nBut the movie has a great cast, and it’s eminently watchable. It is also a complete mess. As the Los Angeles Times’ Michael Wilmington wrote upon its release, it wants to be one of those fantasy comedies from the 1940s but never quite gets there. “The filmmakers had the aspirations of classy old-style Hollywood hacks, but not their tricks,” he wrote. The film also posits—and I swear to the Egyptian gods that I am not making this up—that the greatest time in human history is 1980s Philadelphia.\nPerhaps the filmmakers were just really excited about our new downtown mall. Philadelphia, like many other major American cities, went through a massive process of what’s known as “urban renewal” in the second half of the 20th century. The mall, originally called The Gallery, was the brainchild of Ed Bacon, longtime head of the city’s planning commission (and, yes, father of Kevin). Bacon wanted to bring the suburban shopping experience downtown. The first part of the mall opened in 1977; a second part (as well as a new train station) would open in the 1980s.\nInitially the mall was such a hit that a store was robbed on its first day, but the hype didn’t last forever. Original anchor shops Gimbel’s and Strawbridge’s went out of business. Other anchors left too, and soon the upper levels of the mall had more “for lease” signs than actual stores. The mall was still popular—before it closed, it generated above-average revenue per square foot—but started to deteriorate. Its Center City location, bookended by subway stations and train lines, always drew crowds. But it was starting to seem really old.\nIt also did not have a great reputation. There were riots during a Dr. J retirement parade in the 1980s and a Chingy appearance in the 2000s. Suburbanites realized they didn’t need to drive to the city to go to the same stores that were in their suburban malls. And some people just didn’t want to go into a mall that might also have poor people in it. I mean, look at the Yelp reviews.\nIn the 2011 book The Cosmopolitan Canopy: Race and Civility in Everyday Life, sociologist Elijah Anderson called the Gallery “The Ghetto Downtown.” The Gallery was a hangout for black Philadelphians—not just teenagers, as one might expect, but older people too. “Black church ladies sit and make their place there, you have men from the communities, men of the old manufacturing economy, men who worked at Budd Company,” he told me for an article about The Gallery I wrote for Philadelphia magazine in 2015. “They can come there and see their friends and make friends. They don’t always know each other well. And when they leave there, they go back to separate communities sometimes. But the train is right there for them.”\nAnderson wrote that some white people wouldn’t even go near it. “A few venture into the Gallery only when accompanied by black companions,” he wrote.\nI loved The Gallery. My mom worked at an office building at one end of it, and going to see her was a big adventure when I was a kid. When I moved to Center City after college, I frequented the mall’s CD stores and sneaker shops. I drank at the 2 Street Cafe, the better-than-you’d-think bar in the mall’s basement. Sometimes I’d post up in the food court and do work. The chaos of the place brightened me. I was totally sad when the mall closed in 2015! No matter how much they attempt to rebrand the opening of the Fashion District of Philadelphia, I’m still going to call it The Gallery.\nSometime in the fall of 2013, I bought a copy of Mannequin at The Gallery. I think it was on sale. I remember the clerk asking me to describe the plot and not believing me when I told her. “You know this was filmed down the street at Wanamaker’s,” I said, namedropping the iconic Philadelphia department store that is now a Macy’s. A year later I watched the movie with a woman I’d just started dating. We loved it, for whatever reason. We watched it a few more times. We bought each other Blu-Ray copies of it. And several years later, I proposed in the courtyard at Wanamaker’s. We’re totally dancing to “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” at our wedding. If not for The Gallery and for Mannequin, who knows where our relationship would be.\nSo when I heard that Emmy was going to be on display at the Fashion District of Philadelphia, I knew I had to be there on opening day. I actually walked through the new mall with three different friends on the first few days, just to try to get a feel of it. Sometimes a new public space needs a little breaking in.\nI am happy to report that the New Gallery feels just like the old one. It is very white and bright, the current trend for malls. (The decor reminds me of the mall at the Oculus in Lower Manhattan.) It has fewer sneaker stores, probably due to an exclusivity clause in the lease with the new Nike outlet. But the GameStop moved back into the same space it was before. It still smells like Cinnabon at the one entrance. It still feels like Philadelphia.\nBut the new mall focuses more on experiences: There’s a branch of the City Winery chain; soon there will be a movie theater and a Round 1, a Japan-based video arcade, bowling alley and bar. There is a candy-themed playplace where you can pay $28 and take cool Instagram photos. And, to the new mall owner’s credit, they have brought in some local businesses. Several of the stores are aimed at black customers: There’s a hat shop, a woman’s boutique, and a jewelry/art store, all black-owned. The crowd outside Dolly’s Boutique at its opening made it look like Jonathan and Emmy had just designed a new window display. American Hats had a band in the store opening day. Who knows how Philadelphians will view the mall, but it does just feel like The Gallery again in a lot of ways. I think that’s actually pretty good. I am cautiously optimistic.\nSouth Fellini, another of the local businesses, was my destination on opening day. The store and the mannequin stunt are the brainchild of two Philly natives, Tony Trov and Johnny Zito, who initially screenprinted bootleg t-shirts in order to fund their short films while at Temple. That developed into an online shop, and then a physical location on East Passyunk Avenue, a South Philly commercial strip. (Their store is near Cheesesteak Vegas, if you’d like to place it.)\nBut both continued to work in the local film industry, and Trov struck up a friendship with a longtime worker on Philly movie and TV sets. That man, who the store says wants to remain anonymous, worked on both Mannequin films. And one day, in a storage unit, Trov noticed this guy had an Emmy mannequin.\nHe had lots of mannequin parts, actually. Trov and Zito instantly realized their prospects. They still make movies, and wanted to put it in one of the horror films they made together, but decided against it due to possible rights issues. (They’re well past the bootlegging stage of their careers.) Their South Philly store wasn’t big enough for it. But their mall spot in the new Gallery? When they signed a two-year lease with the mall, their anonymous benefactor reached out and said now was time to put Emmy back on display for Philadelphians to enjoy.\nThe mannequin, being a prop from a 1987 film, was not in great shape by the time it was procured by the store. Trov and Zito did some touch-ups on the face. They bought a new wig for it—“Disco Angel,” from a Delaware Ave. Halloween shop—and dressed it in some of the brand’s clothing.\nI stopped by the shop at lunchtime on opening day and talked with the owners. I took some photos. I figured it was going to be a 250-word post for Jezebel with some photos and I’d move on with my work.\nBut all was not as it seemed. Seeing the original blog post that scooped the city on this breaking news story, Kim Cattrall tweeted that, no, the mannequin on display was a fake! The South Fellini owners thought Cattrall was simply reacting to the stock photo with Magnatta’s initial article. They came back with a still of the actual mannequin. But Cattrall was still not convinced.\nA scandal! I had to investigate more. I contacted Cattrall’s publicist, but the actor is currently busy filming a new TV series (Filthy Rich) in New Orleans and could not comment. I went back to the store. I was under the assumption that it would be prohibitively expensive for the South Fellini guys to fake a mannequin that looks remarkably like Emmy, but there were some doubts. They informed me of a stamp on the bottom of the mannequin torso, from Wolf & Vine-Greneker, which constructed many of the mannequin props for the film. They had something that was at least somewhat legit.\nAccording to interviews done around the time of the film’s release, six mannequins were sculpted of Kim Cattrall for close-up shots. Another 20 or so were made for stunts. And the woman who sculpted those mannequins was Tanya Wolf Ragir, a Los Angeles-based artist. I called her.\nTanya Wolf Ragir was arms-deep in clay when she picked up the phone. But she agreed to talk to me about her work on Mannequin and its sequel, Mannequin Two: On the Move.\nWolf Ragir has been an artist since she was a child. She is now, as she describes it, a “serious-as-a-heart-attack sculptor.” But, like many other artists, she also did commercial work. Her father’s uncle had founded a company that made fiberglass mannequins. She is an artist. It was a perfect fit.\nShe started with a kids’ line—relatively unheard of in those days in the mannequin industry, Wolf Ragir said. Through their parents, she recruited kids from bougie private schools and turned them into mannequin models. (She says some of these mannequins are still in use today, about 40 years later.) Later, she began developing mannequins of different body types. She sculpted lots of people for mannequin models—including Bill Paxton, early in his career.\nWolf Ragir says she made around 1000 mannequins over the course of her time in the business. She was, as she tells it, incredible at her work. Seeing how much Emmy the mannequin looks like Kim Cattrall, I believe her. “For me to crank out a mannequin every two weeks,” she tells Jezebel, “it was just like playing scales as a pianist.” When the producers of Mannequin were looking for a mannequin maker, her name popped up. “I had a big, huge reputation,” she says. “I was easy to find.”\nShe didn’t have to just make mannequins for this film. She had to make mannequins that fit the scenes. She was given a script with notes of every time a mannequin would appear on screen. She had to make a bunch of different poses.\n“I was given the task to figure this shit out,” she says. “Here’s everywhere where a mannequin appears in the movie. I said to myself, ‘Look at the script, Tanya, what do you need to sculpt? Here’s where she turns into a mannequin. Here’s where she’s going into the chopper.’” (The climax of the film involves Emmy nearly falling down a mannequin destruction conveyor belt that is in the basement of a department store. I looked into it and these do not actually exist.)\nWolf Ragir had to sculpt Emmy in various scenes. She even had to sculpt a mannequin arm giving the finger at the movie’s villains, in what has to be the first time a mannequin ever flipped the bird. The task was helped, of course, by the fact that Wolf Ragir had a “full-fledged mannequin factory” behind her work. She was able to get armloads of arms and legs for the movie.\nCattrall tweeted that she sat for six weeks for Wolf Ragir. The session was just like any other. Cattrall posed in a Santa Monica garage Wolf Ragir was using as a studio at that time. The two became friendly. From her tweets, it’s clear Cattrall still really appreciated Wolf Ragir’s work. Who wouldn’t want a perfect mannequin of themselves?\nBut as fascinating as it was to learn about Wolf Ragir’s history as a mannequin sculptor, I still had the most important question unanswered: Was this mannequin really Emmy? After our call ended, I texted her a photo.\n“At first glance I don’t recognize the body (for sure the hands are someone else’s),” she texted me. But the head, she said, was hers: “It’s for sure her head, I just didn’t recognize the body.”\nI went back to the South Fellini guys. They explained to me how it all happened: When they found the Emmy mannequin, it was just a head and a torso. There were also a lot of other mannequin parts in varying conditions in that storage space. So they snapped various arms and legs onto her to make a full body.\nThe mystery was solved. The mannequin on display is Emmy’s head on some other mannequin body parts. For this reason, and only this reason, it is not like the Free Library’s first folio. It is not a complete specimen. It is more like one of the fragments of the First Folio that exist. It’s still important and historic. It’s just not a full copy.\nIt’s not her body. And it doesn’t come to life at night. But it’s still Emmy—her head and torso, at least. And a little piece of movie history is now on display for anyone to see.","After a string of highly successful films that started way back in 1931, the legendary Bette Davis made a seamless transition to television in the early fifties. When she returned to film about a decade later in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?, the actress found that she had become a bit of a horror movie icon. Never one to disappoint her fans, Davis followed up with another spooky film in 1964 when she played a pair of twins in Dead Ringer.\nDead Ringer begins with Margaret DeLorca (Davis) at the funeral of her dead husband, Frank. At the graveyard, Margaret encounters her estranged twin sister, Edith Phillips (also Davis), who accompanies Margaret back to her mansion. Edith accuses Margaret of simply going through the motions of mourning, claiming that she never loved Frank. Edith believes that she should have been the one to end up with Frank, accusing Margaret of tricking the man into marrying her by faking a pregnancy. When Edith returns home to her tiny apartment above a jazz nightclub that she owns, she is given an eviction notice. Desperate, Edith coaxes Margaret into coming over to her place. When Margaret arrives, Edith kills her and swaps places, setting it up to appear that Edith has committed suicide. Edith takes over Margaret’s life, but arouses suspicion with Margaret’s housekeepers. Not only does Margaret’s staff suspect something is wrong, but Edith’s boyfriend, a police inspector named Sergeant Jim Hobbson (Karl Malden from “The Streets of San Francisco”), smells something fishy as well. As Edith struggles to convince people that she is Margaret, she quickly realizes that her sister did not have the idyllic life that she thought she did. As secrets are divulged and details start to surface, Edith’s charade becomes more than a matter of money and comfort; it becomes a matter of life and death.\nOften seen as a classic of film noir, Dead Ringer has all of the conventions of a great crime film. The script, written by television writers Albert Beich (“Mannix“) and Oscar Millard (“The Alfred Hitchcock Hour”) from a story by Rian James (42nd Street), is full of surprises and twists that keep the viewer guessing until the final scene. The film was directed by Paul Henreid, a man who is much better known as an actor, particularly for his role as Victor Laszlo in Casablanca. Henreid takes the suspenseful script and gets his actors to pour their performances right up to the edge without going over, making Dead Ringer a perfect combination of crime drama and horror flick.\nBecause of her unique mixture of distinct looks and over-the-top mannerisms, Bette Davis is the queen of camp. The only thing campier than a Bette Davis horror performance is two Bette Davis horror performances, and Dead Ringer has them. Davis is a perfect antagonist in the film, playing both parts so well that it’s often difficult to pick sides; both women are reprehensible. Initially, the audience feels for Edith as the cruel and unfeeling Margaret treats her with contempt. The villainy shifts when Edith commits her murder, however, leaving neither woman as a sympathetic character. When all is said and done, Bette Davis has masterfully created two terrible characters in Dead Ringer, and the audience is satisfied with both of their comeuppances.\nDead Ringer was shot by cinematographer Ernest Haller, the man who photographed such Hollywood classics as Gone with the Wind and Rebel Without a Cause. He was also the man who shot A Stolen Life, another film in which Bette Davis played twins in 1946, so he knew a thing or two about carbon copying the actress. The effect is achieved through a slick combination of body double usage and split-screen trickery that is pretty convincing, considering the lack of CG technology in the sixties. As much fun as the visual effects are, cloning Bette Davis was not Haller’s only contribution to the atmosphere and style of the film. His stylistic use of active lighting breathes plenty of life into the picture, with setups that change when characters flicks on lamps or light cigarettes. Haller is a master at painting with light and, although Dead Ringer is not one of his household name credits, his work on the film is spectacular.\nThe soundtrack to Dead Ringer, credited to André Previn (Rollerball, Bad Day at Black Rock), is a mix of innovative harpsichord flourishes and straight-up suspenseful horror fare. The score is fresh without sounding too left-of-center, punctuating the visuals without distracting from the film. The music that is featured in Edith’s jazz club is provided by an uncredited jazz combo consisting of organist Perry Blackwell and drummer Kenny Dennis, and the tunes that they supply are exactly what one could expect to hear in such an establishment. Between Previn’s film score and the jazz combo’s diegetic music, Dead Ringer boasts a soundtrack that is more memorable than its contemporaries.\nBette Davis would go on to follow up Dead Ringer with another horror classic, teaming up again with Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? director Robert Aldrich for Hush…Hush, Sweet Charlotte. Although Dead Ringer sits unsung between these two higher-profile horror masterpieces, it is every bit as intriguing, if not quite as frightening."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1e4f7ad5-7e50-4df8-a9c8-7fc10e18f015>","<urn:uuid:9e88051b-ceb0-4c69-94c9-8aea12a57995>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does enzyme bioelectrocatalysis contribute to sustainable energy production and what are its key applications?","answer":"Enzyme bioelectrocatalysis plays a vital role in sustainable energy production through several key applications. It serves as the core technology for devices such as biofuel cells and biosensors, which are important for sustainable energy production and sensing. The technology can accomplish sophisticated reactions including chiral compound synthesis, CO2 fixation, and N2 fixation. Additionally, redox enzymes serve as inspiration for developing new non-noble metal electrocatalysts. The process is particularly advantageous because it features mild operating conditions and high selectivity.","context":["Special Issue \"Enzymatic Bioelectrocatalysis\"\nDeadline for manuscript submissions: closed (31 March 2021) | Viewed by 26849\nA printed edition of this Special Issue is available here.\nInterests: bioelectrochemistry; redox protein; redox enzyme; hydrogenase; multi copper oxidase; electrode nanostructuration; biofuel cells\nFeaturing a mild process and high selectivity, enzyme bioelectrocatalysis employing oxidoreductases immobilized on conductive surfaces is increasingly playing a vital role in a wide scope of applications. Enzyme bioelectrocatalysis is the core for devices such as biosensors and biofuel cells, which are drawing considerable attention towards sustainable sensing and energy production. A wide range of sophisticated reactions, such as chiral compound synthesis and CO2 and N2 fixation, can be accomplished with enzyme bioelectrocatalysis. Last but not least, redox enzymes are sources of inspiration for new non-noble metal electrocatalysts.\nFundamental investigations are required to alleviate the main limitations of enzyme bioelectrocatalysis, i.e., low catalytic efficiency and weak stability. In addition to the investigation of mechanisms of enzyme electrocatalysis, the molecular basis knowledge of the efficient electronic communication between enzymes and a conductive electrode is a mandatory step. Electrochemistry coupling with other in situ spectroscopic methods, as well as theoretical modeling, is expected to bring forth a fundamental understanding of enzyme conformation and dynamics on the electrode. Nanostructured electrodes and materials are significantly pushing enzyme bioelectrocatalysis forward but need further investigation to determine the molecular basis for bioelectrocatalysis optimization and stabilization. New enzyme identification in biodiversity and enzyme engineering will certainly enhance the toolbox of bioelectrochemists for high performance. Enzyme cascade broadens the scope of biocatalysis, which has also seen tremendous progress recently.\nThe Special Issue will focus on fundamentals, developments, and applications of enzyme bioelectrocatalysis.

{"question":"What are the key differences between using a tripod versus a monopod for camera stabilization in long-exposure photography?","answer":"Tripods and monopods offer different levels of stabilization for photography. A tripod provides complete stabilization that allows for very slow shutter speeds and completely blur-free images, making it essential for long exposures up to 1/2 minute, night photography, and star images. Tripods consist of two main parts - the leg set and the head - and can be used with various accessories like quick release systems. In contrast, a monopod, while more limited, still aids significantly in obtaining sharper images but will not stabilize a camera to the same extent as a tripod. For situations requiring less stability, some cameras have image stabilization or vibration reduction built into lenses, which can extend handheld shooting times from 1/100 second to possibly 1/10 or 1/5 second by compensating for camera movement.","context":["Supporting the Camera\nTripod leg sets vary in their height, stability, weight, and ease of use. Courtesy of Gitzo.\nThe tripod head is used to position the camera and lock it in place. Courtesy of Gitzo\nIf your camera has a hot shoe, a bubble level can ensure your camera is absolutely level.\nA quick release system lets you quickly mount and unmount a camera on a tripod head.\nA cable release (top) or wireless remote control (bottom) lets you trigger the shutter from a distance.\nMost cameras have a selftimer\nAny camera or subject movement when the shutter is open will cause some blur in the image. It may not be noticeable at some image sizes, but it will be there. In the digital desktop studio, the subject rarely moves so if you can keep the camera from moving your images are guaranteed to be free of blur even at slow shutter speeds. There are two parts to this equation, securely mounting the camera and then triggering the shutter without introducing motion through camera shake.\nTo securely mount a camera for studio photography, you use a support of some kind. These come in a bewildering variety of sizes and styles. The largest type, called a studio stand, is rock solid but impractical for most users due to its size and cost. The common tripod is widely used in studios and comes in two parts—the leg set and the head. Leg sets vary in stability and ease of use, as well as how high they can be raised. Heads vary in their ease of use, especially when making fine adjustments in the camera's position. Many tripods have accessories. One that's popular in the studio is a horizontal bar that cantilevers the camera out and away from the tripod so you can shoot straight down.\nA quick release system lets you mount and unmount a camera quickly and easily. Once you have used one of these you will wonder how you ever lived without it. One of these systems has two parts. A clamp mounts on the tripod and a plate screws into the camera's tripod mount. To mate the two, you slide the plate into the clamp and tighten it in place with a screw or clamp. To release it you just press a button or lever.\nTo trigger the camera's shutter without moving the camera even slightly, you need a self-timer, remote control, or cable release. One of the best solutions, and one that's available on every camera, is the self-timer. When you turn it on and then press the shutter button, about 10 seconds pass before the picture is taken. During this time, the camera should become very stable as any vibrations subside.\nKeep in mind that it can be very difficult to evaluate image sharpness on the camera's monitor unless you zoom the image in playback mode. Even then, very subtle blur won't show until you enlarge the image on your computer.\nA horizontal bar lets you shoot straight down on a subject.\nStudio stands (right) are heavyweight camera supports fit only for use in large studios.","To obtain a stable camera for long exposures, the tripod is only part of the overall picture. There are many accessories to add to your tripod to make your photographic life easier and to make your images even sharper.\nWhen you purchase your camera it will come with a standard 1/4″-20 screw socket for mounting to the tripod, this is somewhat inconvenient if you need to quickly mount the camera to the tripod.\nI do prefer a tripod in many situations. Some examples of where I find a tripod useful and in some cases essential are as follows:\nWhen using a long telephoto lens.\nWith Macro photography a tripod can greatly increase your success rate.\nWhere you want to carefully frame an image, a tripod is very useful, especially for landscape images.\nLong time exposures require a tripod. Sometimes I may use a 10-stop Neutral Density (ND) filter for water scenes, resulting in exposures several minutes long.\nNight photography. Even though cameras now can use extremely hig ISO settings a tripod can be very handy for night images and is essential for star images at night.\nThe movement of water can help to create interesting images. In order to capture images such as these it is essential to use a tripod, as shutter speeds close to 1 second or greater will be required. Generally a shutter speed of 1/8 of a second will start to blur the moving water, but with a tripod any shutter speeds up to 1/2 minute can be tried.\nA tripod will make a significant improvement to the sharpness of many images. Generally a tripod will comprise two main parts, the main part comprising the three legs and the upper part comprising the head to allow movement of the camera. A tripod is very usefull in obtaining sharp landscape images and also very usefull… Continue reading Using a Tripod\nMany images will be improved if a monopod is used to stabilise the camera and lens. A monopod will not stabilise a camera to the same extent as a tripod, however it will aid significantly in obtaining sharper images. The monopod illustrated below can be used by itself or it can be used in conjunction… Continue reading Using a Monopod\nLong ExposuresLong exposure photography is generally refered to when the photographer uses shutter speeds greater than can be hand held and still get sharp images. There are several options to turn to when this occurs.\nImage Stabilization or Vibration Reduction which is built into some lenses, will assist in allowing the use of longer exposure times, in some circumstances this can be by the equivalent of three to four stops. This means that a shutter speed which would normally 1/100 of a second hand held could be extended to possibly 1/10 or 1/5 of a second, using one of these lenses. Image stabilization lenses compensate for the movement of the camera and lens by moving an element inside the lens to stabilize for any movement of the image at the sensor plane. Image stabilization or vibration reduction can be very usefull in longer lenses from 100mm and upwards.\nWould you like to capture a full frame image of a dangerous creature or a shy animal or bird. It is quite easy if you use a remote camera release. Today there are many types of remote releases available for cameras, there are cable releases, infra red or radio controlled releases.

{"question":"How does El Niño compare to North Atlantic climate patterns in affecting European weather?","answer":"El Niño and North Atlantic patterns affect European weather differently. While El Niño can cause global temperature rises of up to 0.3°C and has global teleconnections, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the main driver of climate variability in Northwest Europe specifically. The NAO determines the strength of westerly winds off the Atlantic, with positive NAO leading to mild, wet winters and negative NAO resulting in cold, dry winters. The climate in Europe is strongly influenced by North Atlantic conditions, which show very high predictability on the decadal time scale compared to other regions of the globe.","context":["The goal of MiKlip Module C is to, for the first time, systematically regionalise decadal predictions. The downscaling is expected to support the supply of climate-information for relevant regions in a resolution that is required by many commercial users. Eight projects were involved in Module C during the first phase of MiKlip. The downscaling was achieved by decadal simulations with regional climate models (RCMs), which were driven with data from the global ensemble of MiKlip climate predictions of the MPI-ESM at the boundaries of the model region.\nTo evaluate the expected quality of a future prediction, simulations of past periods (here 1960-2010), so called “hindcasts”, were performed. The regionalization of ensembles represents with an additional computational effort, which makes it essential to show improvement or at least preservation in skill through the application of regionalization. The processes in the climate system, which contribute to decadal predictability, run at a global scale (approximately ocean currents or planetary waves in the atmosphere). Thus their origin is more often beyond the limited model space of the RCMs, and the information has to be transferred from the driving global-model across the regional model edges. However, smaller-scale processes plays an important role for regional climate and RCMs can better reproduce characteristics such as regional topography or state and classification of soil in the region. In Module C there are three main focus areas in which different regional and thematic aspects were investigated:\nExamination of decadal climate variability has shown that the north Atlantic, compared to the rest of the globe has very high predictability on this time scale. Since the climate in Europe is strongly influenced by North-Atlantic, it should as a consequence be possible to find predictability over land.\nRegionalization with dynamical RCMs\nTo use a regional prediction system efficiently, several aspects were considered: It can be pointed out, that RCMs in contrast to the global model have generally perceived and partially increased predictive skill in Europe and in many cases even better reproduced the climate parameters after regionalization. In Figure 1, summer mean temperatures for the first five years are shown as example, of how well the observed climate variability in the period of 1960-2010 is represented by regional(left) and global(right) ensembles. The correlation of the two ensembles (top) with observations provides comparable results. Positive correlation can be found in most parts of Europe. The lower half shows “reliability”, a number for the confidence of the ensemble. The Metric expresses if the distribution of probabilities of a climate parameter is in balanced relation to the model error. Best values would therefore be zero, contrary to the correlation where higher values represent better results. Through regionalization reliability is enhanced in many regions.\nThere were also studies on the impact of model resolution, the composition of ensembles with only one or various RCM as also the importance of ensemble-size. Potential added value of regionalization appears also in the prediction of user relevant climate-parameters such as heat waves, heavy precipitations or wind blasts.\nRegionalisierung mit einem statistisch-dynamischen Verfahren\nNeben dem direkten dynamischen Downscaling wurde in Modul C auch ein Verfahren zum statistisch-dynamischen Downscaling (SDD) getestet, dass, wenn es auf bestimmte Klima-Parameter optimiert wird, eine Regionalisierung mit geringerem Aufwand ermöglicht. Mit SDD kann so eine gewisse Vorhersagbarkeit der Häufigkeit von Windstürmen und des Windenergie-Potentials einige Jahre im Voraus erreicht werden (Reyers et al., 2015). Abbildung 2 verdeutlicht am Beispiel der zweiten MiKlip Ensemble-Generation (baseline1) die Vorhersagegüte für das Windenergiepotential in Mitteleuropa für den Zeitraum 1979 - 2010. Die Vorhersagegüte ist hier definiert über das Verhältnis der mittleren quadratische Fehler des Ensemblemittels (MSESS) der Hindcasts und un-initialisierten Klima-Projektionen, in die keine Informationen über den beob-achteten Anfangszustand eingeflossen sind. Einen Mehrwert liefern die Hindcasts, wenn der MSESS positiv ist (rote Farben), keinen Mehrwert hat man bei negativen Werten (blaue Farben). Positive Ergebnisse finden sich vor allem nahe den Küsten von Nord- und Ostsee für den Mit-telwert über die ersten 4 Jahre der Vorhersagen (Abbildung 2 links). Für längere Vorhersage-Zeiträume werden die Ergebnisse schlechter (Abbildung 2 Mitte und rechts).\nThe Project DEPARTURE explores the decadal predictability oft he West African Monsoon precipitation and the Atlantic hurricane activity. For a variety of decades in the hindcast cycle global simulations of the coupled climate model MPI-ESM based on the three regional climate models REMO, CCLM and WRF with 50 km resolution were regionalized. Furthermore REMO was coupled with a global ocean model and CCLM was driven with improved boundary conditions(aerosols, sea surface temperatures (SSTs), vegetation, land use) and soil initialization for selected decades, to make advantage of the potential skill of ocean, atmosphere and land.\nWest African Monsoon\nThe Results of several RCMs with improved initial and boundary conditions regarding absolute bias and decadal predictability of the west African Monsoon precipitation can be summarized as follows: The Bias of the RCMs simulated west African monsoon precipitation shows in contrast to MPI-ESM an added value in west and central Sahel, but a clear gain of the warm-bias on the coast of guinea, which is based on too warm SSTs in Southeast-Atlantic. The ocean coupling of REMO can sharply improve this SST Bias and the precipitation bias over the guinea coast (Figure 3, left and middle). On top of that precipitation bias can be reduced in each region through different boundary conditions (Guinea-Coast: SSTs and land cover, central Sahel: vegetation, west Sahel: aerosols).\nThe decadal predictability of the West African monsoon precipitation over a whole decade commonly shows an added value in single RCMSs, but the positive correlation is not significant and variations between individual decades. The intradecadal predictability in the analysed decades and the interdecadal predictability between those decades reveal statistically more robust results and a clear added value for at least one RCM in each region.\nAtlantic tropical storms\nRegarding the Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes all uncoupled RCMs display a positive Bias in the simulated quantity and intensity, which can be also considerably reduced through ocean coupling with REMO (figure 3, right). The decadal predictability of both variables exhibits some improvements through ocean coupling but rarely reaches statistical relevance and fluctuates heavily between the decades.\nThe seasonal to interanual development of weather in Europe is shaped by the long-term-variability and large-scale dynamic in general and in the north Atlantic in particular. The large-scale dynamic in the north Atlantic is not only determined through the large-scale interaction between earth-system components such as ocean and atmosphere and the global phenomena in different regions of the earth but also through the quasi steady interaction with small-scale phenomena (so called mesoscale, in scopes of kilometres to several 100 kilometres). For the weather in Europe upwind interactions have particular importance.\nIn climate models the frequency and duration of heat waves in summer and cold periods in winter is underestimated. The reason lies presumably in the underestimation of frequency and intensity of, in lower latitudes arising and in the north Atlantic propagating, cyclones and anticyclones, in the earth-system-models. The formation of evolution of cyclones and anticyclones is partially mesoscale and can therefore not be captured correctly by climate models, because simulation is not explicitly realized on that scale. Successful improvements in the statistic of large-scale weather conditions could be a critical step for improvements on interannual to decadal prediction.\nAs a result of restricted computational resources it will not be possible in the foreseeable future to simulate mesoscales explicitly in global climate simulations. However it is possible, to calculate these scales in a spatially confined area explicitly, e.g. the north Atlantic. In the context of MiKlip the MiKlip models which have been tested multiple times will be coupled for their respective scale, so that mesoscale dynamics in the coupled area can react upon the large scale dynamic. Therefore the regional climate model COSMO-CLM for the region Central America to north Atlantic (CANA, see figure 4) will be configured and with the help of the recently developed parallelized coupler OASIS3-MCT coupled to the global earth system model MPI-ESM.\nMesoscale Feedback and large-scale dynamics in the north Atlantic\nFigure 4 shows a clear underestimation of cyclone-storm tracks-density through the MPI-ESM(left) and the corresponding raise in cyclone frequency through TWC (right). A promising second result is shown in figure 5. The MPI-ESM underestimates the blocking-rate about 25% in contrast to ERAInterim in the mid latitudes at 20° West to 20° East. This underestimation is not present with T\nIt can be demonstrated, that mesoscale simulations of cyclone-development in the Atlantic can correct a number of known deficits in the large scale dynamic of the north Atlantic. This can be accomplished by slight increase in resources, which is equivalent to an increase of the global model by the factor of 1.2. The model concept can basically be applied on other relevant regions-\nMieruch, S., Feldmann, H., Schädler, G., Lenz, C.-J., Kothe, S., and Kottmeier, C.: The regional MiKlip decadal forecast ensemble for Europe: the added value of downscaling, Geosci.

And could 20 th century warming also be a natural variation?\nCauses of natural climate variability ‘External’ forcing of the climate system: –Ice ages are caused by changes in Earth’s orbit (Sun- Earth distance, angle of rotation axis, …) – but these changes occur slowly on long timescales (~10,000- 100,000 years) – too slow to explain recent changes –Large volcanic eruptions –Solar variability ‘Internal’ climate system variability (chaos due to non-linear interactions of a complex system) –El Niño, North Atlantic Oscillation\nSolar forcing of climate Sunspots The energy output of the Sun shows slight fluctuations as the number of sunspots varies\nSunspots discovered around 1610 by Harriot / Galileo Typically the diameter of the Earth. Slightly cooler regions of the photosphere. Associated with convection in the Sun’s interior. Confusingly, more sunspots correspond to more energy output from the Sun.\nSun-spots show a regular 11-year cycle, but also longer-term cycles\nEl Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ENSO is one of the main causes of global climate variability. But what is El Nino?

{"question":"What are the market consequences of quality uncertainty in exchanges, and what modern approaches exist for achieving mutually beneficial pricing agreements?","answer":"Quality uncertainty in markets leads to several negative consequences: reduced transaction volume, potential market failure, and the phenomenon of 'bad driving out the good' where poor quality products dominate the market. This occurs because sellers have incentives to market inferior merchandise when buyers cannot distinguish quality before purchase. To address this, modern approaches focus on achieving mutually beneficial pricing agreements through principled negotiation. This includes understanding buyer motivations, separating emotional aspects from the problem, focusing on interests rather than positions, and creating options for mutual gain. The approach emphasizes value-based discussions over pure price haggling, with firms needing to understand consumer choice behavior and their Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) to reach satisfactory outcomes.","context":["A seminal paper by this title published by George A. Akerlof in 1970 was so influential in helping analysts analyze quality and uncertainty in markets under conditions of asymmetrical information flow that in 2001, George A. Akerlof was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics. His paper has been singular in analyzing markets ranging from the used car market to health insurance markets. After being awarded the Nobel Prize, Akerlof penned an interpretive essay on this paper and it can be found [here].\nI have since read his 1970 paper and would like to share the wonderful and thought provoking points he makes by reviewing his paper. In the next section, I will try to give the interested reader a brief run through of the philosophy of Akerlof’s theory. Most of the subsequent sections will be taken right out of his paper simplified, expanded and presented. Of course, he does assume (and so will I) that his readers have been blessed with some exposure to basic economic verbiage. I will provide the necessary information and references to background wherever necessary. I must bring to your notice that most of the language will be his but I will provide explanations/analogies to make things (seemingly) simpler.\nA Brief Run Through:\nIn the seminal paper on markets with asymmetric information, George Akerlof strives to provide “a structure for determining the economic costs of dishonesty”. He points out two possible outcomes that may occur where sellers have better information about the quality of products than do buyers. There are many markets in which buyers use some market statistic to judge the quality of prospective purchases. In these cases, there is incentive for sellers to market poor quality merchandise - if buyers cannot distinguish the quality until after the purchase is made, there is no incentive for the sellers to provide good quality products and the average quality of traded goods will decline below the socially optimal level. This is often referred to as “bad driving out the good”. The explanation for this course of events is fairly logical – if all sellers, despite having the information advantage, traded only in high quality goods then average quality of goods in the market will go up, prizes will stabilize leaving a small operating and profit margin. If under these conditions, a seller makes use of his informational advantage to sell a poor quality product – his profits are much higher and the buyer in his position has no way of determining the quality until after the sale has been made. In Akerlof’s own language – “…. the returns for good quality accrue mainly to the entire group whose statistic is affected rather than to the individual seller.” Akerlof cited the used car market as an example for his findings – in the case of used cars, buyers who find out much to their chagrin that they are now the proud new owners of a “lemon” will now attempt to sell it to an unsuspecting buyer (such as themselves) in the used car market. As this continues, more lemons make their way to the market and not only does the quality decline but the market itself is threatened as all buyers are wary and there exists a huge disparity between the number of sellers and buyers. Contributing to the declining quality of this market are owners of “creampuff”(s) who do not sell their cars as they are indistinguishable from lemons and the price is dictated by the demand for cars which the buyers suspect to be primarily lemons. Thus, this information asymmetry leads to quality uncertainty which in turn leads to reduced volume of transactions thereby threatening the very survival of the market itself.\nA second possibility as suggested by Akerlof is that institutions may develop to counteract the effects of quality uncertainty. Warranties and brand names can be used to give the buyer an assurance of quality. These institutions may prevent good products from being driven out of the market but will not necessarily eliminate the inefficiency. These institutions may be costly to set up, run and sellers may over invest in signaling the quality of their product to buyers.\nStabilization (not necessarily efficient) of the market can be attributed to the development of counteracting institutions. The provision of warranties and the seller’s concern for his reputation may prevent sellers from supplying inferior quality products. Another possibility is that the buyer has somehow stabilized the initial information asymmetry by obtaining additional information enabling him to use a more global market statistic to evaluate the quality of the product prior to sale. The market is still deemed inefficient if this stabilization is achieved through costly counteracting institutions or through expensive information search by buyers. In the context of the used car market, this explains the existence of “information stabilizers” such as Kelly’s Blue Book, Car Fax etc.\nI hope everyone appreciates the theory so far. If you have ever bought a used car, you can analyze for yourselves why you did what you did – paid to go through car fax reports, paid mechanics to give a prospective car a once over to ease your fears – all in your attempt to equalize the information flow in the market.\nI will post more technical details in upcoming posts.","The Importance of Negotiating Power in Pricing: The Principled Negotiation Approach\nAt the most recent Business Marketing Conference in Chicago, IL, I listened to the pre-conference address on customer controlled demand management by Integrated Marketing Communications professor Donald Schultz. The primary take away from the presentation involved the disaggregation of consumer markets based on the increase of customer awareness and network spillover effects. Knowledgeable consumers armed with information regarding potential purchases from product reviews, existing customer’s opinions, and trial offers are eliminating asymmetric information between buyers and sellers found in the traditional markets and evolving into a segment of their own. Firm’s standing market strategies may be insufficient in effectively segmenting markets due to the granularity of consumer’s preferences.\nFirms are beginning to face more elastic individual demand curves in consumer markets based solely on information availability. Instead of price derivation through market dynamics, firms are facing pressure on the individual level. Firms are realizing the difficulties involved with developing price structures that properly allocate customers into segments based on their willingness to pay. The growing importance of negotiation in determining price on a one-off basis is becoming more prevalent. Consumer’s latitude in purchasing power has continuously increased over the years due to new means of social interactions. Firms embracing individualized markets consisting of one consumer and defining the customer’s buying behavior will be better positioned to adapt to the changing business environment.\nEssentially, transactions occur between buyers and sellers. The existence of a market rests on a double coincidence of needs occurring. A buyer wants a good or services to eliminate a pain point or gain utility. A seller wants money and is willing to deliver a good or services in exchange for compensation. A double coincidence of wants defines a market opportunity, not necessarily the transaction. The transaction will only occur if an agreement on terms can be established. Such terms include, price, delivery, transaction costs, etc.\nUsually the most important negotiation lever and reason for transaction failure is price. From a positional perspective, buyers tend to demand the lowest price and search for the highest value, where as sellers want the highest price for their offering. Clearly, each participant in the transaction has defined boundaries. Consumers are usually bounded from free to their reservation price (Maximum willingness to pay). Seller’s range of potential agreement prices are from their reservation price (Minimum willingness to accept) and infinity. Exhibit 1 shows the creation of the Zone of Potential Agreements (ZOPA) based on the intersection of the buyers and sellers behavior parameters.\nExhibit 1: Zone of Potential Agreement\nOnly when a positive ZOPA exists do transactions have the chance to occur. If a negative ZOPA exists, when the buyer’s reservation price is lower than the reservation price of the seller, the transaction does not even enter a negotiation. Price facilitates mutually beneficial exchange (1). The question at hand asks how price can be used in negotiation to ensure transactions occur.\nMy recent interest in negotiation strategy according to price has stemmed from several academic articles and one suggested read. The national bestseller, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In (2), by Roger Fisher and William Ury offers a unique applied approach to understanding how to reach a “wise” agreement. According to Fisher and Ury, a wise agreement improves both parties relationship by offering a fair and lasting solution. Determining how to achieve a wise agreement solely by negotiating price will be the objective of the remaining portion of the article. Firm side negotiating will be the primary focus.\nAs mentioned in Getting to Yes, price haggling is a form of positional bargaining where both parties defend their opening position and try to agree upon a new position as the end solution. In the standard price negotiation, the seller’s position is quite higher than their reservation price and in some instances well above the buyer’s maximum willingness to pay. The initial position of the buyer is usually at a price of zero. Positional negotiations may lead to solutions but they tend to offer less than desired outcomes due to neglecting both parties’ interest and possibly destroying future relationships.\nA principled negotiation, introduced by the Harvard Negotiation Project, hinges on four key principles; (1) separate the people from the problem, (2) focus on interests, not positions, (3) invent options for mutual gain, and (4) insist on using objective criteria. Applying a principled negotiation tactic to price negotiation allows for a mutually beneficial exchange.\nSeparate the People from the Problem\nPeople problems usually undermine the effectiveness of wise negotiation outcomes. A solid relationship between parties based off past interactions or mutual respect is a good starting ground for the onset of the negotiation. Viewing the other party as a partner instead of an opposing party increases the probability of achieving a wise agreement. Trying to understand where the other participant is coming from and their side of the story helps develop appreciation and crafting potential offers. Accepting the presence of emotions and trying to decipher the origination of the feelings and how it ties to the party’s actions provides useful insight. Most importantly be a listener and truly understand the other party’s statements before developing your own.\nWhen engaged in a price discussion over a potential transaction buyers and sellers need to understand the internal drivers present. A seller might need to evaluate the buyer and put themselves in the opposite position. Knowing the buyer might feel hesitant to trust, anxious about spending money, not being exactly certain what they desire, etc. are all possibly emotions. Communicating price transparency and understanding what the customer desires through words is the key to recognizing potential product solutions. Sellers demonstrating passion for products and being forefront with intentions seem to make a better connection with buyers.\nFocus on Interests, Not Positions\nPositions are defined by interests. Negotiators establish their positions by what motivates them. Moving away from positional bargaining where it forces people to give up their initial stance, to aligning interests for common benefit is supported. Parties that leave their founded position seem to experience a losing sentiment.\nBusiness executives negotiating price should learn what drives consumer’s decision of position. Why does a consumer want to pay well below my reservation price? Identifying what motivates customer’s choice of position enables firms to help them achieve underlying goals. Maybe a cost conscience customer has a low willingness to pay position due to not having much income or a wide array of substitutes. Understanding the value consumers place on a product will ultimately help in negotiating the price. Taking the time to develop a full scope of the consumer’s buying incentives and how much satisfaction they will receive through consumption enlightens pricing latitude.\nInvent Options for Mutual Gain\nFisher and Ury foster idea creation through informal brainstorming events where both sides can think of potential outcomes and not be judged. During the idea generation process, no one party should criticize the other’s proposals. An environment teaming with creativity and openness supports the formation of a healthy possibility list. Once the list is established both parties can evaluate and determine which proposal seems to best fit both side’s interest. The pairing down of the potential agreement list should be agreed upon by both parties and should be looked as a way to come closer to mutual solution. Components of a proposal that the other party feels strong about should not be attacked. Look for solutions that are important to the partner but not as significant to you. These occurrences can help move closer to a wise decision.\nDeveloping a list of potential outcomes during a price negotiation can take on a variety of forms. Understanding why consumers offer such price outcomes proves useful in seeing what motivates their purchasing behavior. For example, a customer might feel an add-on component to a base model increases the value of the entire offering significantly. Yet the marginal cost of the add-on product to the supplier is almost negligible. This would be an excellent negotiation starting place. Demonstrating to the consumer that you are willing to add an extra component to the base at no additional charge for their agreement to pay a non-discounted price for the base is a win-win solution.\nInsist on using Objective Criteria\nMoving away from subjective reasoning when nailing down an agreement and focusing on an agreed upon objective criteria establishes a benchmark. Not deviating away from the pre-established objective benchmark when negotiating allows for a focused agenda. Keeping an open mind to the other party’s suggestions and not allowing exogenous variables to affect decision making is the key to selecting a wise agreement, even if interests are not aligned.\nDetermining objective criteria for price negotiations takes the form of researching industry norms and previous transactions. Creating a resolution technique in the event of parties’ interests clashing provides a way to get past the obstacle without losing sight of the end objective.\nNegotiation solely on the pricing lever can achieve a wise agreement under the principled negotiation practice. In order to move past the stigma of price haggling and realize an outcome that is mutually beneficial, value derived from consumption needs to be emphasized. Value is another means of expressing price and seems to be less confrontational.\nWhen it boils down, consumers want a product that makes their life easier. Firms want to provide a product to a consumer in exchange for compensation. The transfer of value from the firm to the consumer for an agreed upon price is the end goal. Buyers and sellers enter price negotiations in order to agree on the amount of value provided at the appropriate price.\nUnderstanding consumer’s choice behavior based on their desired interests is an excellent starting place for negotiation. Why is the consumer engaging the seller? What does the buyer require from the potential product purchase? Why is the product of value to the consumer? What comparable alternatives exist to my product? Answers to these types of questions define a consumer’s willingness to pay and helps better approximate a consumer’s Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA). Pushing past customary positions and getting at the heart of value, brings negotiations closer to resolution.\n- Tim J. Smith, Managing Principal of Wiglaf Pricing\n- Fisher, Roger, and William Ury.

{"question":"What are the technological innovations in modern SONAR systems for underwater detection, and how do these systems impact marine life in our increasingly noisy oceans?","answer":"Modern SONAR systems employ cognitive systems and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology, featuring multiple hydrophones for sending and receiving signals. These systems use beamformers, correlation matrices, and CFAR detection algorithms to estimate target angles, distances, and speeds. They include tracking algorithms based on Kalman filtering and can distinguish between 'interesting' and 'non-interesting' targets. However, these technological advances contribute to the growing issue of underwater noise pollution. Man-made noise, including from military activities and sonar systems, can cause severe impacts on marine life. Animals may experience temporary or permanent hearing damage, with some cases resulting in complete deafness or death. The noise can also interfere with crucial animal communications, affecting their ability to find mates and detect predators.","context":["Cognitive systems have drawn the attention of researchers since several years. Different approaches have been proposed for RADAR as well as communication applications and recently also for SONAR systems. In contrast to a classical SONAR system the operator does not need to adjust the system parameters to account for changes in the environment or consider the potential type of the target (e.g. mammal, diver, submarine, etc.) to achieve an increased performance of the system regarding detection and tracking. Cognitive systems are capable to achieve such a performance gain without the assistance of a human being but essentially due to a feedback loop of the receive signal processing to the transmit signal processing. The cognition of the system is achieved by a control unit which extracts the relevant information and adapts the parameters of the system according to a certain pattern.\nThis promising approach is extended by the idea of MIMO signal processing. The usage of this, in the field of SONAR systems novel technique, reveals a vast number of possible improvements which are subject to research at the chair of digital signal processing and system theory. As the chair has dedicated himself to real-time processing the above mentioned theoretical approaches are finally fit into our own real-time capable framework KiRAT.\nIn this project, a MIMO system, consisting of a multitude of sending and receiving hydrophones as well as a PC-based signal processing hardware, is realized. In a first stage, the received hydrophone signals are processed by a multitude of beamformers. Each beamformer output signal is correlated with the send-signal sequence without modifications as well as with several temporally compressed and stretched versions. By analyzing the resulting three-dimensional correlation matrix using a CFAR detection algorithm, the angle(s) of arrival, the radial distance(s), and the radial target speed(s) can be estimated. In the picture on the top you see the graphical user interface that was implemented to visualize the detection results.\nIn order to improve the detection rate, a basic tracking algorithm based on Kalman filtering and multi-hypothesis tracking, is implemented. Tracked targets are distinguished between “interesting” and “non-interesting” (e.g. stationary, known) targets by a dedicated decision unit. In order to improve the detection of weak ”interesting” targets masked by strong ”non-interesting” targets, a sending beamformer is used to block the emission of sound into the direction of the ”non-interesting” targets. Due to the drawback of becoming blind towards some directions, blocking and omni-directional send modes are used alternatingly. In order to achieve a sufficient real-time performance, extensive frequency-domain processing and processor-specific code optimization are utilized.\nBeside that multi-channel system described above we also investigate single-channel systems that are used for either classifying received sounds stemming from marine mamals or for speech communcation between e.g. divers.\nB.

Waves and water turbulences are just some example of physical sources of sounds, but physical sources are not the only ones. An immense variety of aquatic animals depends on sounds for activities that are crucial for their survival, and their vocalisations are called by scientists “biophony” (the symphony of life). Marine mammals are the ocean’s most famous singers, but fish vocalise too. More than 800 species of fish depend on sounds to survive and reproduce. Fish sound production is especially conspicuous during the reproductive season and is typically related to agonistic interactions and mating activities.\nIn the last fifty years, human activities have radically changed aquatic environments by adding incredibly numerous sources of noise. Small boats, commercial boats, seismic exploration, military activities, windfarms, pile driving…anything but a “silent world”, we are actually creating an ocean of noise. The most common man-made source of noise is shipping. The rumble of engines, propellers, and other commercial shipping noise can be heard in virtually every corner of the ocean. In a world in which 80% of global trading takes place at the sea, the number of merchant ships has tripled in the last 75 years and the number of recreational boats keeps increasing as well. Vessels noise in coastal area has become a form of chronic, constant pollution.\nAnthropogenic noise is now recognised as a significant pollutant in the marine environment, and the potential consequences for animal survival are of international concern. Some species may acclimatise to noise after chronic exposure, others may struggle to develop and survive. Considering the global extent and the wide range of effects of noise pollution on aquatic life, man-made noise has been identified as a target for the monitoring of a good quality coastal environment in both Europe and USA (e.g. inclusion in the US National Environment Policy Act and in the European Commission Marine Strategy Framework Directive).\nBut which type of effects can noise have on aquatic life? If they can, animals try to escape from noise, possibly giving up to other important activities, such as feeding and reproduction. For example, avoidance reactions to vessel noise have been noticed in several fish species such as herring, cod, rudd and roach. And if they can’t escape, physiological effects can be expected. Exposure to noise causes stress to several fish species: their heart bits quicker, they move more and their stress hormones increases. Anthropogenic noise can also have other physiological effects. The brown shrimp, for example, grows less, reproduce less and its mortality rate increases; other fish species grow less and produce less viable eggs.\nWhen the situation gets louder, an immediate physiological response has been noticed in several species: a temporary threshold shift. Is basically what happens to us after spending a night out in a really loud place, like a nightclub. For a short period of time, we do not hear very well: this happens because our hearing threshold has shifted a little bit up, meaning that the exposure to noise has temporarily compromised our hearing capabilities. Of course, if the noise is too loud or the time of exposure is prolonged, aquatic animals suffer of a permanent hearing damage: in other words, their hearing ability is permanently impaired. Sometimes, with very loud sounds like the one used in military activities and in seismic surveys, this damage can be so severe to make animals literally deaf or, worst, death. The continuous and increasing level of anthropogenic noise can also make impossible for animals to hear important signals, like predator noises or mate calls. As it happens to us when we try to speak in a noisy place, animals in a noisy environment simply do not hear each other and the communication is difficult, if not impossible. And if the communication was oriented to finding a mate…this could not lead to an unhappy ending…\nRaising our awareness to the problem of underwater noise pollution can help us lower man-made volume, in the oceans and in freshwaters. Aquatic animals would surely thank us for it!\nWant to learn more?\nCheck the video we produced, give a look to the reference lists below and…help us spreading the voice!\nProceedings of Meetings on Acoustics (4th International Conference on the Effect of Noise on Aquatic Life, 2016.

In other words, we can say that Muslims is the subset of set Islam in the case of Islam-Muslim relation. The person gives submission to the will of ALLAH and does obediently what he is obliged to do, whereas restrains himself from doing which is prohibited in the religion. If one wants to enter the religion Islam, he/she needs to believe and declare that ‘there is no God apart from ALLAH and Muhammad is the Messenger of God’,. It should be kept noted that one willing to become the good Muslim needs to follow the five pillars of Islam, and also need to follow the paths of the Last Prophet of Islam Muhammad PBUH. Shahadah, Salat (prayers), Zakat (charity), Fasting and visit to Holy Kabaah are the five pillars of Islam. The Muslims are further divided into dozens of sects, primarily there are two sects of Muslims, one is Shia, and the other is Sunni. All the sects have the similar basic belief like following the teachings of Quran, the oneness of ALLAH, and Muhammad PBUH as the last prophet.\nIslam vs. Muslim\n- Islam is the religion which obliges it followers to follow the teachings of Quran, the oneness of ALLAH, and Muhammad PBUH as the last prophet, whereas the one accepts and practices this religion is called Muslim.\n- Islam is the second largest religion as it has over 1.6 billion followers (Muslims).\n- Islam is only one, although Muslims get divided further by sects and beliefs.\n- Shahadah, Salat (prayers), Zakat (charity), Fasting and visit to Holy Kabaah are the five pillars of Islam.","IIUM ENDOWMENT FUND\nZakat is one of the pillars in Islam.

Your invocations are a source of security for them; and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.\" At-Taubah:103\nTo purify means ridding ourselves from being individualistic, greedy in ones self, while in the eyes of the poor(miskin), it is a way to purify ones self from having vengeance, jealousy, envious towards the wealthy. Cleansing one self brings about returning the rights of the poor(miskin) that has been enshrined in the wealth or income of someone.This is further cleared by Allah as follows:\n\"And in their properties there was the right of the Sail (the beggar who asks) and the Mahrum (the poor who does not ask others)\" Adz-Zaariat:19\nIn this respect, as a muslim, it is our duty to perform the zakah when we have fulfilled the conditions.\n\"Truly those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, they will have their reward with their Lord.

{"question":"What are the key differences between how heritage months handle terminology and identity labels? In Hispanic Heritage Month, what is distinction between Hispanic/Latino/Latinx terms? For Native American month, what terms are discussed for referring to Indigenous peoples? Please compare approaches to identity language.","answer":"For Hispanic Heritage Month, there are specific distinctions between identity terms: 'Hispanic' refers to Spanish-speaking individuals or those from Spanish-speaking countries, while 'Latino' refers to people from Latin American countries. 'Latinx' has emerged as a newer, gender-inclusive alternative. These terms relate to shared culture and ethnicity rather than race or physical features, though this can create some confusion since the groups are broader than ethnicity alone. For Native American Heritage Month, the documents primarily use terms like 'Native peoples,' 'Native Americans,' 'Indigenous peoples,' and specific tribal affiliations (like Diné or Navajo). The documents also reference the term 'Turtle Island' as the Indigenous name for North America or Earth, showing how terminology connects to cultural and spiritual understanding.","context":["Ways to Honor & Celebrate Native American Heritage MonthNovember is Native American Heritage Month in the US. We gathered a variety of resources to help guide respectful celebration of this month.\nNovember is Native American Heritage Month in the US. We gathered a variety of resources to help guide respectful celebration of this month.\nLearn the History of the Land\nLearn about the history of the land you’re standing on and practice Indigenous land acknowledgment. You can see what land you're occupying by visiting native-land.ca.\nIf you are in the US or Canada, you may have heard the name Turtle Island, the name for North America or the Earth. In her book of essays, Braiding Sweetgrass, writer Robin Wall Kimmerer writes about the creation of this land as an act of thanksgiving:\n“Skywoman bent and spread the mud with her hands across the shell of the turtle. Moved by the extraordinary gifts of the animals, she sang in thanksgiving and then began to dance, her feet caressing the earth. The land grew and grew as she danced her thanks, from the dab of mud on the Turtle’s back until the whole earth was made. Not by Skywoman alone, but from the alchemy of all the animals’ gifts coupled with her deep gratitude. Together they formed what we know today as Turtle Island, our home.”\nStudy to Find Organizations to Support\nEducate yourself on current problems affecting Native peoples and how you can support through mutual aid.\nThis month Xula, through the Floret Coalition is joining @4kinship to support @chizhforcheii. Chizh For Cheii is a grassroots organization with the goal of providing warmth to elders on Navajo land. Fire is crucial for cooking food and purifying hauled water for the Diné community, many of whom live in remote rural areas with no electricity and limited access to firewood. Donations fund monthly gathering and distributing of firewood, caretaking for the last remaining Navajo Code Talkers and their widow families, COVID-19 mutual aid assistance such as food boxes and water, plus yard clean up and home repairs to winterize for the cold season.\nIn November 2020 the Floret Coalition organization that we donated to supported @orendatribe's fundraiser for ADABI Healing Shelter serving the Diné people. ADABI Healing Shelter is the primary support provider for domestic violence, sexual assault, family violence, and dating violence victims in the Chinle Agency of the Navajo Nation. ADABI provides resources for advocacy, prevention, and safe home networks. The funds raised will provide PPE, food, supplies, and utilities for the shelter. The women working at ADABI are first responders doing valuable work without funding and proper protection - we ask you to join us in caring for them by raising funds for these shelters to continue their beautiful work.\nEngage and Teach\nTeach real Native history to the youth and incorporate works by Native scholars, authors and healers into instruction.\nWays to engage include:\nInvite Native speakers to school events to talk with children about Native history, including harvest feasts. November is a great time to introduce students to Indigenous peoples. It’s also important that children see Natives people as contemporary living people, not just representations in history books and in media.\nBuying books written by Native American authors or featuring Native American characters. An excellent place to start is with any book by author Louise Erdrich.\nAttend a Powwow. Powwows can be anywhere in the state and happen at varying points in the year. There are several guidelines to make sure you follow as part of powwow etiquette, which Indiana University's First Nations Educational and Cultural Center explains here.\nRespect Native belief systems as you would your own religion and honor Native veterans. If Native people and organizations ask you to stop engaging in behavior that they find insulting and offensive, listen.\nNatives served in the U.S. military in at a higher per capita rate than any other ethnic group in the 20th century, and in the military actions following September 11, 2001, Native men and women veterans served at a higher rate than veterans of all other ethnic groups, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian.\nSupport legislation and groups that assist veterans, like those that improve and expand medical services for them and combat homelessness.\nPolicy Matters—Get Political\nDemand that the U.S. Congress vote on Savanna’s Act and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).\nBoth pieces of legislation are presently stalled in the U.S. Senate. The latter has already been passed by the House of Representatives. These laws could stem the high rates of sexual violence that Native women face and provide desperately needed funding for Native communities to assist women and girls who are survivors of rape, sex trafficking, and domestic abuse. You can also help by spreading awareness about the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\nReject Racist Representation\nSupport the ongoing fight to change race-based mascots. Last month, Minnesota lieutenant governor Peggy Flanagan, who is a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, protested the R*dskins name alongside other Native leaders before a game against the Minnesota Vikings. Be vocal in your opposition, like she is. There are still public schools and colleges using race-based mascots. If you’re attending one or there’s one in your area, push them to change it.\nCenter Native Voices\nFollow Natives on social media. Here are just a few Native voices on Twitter that you should follow: @NativeApprops, @mariahgladstone, @YazzieSays, @travisxthompson, @lilnativeboy, @rebeccanagle, @apihtawikosisan, @Tileiya, @simonmoyasmith, @Terrilltf, @nick_w_estes, @agnauraqtweets, and me, @RuthH_Hopkins.

In 1968, California Congressmen George E. Brown introduced Hispanic Heritage Week to honor Latinx and Hispanic communities that were heavily represented in his East Los Angeles district. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s ushered in a new era of multiculturalism and efforts to amplify the culture and history of a diverse range of racial and ethnic groups in the United States.\nOn September 17, 1968, Congress issued a joint resolution to authorize and request President Lyndon Johnson issue annual proclamations declaring September 15 and 16 to mark the beginning of National Hispanic Heritage Week. President Johnson, and every president after, issued yearly proclamations to honor the week until 1987 when Representative Esteban E. Torres of California proposed expanding the observance period so the nation could honor, observe and develop events and activities to celebrate Hispanic achievements and culture. Under President Ronald Reagan in 1988, Hispanic Heritage Week was expanded to a full 31 days from September 15 through October 15. Those dates are significant because September 15 coincides with the national independence day of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Mexico celebrates its independence on the 16th, Chile on the 18th and Belize on the 21st.\nThe month is marked by a celebration of history, culture and contributions of generations of Hispanic and Latinx people that have shaped and influenced society\nDEFINING THE TERMS\nThe use of the term \"Hispanic\" in the recognition of the month is not without controversy. The term Hispanic refers to one who speaks Spanish or who is native to a Spanish-speaking country. While Hispanic and Latino are sometimes used interchangeably, they have different meanings. Hispanic refers to individuals who are Spanish-speaking or have a background in a Spanish-speaking country. Latino refers to those who are from or have a background in a Latin American country. The terms \"Hispanic\" and \"Latino\" refer to ethnicity, culture, and identity. They are groups based on shared culture rather than skin color, race or other physical features. However, the groups are also broader than ethnicity, which can make the terms confusing. For this reason, people who are Hispanic may vary in their race and also where they live or originate. For example, a person from the Dominican Republic and a person from Mexico might both call themselves Hispanic because they share in common a spoken language and a legacy of Spanish colonies. The recent popularity (and use) of the word Latinx in the U.S. presents another alternative to the contested \" Hispanic\" label that proponents say also offers gender inclusivity. The month is marked by a celebration of history, culture and contributions of generations of Hispanic and Latinx people that have shaped and influenced society in myriad ways. It marks a way to honor voices, culture and language, and amplify teaching of diverse texts and stories.\nSOME CONVERSATION STARTERS\n- Engage friends in their knowledge about Hispanic Heritage Month. Help to share information and spark meaningful discussion. For example: \"What do you know about Hispanic Heritage Month? May I share an article about it with you to help you with your understanding?\"\n- Reflect on representations of Hispanic Heritage Month in the media and share research with friends and colleagues. Build critical media literacy skills and advocacy for authentic representations of Hispanic and Latinx families in the media.\n- Post information about Hispanic Heritage Month on social media. This resource guide produced by Unexpected Virtual Tours contains many social media ideas.\n- Engage in discussion with friends, family and colleagues about the month. Widely recognized social media hashtags honoring the month include #hispanicheritagemonth.\n- Discuss ways your place of business could engage in community service in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month.\n- Encourage schools to begin the year with recognition of Hispanic Heritage Month and devote time and energy to learning more about the history, culture and breadth of diversity within the Hispanic community. Consider ways the month could be celebrated without reducing it to food or limited examples of culture.

In 2006, the $93 million renovation was completed in time for the live coverage of Pheonix landing on Mars in May of 2008.\n\"Centered in the Universe\" is one of their most popular high-resolution videos that is projected by a laser system. It takes place in the Samual Oschin Planetarium on site. Tickets for this can be purchased separately after admission to the observatory. Other shows include \"Water Is Life,\" \"Light of the Valkyries,\" and \"Time's Up.\"\nBurke Baker Planetarium\nOne of the coolest planetariums in the world, Burke Baker is located in the Houston Museum of Natural Science. The planetarium opened in 1964, and has a range of shows that simulate black holes, planets, solar systems, star clusters, comets, nebulous objects, and much more. They were the third in the world to gain multiple projector digital image capability; this allows them to show full-dome movies.\nThey even have eight different shows today! \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"We Are Stars,\" \"Dark Universe,\" \"Starry Night,\" \"Solar Superstorms,\" \"Edge of Darkness,\" \"Black Holes,\" and \"Tales of a Time Traveler\" are all shows that you can see today; which sounds most appealing to you?\nYerkes Observatory calls the University of Chicago home. It was established all the way back in 1897, is operated by the university's Department of Astrophysics and Astronomy, and financed by George Ellery.\nWhat makes this observatory so great? It houses a 40-inch diameter telescope, aka the largest astronomic telescope. Tours are open to the public every Saturday!\nMorehead Planetarium and Science Center\nOne of the coolest observatories in the world is the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center. It is also one of the oldest and largest in the United States, as it was first opened in 1949.\nIn '49, the center was used to train astronaut programs such as Apollo and Gemini. How cool! After it was used for this, it was donated to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It is a full-dome planetarium with room to fit 240 people. Exhibits include Zoom In: Science at the Extremes and The Ancient Carolinians.\nMauna Kea Observatory\nJust when you think you know all of the reasons you want to go to Hawaii, there is one more. The Mauna Kea is the best location for infrared astronomy in the North Hemisphere. It is one of the only places in the world where sea level to 14,000 feet is drivable in two hours. Just be sure to prepare if you suffer from altitude sickness, plus it is only recommended for four-wheel drive vehicles.\nThe observatory is home to multiple research facilities and large telescopic observatories. There are a total of 13 telescopes!\nThough this observatory is not open to the public, it is still one of the coolest observatories in the US. And this is because it has strayed away from the typical dome shape, and instead has a geometric shape that is lined with fir plywood. It was designed by Anmahian Winton Architects, and is located in New Hampshire. It falls under the category of $1.5 million in cost and fits in great with the mountain geographic.\nThe first planetarium to ever open in the Western hemisphere, the Alder Planetarium in Chicago. It was first created in 1930 to teach astronomy education and is home to high tech theaters, an observatory, and science exhibits.\nThe best part is the view of the Chicago skyline and the location in Lake Michigan.","A Space and Astronomy Timeline\n| Early 20th\n| Late 20th\nThe Second Millennium (1001 - 2000AD)\n19th Century (1801 - 1900)\n1803: Swedish chemist Jons Jakob Berzelius discovers cerium.\n1808: British chemist John Dalton sets forth the atomic theory of matter.

{"question":"How can someone with osteoarthritis maintain an active lifestyle safely, and what are the disability implications if the condition prevents them from working?","answer":"For maintaining an active lifestyle with osteoarthritis, it's recommended to start low and go slow, beginning with just 3-5 minutes of activity twice daily. Activities should be 'joint-friendly' like walking, bicycling, water aerobics, or dancing. It's important to modify activity if symptoms increase rather than stopping completely. Home exercises like heel slides, straight leg raises, and pillow squeezes can help strengthen muscles around affected joints. Regarding disability implications, osteoarthritis is the number one cause of disability, affecting one-third of working-age people's ability to work. If osteoarthritis prevents someone from earning a living for at least 12 months, they may qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). To qualify, medical documentation must show severe symptoms preventing work, including imaging results, surgical notes, and healthcare provider documentation.","context":["While your doctor may advise you to steer clear of some of the high-impact sports and activities that you’ve enjoyed in the past, it’s still possible to maintain an active lifestyle while managing your osteoarthritis (OA).\nExercise is key to maintaining function in people who have OA of the knee. One large study showed that older adults who engaged in moderate physical activity at least three times per week reduced their risk of arthritis-related disability significantly.\nIf you’re considering adding exercise to your treatment, here are some guidelines to keep in mind:\n- Don’t start out too fast. Your pain may increase, prompting you to get discouraged and quit.\n- Expect some increase in pain for the first four to six weeks after starting an exercise program. Sticking with it will result in long-term pain relief.\n- Don’t overdo it. If pain is sharp or knife-like, or causes you to limp, you have probably overdone it, so you should back off a little. If pain is achy and does not affect your daily activities, it’s probably OK to work through it. If your joint is red, hot to touch, and swollen, see your doctor as soon as possible.\n- Try to lose weight. A modest weight loss (e.g., 5 percent of your body weight, or 12 pounds, for a 250-pound person) can help reduce pain and disability.\nJennifer M. Hootman, Ph.D., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist, recommends a simplified way of approaching exercise for people with osteoarthritis:\n- Start low and go slow. Inactive people should start with a small amount of activity — for example, three to five minutes two times a day. You should increase the activity level in small amounts, allowing enough time for your body to adjust.\n- Modify activity if your arthritis symptoms increase. Arthritis symptoms come and go. Most people completely stop activity when their symptoms increase. It’s better to first modify your activity by decreasing the frequency, duration, or intensity, or changing the type of activity to stay as active as possible without making your symptoms worse.\n- Activities should be “joint friendly.” Unsure of what types of activity are best for people with arthritis? A general rule is to choose activities that are easy on the joints, such as walking, bicycling, water aerobics, or dancing. These activities have a low risk of injury and do not twist or pound on the joints too much.\n- Recognize safe places and ways to be active. For inactive adults with arthritis or those who do not have confidence in planning their own physical activity, an exercise class designed just for people with arthritis may be a good option. For those who plan and direct their own activity, finding safe places to be active is important. For example, while walking in your neighborhood or at a local park, make sure the sidewalks or pathways are level and free of obstructions, well lighted, and separated from heavy traffic.\n- Talk to a health professional or a certified exercise specialist. Many health professionals and certified exercise professionals are good sources of information on what types and amounts of activity are appropriate for people with chronic conditions and disabilities.\nExercises You Can Do At Home\nThe most important thing you can do at home after receiving the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee is to stretch and strengthen. Stretching and strengthening the musculature surrounding the knee, such as the hamstrings, the quadriceps, and the calves, is vital. But it’s important to avoid heavy, weight-bearing activities such as squats, leg presses, and running. Light weight training and low-impact activities like yoga or Pilates are ideal.\n- Combined calf and hamstring stretch. Sit with your foot slightly elevated resting on a small stool. Bend your ankle up and flex your foot toward your body, keeping the heel in contact with the stool and the knee straight. Slowly reach with both hands toward your toes. Hold the gentle stretch for 30 seconds. Repeat two times and then switch legs.\n- Heel slide. Lie on your back. Slowly slide your heel toward your buttock, keeping your heel in contact with the floor. Hold your knee bent for 30 seconds. Repeat two times and then switch legs.\n- Straight Leg Raise. Lie on your back, bend one leg, and keep the other one straight. Slowly lift the straight leg to 45 degrees; hold and then slowly lower it back down to the ground. Make sure not to use your back to do this. All of the effort should come from the leg muscles. Repeat five to 10 times, and then switch legs.\n- Sit to Stand. Practice this move to make standing easier. Place two pillows on a chair. Sit on top of the pillows, with your back straight and feet flat on floor. Use your leg muscles to slowly and smoothly stand up tall. Then, slowly lower yourself back down to sitting. Be sure your bent knees don’t move in front of your toes. If this is too hard, add pillows or use a chair with armrests and use your arms to help push up.\n- Pillow Squeeze. Place a pillow between your knees and squeeze. Hold for 15 to 20 seconds and release. Repeat five to 10 times.\n- Side Leg Raise. Lie on your side. Tighten your thigh and slowly raise your leg toward the ceiling, keeping the leg perfectly straight. Slowly lower your leg to the starting position. Each repetition should take eight seconds. Repeat the exercise on until you are fatigued, switch sides. When you are able to do 25 reps, you can try adding a light weight to your thigh or ankle.\n- Hamstring Chair Scoots. Sit in a chair with wheels. Propel yourself forward using your hamstring, by extending your leg several feet in front, then pulling back with your heel. Repeat until fatigued.\n- Standing Heel Raises. Stand on one foot. Slowly raise yourself up until the heel is off the ground, keeping the standing leg perfectly straight. Slowly lower. Each repetition should take eight seconds. Repeat the exercise until fatigued, switch legs.","Osteoarthritis (OA), sometimes called degenerative joint disease or “wear and tear” arthritis, affects approximately 31 million adults in the United States. The symptoms of osteoarthritis vary greatly from person to person.\nSo, is arthritis a disability? Arthritis is the number one cause of disability. In fact, one-third of working-age people with arthritis have limitations in their ability to work.\nIf you have osteoarthritis and if you are unable to earn a gainful living as a result, there could be financial help available to you. The SSA has a list of conditions that qualify for disability and osteoarthritis is one of them. The Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program was created to assist those who have become disabled due to an illness such as osteoarthritis.\nWhat Exactly Is Osteoarthritis?\nOsteoarthritis is a common joint disease that tends to affect middle-aged and older adults. In a healthy joint, a firm and spongy substance cartilage covers the end of each bone. This cartilage provides a cushion between bones and also offers a smooth surface so that bones may glide.\nFor those with osteoarthritis, the cartilage of the joint breaks down, causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and difficulty moving. In severe cases, bone spurs may form around the affected joint.\nOsteoarthritis mainly attacks the weight-bearing joints of the body such as the hips, lower back, and knees. Osteoarthritis can also affect the joints of the hands and toes. The risk of osteoarthritis increases with age and women are more likely to develop the disease. Additionally, those who are overweight or have had a previous injury to the joint are at higher risk for osteoarthritis.\nOsteoarthritis is considered a progressive disease, meaning that for most people it tends to get worse over time. This means that many people may not qualify for Social Security benefits after an initial osteoarthritis diagnosis, but may later qualify as a disease progresses.\nWhile there is no reversal of osteoarthritis, there are many possible treatments to help slow the progression and severity. Possible therapies include medications, diet modifications, and physical therapy. Self-care such as weight loss and exercise are often recommended. For advanced cases of osteoarthritis, joint surgery is sometimes an option.\nWhat Are Symptoms of Osteoarthritis?\nSymptoms of osteoarthritis include pain in your joints, stiffness, tenderness in your joints when applying pressure, loss of flexibility, swelling, bone spurs and grating sensation in your joints, such as cracking or popping.\nOsteoarthritis symptoms require a medical diagnosis from a doctor. Symptoms of osteoarthritis generally occur in the hands, neck, lower back, knees or hips.\nOsteoarthritis symptoms usually begin slowly effecting only a few joints in your body. Osteoarthritis can in fact get worse affecting multiple joints with a wide variety of different pain symptoms.\nOne of the most common symptoms of osteoarthritis is stiffness in the joints, usually stiffness lasting longer than 30 minutes at a time. Stiffness from osteoarthritis usually happens in the morning after waking up from sleeping.\nAnother osteoarthritis symptom is swelling in the joints affected. Often times swelling in the joints from osteoarthritis happens after a lot of activity or use from those joints, like for example osteoarthritis in the knees can cause swelling after running.\nIf you have osteoarthritis and are thinking about applying for Social Security disability benefits, its recommended that you keep track of all your symptoms of osteoarthritis and have medical paperwork to back up your osteoarthritis symptoms.\nMedical evidence of your osteoarthritis symptoms is the key to your Social Security disability claim. The more evidence you have of your osteoarthritis and its ability to keep you from working for at least 12 months, then you may be able to qualify for Social Security disability benefits with osteoarthritis.\nWhat Can I Expect?\nYou can expect a range of symptoms when you have osteoarthritis, and they all might affect your ability to work. Here are some signs that you may qualify for Social Security benefits with osteoarthritis:\n- Osteoarthritis tends to affect the weight-bearing joints. Therefore, if your job requires that you bend, lift, or spend an extended amount of time on your feet and you have difficulty doing so, you may qualify for disability benefits. For example, working in construction, in a warehouse, as a postal worker, a healthcare provider, or in retail may prove challenging if you suffer from osteoarthritis.\n- Persistent swelling or pain might make it difficult to perform many tasks with your arms and hands. In fact, some people have difficult putting on their socks and shoes due to hand pain. Fine motor skills such as typing or writing could be difficult as well.\n- Pain, stiffness, or difficulty moving could affect your mobility, making tasks like walking or driving very difficult. You may need to use a cane, walker, or wheelchair to get around. Some people require assistance getting in or out of a car. If you have difficulty with mobility issues, you may be eligible for financial assistance.\n- If your doctor puts you on medications for osteoarthritis, you may experience some side effects that may affect your quality of life.\n- Pain medications may cause side-effects such as fatigue, fogginess, or loss of balance. For patients with OA that might already have difficulty walking, these symptoms may increase the risk of falls.\n- NSAIDS used to reduce inflammation and pain may cause severe stomach problems such as heartburn, acid reflux, nausea, and in severe cases, kidney problems and bleeding from the lining of your stomach.\n- In some cases, steroids, such as Prednisone, are prescribed for severe OA flare-ups. While steroids help to relieve swelling, they can cause side effects such as high blood pressure, high blood sugars, and stomach ulcers.\nOsteoarthritis is a chronic illness in which the cartilage and tissues surrounding a joint are damaged. Degenerative arthritis is a word that is interchangeable with osteoarthritis. It's also known as \"wear and tear\" arthritis or \"degenerative joint disease.\"\nPeople with degenerative arthritis frequently have to put forth extra physical effort in order to perform fundamental everyday tasks. This can lead to exhaustion.\nChemical mediators known as cytokines are responsible for inflammation. It can also make you tired.\nHow Serious is Osteoarthritis of the Spine?\nOsteoarthritis of the spine can be serious if it’s left untreated. Osteoarthritis of the spine is serious enough that it can lead to the pain in the neck and back becoming worse and worse over time.\nOsteoarthritis of the spine is a degenerative disease, which is serious, so if it is left untreated the symptoms can get worse as time progresses.\nIf you have osteoarthritis of the spine, there are remedies available to help mitigate the pain associated with it. If you have osteoarthritis of the spine, there are spinal surgeries available, as well as spinal injections to help with the pain.\nYou should consult with your doctor to see what remedies you should take in order to help treat your osteoarthritis of the spine. Self-care such as exercise can often help mitigate the pain associated with osteoarthritis of the spine.\nIf you have osteoarthritis and it is serious enough that you will be unable to work full time for at least a year, you may be able to qualify for Social Security disability benefits with osteoarthritis of the spine.\nThe SSA has a list of musculoskeletal diseases that qualify for Social Security disability benefits. If the symptoms and medical records of your osteoarthritis of the spine match one of the musculoskeletal diseases that qualify for Social Security disability, then you may be able to qualify for Social Security disability benefits.\nDo I Qualify for Benefits?\nTo be eligible for Social Security benefits for osteoarthritis, your medical records will need to show that your symptoms are severe enough to prevent you from working at a level which would support you. Additionally, your osteoarthritis needs to be expected to be disabling for at least 12 months. Osteoarthritis is a progressive illness that is unlikely to get better over time. Therefore, if you have not qualified for osteoarthritis in the past and your symptoms have progressed, you might qualify now.\nWhat Information Will I Need to Provide?\nWhen applying for Social Security for osteoarthritis, medical documentation is critical. You should obtain the following:\n- Confirmation of your diagnosis of osteoarthritis from a doctor.\n- Blood tests confirming inflammation in your body, which may include a positive ANA or a positive rheumatoid factor test.\n- X-rays, MRIs, or other imaging results that may help to confirm your diagnosis of osteoarthritis. If your MRI can demonstrate joint space narrowing or bone fusion, you may have a higher chance of being approved for benefits.\n- Surgical notes from an Orthopedic physician.\n- Notes from your doctor, physical therapist, or other health care provider that describe your symptoms and illness.\nBuilding a relationship with your physician is extremely helpful when applying for Social Security benefits. The more documentation that you have available to you, the better your odds of receiving SSDI assistance for osteoarthritis.\nIf you have Osteoarthritis and believe that you may qualify for Social Security benefits, you should contact a disability lawyer in your area. When your health is suffering, it can be difficult to know where to turn or what to do next. A disability advocate or attorney can help you navigate the Social Security application process, leaving you time to focus on what’s most important: your health."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8a24558a-b9a1-4795-bf6a-e8c7c1aa3067>","<urn:uuid:72827e23-2159-427c-bdc6-fc3e9e26841a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the compositional relationships with performers differ between Sierra's Piano Trio No. 3 and Radulescu's works?","answer":"Sierra's Piano Trio No. 3 was written for the Trio Arbós, who premiered the work in Spain in 2008, representing a traditional composer-performer relationship. In contrast, Radulescu's works required a much more intensive collaborative relationship with performers. He often made personal coaching a prerequisite for performance and developed his alternative notation systems in coordination with trusted performers like Vincent Royer. His works were typically premiered in close collaboration with specific performers, many of whom were part of his European Lucero Ensemble, and this direct composer-performer interaction was crucial for understanding and accurately interpreting his unique sonic vision and notational practices.","context":["|About this Recording\n8.559611 - SIERRA, R.: Piano Trios Nos. 1-3 / Fanfarria, aria y movimiento perpetuo (Trio Arbos)\nRoberto Sierra (b. 1953)\nThe three piano trios in this recording span seventeen years (1991–2008) of my creative life. Each reflects a different creative impulse and the ideas that were in my mind at the time I wrote them. There are nevertheless common threads that link these works: a constant preoccupation with the intersection of a modern musical language and the vernacular that comes out of my ethnic background, and also timbral explorations often linked to instrumental virtuosity.\nMy first trio is titled Trio Tropical (1991), implying from the outset my intention of tropicalizing a genre that has a long tradition. The four movements reflect the rhythmic gestures, timbres and melodic gestures of the music I heard growing up in Puerto Rico. The insistent rhythms of En do (In C) are infused with the Latin jazz elements of the music I would hear on the radio, while the dreamy middle section evokes the atmosphere of the tropical nights, also evoked in Habanera nocturna. The last movement contains a slow introduction (Intermezzo religioso) followed by a fast perpetual motion. In the Religious intermezzo piano riffs of salsa music are superimposed on chorale-like textures, leading to wild explorations of polyrhythms in the movimiento perpetuo.\nEach of the four movements of Trio No. 2 (2002) treats the same material, namely a twelve-tone row/motive that is used without transpositions or inversions, but in very different ways. Out of this restricted material a first movement emerges written in clave, the underlying rhythmic backbone of salsa, hence the title Clave de mediodía (Midday Clave). Espejos (Mirrors) transforms the same material into a mirage of counterpoint, while in Juego (Game) that material becomes a playful scherzo. The trio ends with music for an imaginary ritual, where the three instruments join in rhythms that resemble Afro-Caribbean drumming.\nPiano Trio No. 3 (2008) incorporates extended tonal idioms infused by non tonal chromatic sonorities in many ways similar to Trio Tropical. Here too Afro-Caribbean musical gestures are present. I subtitled this trio Romántico to denote the expansive and broad musical gestures evocative of late-nineteenth-century chamber music. The first movement, Con profunda expresión, follows in a loose manner a sonata-allegro formal scheme. Here the sweeping and broad melodic gestures are interrupted by violent outbursts of seemingly unrelated harmonies and rhythmic gestures, which in the course of the music create their own continuity and sense of urgency. The second movement, Veloz (Fast), is a scherzo where the traditional triple meter is substituted by an asymmetric 5/8 meter. A slow movement follows, Con gran sentimiento, como un ‘Bolero’ (With great feeling, like a ‘Bolero’). This bolero is not the Spanish dance that inspired Maurice Ravel, but rather the slow Latin Ballads that became popular during the 1950s. The trio closes with a rondo (Agitado), with a main theme written in the style of Puerto Rican folk-tunes. Mirroring the first movement in a kind of inverse equation, the interruptions here are caused by broad sweeping melodic gestures. The work was written for the Trio Arbós, who gave the première of the work in Spain (Gijón, Asturias) in November 2008.\nThe opening sounds of Fanfarria, aria y movimiento perpetuo (2000) are based on the kind of open intervals and triads reminiscent of sonorities that Aaron Copland favored in his music (the work was commissioned by the Library of Congress as part of the Copland centennial celebrations). The fanfare was written to sound almost like an improvisation in which rhythmic elements of salsa can be heard. The aria is a slow section that explores the expressive qualities and singing tone of the violin. As a reminder of the open intervals used at the beginning, and to serve as a bridge to the perpetual motion, we again hear fanfare-like material. The work closes with running sixteenth notes movimiento perpetuo—a rhythmic evocation of salsa music.\nClose the window","On the music of Horatiu Radulescu\nThe rarely performed music of Horatiu Radulescu, the iconoclastic Romanian composer and self-described founder of spectralism, will be at the center of an ambitious upcoming three-day festival at Acker Stadt Palast in Berlin on October 19-21. Organized by Iranian composer and conductor Arash Yazdani and his Ensemble for New Music Tallinn (ENMT) in honor of Radulescu’s 75th birth year, this two-part festival (the first part took place in Tallinn earlier this month) titled Sound-Plasma—Festival of Microtonal Music features performances by violist Vincent Royer, glissando flutist Erik Drescher, cellist Juho Laitinen, clarinetist Samuel Ekkehardt Dunscombe, and flutist Rebecca Lane and includes new works by Marc Sabat, Klaus Lang, Asia Ahmetjanova, Ernstalbrecht Stieble, Dror Feiler, Yazdani, and, full disclosure, me.\nSound plasma, the evocative term to which this festival owes its name, was an idea coined by Radulescu in 1973 as part of a text-based hybrid prose concept score titled “Sound Plasma—Music of the Future Sign or My D High Opus 19 ∞.” The work loosely explores different phenomenological, spiritual, and quasi-scientific ideas on what Radulescu calls “the endless ocean of vibrations” that is sound. The concepts touched upon in this text-score formed the bedrock of Radulescu’s compositional thought in the early 1970s, and can serve as a rough guide to his overall musical thinking throughout the rest of his life. For Radulescu, sound plasma was the coexistence and synthesis of “abstract sound sources” (instrumental sounds, human sounds, nature sounds, and electronic sounds) with “concrete sound sources” (semantic language). The ideas of synthesizing sound sources played a big part in early works like “Flood for the Eternal’s Origins” (1972) for global sound sources, and his “ko ‘tro—Mioritic Space” (1972) for 11 speakers, string orchestra, electronics and natural sounds.\nInseparable from Radulescu’s unwavering and visionary musical ideas was his notoriously unapologetic and larger-than-life personality—something that often caused friction between him and other composers, performers, and concert organizers. But his lifelong friends, collaborators, and biggest supporters describe Radulescu’s uncompromising exterior as a loveable eccentricity balanced by his big heart and ceaseless love for life. By all accounts, Radulescu approached life with such a single-minded and voracious appetite for innovative and fulfilling musical creation that it permeated all aspects of his character.\nAt the Sound-Plasma Festival Berlin audiences will have the rare opportunity to hear Radulescu’s character and musical ideas come to life in performances of his “Dizzy Divinity” for solo flute, “Inner Time IV (b)” for eight Bb clarinets (one live and seven pre-recorded), “Immersed in the Wonder” for bass flute and cello, “Das Andere” for solo viola, and “Sensual Sky” for large ensemble. Each of these works was written and premiered in close collaboration with specific performers, many of whom were part of Radulescu’s own European Lucero Ensemble. The ensemble has long been disbanded, and its performers only brought together once since Radulescu’s death nearly a decade ago. Many of its members are less active now both as performers and in championing Radulescu’s works.\nBelgium-based violist Vincent Royer is one notable exception. Royer, who became a member of the European Lucero Ensemble in 1991, also worked closely with the composer to record an album of viola works in 2006. He remains one of the few active performers with both firsthand knowledge of the composer’s idiosyncratic writing for strings, and a passion for sharing it with others. He has coached younger ensembles like the JACK Quartet in performing Radulescu’s distinctive extended techniques, taking over a role that Radulescu would himself have needed to fill.\nTaking a closer look at “Das Andere,” its score posted on YouTube alongside Royer’s recorded performance, one can see firsthand Radulescu’s enigmatic notational practice. While visually impressive, this score will likely raise eyebrows amongst most classically trained musicians. Radulescu wanted to break free of the strictures of standard Western notation to explore uncharted sonic territory unattainable on the traditional five-line staff. The result is music that is sonically uncanny—like something from another planet. The sonorities that emerge from the spectrally detuned strings and the piercing double stopped harmonics in the uppermost regions of the viola’s range are intangibly “other.” Artificially perceived (but not actually acoustically present) combination tones emerge out of these gestures, creating otherworldly psychoacoustic melodies in the ears and mind of the listener.\nTo generate these unearthly sounds, Radulescu invented alternative modes of notation developed in coordination with trusted performers like Royer. What’s more, during his lifetime, Radulescu often made personal coaching a prerequisite to performance. This provided him an opportunity to clear up any notational confusion or inconsistencies while ensuring that performers fully grasped his uncanny sonic imagination. Today, only these close collaborators have the knowledge and experience to recognize and accurately interpret many of these beautiful scores. But sadly, for a number of these players, memories are beginning to fade.\nNotational vagaries are only the tip of the iceberg when considering the obstacles to performing Radulescu’s music. As a self-published composer with no concrete plan for his archive after his death, Radulescu’s scores have remained largely inaccessible since 2008. Radulescu’s immediate family took over publishing responsibilities with good intentions, but became quickly overwhelmed by the task at hand. Many of Radulescu’s works were hand-written and not properly digitized. Pieces like “Inner Time” have more than six different versions, each with its own specific instrumentation or electronic component, and none of which were clearly cataloged prior to his death. Recordings could offer more clues, but most of his works were never released on disc. And for those that were, many are now out of circulation. Luckily YouTube, as with many other composers’ works, has become a default repository for bootlegged recordings. But this can’t make up for live performances, especially with a body of work that so often plays with psychoacoustic phenomena—perceived sonic effects that are often less effective in recordings. As if this wasn’t enough, Radulescu’s publishing company, Lucero Print, along with its website and online hub for all-things Radulescu, www.radulescu.com, a site previously maintained by the late Irish musicologist and close friend to Radulescu, Bob Gilmore, recently disappeared, returning only a disheartening error: “This Domain Has Expired.”\nThe only way to keep Radulescu’s radical music alive is to continue the uphill climb of performing his works in consultation with those who, like Vincent Royer, worked with Radulescu directly. It’s an admirable feat for Arash Yazdani and his Sound-Plasma Festival to showcase so much by a composer whose works are unavailable for purchase or hire. But the sort of acrobatics needed to perform this already time-intensive and technically virtuosic music creates enormous hurdles for those young and ambitious performers interested in recreating Radulescu’s uncanny sound world for audiences. I hope that the sheer weight of this music will be enough to attract those willing to take on the challenge of interpreting this music before it vanishes from concert halls completely. ¶"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:946b1161-100e-4fff-91df-e8210c5f3d69>","<urn:uuid:5b867d35-db81-464d-beb9-793ec53a9813>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What key competencies should a sports nutrition professional have?","answer":"Sports nutrition professionals should be competent in: ensuring nutrition plans prioritize athlete health and well-being, applying sport nutrition science for fitness and performance, conducting nutrition assessments, educating about food selection and preparation, addressing energy balance and weight management, tackling performance nutrition challenges, developing personalized nutrition and hydration strategies, understanding special diets (vegetarian, vegan), and providing clear information about supplements and ergogenic aids.","context":["You are here\nProper nourishment needed for active bodies\nIn an effort to encourage young people with a keen interest in sport to get involved and make a positive difference. I am committed to giving them a voice and space. This week’s Things that Matter column places the focus on sports nutrition and Tracey Pierre, a graduate of Leeds Metropolitan University, who has agreed to put pen to paper and share her thoughts on sports nutrition.\nThe name “Sport Nutrition” is somewhat of a misnomer, because it implies a special kind of nutrition only geared toward people who play sports. However, in this context, ‘sports’ is generic and much broader in its definition.\nSport Nutrition encompasses an extremely wide range of potential candidates, including athletes, weekend warriors, gym rats, fitness buffs, diehard aerobic queens and sport fanatics. It includes anyone engaged in physical activity. In fact, if you train and eat food, you’re engaged in sports nutrition.\n‘Sport Nutrition’ is an intricate fusion between the scientifically precise and the socially practical. There is an art to nourishing an active body with high quality foods and natural health products in a skilful and safe manner. One must not only be concerned with what we eat, but also the when, where and how. The science of this field helps us to understand the fundamental theories of “why” certain recommendations and decisions are made regarding athlete nutrition. Through careful observation, research and repeated experiment, experts in the field investigate the effect of controlled exercise, food and natural products on the health, recovery and performance of athletes. While optimum nutrition can facilitate significant gains in these areas, poor nutritional choices can have equally disastrous results. As a result, changes to an athlete’s diet very clearly manifest themselves within any one of these three parameters.\nNutritional needs of athletes can vary significantly from those of the average physically active individual and as such, their eating habits require special consideration. An athlete’s dietary needs can fluctuate throughout the cycle various phases of an athletic year.\nMacronutrient requirements often need to be manipulated so as to meet personal goals and maximise the benefits of training, enhance performance in competition, reduce recovery time and minimiae the risk of injury. Though many athletes are committed to their sport and acknowledge the importance of nutrition in preparation, competition and recovery, they often face many situations that challenge their resolve, and make adhering to a programme difficult.\nOutside the realm of micro and macronutrients, individuals in the field of sport nutrition need to have an understanding of the effects of travel and travel related illness on an athlete and the ways in which food and other related interventions are best used to both avoid and treat them.\nEvaluation of nutrition knowledge of athletes can lead to a clearer understanding of areas around which an education or intervention programme should focus. It has been suggested that a positive attitude toward nutrition is an indicator of greater responsiveness to education programmes. The nutrition knowledge of Caribbean athletes and coaches, more specifically, those from Trinidad and Tobago, has never been reported in an academic arena.\nSuccessful integration of a sport nutrition programme requires an understanding of the athletic culture, physiological milestones, and life stressors faced by athletes. Athlete education should therefore be both practical and dynamic.\nProfessionals in the field of sport nutrition should be competent in:\nEnsuring that nutrition plans are focused primarily on the health and well being of the athlete\nApplying sport nutrition science to fuel fitness and performance\nConducting and analysing nutrition assessments.\nEducating individuals in food selection, purchase and preparation\nAddressing energy balance and weight management issues\nAddressing nutritional challenges to performance\nDeveloping personalised nutrition and hydration strategies\nUnderstanding the unique needs of vegetarian, vegan other athletes with special diets\nProviding clear and concise information regarding the use of supplements and other ergogenic aids\nPierre has a Masters Degree in Sports and Exercise Science with a focus on Sport Nutrition from Leeds Metropolitan University.

{"question":"How do the recommended temperatures for smoking fish differ between traditional outdoor smoking and stove-top smoking methods?","answer":"For traditional outdoor smoking, the temperature should be kept around 150 degrees Fahrenheit and never exceed 200 degrees. The smoking time is 4 to 10 hours depending on taste and fish size. For stove-top smoking of white king salmon, a shorter smoking time of about 12-15 minutes is recommended, with a 2-3 minute rest period afterward in the smoker.","context":["Dehydrating Food: Wrinkles Have Never Looked Better\nWhen the water content of foods is reduced to about 10 percent, microorganisms that cause spoilage go into “hibernation”; because of this, foods may be preserved almost indefinitely. Dehydrating foods changes the color and flavor—not into something worse, but into something different. And most of the vitamins and minerals are still there.\nFollowing are the results of our family’s ongoing research about dehydrating foods.\n1. Selecting foods for dehydration. Most fruits and vegetables and some meats will dehydrate successfully. Citrus products won’t. The raw product should be of good quality and fully mature, but should still be firm. Remove any blemish. Peeling is optional except in obvious cases like bananas.\n2. Slicing. An ideal thickness is approximately 3/16 inch. Drying a chunk as large as a peach half takes so long that the fruit often spoils first. Using a thin stainless steel blade to slice reduces bruising and discoloration.\n3. Treatment. This is the only step where fruits and vegetables must be treated differently.\nMost vegetables must be steam-blanched to destroy the maturation enzyme. Place the sliced vegetables in a steamer, a colander, or a deep-frying basket and suspend over boiling water. The time required depends on the vegetable and varies from two minutes for celery to 40 minutes for red beets, which must be fully cooked before slicing and dehydrating.\nThe treatment for fruit depends upon the variety of the fruit and the method of dehydration. For example, in sundrying, fruit must be protected from oxidation with a sulphur fume treatment or by being soaked in a sodium bisulfite and water solution for 30 minutes, then drained thoroughly. (Complete directions for each fruit need to be obtained from professional dehydrators, county agents, or state extension services.)\nAny dehydration method taking less than 48 hours will not need the above treatment. However, fruits that darken when exposed to the air (apples, bananas, and so forth) should be sliced and dipped immediately in a solution of water and ascorbic acid (like Fruit Fresh, which is available in grocery stores), water and erythorbic acid, or similar material, available through some druggists or wholesalers. Soak for two minutes, remove, and drain thoroughly.\nThe meats we have dehydrated include beef and chicken. We have also made jerky. If you wish to reconstitute beef or chicken after you dehydrate it, then cook it completely first. Then chill the meat for easier handling. After it is chilled, slice it 1/4 inch thick and remove all fat.\nHerbs should be mature (but not old), thoroughly washed, and not blanched.\n4. Place on shelves or trays. Air circulation is the key for successful dehydrating. Use shelves, trays, cloth netting, or screens, and arrange food only one layer deep until you know what works well. Several vegetables or fruits can be dehydrated at the same time on separate trays, but do not mix fruits and vegetables in the same dryer load, as fruits will pick up vegetable tastes. (Heavy nylon net between the shelves and some sticky fruit, like bananas, will keep the pieces from sticking to the shelves.)\n5. Dehydration. If you want a high quality product, the moisture must be removed as rapidly and continuously as possible without damaging or cooking the food. Dr. D. K. Salunkhe, professor of plant science at Utah State University, identifies 145 degrees F. as the point where vitamin loss accelerates. If the temperature is below 145 degrees, essentially all nutrients will be retained except for the extremely unstable vitamin C.\nSome dehydration methods are:\nSun dehydration. Products are spread on trays tilted to receive direct sunlight. The product must be protected from insects, blowing dust, rain, and evening dew. There is more danger of spoilage with this slow method, especially if cloudy days intervene. Before storing, sun-dehydrated products should be placed in a dehydrator or oven for 20–30 minutes to complete the drying process.\nOven dehydration. The kitchen should be well ventilated, the oven preheated, and the temperature carefully watched. It must not exceed 145 degrees F. Leave the door of an electric oven open two inches (eight inches for a gas oven) for temperature control and moisture escape. Oven drying has its problems, too: you have to stir to compensate for the lack of air movement, space is limited, and most ovens do not control well at such a low temperature.\nHomemade dehydrator: Make your own from a wooden or metal box or old refrigerator by adding a fan, a heating element, a thermostat, shelf supports, and ventilation vents. Experiment to get the proper air movement and temperature.\nCommercial dehydrators: Look for one with a heating element, a thermostat, a fan for air circulation, and a means to pull in dry air and expel moist air.\n6. Testing for dryness. The time required varies from four to 36 hours in a commercial unit to one to three weeks for sundrying, depending on the item and weather conditions. Remove a sample and cool. Vegetables should be hard and brittle. Fruit should be pliable and leathery; if the fruit cracks, the drying time was too long. Jerky should be stringy and leathery; precooked meat should be crisp. The longer you wish to store it, the drier it should be.\n7. Storage. Storage space is where you really save with dehydrated food. Ten pounds of fresh carrots reduces to one pound when dehydrated. One-half bushel of apples will fit in a gallon jar, and 25 pounds of fresh celery reduces to an astounding one pound. However, when all foods are reconstituted, they regain their full original size.\nKeep three rules in mind for proper storage: (1) dehydrated food should be kept in airtight containers: glass jars (nicked rims don’t matter since you don’t need a perfect seal), metal cans (especially if lined with food-grade plastic bags and sealed with tight lids), or plastic cooking pouches (sealed with a commercial heat-sealer); (2) temperature should be 60 degrees or below if possible, because food discolors at a rate that doubles for each 12–15 degree rise in temperature; and (3) the food should be stored in darkness. Wrap transparent containers with colored paper, newsprint, or black plastic if the storage room is not completely dark or if windows cannot be covered.\nDehydrated food will last two to three times longer with a small desiccant package (containing a chemical that absorbs moisture) in the container. These packages are available from wholesalers. Examine the food occasionally and redehydrate if there is any indication of moisture.\n8. Using dehydrated foods. Dehydrated food is popular as a snack or reconstituted.\nMost vegetables can be reconstituted and cooked in approximately one hour, using two cups of water for each cup of food. Carrots will reconstitute in cold water in five or six hours without cooking. Dehydrated swiss chard and other greens can be placed in boiling water for five to ten minutes and then seasoned. Do not salt any vegetables until after they have been reconstituted. You can also make your own vegetable soup mix out of dried vegetables by reconstituting them all together.\nPlace dehydrated fruit in boiling water, or soak it in either hot or cold water without cooking, until it is reconstituted. Use in recipes calling for fresh fruit, or cook the fruit alone, but do not add sugar before reconstituting.\nDehydrated meat can be added to soups and stews without any reconstitution. Dehydrated herbs and celery leaves can be added to any cooked food for seasoning. Peel, slice, and dehydrate cucumbers until they are brittle, then blend them to a powder and use it to season salad dressing. Almost any vegetable can be powdered after dehydrating for seasoning, purees, soups, baby food, etc.\nIf directions on preparation and storage are followed, dehydrated foods can last indefinitely. Some people report no deterioration in vegetables they’ve had up to 15 years. Since our family uses, as well as stores, dehydrated foods, there’s no “rotation” problem. And it lasts the first dehydrated cooked meat we made was stored two years ago and it’s still good!\nFor further information, write the Cooperative Extension Service, Utah State University, Logan, Utah 84321.\nWant some delicious memories from your fishing trip? Brother and Sister Everett Goodell of Willard, Utah, share ways to store not only fish, but also campfire scents and summer nights until a December dinner. They’ve always loved fishing, but since Brother Goodell retired five years ago, it’s practically a full-time summer occupation.\nClean the fish thoroughly, but do not skin or scale them. Fish under 12 inches long can be smoked whole; larger fish should be cut into steaks of less than a pound. Then try one of these methods:\n1. Mix a brine solution of 1 to 1 1/2 cups salt, 1 to 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, and 1 quart water. (One variation is to spice the brine with 1 tablespoon black pepper, 3/4 teaspoon oregano, and one cup water in which four bay leaves have simmered.) Split all fish so they will lie flat. Soak for 6 to 8 hours, wash in clear water, and smoke, turning at least once. In about three hours, a shiny film will form; it’s normal.\n2. Dr. John N. Neuhold of Utah State University Wildlife Resources uses a straight brine solution of 10 ounces sugar, 1 pound salt, and 2 gallons water. If the fish are fatty, add a pinch of salt petre.\nSoak 24 to 48 hours, rinse with clear water, drain, and smoke. If the fish have brined longer than 24 hours, soak in clear water 1/2 to 1 hour before smoking.\nCommercial smokers are readily available at most supermarkets or discount stores for under $30, or you can make your own out of a small refrigerator. Add racks until they are about 5 inches apart, drill a 1/2-inch ventilation hole in the top of the back wall, put a hot plate with thermostat or heat controls in the bottom, add a cast-iron frying pan full of smoldering coals or four to six charcoal briquets, and you’re ready to go.\nSmother the fire with sweet wood chips—hickory, apple, nutwoods, maple, oak, chokecherry, river birch, or aspen. Chips will need to be added about every two hours.\nThe temperature should be kept around 150 degrees, never over 200. Smoking time is four to 10 hours, depending on your taste and the size of the fish. Sample it. If you like it, it’s done. Longer smoking produces firmer, drier fish.\nAccording to experts, a charcoal brazier will work if it has a hood. Pile the briquets and wood chips in the middle and place the fish on the rack in its highest position, or hang the fish from the hood. Cover the open part with foil so no smoke will escape. Test the fish for doneness after two hours. When the muscle layer near the backbone flakes, the fish is ready to serve.\nSister Goodell also suggests canning fresh fish. They should be cleaned, skinned, and cut in four-inch pieces, then packed solidly in jars with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Seal and pressure cook at 10 pounds for 40 minutes.\nNewsprint: Daily Woodpile\n1. Divide the day’s paper into two or three sections.\n2. Fold paper over to 1/2 page size, about 12 to 15 inches wide, and 1/2 inch or less thick.\n3. Soak overnight in a solution of 1 gallon of water mixed with 1 tablespoon liquid detergent.\n4. Roll dripping wet sections individually on a chrome rod that is 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter.\n5. Squeeze out excess water; smooth surface edges in.\n6. Slide paper roll off rod and stand on end to dry. Tip rolls slightly to let air circulate. Rolls should be about 12 inches long and 2 to 4 inches in diameter.\n7. When completely dry (drying can take as much as two weeks), stack and use like wood.\nBrother Lofgren is family preparedness coordinator in the Valley View Fourth Ward, and physical facilities representative for the Salt Lake Valley View Stake.\nTin Can Cooking\nTin can cooking can be one of your summer delights, because it gets Mom out of the sandwich routine and Dad away from the smoking grill. Children as young as six years of age can learn to use these handy substitutes for pots and skillets on any camping trip, at any picnic, or even on a backyard adventure. A tin can can become a frying pan, a saucepan, and an oven.\nOn the top of the stove you can cook regular favorites such as pancakes, bacon and eggs, and tacos. Or experiment with these recipes:\nFrench toast: One egg, two tablespoons of milk, and a dash of salt and pepper will make the basic mix for four slices of bread. Oil the stove surface lightly before cooking.\nFor variety, place the egg-covered bread in partially crushed cornflakes before cooking.\nEggs in a basket: Make a V out of a bacon strip and fry it to the desired crispness. Remove the center of a slice of bread and lay the slice over the cooked bacon on top of the stove. Break an egg into the hole, season it, and cook it, turning it if desired.\nBacon and egg sandwiches: Cut bacon into small pieces and fry them to the desired crispness. Break an egg on top of the bacon, season it, and scramble it. Turn the mixture. Place cheese on the egg if desired, and top it with a slice of bread. To toast the bread, turn the sandwich over so the bread is next to the top of the stove.\nYou can bake any food with the tin can that you normally do, including this unusual recipe, simple and tasty:\nPineapple upside down cake: Oil the inside of a tuna fish can and place a long strip of aluminum foil about one inch wide across the bottom of the can and up the sides with both ends projecting to can and up the sides with both ends projecting to use in lifting the cake from the can. Place one slice of pineapple in the bottom of the can with a maraschino cherry in the center. Sprinkle the pineapple with one tablespoon of brown sugar. Next, wet the sugar with pineapple juice, then fill the can two-thirds full with any cake batter. Place the can on top of the rocks, cover with the oven, and bake for about 20 minutes or until the cake is firm to the touch and light brown on top.\nStove: Cut one end from a # 10 (one gallon) tin can with a can opener. The open end is the bottom. Next to the bottom, cut a small door 3 inches high and 4 inches wide with tinsnips. Bend out and up. With a V-can opener, punch holes opposite the door next to the top for ventilation.\nBuddy-Burner (fuel): Remove the lid from a tuna fish can and save it. Cut a strip of corrugated cardboard across the corrugations, about 1 1/2 inches wide and 4 1/2 feet long. Roll it tightly, and place it in the can. Fill the can with melted wax. When the wax cools, light it by turning the can on its side so the match flame will reach the wax. One full can will burn 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Refill the can by putting small chunks of wax into the flame and melting them. The cardboard will last indefinitely.\nDamper: This is essential for controlling the flame. Make a handle by bending a coat hanger or heavy wire into a hair-pin shape. Wire the u-shaped end to the lid by punching small holes in the lid. Bend the handle end down. A more temporary damper consists of three or four layers of aluminum foil in a 12 to 15 inch strip; bend the last two inches down at a 45-degree angle for a handle. Slide the damper back and forth over the buddy-burner to regulate heat.\nOven: Remove both ends from a can similar to a shortening can, cover the top with transparent oven-bake wrap, and wire the wrap into place. Make a handle by inserting wire ends under the wire holding the wrap in place—Put three or four pebbles on the stove top, and put food in a tuna fish can, on a lid, or on aluminum foil. Place the food container on the rocks, and cover with the oven.","|Smoked Alaskan King White Salmon on a Bed of Succotash Topped with Alfalfa Sprouts|\nWhite king salmon has a softer flesh and is buttery and silky, less \"meaty\" than red salmon. It is clearly salmon, but with flavors evocative of perch and Chilean sea bass. A white king salmon is considered to be an oddity where only one in 100 wild kings is white, and there is no way to know until a fish is gutted whether it has white or red flesh. One theory about white king salmon is that they eat a different diet from their red counterparts. The bright-red color of wild salmon comes from a diet of shrimps, krill and crabs that contain carotenoids, natural pigments found in plants and animals. Beta-carotene, which makes carrots orange, is probably the most familiar one. Some scientists believe that white salmon eat mostly squid and fish, which have fewer carotenoids. Okay, enough. I'm starting to sound like Alton Brown.\nA few weeks ago, I received an e-mail from Great-Alaska-Seafood.com announcing that they were offering a special for 8 pounds of the ivory fish. Typically, I'm not one who keeps anything frozen in the ice box, or more contemporarily speaking, the fridge--other than stocks or sauces-- but I opted to place the order. And what an order it was.\nThe fish arrived in a Styrofoam box. The salmon was sealed in ten individually frozen cryovac packages. Each package contained a 13-14 ounce portion which is enough to serve two people. Additionally, since the packages are in cryovac, they could also be prepared in the Sous Vide Supreme machine. That's another story.\nFor the first recipe, I sautéed the fish in a mixture of olive oil and butter, skin-side down first for about 3 minutes, then the flesh side down for another 2 minutes. I do not like overcooked fish. When done, I topped the fish, flesh side up, with a sprinkling of pink sea salt and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Made this way, the fish was perfect served with a side of freshly sautéed spinach and garlic.\nAnother method I used that was quick and very easy to do was to poach the fish in about 2 cups of (home-made) fish stock and butter. As the fish simmered, I spooned the pan juices over it while gently turning. It was done in just a few minutes. Prepared this way, I served the fish with a side of bamboo rice, topped with a ginger glaze.Then, I pulled out the indoor grill. After lightly brushing the fish with olive oil and seasoning with kosher salt and freshly-ground white pepper, I grilled the fish until done. Served with a topping of sautéed porcini mushrooms, parsley and lemon, this was another winner.\nSautéing, poaching, and grilling fish. Nothing new here. And with all of this beautiful fish at my disposal, I was anxious to make some new recipes, so I decided to pull out the Camerons stove top smoker and make white smoked salmon. Before I smoked the salmon, I created a brine and let the salmon sit in it for about 8 hours. The brine is supposed to help form a coating on the fish to prevent it from drying out and prevent the smoked flavor from becoming too overbearing within the flesh of the fish during the smoking process. For my brining mixture, I used low-sodium soy sauce in lieu of the cups of salt typically found in brining recipes. Also, I used a combination of peppercorns. My smoking mixture consisted of kicked up rice and teas, brown sugar, and alder chips.\n|White King Salmon in Brine|\n2 cups water\n1/2 cup dark brown sugar\n1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce\n1 tablespoon white peppercorns\n1 tablespoon green peppercorns\n1 tablespoon pink peppercorns\n2 fresh bay leaves\n2 6-oz portions of Alaskan White King Salmon, skin on\nMix brining ingredients together until sugar is dissolved.

The pan is ready to go.\nSuccotash ingredients:4 ears fresh corn, husked\n4 ounces fresh green beans, trimmed\n4 ounces sugar snap peas\n1/4 cup chopped chives\n2 tablespoons butter\nGarnish:Lime or lemon wedges\nMake the Succotash:\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add corn, turn off heat and let sit 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Cut kernels from cobs and place into a medium saucepan. Set aside.\nBring another large pot of salted water to a boil. Add green beans and cook until tender and slightly crisp, about 4 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and place into a separate bowl of ice water. Bring cooking water back to a boil and add snap peas. Cook until tender but slightly crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove snap peas and place into a bowl of ice water. Remove both vegetables from ice baths and pat dry on paper towels. Then, halve green beans, and slice snap peas diagonally into 1/2-inch pieces. Add the green beans and snap peas and butter to corn mixture. Place pan over medium heat and stir until thoroughly warmed. Stir in chives.To smoke the salmon:\nRemove salmon from brining mixture. Pat dry and place into prepared smoker, skin side up. Smoke for about 12 minutes. Turn off heat and let salmon rest in smoker for another 2-3 minutes. Remove fish from smoker.\nTo serve:Make a bed of succotash mixture on each plate.

{"question":"What are the drought tolerance characteristics of buffalograss and what are its limitations in terms of location suitability?","answer":"Buffalograss is among the most drought-tolerant turfgrass species, capable of surviving without irrigation once established. However, it's important to note that non-irrigated buffalograss becomes dormant during most summers and becomes prone to weed invasion while dormant.

It thrives with little maintenance and occasional watering, and tolerates cold, heat, and shade.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 6-11\nVarieties: Meyer, Zenith (zones 6-7); Cavalier, Zorro, Emerald, El Toro, Zenith, Zeon (zones 8-10)\nCare: Zoysiagrass will take longer to establish than other turfgrasses, but once settled it requires less mowing and repairs itself. Full sun is best, but it can tolerate shade.\nCost: Zoysiagrass sod has an average cost of around 50 cents per square foot.\nBuffalograss is the only grass native to North America used as turfgrass, making it perfect for homeowners who prefer to grow native species. This warm-season grass gets its name from the American bison, who eat it as a forage diet.\nBuffalograss is among the most heat- and drought-tolerant turfgrass species. Historically, it’s perfect for lawns in the western prairie and plains, but cultivars have developed to extend its adaptation regions.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Legacy (zones 3-6), Prestige (zones 5-9), Bison, Bowie, Plains\nCare: The best time to plant is late spring or early summer. Proper irrigation is important while planting, but once established, it can survive without watering and it should only be watered to prevent dormancy or keep the grass growing.\nBuffalograss is low density, so it’s at risk of weed competition. Don’t overfertilize or use products that aren’t labeled for buffalograss.\nCost: Buffalograss is more expensive than other turfgrass varieties due to the difficulty of harvesting seeds. Seed packets run around $8 per ounce.\nBermudagrass can be considered a convenient turfgrass option or a troublesome weed, depending on the needs of your yard. In agriculture, it’s considered a pest for corn fields and vineyards and is difficult to eradicate due to its deep rhizomes and seed production. As a lawn grass, however, its resilience makes it appealing for homeowners in warmer climates.\nNative to tropical and subtropical regions, Bermudagrass thrives with heavy rainfall but can survive in arid climates with some supplemental watering. Its ability to go dormant and produce seeds under stress conditions helps it survive extreme drought.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Sunturf, Tiflawn\nCare: Bermudagrass needs plenty of nitrogen in its soil, so you may want to apply fertilizer. With frequent mowing and adequate fertilization and watering, Bermudagrass produces a dense, dark green turf. It does produce a lot of pollen, however.\nCost: Bermudagrass seed costs between $7 and $10 per pound.\n4. Kentucky Bluegrass\nKentucky bluegrass is less drought-tolerant than other fescues, but its ability to go dormant under stress helps it weather drought with reduced watering. This cool-season grass is adapted to a wide range of climates, and can handle both warm summers and cold winters.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Kentucky bluegrass has hundreds of cultivars due to its long history of development, including Galaxy, Merion, and Windsor.\nCare: Kentucky bluegrass is particularly drought-tolerant when it’s young, but thatch buildup will reduce its resilience. It can be paired with other drought-tolerant grasses to increase lawn health and shade tolerance.\nCost: Kentucky bluegrass seed costs around $7.50 per pound.\n5. Red Fescue\nRed fescue is a low-maintenance, cool-season grass that thrives in shade and cold conditions. It’s a perfect companion for Kentucky bluegrass and can go dormant in the summer to weather drought.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 1-7 (perennial); 8-10 (annual)\nVarieties: Creeping red fescue, Chewings fescue\nCare: Red fescue doesn’t need much fertilizer or water. It should be mown relatively high. While it does well in shade, cold, and drought, it has low heat tolerance.\nCost: Creeping red fescue seed runs around $7 per pound, while Chewings fescue seed is approximately $6 per pound.\nBahiagrass is a warm-season grass that’s native to South America and particularly common in the Southeast U.S. Its deep root systems and prolific seed production make it tolerant of drought, shade, and poor drainage, and it’s also resistant to many pests and diseases.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 7-10\nVarieties: Common bahiagrass, Pensacola bahiagrass\nCare: Bahiagrass should be planted in the spring to avoid the worst of weed competition, and be sure to keep control over weeds during establishment.\nCost: A five-pound bag of bahiagrass seed is available for around $35.\n7. St. Augustinegrass\nSt. Augustinegrass is a shade-tolerant warm-season grass. Native to the Gulf Coast, it creates a lush blue-green lawn with dense turf. It has a high tolerance for salt, making it ideal for coastal regions. It’s also drought-tolerant and won’t need watering until it shows signs of stress.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 8-11\nVarieties: Palmetto, Floratam, Raleigh, Mercedes, Bitterblue, Jade\nCare: St. Augustinegrass can be high maintenance and should be mown at the recommended height and fertilized regularly. It is susceptible to winter injury and damage from chinch bugs.\nCost: St. Augustinegrass installation is typically around 80 cents per square foot.\nDrought-Tolerant Ornamental Grasses\nIf you’re looking to add drought-tolerant accents to your yard, check your local ordinances first. In Nevada, a recent water conservation law now bans the use of decorative grasses at office parks, housing developments, and street medians.\nWith these hardy ornamental grasses, however, you’ll save water and keep your front yard fresh.\n1. Fountain Grass\nFountain grass provides an elegant appearance, with clumps of draping leaves and flower spikes that sway in the breeze. It prefers dry soils with full sun, making it a great choice for a drought-tolerant yard, but it can thrive in partial shade and most soil conditions.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 4-10\nVarieties: Fox Trot (zone 4), Cassian (zones 5-6), Redhead (zones 5-6)\nCare: Fountain grass can become invasive in warmer climates, and it may struggle to survive in wet years. It’s recommended to divide and replant clumps every three years to rejuvenate the plant, though for smaller ones this may not be necessary.\nCost: A gallon pot of fountain grass costs about $25.\n2. Blue Fescue\nBlue fescue is also known as sheep grass, and it’s prized for its drought tolerance and beautiful silver-blue to blue-green color. In mild climates, it stays green year-round. Blue fescue is a versatile plant that thrives in many conditions and can be grown in rock gardens, rain gardens, or as landscape edging.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 4-9\nVarieties: Elijah Blue, Sea Urchin, Boulder Blue\nCare: Blue fescue can be short-lived in wet soil and areas with high temperatures. It should be trimmed back to 3 or 4 inches in early spring to remove dead foliage and allow new growth.\nCost: “Boulder Blue” blue fescue plants are available for about $15.\n3. Prairie Dropseed\nPrairie dropseed is a unique ornamental grass native to the Great Plains, though it’s also found in some parts of the Midwest and Northeast. This resilient warm-season grass overwinters by turning a beautiful bronze color, and in the summer, it grows tiny pink-and-brown flowers with a smell that resembles licorice or popcorn.\nUSDA Hardiness Zones: 3-9\nVarieties: Tara, Morning Mist\nCare: Prairie dropseed tolerates both drought and periodic wet conditions. Once established, it requires very little care aside from removing old foliage in early spring, and doesn’t have any serious pest problems. It’s difficult to start from seed and is often grown from plugs or divisions.\nCost: A 12-pack of plugs costs about $30.\nFAQ About Drought-Tolerant Grasses\nDrought-tolerant grass can weather periods of drought on minimal water through dormancy and other adaptations. “Drought-tolerant” shouldn’t be confused with “drought-resistant” – the latter means that a plant can survive on NO water for long periods of time.\nTo keep your grass healthy in drought, reduce fertilization, water deeply and less frequently to encourage longer root growth, and mow your grass at the highest recommended height.\nYes, mowing your grass at the highest recommended height will increase leaf area to encourage more photosynthesis, allowing grass to better survive stress periods like drought.\nWhen to Call a Lawn Care Pro for Help\nIf you’re brainstorming the perfect drought-tolerant grasses for your yard, a professional can provide insight on the best options for your area and your lawn’s needs.

Cox* (2/12)\n- Buffalograss is a perennial, warm season grass species. It is sod-forming, spreading by stolons (aboveground stems) which root where they touch the ground, forming new plants.\n- Success and satisfaction with buffalograss is dependent on the use of proper establishment and management practices. While it can be considered a low-maintenance grass once it is established, the production of a buffalograss lawn from seed can be a labor intensive and somewhat frustrating process.\n- Once established, buffalograss can survive without irrigation. However, non-irrigated buffalograss becomes dormant during most summers, and is prone to weed invasion while dormant.\nBuffalograss (Buchloë dactyloides) is a perennial, warm season grass species. It is sod-forming, spreading by stolons (aboveground stems) which root where they touch the ground, forming new plants. Native to Colorado and much of the North American Great Plains, it displays a wide range of adaptability. Buffalograss, a “warm-season grass”, grows most actively from late May through early September; it breaks dormancy in mid- to late spring, well after bluegrass and fescue lawns become green; it turns brown and dormant with the first hard frost in the fall. Its long dormant period and reputation of being expensive and difficult-to-establish has made buffalograss a less-popular lawn option for many homeowners. However, the development of attractive turftype cultivars and greater availability of seed, sod and plugs has generated new interest in this grass for home lawns. These new turf-type varieties are darker green, form a dense, short-growing turf, and are more resistant to weed invasion than previously-used varieties. Those who choose to plant newer buffalograss varieties find that their lawn can remain green and attractive on 50-75 percent less irrigation than Kentucky bluegrass, requires less frequent mowing, and thrives when fertilized only once or twice yearly.\nSeeded cultivars (varieties) of buffalograss that can produce a good quality lawn include: Bison, Bowie, Cody, Plains, and Topgun. It should be noted that the Texoka and Sharp's Improved varieties are used for mainly pasture and rangeland revegetation, producing a less attractive lawn. Certain varieties of buffalograss are available only in vegetative form (sod or plugs). These vegetative varieties will provide the best quality buffalograss lawn, but may be more expensive to use for lawn establishment than the seeded varieties. Commercially available vegetative types include: Prairie, 609, Legacy, Prestige, and Turffalo. Prairie and 609 are likely to suffer moderate to significant winterkill during most winters along the Colorado Front Range, and are not recommended except in southern and southeastern Colorado and the Grand Junction area. Legacy, Prestige, and Turffalo have proven to be quite winter-hardy and will produce a high quality buffalograss lawn anywhere in Colorado when planted at elevations below 6500 feet.\nBuffalograss Establishment and Management\nSuccess and satisfaction with buffalograss is critically dependent on the use of proper establishment and management practices. While it can be considered a low-maintenance grass once it is established, the production of a buffalograss lawn from seed can be a labor intensive and somewhat frustrating process. The use of sod improves results for the average home gardener, but it will be more expensive than if seed or plugs are used for establishment. It is essential to understand that, although buffalograss is a highly drought-resistant native plant, supplemental water MUST be used liberally in order to establish a lawn. The amount of water required to establish a buffalograss lawn from seed, sod, or plugs will be equal to (and occasionally greater than) that amount required to establish a bluegrass or tall fescue lawn.\nSeeding a buffalograss lawn\nProper seedbed preparation is vital for successful seeding and obtaining a uniform lawn. The soil should be rock- and debrisfree, level, and firm enough to walk on without sinking in more than one inch when dry (soil that is loose and fluffy should be firmed by rolling prior to seeding). Use a seeding rate of three-five lbs. seed/1000 square feet. Seed should be planted to ½ inch depth, using a seed drill if available. If the seed is spread on the soil with a spreader, it should be covered with ¼ to ½ inch of soil by light raking. Buffalograss seed can be planted anytime in the spring and until late July; seed planted in early spring will not germinate until soil warms to above 55 degrees F in late spring. Seed planted too late in the season (between August 1 and October 1) may germinate, but the young seedlings are quite susceptible to being killed during the winter. Buffalograss seeded during October-December (dormant seeding) will not germinate until the following spring with warming soil temperatures; dormant-planted seed will not rot or otherwise degrade over the winter. With warm soil and consistent irrigation, seedlings will appear in seven to 21 days. Pre-emergent herbicides (“crabgrass preventer”) for weed prevention should NOT be used at the time of seeding. Apply turf fertilizer (do NOT use a “weed and feed” product) according to label instructions two to three weeks after the seedlings begin to appear; repeat about six weeks later. Irrigate to prevent excessive drying and to maintain active grass growth. When it appears that most of the seed has germinated, the new lawn should be irrigated less frequently. Occasional mowing (stop irrigation one-two days prior to mowing to dry out the soil) will encourage the buffalograss to spread and fill in open areas, and may help to control any weeds that have begun growing. Extra seed can be scratched into open or thin spots in the new lawn.\nPlugging a buffalograss lawn\nThe use of pre-rooted plugs (sold via the internet, by some sod farms, and at a few nurseries and garden centers, in trays similar to those in which annual flowers are sold) can provide complete cover six to 12 weeks after planting (depending on plug spacing and weather conditions). As with seeding, proper soil preparation (see above) is essential for success when using plugs. Plant plugs on 12 to 18 inch centers following the last spring frost and at least 6 weeks prior to the first expected fall frost. Apply a starter-type fertilizer according to label instructions at planting, and again about 6-7 weeks after planting. Irrigate to maintain a moist surface for seven-10 days (three-five short irrigation cycles daily, every two-four hours beginning at 8:00 or 9:00 a.m.), and to maintain active grass growth thereafter. The pre-emergent herbicide pendimethalin (sold as Pre-M® or Scotts Halts/Crabgrass Preventer®) can be used to prevent weed invasion and is safe to use at the time of planting plugs. Buffalograss plugs will often turn brown after planting, even with adequate irrigation. This is quite normal; if they have been receiving consistent moisture, they have not died. The grass will come out of dormancy after the plugs have formed a healthy root system. It is important that the plugs and soil be kept moist after planting, even though the plugs may turn brown and appear to be dead or dormant.\nSodding a buffalograss lawn\nBuffalograss can be sodded like many other grass species to produce an instant lawn. Buffalograss sod is significantly more expensive than bluegrass sod and availability is much more limited. However, it is the quickest, easiest, and least frustrating way of getting a buffalograss lawn. Adequate soil preparation (see above, under ‘Seeding’) and careful post-plant care will aid in sod establishment. Transplanted buffalograss sod should be irrigated like any other transplanted sod: that is, it should be given enough water to maintain a moist, but not saturated, root zone under the sod. It is very common for buffalograss sod to quickly turn brown following transplanting, even though it is being irrigated. It may remain dormant-brown for one to two weeks while new roots are being formed. New, white root growth can be seen on the bottom of the sod after a few days of watering, even though the grass may be entirely brown in color. After enough rooting has occurred, the buffalograss will begin to form new leaves and green up. Proper irrigation is crucial during this root formation period.\nColor and growth of an established buffalograss lawn will improve with fertilization, but little improvement occurs when more than two pounds of total N per 1000 square feet per growing season is applied. A suggested application schedule is one pound of N per 1000 square feet in late May to mid June, and again in late July. Excessive fertilization, especially in combination with too much water, can result in rapid weed invasion in the buffalograss lawn. Buffalograss is sometimes prone to iron chlorosis (yellowing) on high pH soils; supplemental iron applications will help to prevent or remedy this problem.\nOnce established, buffalograss can survive without irrigation. However, non-irrigated buffalograss becomes dormant during most summers, and is prone to weed invasion while dormant. Buffalograss lawns require a minimum of one-two inches of rainfall or irrigation every two-four weeks during the summer to maintain active growth and to look acceptably green. Deeper, infrequent irrigation (for example, one inch every two-four weeks, depending on rainfall) produces a good-quality buffalograss lawn and discourages weed invasion. Irrigation can begin in mid- to late-May if the spring is dry; irrigation earlier in the season does not speed spring green-up and encourages weed growth.\nWeed invasion is the most common and frustrating pest problem in the buffalograss home lawn. Pre-emergent herbicides (“crabgrass preventers”) are safe to use in the spring on well-established, mature buffalograss lawns to prevent annual grassy weeds like crabgrass and foxtail. Yet, the control of existing weeds – both grassy and broadleaf – presents a more difficult problem for the manager of a buffalograss lawn. Buffalograss can be easily injured, and therefore discolored, by many of the off-the-shelf herbicides (especially those containing 2,4-D) sold in garden centers and nurseries for the control of dandelions and other broadleaf weeds in Kentucky bluegrass and tall fescue lawns. These products can be safely used on fully dormant buffalograss in spring or fall (spot treat only; do not broadcast apply). However, they may cause slight to severe discoloration (yellowing or browning) of green, actively growing buffalograss during the spring and summer. These products should be used carefully. All label directions should be followed and products should be used sparingly. They can be used as a spot treatment (spraying individual weeds, and not the entire lawn). For a severe weed problem, the use of a professional lawn care company should be considered. Professional applicators are able to use herbicides which are both very effective and safe for use on buffalograss (these herbicides are often very expensive and generally not for sale to the home gardener). One effective—but somewhat risky—method of controlling winter/early spring weeds in buffalograss is to apply glyphosate (Round-up®, Kleen-up® and other trade names) when the buffalograss is TOTALLY brown and dormant, but while the weeds are green, and not stressed by drought. This should be applied on a warm day in March to early April. When applied to dormant buffalograss, the glyphosate product should be applied to the individual weeds as a very light mist (use the pre-mixed, hand-pump products). Glyphosate applied too heavily will tend to drip off of the dormant brown buffalograss leaves onto green runners and other plant parts near the soil surface, causing dead spots to show up in the lawn as it begins to green up in late spring. DO NOT APPLY GLYPHOSATE ONCE GREEN LEAVES BEGIN TO APPEAR IN THE BUFFALOGRASS (late April to mid-May).\nNo serious diseases cause problems on buffalograss lawns in Colorado.\nMealybugs (Tridiscus sporoboli and Trionymus sp.) and a short-winged species of chinch bug (Blissus sp.) have been found in Nebraska buffalograss lawns, but have not yet caused problems in Colorado. Leafhoppers and grasshoppers are common nuisance pests, but do not generally damage healthy buffalograss lawns.\nWhere buffalograss is NOT a good lawn choice\n- Moderate to very shady locations (more than ½ day of heavy shade).\n- Saline soils (greater than 6-8 mmhos/cm salinity).\n- Above approximately 6500 feet elevation. A protected, sunny, south- or west-facing exposure may allow buffalograss to be used successfully at 6500-7000 feet, but the growing season (period during which the grass is green) will be short.\n- Very droughty, sandy soils - unless supplemental irrigation is provided.\n- Small, heavily used home lawns, athletic fields, or other situations where foot or vehicular traffic is BOTH concentrated and constant. Sporadic heavy use is not a problem for buffalograss, nor is light, constant use.\n|Inclusion of chemical or trade names does not imply any product endorsement, nor does exclusion imply criticism, by the author or Colorado State University.

{"question":"How do soil preparation and nitrogen requirements affect summer forage growth, and what are the seeding specifications?","answer":"Land preparation should start at the end of the rains following a crop season. Summer forage does well in sandy soils and can be grown with minimal soil disturbance. For seeding, proper depth and soil contact are crucial - sudangrass should be planted ½-¾ inch deep, while sorghum-sudangrass needs ¾-1 inch depth. Regarding nitrogen, it's essential for high yield and protein content. Apply 80-90 lbs/acre of actual nitrogen at seeding, followed by 50-60 lbs/acre after each cut. Well-composted manure should be applied during land preparation and worked into the soil, and organic foliar feeds can be added when the plant is knee-high.","context":["Summer Forage frequently asked questions\nWhat are the advantages of Summer Forage?\nSummer forage has many advantages:\n• It can grow well in both high and even in low potential areas with poor soils.\n• As a fodder crop it can be used in adequate supply when maize and other feed sources fail.\n• Most varieties of summer forage produce much more forage than corn.\n• Unlike corn, the lower leaves do not dry out as the plant matures; they remain green and therefore retain a higher crude protein content.\n• Summer forage can regenerate (grow again) after cutting the stalks for fodder; The ratoon crop will mature early in the following season but yield slightly less than the first crop – depending on level of plant feeds available. This way farmers can reduce the cost of replanting, land preparation, seeds and time.\n• As animal feed, it has the same energy level as maize or other cereals.\n• Summer Forage can withstand dry conditions and remain green at very low moisture levels.\nIs Summer Forage easy to plant?\nTo get a good Summer Forage crop a farmer needs to observe these guidelines:\nLand Preparation: For both forage and food varieties of sorghum, start preparing the land at the end of the rains following a crop season. Summer Forage does well in sandy soils. It can also be grown where the soils are not disturbed much (where conservation tillage is practiced).\nSeed rate and spacing: For information on seed rate and spacing please see the Summer Crop Variety Guide.\nSowing: Summer Forage should be sown at the onset of the long rains. Drill seeds along the furrows (trenches).\nManure application: Well-composted manure should be applied during land preparation and worked into the soil. Organic foliar feeds can be added when the plant is knee high.\nWeeding: Hand weeding should be done at least twice. A sorghum field should be kept weed-free especially at early stages of growth.\nPest and disease control: Control of cutworms, aphids, shoot-fly and stalk borer is important. Birds like sorghum especially at milk stage; they prefer white-seeded varieties. Sorghum is generally disease tolerant. Control disease when necessary.\nHarvesting: Summer Forage meant for feed can be cut when still green and fresh. Leave it in sun to allow wilting for 12 hours then chop and then feed the animals. To make silage, start harvesting at dough stage (between milky and hardening stage). For dual-purpose sorghum, cut the head with a knife or use a combine harvester.\nWhat is Pioneer® brand Betta Graze?\nBetta Graze is a tall late flowering, late maturing hybrid (sorghum x sudan hybrid) grown for high quality, high yielding summer feed for grazing in dairy, beef and sheep systems, and also for silage .\nRapid early growth, quick recovery after grazing or cutting along with delayed flowering means Betta Graze is a versatile, easy to manage summer feed. High sugar content, fine stems and a high leaf to stem ratio ensure excellent palatability and feed value.\nBetta Graze seed is available with bird repellent for an extra charge. This will reduce the risk of crop establishment problems due to bird damage of seedling crops.\nWhat is the best timing in order to maximize utilisation of Betta Graze?\nBetta Graze feed value is highest when the crop is less than 1.2 m in height. Graze Betta Graze behind a wire or cut it 35-45 days after planting when the crop reaches around 1 metre in height. Leave a residual of 15cm for maximum regrowth. Recut or graze after 4-5 weeks when the crop is at least 0.8m and no more than 1.2m in height.\nWhat are my feeding options for Betta Graze?\nBetta Graze can be grazed by break feeding to stock. Back-fencing is essential to minimise plant damage and allow quick re-growth in the grazed portion of the crop and to avoid crop toxicity.\nBetta Graze can be made into pit, bunker or round bale silage. It is always recommended to cut using a mower-conditioner and wilt in the paddock for a maximum of 48 hours.\nWhat is Pioneer® brand Super Sweet Sudan?\nPioneer® brand hybrid Super Sweet Sudan (SSS) is quick to graze and sustains multiple and intensive grazing. SSS produces high quality hay and round bale silage suitable for sheep and cattle. Adaptable for early or late planting.\nWhat is the primary use of SSS?\nCattle and sheep plus intensive or non intensive grazing. SSS produces highly palatable hay plus round bale silage.\nHow do i get the best result from SSS?\nPlease see our SSS Growing Guide","Updated: Apr 11, 2022\nSudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass are warm-season annual grasses from the sorghum family. They are grown in the summer and have the potential to provide high yields of palatable, high quality forage when managed properly. Although rainfall is necessary for optimal growth, they are very drought tolerant and respond well to hot summer weather. They are very frost sensitive, both in the spring as seedlings, as well as in the fall when frost will kill them, preventing any further growth.\nConsider terminating winter injured, low yielding alfalfa fields after first-cut and planting to sorghum-sudangrass or sudangrass for emergency forage. They can also be planted into unseeded soybean and corn acres during a wet year to provide additional forage.\nWhile sorghum-sudangrass has higher yield potential, sudangrass is leafier with much finer stems, which provides higher forage quality. New BMR (brown mid-rib) types of both species are available, which provide low-lignin, higher fibre digestibility (NDFD) for improved forage quality. Yield expectations under optimal weather conditions, management, and timely seeding are 3 – 4 tonnes or more of dry matter per acre. Harvested at the correct stage with good fertility, these crops, particularly BMR types, have high digestible energy and crude protein levels of 15 – 20%. For dairy quality feed, BMR sudangrass is preferred. The BMR sudangrass varieties exclusive to Quality Seeds include SS2.\nSudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass require a soil temperature of at least 15.5 - 18°C (60 - 65°F) for optimal germination, rapid emergence and growth. This typically occurs the last week of may or early-June. They do not perform well in cold soils. While they have very good drought tolerance once established, some rainfall is necessary for germination and early growth.\nSudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass can be no-till drilled following a low yielding alfalfa stand after first-cut and a burndown, or seeded into a prepared seedbed. Sorghum-sudangrass and sudangrass seedlings are not competitive in an existing alfalfa-grass stand, so a burndown or tillage is necessary. No-tilling into an existing stand without a burndown or tillage is usually disappointing. An application of glyphosate, or a “stale seedbed” system (tillage followed by harrowing after weed seedlings emerge) before seeding should be done to prevent excessive weed competition (particularly grasses) to sorghum seedlings. When following an unproductive first-cut, a pre-harvest application of glyphosate can enable an earlier seeding.\nProper seeding depth and seed-to-soil contact is important. Suggested seeding depth for sudangrass is ½ - ¾ inch and ¾ - 1 inch for sorghum-sudangrass. The seedbed should be firm, and well packed after seeding. Seeds planted too deep, or too shallow by broadcasting, frequently result in seeding failures. A no-till drill is best for proper seed placement. A suggested seeding rate for sudangrass is 25 - 30 lbs/ac. A suggested seeding rate for sorghum-sudangrass is sometimes 40 - 50 lbs/ac, but a seeding rate of up to 60 lb/acre can provide a stem that is finer and less coarse, and also provides greater competition against weeds.\nNitrogen (N) is essential for high yield and protein content. A split application of nitrogen should be applied at seeding at a rate of 80 - 90 lbs/acre of actual N (185 lbs urea), and an additional 50 - 60 lb/acre (120 lbs urea) after each cut for the next cutting, depending on yield potential. (50 lbs/acre of actual N for each tonne of expected dry matter yield.) If liquid manure is to be applied, it should preferably be done before planting, or immediately after harvest (within 2 days) and N rates should be adjusted accordingly. There is some susceptibility to heavy traffic damage. P and K removal rates are similar to other grass forage species – approximately 12 lbs P2O5and 50 lbs K2O per ton of dry matter yield.\nGrowth of these species is initially modest, but accelerates very rapidly at about the 7 – 8 leaf stage. Once established at this stage, rapid growth usually out-competes most weeds, and herbicide weed control is not necessary. However, if broadleaf weed pressure is heavy at the seedling stage, herbicide application may be considered. Refer to OMAFRA Publication 75, Guide To Weed Control www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/pub75/pub75A/pub75A.pdf,\np.186. Herbicides include bromoxynil (Pardner) and prosulfuron (Peak + Assist).\nGrowth & Harvest\nAfter seeding, seedlings should emerge within a week given warm soils and adequate moisture. Dry weather can delay emergence.\nFor dairy cow, high quality feed, first-cut typically occurs 40 – 50 days after planting, before the “head emergence” stage, while the crop is 36 – 45 inches in height. Nutrient quality drops quickly and dramatically at heading. A rule-of-thumb is 45 days or 45 inches, whichever comes first. Regrowth is rapid, and a second-cut is usually ready 30 – 35 days later.\nThese species are harvested as haylage or baleage, but because their stems contain high moisture levels, they cannot be dried for hay. A high cutting height of at least 4 inches (leaving 2 growth nodes) is required for faster regrowth. Wide swaths and proper roll conditioning (crimping) enables faster wilting to proper ensiling moisture. Adequate packing for efficient fermentation can sometimes be an issue with coarser stemmed sorghum-sudangrass.\nWhile 2 cuts are common, with timely seeding and aggressive cutting schedules, and without an early frost, 3 cuttings in a season are possible.\nNitrates & Prussic Acid\nIdeally, the final cut of the season should be taken before frost to optimize forage quality and eliminate potential prussic acid risk and high nitrates. Prussic acid toxicity after frost can be a potential issue with sorghums when grazed, but this is usually not an issue as haylage when fully fermented.\nNitrate toxicity is possible with warm-season annual grasses, particularly if harvested following a drought-ending rain, but again, this is also more of an issue with pasture and green-chop. When high nitrates occur, fermentation dissipates the nitrates as nitrogen dioxide (silo gas).\nFor information on how to manage to risk of prussic acid and nitrate poisoning, particularly in green chop and pasture situations, refer to “Forage Sorghum-Sudangrass” at www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/98-043.htm.\nUsing BMR Sudangrass As A Companion Crop With Forage Underseedings\nThis has been done successfully by farmers in Quebec and on a smaller scale by farmers in Ontario using specific management practises. Quality Seeds did some plot trials in 2019 under Ontario environmental conditions with very promising results. (Figure 3)\nAdditional suggested management practises to consider when underseeding to BMR sudangrass are as follows:\n· Glyphosate burndown and tillage before planting essential\n· 20 lbs/ac sudangrass and 18-20 lbs/ac alfalfa-grass blended together, seeded with a no-till drill through the cereal box at ½ inch seeding depth (maximum), seedbed well packed and firm\n· Nitrogen fertility requirements are the same as above\n· Do not apply manure after planting or harvest - very susceptible to traffic damage\n· Harvest the last cut before September or just before frost, avoiding the critical fall harvest period\nFigure 1 – HayKing II BMR sudangrass planted at 35 lbs/ac on June 18th.

{"question":"How do AutoCAD and Blender compare in terms of their approach to 3D object creation and customization?","answer":"Both AutoCAD and Blender offer robust 3D object creation capabilities, but with different approaches. AutoCAD allows users to create 3D objects from basic geometrical shapes and custom drawings, with high-quality textures and precise anchor points using a grid system. Blender, on the other hand, provides a comprehensive array of modeling tools and features a powerful cycles rendering engine for ultra-realistic rendering, along with advanced sculpting capabilities for organic subjects. Both software packages support materials customization and offer various tools to enhance precision in 3D modeling.","context":["Equipped with the right applications, a computer can be of great help in virtually any domain of activity. When it comes to designing and precision, no other tool is as accurate as a computer. Moreover, specialized applications such as AutoCAD give you the possibility to design nearly anything ranging from art, to complex mechanical parts or even buildings.\nSuitable for business environments and experienced users\nAfter a decent amount of time spent installing the application on your system, you are ready to fire it up. Thanks to the office suite like interface, all of its features are cleverly organized in categories. At a first look, it looks easy enough to use, but the abundance of features it comes equipped with leaves room for second thoughts.\nCreate 2D and 3D objects\nYou can make use of basic geometrical shapes to define your objects, as well as draw custom ones. Needless to say that you can take advantage of a multitude of tools that aim to enhance precision. A grid can be enabled so that you can easily snap elements, as well as adding anchor points to fully customize shapes.\nWith a little imagination and patience on your behalf, nearly anything can be achieved. Available tools allow you to create 3D objects from scratch and have them fully enhanced with high-quality textures. A powerful navigation pane is put at your disposal so that you can carefully position the camera to get a clearer view of the area of interest.\nVarious export possibilities\nSimilar to a modern web browser, each project is displayed in its own tab. This comes in handy, especially for comparison views. Moreover, layouts and layers also play important roles, as it makes objects handling a little easier.\nSine the application is not the easiest to carry around, requiring a slightly sophisticated machine to properly run, there are several export options put at your disposal so that the projects itself can be moved around.\nAside from the application specific format, you can save as an image file of multiple types, PDF, FBX and a few more. Additionally, it can be sent via email, directly printed out on a sheet of paper, or even sent to a 3D printing service, if available.\nTo end with\nAll in all, AutoCAD remains one of the top applications used by professionals to achieve great precision with projects of nearly any type. It encourages usage with incredible offers for student licenses so you get acquainted with its abundance of features early on. A lot can be said about what it can and can't do, but the true surprise lies in discovering it step-by-step.\nAutoCAD 20.0 Crack License Keygen For Windows (Updated 2022)\nIn early 1982, Roland Heslet, an engineer at a company called Xerox, used the PARC’s Sketchpad to create some rough-and-ready mockups of a graphical user interface that would eventually become Microsoft Windows. At the time, he was working on the mainframe computer at PARC, developing the well-known precursor to the graphical interfaces that we now expect. One of his colleagues, Bob Frankston, realized that he could apply a similar approach to the problem of turning ideas into a product. What if the idea was the product? He asked Heslet, “Suppose we started with the idea of something that let you draw on the screen, not a lot of ideas but a good idea, and then we would develop it in this way?” Heslet agreed and Frankston began building an idea-driven application. The name they came up with was “Doc-O-Matic”, and it became an early version of the AutoCAD application. Read more about the history of AutoCAD on Wikipedia.\nIn AutoCAD, a “document” is a single drawing, design, specification or other type of file. A single document can be saved or printed as multiple print layouts, or parts of a layout can be saved as separate documents. Documents can be created, updated, stored, searched, linked and merged together using a powerful hierarchical (folder) tree. They can be linked to projects, drawings, and drawings can be linked to tables or lines.\nIn earlier versions, documents could be created in the drawing’s default format. But AutoCAD’s new 2018.1 release provides support for ARX (application definition) and DWG (drawing) documents. These allow for increased interchange and easier design.\nDeeper Dimension Management\nAs of AutoCAD 2018.1, the AutoCAD application provides support for the following Microsoft Word-compliant document formats: DOC, DOCX, DOCM, and DOCZ. Additionally, it can now be used with open source LibreOffice. LibreOffice documents are better-behaved than AutoCAD files, and an icon is included on the ribbon to enable users to open and save them.\nIn AutoCAD, the name of a drawing is commonly referred to as the “Active Document”. The “Active Document” can be edited at any time and can be linked to other documents or to a table. A table can be linked to the Active Document and any other\nAutoCAD 20.0 Crack + Free Download\nOn April 2, 2009, Cracked AutoCAD With Keygen 2009 was released.

While household cleaning tools also involve chemicals, the precautions are less strict - cleaning vacuum filters should be done in a well-ventilated area to avoid dust clouds, and when using bleach solutions for mops and brooms, the main safety concern is wearing protective gloves to prevent skin damage, but there's no specific requirement for outdoor use. The gloss varnish step in sticker-making notably doesn't produce fumes and can be done indoors, showing how even within the same process, different chemicals require different safety measures.","context":["This tutorial provides a process for making stickers that last outdoors for a time. You can use this process to make stickers for store windows, for advertising upcoming events outdoors, or for leaving your artistic signature.\n1Obtain the proper materials. It is important to use materials that will ensure that your sticker can survive the outdoor environment. Acrylic varnish as a base, followed by a gloss varnish to cover the acrylic varnish is ideal. Look for acrylic varnish with UV protection. The gloss varnish forms a rubbery coating that stops the rain from causing the color to run. Workable fixative can be used as substitute for the acrylic varnish. These varnishes will not hurt the adhesive on the other side of the paper either.\n2Choose suitable inks. Acrylic inks come in a wide array of colors and metallic inks too. You just need brushes but the inks will go a long way. You can also get away with being less precise as they will not typically cover the black outline you laid down.\n3Select the markers. There are a lot of markers out there but many of them will not stand the test of time. A good marker has to be oil-based marker, meaning don't use a Sharpie. A few companies that make good markers are:\n- Marvy Uchida Deco color. These are the best for fills and and outlines because they can cover almost anything but be wary of the fumes. These will last outside without being treated for a while.\n- Sharpie oil paint. This is good for fills and outlines and has less odor than Deco. These will last outside without being treated for a while.\n- Sharpie poster paint. These are good for outlines and sometimes for fills. These will not last outside without being treated for a while.\n- Elmers paint markers. These are better for outlines, especially the black. These will last outside without being treated for a while.\n- Sakura. The metallic inks are the best. The color inks last when treated.\n4Take a full blank sheet of paper. Use a pencil to draw out the initial design. By using a pencil first, you can correct or redraw what you do not like. You can order the paper from many sources online; cheap matte finish paper is ideal as it will be getting treated anyway. Do not use an ink jet because the ink will not survive the weather. Only laser printers and copy machines will produce a black that lasts because the ink is melted on to the paper.\n5Draw over the pencil lines with a permanent maker.\n6Find the method that works best for you. There are two possible ways - print out a design using a laser printer or just draw it out. When a lot of black is involved, it's easier to use the laser printer ink from the computer. You could also draw it out and take it to the copy shop to make copies on sheets of sticker paper as well.\n7Outline all the drawings on the page. Touch up lines after you have finished coloring it.\n8Fill in the design. It is best to use the inks for this because they end up being cheaper than the markers when covering larger areas. They also lack the fumes of the markers, so are more pleasant to work with. When treated properly, the colors will last for quite a long time outside.\n9Decorate the design. After painting in the design, add any decoration with paint markers. You can also do this step after spraying with workable fixative if you want to add a layer of color.\n10Fix the inks on the paper. Although this step is not completely essential, it does ensure that the inks won't bleed when the gloss varnish is applied. Use either acrylic varnish or workable fixative. Work on this outside because of the fumes. It is recommended to do this direct onto an old board or a piece of cardboard so that the spray does not end up everywhere.\n11Seal the inks in. Once you have applied the gloss varnish, the inks will be sealed in and weather-protected. This step is vital to outdoor endurance. There are not fumes with gloss varnish, so this step can be done indoors.\n12Wash your brush immediately after using the gloss varnish. If you don't do this, your brush will turn hard and become unusable. Artist's pink soap is good to use but any type of soap will work.\n13Cut the design out. Use an Exacto knife to cut out the design. It is up to you whether or not you leave a border of white space or not. Scissors could be used in place of the knife.\n14Apply your stickers. They are now ready to stick outdoors. Make sure that the surface on which you apply your sticker is very clean and smooth. You might need to wipe it with paper towels etc. Latex based spray adhesive (e.g., 3M Photo Adhesive (Orange Label)) is a good choice for affixing your stickers. It is inexpensive, widely available, relatively easy to remove and will not damage most non-porous surfaces.\n- Hardened brushes can also be cleaned off with proprietary brush cleaner and restorer if you neglect to clean your brush quickly enough.\n- Consider scanning your drawing into the computer for later reproductions.\n- Using \"glue\" on windows is not recommended because it will permanently harden and damage your window. Instead, there are \"removable\" spray adhesives which will allow you to clean the window with an adhesive remover such as \"goo gone\" when you choose to remove your sign.\n- Avoid placing stickers where there is a notice about not posting bills etc. Your individual artwork will be highly recognizable!\nThings You'll Need\n- Acrylic varnish\n- Gloss varnish\n- Acrylic inks\n- Markers (see types suggested above)\n- Blank sheet of paper, matte finish paper is good\n- Artist's pink soap or soap or brush cleaner and restorer\n- Exacto knife or sharp paper scissors\n- Spray adhesive\nSources and Citations\n- Original source of article and photos, Señor Codo, The Process of Making Stickers, shared under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic License.\nIn other languages:\nThanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 46,941 times.","You can’t have a spotless home if you utilize dirty cleaning items and equipment. When your tools aren’t cleaned and stored correctly, they can become breeding grounds for germs and grime. Maintaining a clean home is not just the right thing to do. It’s also crucial to the well-being of your loved ones. Find out how to clean every cleaning tool and supply from your broom to your grimiest sponge.\nCleaning Tool #1: Vacuum Cleaner\nHow To Clean A Vacuum Cleaner\nIf your vacuum is not sucking dirt and dust as before, it may be blocked with something, or the filters are already full. Blockage causes the machine to be difficult to start up and to heat up rapidly. Replacing the bag, which is usually a part of the filtration system, can help reduce this to a minimum. It will be less effective if dust accumulates there. When the warning light comes on, it’s necessary to change the bag. If the device’s light isn’t working, you can always remove the machine’s case to conduct a thorough visual check of the bag’s contents.\nIt is necessary to remember to remove the dust and dirt from the canister after each usage of a bagless machine. If your bagless vacuum isn’t sucking either, it may be because the canister is full. To remove debris from a clogged vacuum, it is necessary to turn off the machine and disconnect it. Unscrew the hose and look for other blockages at the machine’s inlet or the bag’s top, in addition to plucking out the ones in the tube.\nHow To Clean The Filters\nA lot of vacuum cleaners have filters that you can clean. Determine where the filters are placed within your vacuum, remove them, and tap them against something hard to dislodge dust bunnies. Ensure to do this in a well-ventilated outdoor area, or you’ll create a dust cloud around yourself.\nThe filter must be washed in lukewarm water and dried for a minimum of 24 hours before being put back into the machine, if possible. Make sure to read the manual to see if the extra filters in the device can be cleaned too. If they can be washed, you can remove any clumps by tapping them on a hard surface before putting them back in the machine.\nHow To Clean The Brush Attachments\nRemove any hairs or threads from the brush’s bristles before using it. If it becomes stuck, remove the blockage by cutting (not pulling) the threads. Make sure not to cut the bristles so you won’t damage the brush attachment.\nIndentions along the length of the tip of some brushes are made so scissors can easily cut down hair and thread without snagging the bristles. If your brush head has no electrical components, you can clean it by soaking it in warm water and stroking the bristles to loosen any dust or fibers that may have lodged there. Before reattaching it to the machine, make sure to dry it thoroughly.\nCleaning Tool #2: Mop Head\nHow To Clean Smelly Mop Head\nIn a seemingly contradictory turn of events, the products we utilize to clean the floors might also cause the mop to develop a smell. The filth and germs that will indeed find their way into its fibers are some of the causes. Cleaning the mop is necessary for sanitary reasons. Having a clean mop can eliminate unpleasant odors in the home.\nTo clean your mop head, you could use either hot or cold water, then add a gentle detergent to fill a bucket. You can use bleach and a good detergent instead of soap. Put the mop head in the bucket. This method is safe for any mop head, whether it is a microfiber or cloth type. Grab and wear your protective gloves, then wash the mop in the solution in the bucket. Use a lot of pressure to eliminate any remaining dust or mildew.\nIt’s time to clean the bucket, rinse the mop, and refill it with fresh water. The mop bucket may have some dirt residue that will require multiple rinsing. Use clean water to wash the bucket. After thoroughly cleaning the bucket, put two cups of white vinegar into the bucket. You must soak the mop for three hours in a mixture of three lemons’ juice and water. If you combine vinegar plus lemon juice, you can get rid of any lingering scents on the mop handle. When the three hours are up, please give it a good soaking in water. Remove extra water from the mop and hang it outside to dry in the sun. To dry the fibers, they must be exposed to the sun’s rays.\nWhite vinegar will clean, disinfect, and brighten the mop. Not only that, but when combined with lemon juice, it will do wonders for getting rid of the odor. Give the mop this thorough cleaning every week or, at the very least, once a week. It’s best to do it right after each usage, but that isn’t always practical.\nHow To Easily Remove Entangled Hair From Your Mop Head\nHairs becoming entangled in the fibers of a mop head is among the most time-consuming and annoying problems to solve when cleaning one.\nTo do this, simply combine bleach and cleaning agent in a pail of water. Use this solution to clean the mop and get rid of all the dirt and hair. You should put your mop head in the bucket and then scrub vigorously. It’s expected that the hairs will fall out into the water. You may get rid of any stray hairs left behind by washing and then rinsing the mop.\nWearing gloves is a safety measure taken to prevent skin damage from the process’s harmful ingredients, such as bleach and detergent, so make sure you wear one!\nCleaning Tool #3: Broom\nHow To Clean Your Broom After Each Use\nMany households have to do daily tasks like sweeping hard floor surfaces. If you’re like most people, you probably can’t believe how much dust, filth, and pet hair you pick up every time you sweep, no matter how often you clean the floors. All of this means that your broom needs cleaning too!\nGo outside and shake your broom when you finish sweeping or begin again. Make sure you are not too close to your front entrance. You don’t want to put dirt anywhere that can be tracked inside. The head of the broom can be tapped on any tree trunk or other solid object. Keep doing this until the bristles no longer shed dust. You may have to remove the hair or dirt from the strands by hand. A wide-toothed comb can also be used.\nHow To Deep Clean Your Broom\nYour broom needs a more thorough cleaning once every few weeks. Before sweeping, it’s standard practice to loosen the dust off your broom head. After that, make your cleaning solution. Make sure the head of your broom fits in the bucket you decide to use. Put some hot water and cleaning supplies of your choosing in the bucket. Liquid dish soap and laundry detergent are the typical cleaning products that are used to clean broom. A touch of bleach can be added to the mixture as well. Completely submerge the broom’s head in the soapy water. Put the broom where it can soak for at least thirty minutes in the bucket.\nIt’s time to give the broom’s handle some TLC while the head is soaking. With consistent use, the handle might become completely contaminated. After all, before each sweep, do you often wash your hands? A disinfectant wipe or a disinfectant surface cleaner sprayed on a fresh towel can do the trick. Then, just clean the entire handle, starting at the top.\nThe broom’s bristles should be soaked in soapy water for an appropriate amount of time before being rinsed in clean water. If you wish the water to come out completely clean, just keep rinsing. After that, dry the bristles with a clean towel. As the strands will likely still be damp, precautions must be taken to stop mildew growth. Choose a well-lit spot to keep your broom while the bristles are still drying to keep it in excellent shape. Store the broom upright at all times.\nCleaning Tool #4: Duster\nHow To Clean Cloth Dusters\nCloth dusters are very easy to clean. All you need is just a liquid detergent and clean water. To avoid the growth of bacteria on your soiled cloth duster, make sure you wash them after each use. You can wash cloth dusters by hand or run them on your washing machine. Always keep it dry in a clean area so there won’t be any mold growth.\nHow To Clean Feather Dusters\nFor feather dusters, prepare a basin where you can soak them. Put warm water and mild dish soap, then submerge the feather duster. Leave it for a few minutes to loosen the dust and dirt. After a couple of minutes, wash it with your hands gently. To rinse it, put it under running water until all the soap is gone. Hang it to thoroughly dry before keeping it in place.\nHow To Clean Synthetic Dusters\nSynthetic dusters can be cleaned with soapy water like a feather duster. You can follow the procedures mentioned above. Synthetic dusters are best cleaned by hand rather than on the washing machine. Make sure to keep them dry after cleaning.\nCleaning Tool #5: Sponge and Brush\nHow To Clean Your Sponges And Brushes\nYou can clean your dish sponge or brush with dishwashing liquid and hot water. Give your sponges and brushes a good soak overnight, then rinse them with clean water. Put them aside in an upright position to dry them quickly.\nIf you aren’t satisfied with soapy water, you can use vinegar instead. Mix vinegar and water with the same amount in a basin where your cleaning tools can fit. Soak the brush and sponge overnight. Rinse them using clean water and set them aside to dry. This water-vinegar mixture is best to use for smelly sponges and brushes.\nHow To Disinfect Your Sponges And Brushes\nSponge and brush sets should be soaked in a solution of one-gallon hot water and half a cup of chlorine bleach at least once a week for five to ten minutes. Please don’t submerge brushes with wooden handles or bases in water. It’s best to immediately submerge them in the mixture and let them dry naturally.\nReplace your sponge if it already has a bad smell. A stinky odor on your sponge means bacteria are already present."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7548a2be-7496-4909-9b37-5a3376656f8c>","<urn:uuid:22cbcce3-aa49-40d7-b677-c4c25560dc2e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How many total articles are included in issue #20 of The Weathering Magazine, and what is their main focus?","answer":"The issue contains 11 different articles that all center on the theme of camouflage. Nine of these articles are model specific, while two are more generic articles about camouflage in general.","context":["The Weathering Magazine has hit a milestone with the publication of their most recent issue. This marks the twentieth issue for the magazine since AK Interactive began publication five years ago and Ammo of Mig picked it up a year or so later. Like all 19 of their predecessors this issue focuses on a single theme: this time it is ‘Camouflage’, which will be the star.\nAs per normal this issue is 74 pages printed on slick glossy heavyweight paper to give it a nice feel and provide a bit of gravity to the entire affair. This issue provides the reader with 11 different articles that all, of course, center on the theme of camouflage. Nine of these articles are model specific with two being more generic to camouflage in general.\nThere are the usual assortments of articles on World War II subjects but they are all, for the most part, German subjects. We get an article on German ‘disc’ camouflage as applied to a Jagdpanzer IV/70 (V), a King Tiger is employed for an article on how to use the popular modulation techniques in a camouflage scheme. There is also an article on whitewashing a StuG III Ausf. B and on painting an SS pea-dot camouflage uniform.\nA little outside the normal range of models we get an article on weathering a WR360 C12 locomotive. The article never states but it appears to be a 1/72 scale offering. I say outside the normal range because this one doesn’t sport any type of camouflage but is a beautifully weathered subject nonetheless. The final World War II offering is another unusual subject, a 1/35 Bronco kit of the Type XXVII pocket submarine that has been placed in use by France after the war as a river patrol unit for smuggling intervention work. This article takes a different slant by showing how to apply a faded camouflage that can still be seen under a newer paint job; very cool indeed!\nOutside of the World War II offerings is an Australian M1A1, which graces the cover, in the unique Australian camouflage pattern. Although the camo on this model appears to be finished this article is going to be a two-part offering, perhaps the author Maxi Fernandez, is going to next apply some heavy fading, the subject of the next issue? Another modern subject is a Russian Terminator II dressed up in a camouflage scheme that was used only once for an exposition of Russian Military equipment but never used in the field. As with many subjects, Ammo of Mig has a paint set just for this particular camouflage scheme; what a surprise!\nThe final model subject is a bit more out there in the sense that it is a sci-fi rendering of a Studio Ma.K model of a Maschinen Krieger by Lincoln Wright. Perhaps to make it even a bit more sci-fi Wright will finish the complete model using only brushes and a couple of cans of spray paint. Not only that but he uses lacquers, acrylics, and oils for brushing and manages to keep it all together for a great finish.\nThe issues finishes up with a pair of non-model specific articles; the first is an article on camouflage profiles and provides over 25 different camo profiles of different vehicles even including a Flower class corvette and, gasp!, an airplane!! The final article in the issue details the history of the use and development of camouflage with a heavy emphasis on World War I where camouflage came into its own.\nAnother fine effort from the folks at Ammo by Mig. I thought it was a bit heavy in German subjects and would have liked to have seen at least one treatment of an Allied vehicle but much, if not all, of the techniques discussed and demonstrated are somewhat universal. Recommended.\nHighs: Nice price at 8 Euros, around 10 bucks in the US. Great photography throughout, easy to understand text and techniques. Lows: Of the World War II subjects the magazine focuses solely on German vehicles and camouflage. Verdict: Recommended.\nAbout Rick Cooper (clovis899) FROM: CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES\nI have been modeling for about 30 years now.

{"question":"When playing scales on handbells compared to playing on the gamelan jegog, which one requires more physical strength and why?","answer":"The gamelan jegog requires significantly more physical strength. While handbell playing involves alternating hands and various techniques like four-in-hand and bell trees, the gamelan jegog demands exceptional physical prowess due to its massive bamboo tubes and heavy rubber mallets. The bass jegog is so large that it requires two players using both hands to wield the heavy mallets, and players face the real danger of fainting from exertion, especially in tropical heat. In contrast, handbell exercises can be practiced slowly and don't require particular physical strength, focusing instead on choreography and technique.","context":["Doing exercises will help you learn solo handbell choreography (sometimes called “blocking.”) That, in turn, will free you to explore works not specifically published for solo handbells. You can create your own exercises by writing out a 1 octave scale, both ascending and descending, in any key. Try several different approaches to choreographing the scale, document it with solo notation, then try another key. You can also do this with a phrase of any handbell solo, or any musical line within your bell range.\nHere are some solo-friendly scales to get you started:\nHere are some passages from actual solo bell pieces:\nPermission is granted to print these exercises (and the instructions below) for your personal use.\nHow to use these exercises:\nThere are no right or wrong answers – there are only comfortable and awkward choreography solutions. Choreography is nearly always a trial and error process, even for experienced soloists. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to choreograph each exercise and document it with standard solo notation. Try at least three different approaches to each exercise. (The exercise is repeated on the sheet for this purpose.) Don’t expect every approach to work well. Some won’t work at all, and you may have to combine approaches to obtain an elegant and musical solution. It isn’t necessary to play at tempo when working out choreography, but your preferred solution should be playable at tempo, if you were to practice it repeatedly. With experience, you’ll learn to recognize the difference between choreography that smoothes out with practice, and choreography that is inherently unworkable.\n• Play the entire passage with single bells, alternating hands.\n• Change the starting hand.\n• Weave. Consider displacing or reversing bells as you table damp on the way up the scale and replacing them on the way down.\n• Look for constants and use traveling four-in-hand. Try different constants.\n• Displace or preset bells. Choose different bells to displace.\n• Swap two adjacent bells.\n• Pass bells between hands. Identify other points to pass a bell, freeing up the correct hand when needed. Choose the least disruptive pass (preferably on a long or repeated note).\n• Play consecutive bells paired in the same hand. This is especially useful on short note values (8th or 16th notes), instead of changing bells.\n• Use shelley plus or minus.\n• Mallet bells on the table. Try different stickings (i.e., change the mallet hand you use to strike certain bells).\nYou can also watch for places to use skills you may not have learned yet, like six-in-hand or bell trees. Identify particular aspects of the passage that make that technique appropriate.\nExample 1: A passage that sounds good LV (determined by playing it on the piano, with pedal) might work well on bell trees.\nExample 2: A passage using only 6 small bells might be played six-in-hand.\nIn an actual piece, the six-in-hand or bell tree section will work only if the bells are available, either as duplicates, or as bells not needed elsewhere in the piece, or where you have sufficient time to set the bells up for the technique during a piano interlude. Still, it’s worth considering these possibilities, so you get used to spotting opportunities to apply these techniques once you’ve mastered them.\nDoing all the exercises will take several weeks. I suggest doing only one at a time, in the order presented, taking as much time as you need to complete it. In the process, you’ll:\n• Start to recognize situations where you might apply certain techniques\n• Learn which approaches you instinctively favor\n• Identify techniques you want to spend more time practicing\n• Master solo notation\nCopyright © 2013 Nancy Kirkner, handbells.com","Gamelan Sekar Jaya\nJegog: Live at the Bali Arts Festival\n1.

Jaran Dauh / 12:16\nThe Gamelan Jegog\nBali is an island blessed with a bewilderingly rich variety of musical ensembles, and the gamelan jegog stands out for its impressiveness and sheer thundering resonance. The gamelan jegog, comprised of giant bamboo marimbas, originated in Jembrana, West Bali in the early twentieth century. The instruments are tuned to an unusual four-tone scale used by no other form of gamelan in Bali.\nSound is produced on the jegog by striking the bamboo tubes, which act as giant resonators. These bamboo tubes range from modest to gigantic—up to ten feet long in the case of the bass jegog, the instrument for which the whole ensemble is named. Part of the energy and power of jegog music derives from the sheer physical strength needed to play the instruments. The size of the bass jegog is so large that two players must squat on a platform above the tubes, often using both hands to wield the heavy rubber mallets. Its resonant boom, which anchors the rest of the orchestra, can be heard for miles across Balinese rice fields.\nGamelan jegog remains very much a regional specialty, characteristic of the flavor of the western reaches of the island, with a unique repertoire that has developed its own complex textures and idiomatic forms of interlocking figuration. There are just a handful of gamelan jegog instruments outside of Jembrana, and music enthusiasts must still head West to seek out expert jegog teachers and instrument makers. The passionate playing and ensemble perfection of the Jembrana groups continue to set an unsurpassable standard. In contrast to the refined, stately traditions of bronze gamelan associated with the Balinese courts, gamelan jegog boasts homegrown performance traditions remarkable for their athleticism and unrestrained exuberance. The jegog accompanies the annual water-buffalo races in Negara, Jembrana’s capital city, and is often played along with dances deriving from the Indonesian martial art pencak silat. The most popular and notorious tradition may be the competitive musical battle known as the jegog mebarung. The uninhibited frenzy of the jegog mebarung is anything but a polite trading of compositions. More accurately, it is a contest of endurance, concentration, and group virtuosity in which both orchestras play simultaneously, overlapping each other as furiously as possible until exhaustion forces one side to surrender. For the listener, the result is a mind-bending, pulsating, phase-shifting wall of sound, as unsynchronized tempi and varied tunings collide at high volume.\nThe Roots of Jegog Music in America\nThe history of gamelan jegog within the United States starts with Gamelan Sekar Jaya (GSJ) in 1987. Former GSJ musician Kate Beddall studied with I Wayan Gama Astawa in the West Balinese town of Tegal Cangkring. Unable to transport an ensemble of such massive proportions back to the United States, Beddall did manage to bring home six tingklik -- small, portable versions of the jegog instruments with keys made of bamboo planks rather than tubes, most often used in Jembrana by children or by musicians as practice instruments. The tingklik became a regular part of GSJ’s performances until the Fall of 2003 when Mickey Hart (Grateful Dead) donated a partial set of full-sized jegog instruments to the group. Gamelan Sekar Jaya musician Samuel Wantman along with David Hermeyer embarked on the task of restoring the donated instruments and duplicating them to complete the fourteen-piece ensemble—the only one of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. After finding a temporary home for the instruments at San Francisco’s School of the Arts, GSJ’s gamelan jegog performers have continued studying with Balinese master artists—both locally with artists who come to the Bay Area via GSJ’s artist-in-residence program, and abroad in extended individual trips to Jembrana, Bali. They have performed new works and classic jegog pieces throughout the Bay Area on formal stages, and in festivals, conferences, and benefit concerts.\nA historic moment in GSJ’s jegog ensemble evolution occurred when I Gede Oka Artha Negara joined GSJ artist-in-residency program as a jegog specialist in 2010. Bapak Gede Oka started playing jegog music as a child, and is the son of I Ketut Suwentra, the founder of Suar Agung, one of the most recognized jegog groups within Bali. Bapak Gede Oka’s residency with the group allowed the musicians of GSJ to refine their technique, learn new repertoire, understand the emotive subtleties of the music, and prepare for the landmark jegog tour to Bali.\nAn American Jegog Group in Bali\nIn 2010, Gamelan Sekar Jaya’s jegog group received an invitation to perform at the illustrious Pesta Kesenian Bali (PKB), or Bali Arts Festival, an annual showcase of art and music. With GSJ’s fortuitous connection with Suar Agung, the subsequent logical step for the group was to plan an international tour to Bali.\nIn June of 2010, the musicians and dancers of Gamelan Sekar Jaya convened in the small West Balinese village of Sangkar Agung, home to jegog group Suar Agung. This lovely rural outpost was far from Bali’s teeming tourist centers, a place where almost no English was spoken, and a slow and tranquil pace of life prevailed. It was here at Suar Agung’s yayasan (music foundation) that the musicians of GSJ would encounter the brutal shock of the physical strength required of jegog musicians in Bali.\nThe group had been forewarned of the physical adjustment of playing on modern-day jegog instruments; Mickey Hart’s instruments were older, dating back to an era when musicians sat down to play, while current-day jegog instruments are built on a larger scale, raised so that players stand behind the instruments, swaying with the beat of the music. However, this knowledge failed to prepare the musicians with the intensity, ferocity, and speed that the music required.\nCombined with the massive size and heavier weight of the instruments and mallets found in Bali, the musicians of GSJ quickly found themselves with badly blistered hands and sore muscles, facing tropical heat which made one single practice cost liters of water in sweat, and monitoring the real danger of fainting from exertion. Meanwhile, GSJ witnessed the mental acuity and unbridled athletic vigor of the musicians of Suar Agung—many of them strapping men and laborers by day who could effortlessly whip through complex figurations at speeds beyond the threshold of collapse, while synchronizing themselves in a nearly telepathic demonstration of the group-mind.\nAs Americans emulating these Balinese musicians who were raised on jegog music, Gamelan Sekar Jaya was humbled and pushed to the limits. A mebarung competition was planned with Suar Agung – were GSJ’s musicians crazy? The Balinese themselves were far too encouraging and gracious to ever suggest that a foreigner’s imitation might be a pale one. At once demoralized and invigorated, GSJ hoped at least to perform with enough feeling, energy, and collective attunement to show proper respect to Bali’s masterful artists.\nThis was the atmosphere in which the Gamelan Sekar Jaya found itself as the musicians and dancers stepped onstage in front of the packed audience at the Bali Arts Festival for the highest-profile show of the group’s tour. We humbly offer up the results to your ears here.\nPerformed live at the Bali Arts Festival in Denpasar, July 8th, 2010\nTeruntungan Bebek Putih (Traditional)\nMost Balinese performing arts originate as devotional intent and are used in ceremonial contexts. In the jegog tradition of West Bali, each group maintains a tertuntungan-style opening piece, intended to summon the gods and audience while “warming up the bamboo.” This arrangement comes from the village of Sangkar Agung, famous for its jegog tradition.\n2.Subak / Composer: I Dewa Putu Berata (2009)\nIn Bali-Hindu culture, cycles of life and seasons are honored in ritual and offerings. Inspired by Dewi Sri Lakshmi, the Goddess of the Rice Harvest and Fertility, this new dance piece depicts workers irrigating rice fields, tilling the soil, and planting rice shoots. This composition brings a unique dynamism to the music, by incorporating idioms and interlocking patterns from other genres of Balinese music not commonly found in jegog repertoire.\n3.Curing Beroh / Composer: I Nyoman Ridia\nA piece that is as old as the art of jegog itself, this composition is typical of the classic canon of jegog works. Curing Bero is a composition that mimics the sound of birds singing in a particular scale, with “curing” depicting the type of bird and “bero” describing the musical scale.\n4.C’ret Nong / Composer: I Made Terip (2004)\nAdapted from gamelan angklung repertoire, C’ret Nong is inspired by, and named for the syncopated sound of the cicada insect (nongceret) found in the mountains and often heard in the late afternoon. This was the first piece composed specially for Gamelan Sekar Jaya's jegog ensemble, during I Made Terip’s residency with the group.\n5.Pemiketan Tresna / Composer: I Gede Oka Artha Negara (2010)\nPemikitan Tresna (“Strengthening the Bonds of Love”) is a dance work created by I Gede Oka Artha Negara and Ni Ketut Arini to explore the way in which parents pass along their experience and knowledge of finding a true love. From courtship to the delicate process of weaving familial bonds, this work offers a glimpse of a Balinese perspective on love-in-the-making. The frenzied nature and complex interlocking sections of this piece, as well as the inclusion of extra instrumentation (kendang drums and ceng-ceng cymbals) makes it exemplary of the new trends in modern jegog compositions.\n6.Jaran Dauh / Composer: I Nyoman Ridia\nComposed by the prolific I Nyoman Ridia, this version of the celebrated composition was further adapted by I Gede Oka Artha Negara. Jaran Dauh (“Rearing Horse”) was originally known as Jaran Dauk (Black-Maned Horse), after the horse used in battle by the Raden Pata, a Javanese sultan. Both are fitting images for the work’s dazzling array of musical and orchestral techniques and its unbridled energy.\nGamelan Sekar Jaya is a sixty-member company of musicians and dancers, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, specializing in the performing arts of Bali, Indonesia. Founded in 1979, Sekar Jaya is now recognized internationally as “the finest Balinese gamelan ensemble outside of Indonesia.” (Indonesia’s Tempo Magazine) The group has sponsored the creation of more than eighty new music and dance works by Balinese and American artists in major projects supported by the NEA, the Rockefeller Foundation, the MAP Fund, the National Dance Project, and many other foundations and individuals. Over the last three decades, GSJ has created new works in exciting collaborations that stretch the boundaries of culture, genre, and ethnicity; and blur the distinctions between traditional and modern. Gamelan Sekar Jaya has performed throughout California, the US, and Bali—in venues ranging from LA’s Hollywood Bowl, to New York’s Symphony Space, to remote village squares in Bali.\nDan Bales, Scott Barnes, Susanna Miller Benningfield, Kathy Bouvier, Alexis Brayton, Phil Cox, Matthew Gleeson, Barbara Golden, Suzanne La, I Gede Oka Artha Negara, John Noble, Laurel Smith Pardue, Paddy Sandino, Heather Sansky, Samuel Wantman, Kwan Wong\nAll tracks recorded July 8th, 2010 at Taman Budaya Arts Center, Denpasar, Bali.\nRecording Engineer: Robert Weber\nMixing and Mastering: Charlie Wilson - Sonic Zen Studios\nCover art: I Ketut Wirtawan\nText: Matthew Gleeson, Samuel Wantman, Sara Gambina-Belknap, Suzanne La, Paddy Sandino\nSPECIAL THANKS: (listed alphabetically)\nNi Luh Estiti Andarawati, Ni Ketut Arini I Made Arnawa, I Dewa Putu Berata, Mickey Hart, David Hermeyer,\nSuzanne La, I Made Moja, I Gede Oka Artha Negara, I Made Mangku Pastika (the Governor of Bali), I Putu Putrawan, Ida Ayu Ketut Suciawani, I Wayan Pasek Sudipta, Emiko Saraswati Susilo, I Ketut Suwentra, I Made Terip, Samuel Wantman\nPesta Kesenian Bali (Bali Arts Festival), Sanggar Çudamani, Sanggar Warini Foundation, Banjar Taman Kaja (Ubud), Sanggar Tripitaka (Munduk) , Gamelan Dharma Swara (New York), Yayasan Suar Agung,, Banjar Sangkar Agung (Negara)\nThis album is dedicated to the memory of Ida Ayu Ketut Suciawani (GSJ Guest Dance Director 2007).\nThis recording was made possible with the generous support of the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation, The National Endowment for the Arts, and independent contributors."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ffc7238c-f13f-4c9b-a02a-b6cbc1c89965>","<urn:uuid:34e8c824-67c1-4726-a098-3fc7470733ce>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the current preservation challenges differ between the Parthenon in Athens and the Great Pyramid of Giza?","answer":"The Parthenon's main preservation challenge involves the division of its sculptures, with more than half currently located in the British Museum in London, creating an ongoing cultural issue about their return to Athens for unified display in the Acropolis Museum. The Great Pyramid's preservation challenges stem from the loss of its original white Tura limestone casing stones, which were removed during the Middle Ages following a 14th-century earthquake. Many of these stones were repurposed for building mosques and fortresses in Cairo, though some casing stones remain visible at the pyramid's base.","context":["An unprecedented conceptual design; embodied in architectural excellence\nPut the best of science, art and philosophy together in one creation and you have the definitive monument of human civilisation. UNESCO calls it the symbol of World Heritage. The world calls it the Athenian Acropolis!\nThe history of the Acropolis of Athens is long, with moments when democracy philosophy and art flourished, leading to its creation. Then there were the times when its best standing pieces were removed and shipped away from the city, dividing the monument in two. Today, the international community wants to reunite all of the Acropolis sculptures in Athens and restore both its physicality and meaning.\nThe Acropolis, and the Parthenon in particular, is the most characteristic monument of the ancient Greek civilisation. It continues to stand as a symbol in many ways: it is the symbol of democracy and the Greek civilisation. It also symbolises the beginning of the Western civilisation and stands as the icon of European culture. The Parthenon was dedicated to Athena Parthenos, the patron goddess of the city of Athens and goddess of wisdom. It was built under the instructions of Pericles, the political leader of Athens in the 5th century BC. The Parthenon was constructed between 447 and 438 BC and its sculptural decoration was completed in 432 BC. In 1987 it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site (UNESCO, 1987). Uniquely, capturing the gravity of the Athenian Acropolis as a symbol, UNESCO recognises that “[…] the Acropolis, the site of four of the greatest masterpieces of classical Greek art – the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheum and the Temple of Athena Nike – can be seen as symbolizing the idea of world heritage” (UNESCO, 2006).\nDespite the unique symbolic and cultural value of the monument, the issue of the removal of the sculptures from the Athenian Acropolis by Elgin continues to shadow their history. Today, more than half of the Parthenon sculptures are in the British Museum in London and their return to Athens, for their display in the Acropolis Museum together with the other originals, is a cultural issue awaiting to be settled.\nIt is recommended that you start your reading about the Parthenon and the Acropolis of Athens at the Acropolis of Athens page of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture. You can also start from The Review of the Seizure of the Parthenon sculptures, or read The Memorandum of the Greek Government for The Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles. But there is more to discover. This website brings you the key concepts associated with the Acropolis sculptures and the reasons why they should be reunited in Athens.

The Great Pyramid is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids at Giza, the other two belonging to the pharaohs Khafre and Menkaure. Although the Great Pyramid has survived till this day, it has not escaped from weathering and has a drastically different look from when it was newly completed.\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza. (Nina / CC BY-SA 2.5 )\nConstruction of the Pyramid\nIt has been estimated that up to 2.4 million stone blocks, each of which had to be cut and dressed before they could be used for the construction of the pyramid. The core of the Great Pyramid consists mainly of rough blocks of limestone that were quarried at the Giza Plateau. This limestone, however, is of low quality and has a brownish-yellow color. Within the Great Pyramid is the central chamber, which contained the pharaoh’s sarcophagus. Reddish-pink granite was used to construct the chamber, as it was able to support the weight of the stone blocks above it.\nThe entrance of the Pyramid. (Olaf Tausch / CC BY-SA 3.0 )\nOriginally, the Great Pyramid was covered with blocks of limestone that came from Tura, about 129 km (80 miles) away, on the other side of the Nile. These casing stones served to cover the brownish-yellow limestone that was used to construct the pyramid’s core. Moreover, the Tura limestone made the Great Pyramid dazzling white, which would have made it highly visible, even from afar away.\n- The Hidden Message in Khafre’s Pyramid: What Were the Builders Trying to Tell Us?\n- Star Shaft Pointing - Busted: Debunking the Star Shaft Theory of the Great Pyramid\nOne of the original casing stones for the Great Pyramid (circa 2570 BC), most of which were removed during medieval times. This block was found in the rubble surrounding the pyramid. (British Museum / CC BY-SA 3.0 )\nNo Longer Dazzling White\nToday, however, the Great Pyramid is no longer dazzling white, as the Tura limestone blocks were removed during the Middle Ages. During the 14 th century, a massive earthquake loosened many of the outer casing stones. The dislodged stones were taken by the Bahri Sultan, An-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan in 1356 to build mosques and fortresses in nearby Cairo. The casing stones that were left on the Great Pyramid continued to collapse in the subsequent centuries, leaving piles of rubble at the monument’s base. These were cleared away when the site was excavated. Nevertheless, many of the casing stones covering the base of the pyramid have been left on site and may still be seen today.\nWhite casing stones remain near the top of the Pyramid of Khafre. ( CC BY 2.0 )\nWhen was the Great Pyramid Built?\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza is thought by the majority of mainstream archaeology to have been built during the reign of Khufu, the second pharaoh of ancient Egypt’s Fourth Dynasty. The precursors of the Great Pyramid may be found in Early Dynastic period. During this time, it is believed royal tombs were built into the ground and covered with a type of monument known as a ‘mastaba’. These were rectangular, flat-topped structures with inward sloping sides that were constructed using mudbricks. The first pyramid was built by Djoser, the founder of the Third Dynasty, at Saqqara, although the age of all the pyramids remains and area of contention. The Pyramid of Djoser, known also as the Step Pyramid, consists of six mastabas of decreasing size and its design has been attributed to Imhotep.\nDiagram of the Great Pyramid, 1893. The inner line indicates the pyramid's modern (1893) profile; the outer line indicates the original profile. ( Internet Archive Book Images )\nThird Dynasty Pharaohs Attempted to Build Step Pyramids\nThe pharaohs of the Third Dynasty followed Djoser’s example and built step pyramids for themselves. These, however, were not completed, possibly due to their relatively short reigns. It was during the Fourth Dynasty that the first ‘true’ pyramid, i.e. one with smooth sides, was built. This is the Red Pyramid of Dahshur, known also as the North Pyramid. The Red Pyramid was built by Sneferu, the founder of the Fourth Dynasty, and is named as such due to its red limestone blocks . Incidentally, Sneferu was also the builder of the Bent Pyramid which is also located at Dahshur. This pyramid has a 54° inclination at its base, which narrows to 43° to the top, thus giving it a bent appearance. It is widely believed that this is the transitional form between the step pyramid and the true pyramid.\n- Hidden Chamber Found?

( CC BY 2.0 )\nThe Mystery of How the Great Pyramid was Built\nThe Great Pyramid was built by Sneferu’s successor Khufu. Prior to the construction of this pyramid, the Red Pyramid was the largest Egyptian pyramid (it remains the third largest, after those of Khufu and Khafre). One of the mysteries surrounding the Great Pyramid is the way it was built. Various theories regarding the techniques used to construct the pyramid have been put forward over time, though there is still no consensus as to how this ancient wonder was actually built.\nThe Golden Age of Egyptian Pyramids\nThe reigns of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure are regarded to be the golden age of Egyptian pyramids. During the subsequent Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, pyramids were continued to be built, though a decline in quality and scale is evident. The last of the great pyramid builders was Pepy II, whose pyramid was built in Saqqara. Several years after Pepy II’s death, the Old Kingdom collapsed, and a period of instability known as the First Intermediate Period ensued. Although pyramids were built by later pharaohs, they were certainly not as grand as those built during the Old Kingdom.\nTop image: Great Pyramids, located in Giza.

{"question":"How do variables and dimensions work in InferenceData, and what types of measurements are monitored in nuclear power plant systems?","answer":"In InferenceData, variables are multidimensional labeled arrays with named dimensions and coordinates, where dimensions like 'chain' and 'draw' represent sampling processes. Nuclear power plants monitor various measurements including vibration signals from accelerometers and velocity probes, acoustic signals from accelerometer sensors, neutron flux measurements, and process data such as temperature, pressure, flow, and rotation speed. Both systems rely on structured data organization with specific naming conventions and coordinate systems to facilitate analysis.","context":["InferenceData schema specification#\nInferenceData schema approach defines a data structure compatible with NetCDF.

The company installed monitoring systems on primary circuits and turbo-generators of nuclear power plants to detect and investigate possible incidents, in addition to automated plant control.\nIt is now important to take into account how to accurately monitor the behavior of critical components. The company needed to archive events related to these components and their behavior to continuously evaluate their future ability to operate, and to schedule maintenance operations or replacements.\nEDF has thus acquired a large knowledge base describing the behavior of the main elements of a nuclear power plant: reactor coolant pumps, turbines, generators, inlet valves, internal structures, and reactors.\nPoste de Surveillance et d’Aide au Diagnostic (PSAD) is an online monitoring system designed to keep maintenance personnel informed of the working conditions of equipment through the in-depth analysis of data collected about its operating state.\nThe system’s main objectives are to monitor a power plant’s critical machinery and detect early any atypical operating conditions. It allows the operator to perform an in-depth analysis of detected problems and to help elaborate a precise diagnosis through the use of sophisticated graphing tools.\nOne specific advantage of the system is its capacity to monitor a fleet of nuclear power plants. It provides a maintenance knowledge database that can compare equipment behavior in different nuclear power plants and support feedback loop applied to the fleet. This is especially important for aging plants in managing equipment related to the extended lifetime of nuclear installations.\nUser-friendly analysis tools and user interface help facilitate the work of maintenance operators and remote experts. In addition to generic graphic tools adapted to vibration monitoring, the system provides dedicated tools for critical equipment monitoring in a nuclear power plant.\nCondition-based maintenance stakes\nThe strategy of maintaining equipment for corrective maintenance when a failure occurs may result in plant unavailability, severe damages to the equipment itself, excessive maintenance costs, and safety and environmental risks.\nAnother concerning strategy, scheduled preventive maintenance, avoids concerns about corrective maintenance, but you can replace parts of equipment although they can be still available for some time. You must periodically inspect equipment, and these operations generate maintenance costs and loss of equipment availability.\nCondition-based maintenance means monitoring equipment behavior, detecting anomalies or conditions of a future failure, and deciding the right time to intervene and maintain.\nThis strategy has economic and safety benefits:\nIt reduces the number of maintenance interventions and the number of inspections.\nYou can reduce radiation exposure of inspection personnel.\nYou can detect faults early and avoid damages.\nYou can better repair and maintain operations, provide spare components in due time, and then reduce spare parts inventory.\nIt is possible to build a knowledge database related to the working conditions of equipment, components, and equipment aging.\nFinally, condition-based maintenance helps reduce maintenance costs, as well as increase equipment lifetime, equipment reliability, and equipment availability. Meanwhile it reduces the risk of failure and accidents.\nCondition-based maintenance can be a solution for monitoring the evolutions of equipment’s working conditions, which can be related to future faults. The progress in data processing and computer technologies makes it possible. Methods and systems available today can see use for online condition monitoring with reasonable efforts and costs.\nBut technology alone is not the best response to implement this strategy. Condition-based maintenance requires highly skilled people in an organization to identify the cause of anomalies and to predict their evolution and modify working conditions of equipment or to manage maintenance operation.\nCritical equipment monitoring\nEDF uses the online monitoring system for critical equipment in nuclear power plants, which need continuous monitoring of working conditions. For other equipment, it is possible to use lighter solutions, such as portable data collectors and an off-line vibration analyzer.\nThe monitoring system actually allows operators to detect the following defects on critical equipment:\nPrimary coolant loop\nReactor coolant pumps—unbalance, seal degradation, bearing looseness, shaft cracks, frictions\nLoose parts detection—localization, impacts intensity identification\nInternal reactor structures—reactor vessel oscillation, core barrel vibrations, support rupture on thermal shield\nTurbine—frictions, unbalance, thermal distortion, misalignment, cracks\nGenerator—rotor ventilation, vibrations, short-circuit, failure of the stator coolant system\nSteam inlet valves on the turbine—valves jamming, opening and closing time\nThe first function of the monitoring system is to characterize working conditions and equipment behavior. Using data measured at a machine or process level, extracted features compare with reference features, which experts interpret. To get continuous measurement systems for critical equipment in nuclear power plants, depending on the types of equipment and the types of phenomena to interpret, we can measure vibration signals, acoustic signals, neutron flux, and process data such as temperature, pressure, flow, rotation speed, position, state, and delay.\nVibration signals acquisition measurements come from vibration sensors, such as accelerometers and velocity probes. With the monitoring system, they can see use for rotating machinery-like pumps, turbines, and generators. In nuclear power plants other than those from EDF, these kinds of sensors could also see use on the primary circuit for structure vibration measurement.\nSpectral analysis, harmonics analysis, algorithms based on root mean square (RMS), or peak value of a vibration allow the identification of anomalies in the behavior of the machine related to a component, such as a shaft, bearing, or seal.\nAcoustic signals acquisition measurements come from accelerometer sensors mounted on the coolant primary loop, especially on the reactor vessel and the steam generators. These sensors are working in the audible frequency range and help detect and locate loose parts in the primary circuits. The principle is to detect burst-type signals against background noise. For this function, PSAD manages alert thresholds. In case of threshold detection, the monitoring unit generates acoustic records sent to the diagnosis workstation for storing and expert analysis.\nNeutron flux measurements concern the variation of neutron flux issued from reactor vessel at specific points. They allow you to detect reactor vessel oscillations, barrel vibrations, and fuel assembly vibrations.\nProcess data acquisition\nSome process data, such as speed rotation for pumps or turbines, see use in correlation with vibration measurements in digital signal algorithms. The online monitoring system manages other process measurements to detect some equipment failures that are not correlated to vibration, such as steam inlet valves on the turbine. We can compare position and delay measurements with reference values and allow the detection of jamming defects or abnormally long stroke times. Take generators as another example—temperature and pressure measurements allow you to monitor thermal conditions of a generator.\nFinally, a function called perturbography samples process data after some predefined conditions. You can define these conditions through one operating state or a combination of several operating states of a machine. When the condition occurs, the monitoring unit samples one or several process measures at a configurable frequency and duration. Records go to a diagnosis workstation for storage and analysis. EDF uses this function for monitoring some components related to the working conditions of the turbine and the generator during transition phases such as run-up and run-down.\nData calculation, monitoring functions\nA descriptor defines all process data in the monitoring system. It is an abstract entity that represents one piece of information related to the monitoring task, usually some measurement of machine behavior.\nThe monitoring system can measure or compute descriptors at three different levels:\nLevel 1: Descriptors received directly from the acquisition boards; the measurement and its format are determined by the type of board that generates the descriptor.\nFlow rate, temperature, pressure, etc., from an analog-to-digital conversion board\nRMS or peak value from a dynamic input board\nHarmonic amplitudes and tachometer from a synchronous analysis board\nSpectra from a spectral analysis board\nLevel 2: Descriptors as real-time results of level 2 data processing functions the monitoring unit evaluates using level 1 and/or level 2 descriptors in its real-time database:\nArithmetic function of level 1 descriptors\nSliding average of a level 1 descriptor\nMean and sigma value of level 1 descriptors\nLevel 3: Descriptors resulting from level 3 data processing functions and computed from descriptors of any level and/or external state variables. Unlike the other two types of real-time descriptors, these are computed off-line by the diagnosis workstation using measurements stored in the local database. Level 3 descriptors describe long-term behavior such as:\nResonance frequency damping\nThe progression of an average vibration vector\nLong-term average and standard deviation of a harmonic\nWarning functions can generate alert and warning messages about operating faults at two levels:\nThe monitoring unit in real time (A temperature descriptor, level 1, exceeds some upper bound. A shock factor, level 2, reaches its threshold.)\nThe diagnosis workstation, using archived data from the local database, such as long-term progression of a harmonic descriptor, or level 3.\nA monitoring system configuration is based on the definition of these descriptors and the data processing functions selected from the system’s library. The configuration of a monitoring function consists of the following operations:\nSelecting the type of each sensor and its parameters (sensitivity, offset, physical units)\nSelecting the type of signal processing for each sensor input (level 1 descriptor) and the processing parameters (gain, pass-band, harmonic, filter)\nConfiguring additional data processing (level 2 or 3 descriptors) with algorithm function library\nConfiguring automatic fault detection (from the warning function library) and associated parameters (thresholds, time spans)\nAnalysis, diagnosis tools\nAn important requirement for this kind of system is the user interface ergonomic characteristics. The monitoring system allows facilities to efficiently access information. A warning frame located on the bottom of all screens of a diagnosis workstation gives operators a general overview of an installation. This frame gives a concise evaluation of the state of all monitored equipment based on the existence and severity of any warning messages. In case of a defect on equipment, alarm logbook indicates the details and the chronology of events.\nThe working space and context definition facility allows operators to rapidly restore a previous analysis work. This facility is based on the working-set concept. A working set can define a collection of sensors, data, and time periods to examine. Then various users can save work they define and recall it again later whenever they need to repeat the same analysis for a same or different time frame.\nAll data declared in the system has a specification sheet that describes the functions and data used to process it, such as sensor parameters, acquisition board configuration, level 2 data processing functions, and warning functions. You can display this information in a frame by clicking on the descriptor’s identifier, wherever it appears on screen—in a warning message, on a graph display, or elsewhere.\nGraphic tools can help users plot any variable on different scales, either linear or logarithmic, to display information as Nyquist diagram, 3-D perspective, and waterfall diagram. There are also specific tools dedicated to nuclear power plant domain, facilitating the analysis of some equipment working conditions:\nPerturbography data display\nValves operations monitoring\nMachine slow-down analysis\nNatural frequencies identification\nMachine behavior report\nAcoustic signal listening for loose parts detection\nFollowing a detected fault or for a specific case study, operators and experts use data graphing tools and dedicated diagnosis tools to diagnose the exact physical condition of the machines concerned. You can process analysis on site or remotely. This remote analysis capability helps users compare different sites equipped with the same component and helps them gather the best specialists of a technical domain. Experts at EDF can remotely access information of a defined power plant while keeping an eye on the average case, collaborating to the best practices and increasing their knowledge.\nMonitoring units (MU) provide data acquisition, digital signal processing, first level of data processing, anomalies detection, and data compression.\nLocal station (LS) provides data processing, local storage (short-term database), and data export to the public server.\nPublication server provides long-term data archiving and secured access to database-to-remote expert users.\nRemote station and site station are diagnosis workstations dedicated to experts—in-depth and post-incident analysis and assistance to onsite operators.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nBruno Gauthier is I&C project manager at the Energy & Utilities center of Atos Origin, an international information technology services company specializing in systems integration and managed operations out of Meylan, France.\nReturn to Previous Page"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e04ca16b-b597-4883-8281-486363aa37b4>","<urn:uuid:e082103b-21b4-475c-af9b-06c70f105009>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the combat experiences of SSgt. Jason Ramseyer from the Marines and the Army veteran Sean in terms of their IED-related injuries in Iraq?","answer":"Both servicemembers were wounded by IEDs in Iraq, but with different outcomes. SSgt. Ramseyer was fatally wounded on April 20, 2006, when an IED detonated near him during a patrol in Al Anbar province. Despite being hit in his femoral artery, he prioritized his fellow Marines' safety and medical care before his own, ultimately succumbing to his wounds. Sean, on the other hand, survived his IED incident but suffered a traumatic brain injury from the blast during his deployment between 2003 and 2004.","context":["A patrol from Headquarters and Service Company’s Jump Platoon encountered an improvised explosive device, resulting in one Marine killed and two wounded in action.\nOn April 20, 2006, SSgt. Ramseyer was in the lead vehicle of a five-vehicle convoy. As the convoy moved through Dam Village on a security patrol, SSgt. Ramseyer spotted a suspicious object in the road. He immediately called to halt the vehicles and had his men dismount and conduct 5 and 25 meter checks around the area. The Marines attempted to identify the object but were unable, so SSgt. Ramseyer decided to conduct a V-shaped sweep forward. As they moved forward, SSgt. Ramseyer assumed the critical position at the apex of the V while he pushed his men out on the flanks to threaten a possible trigger man. SSgt. Ramseyer realized it was an improvised explosive device and instinctively turned and warned his Marines to get back. A split second later, the device was detonated, wounding the Staff Sergeant, and two other Marines. Although hit in his femoral artery, he attempted to turn and run to another wounded Marine to try and render first aid, but was overcome by his own wounds. He repeatedly refused medical treatment until his fellow Marines were looked after, and continued to issue directions for casualty evacuation and security. His last second warning to his Marines undoubtedly saved their lives and prevented more serious injuries. SSgt. Ramseyer was evacuated by helicopter from the site. While on the helicopter receiving medical care, he ignored his own mortal injury and repeatedly asked for assurance that his Marines were alright. Before that helicopter touched down again, SSgt. Jason Carroll Ramseyer was dead. He was 29 years old, leaving behind a wife and two daughters.\n- 1 News\n- 2 Awards\nDoD Identifies Marine Casualty\nIMMEDIATE RELEASE No. 347-06\nApril 24, 2006\nDoD Identifies Marine Casualty\nThe Department of Defense announced today the death of a Marine who was supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nStaff Sgt. Jason C. Ramseyer, 28, of Lenoir, N.C., died April 20 while conducting combat operations against enemy forces in Al Anbar province, Iraq. He was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.\nMedia with questions about this Marine can call the Hawaii Public Affairs Office at (808) 257-8870/71.\nSource: Department of Defense\nTwo Kane’ohe Marines killed in separate missions in Iraq\nBy Eloise Aguiar | Advertiser Windward O’ahu Writer | Tuesday, April 25, 2006\nKANE’OHE — Two Hawai’i-based Marines were killed last week in separate incidents while on duty in the Al Anbar province of Iraq.\nStaff Sgt. Jason C. Ramseyer, 28, of Lenoir, N.C., and Cpl. Eric Lueken, 23, of Dubois, Ind., were assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawai’i.\nTheir families yesterday recalled the pride both men took in serving as Marines and how each had been eagerly making plans for the future.\nRamseyer was set to re-enlist in a post that would allow him to spend more time with his wife and two girls, ages 2 and 3. Lueken was engaged to marry upon return in October.\nLueken and Ramseyer were deployed to Iraq in March, nine months after returning from a deployment to Afghanistan that went from November 2004 to June 2005.\nLueken, a field radio operator, was mortally wounded Saturday by an improvised device while in a convoy. Ramseyer was on a foot patrol, said 2nd Lt. Binford Strickland of the Marine Corps base.\nA total of 54 Marines and three sailors based at Kane’ohe Bay have been killed in the Middle East since 2004, Strickland said.\nMandy Ramseyer, 28, of Kailua, yesterday said her husband was killed Thursday after he got out of a vehicle to check on an object that appeared to be a roadside bomb.\n“He was within 30 meters of it and he knew it was one but by the time he turned around to tell everyone to get back, someone with a remote detonator set it off,” she said.\nShe said the seven-month deployment under way was to be her husband’s last for a while. “The last time he called was two days before it happened, and he told me he had talked to a career planner about where we were going next and … he wouldn’t have to leave us again for four years,” Ramseyer said. “He just seemed really happy and in high hopes.”\nPRIDE, HONOR, RESPECT\nJason Ramseyer, born in West Palm Beach, Fla., moved to Lenoir, N.C., when he was 12. He signed up to serve as a Marine in 1996 before graduating from high school, said his mother, Cindy Hicks of Claremont, N.C. She said her son graduated with honors and was among 20 students selected for the high school’s hall of fame for students who excel and are proven leaders.\nHicks said her son’s height — about 5 feet, 7 inches — spurred him to play hard in baseball, soccer, wrestling and other endeavors.\n“He was a very fierce competitor and he wanted to make sure his size didn’t make him any less of a person, athlete or Marine,” she said. “He had no reservation about serving his country.”\nWhen he was heading for Afghanistan, she came to Hawai’i to see him off and recalled how he wanted his wife and mother to learn exactly how his medals should be placed on his uniform if he should die, Hicks recalled. He had a display box and had lined them up in the proper order, but neither his wife nor Hicks wanted to discuss the issue.\n“He said, ‘No you need to know where these go,’ ” she said. “It was very important to him. He had so much pride in his job, so much honor and so much respect.”\nLt. Col. Norm Cooling, commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, also known as the “American Battalion,” described both Ramseyer and Lueken as “very proficient and popular” Marines.\n“To lose them in two separate missions and in two different areas, yet so closely together in time, makes it even more difficult for all of us. But we have a mission to do and they would want us to see it through,” Cooling said yesterday by e-mail.\n“We are committed to reducing violence in this area while creating self-sufficient Iraqi Security Forces to eventually take the place of Coalition Forces here. Our hearts and prayers go out to the Ramseyer and Lueken families,” he said.\nCopyright © Honolulu Advertiser 2006\nMilitary Was Early Calling for Marine\nArianne Aryanpur | Washington Post Staff Writer |Tuesday, May 2, 2006\nStaff Sgt. Jason C. Ramseyer wanted all his life to be a Marine. He wanted it so badly that he couldn’t wait for his 18th birthday, choosing instead to ask his mother to sign his enlistment papers.\nAnd after he made it through boot camp, he would come back to his high school in Lenoir, N.C., from time to time, proudly wearing his Marine uniform and sharing stories of life in the military.\nYesterday, after a decade in the corps that took him to wartime assignments in Afghanistan and Iraq, he was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. He was 28.\nRamseyer was killed April 20 when an improvised explosive device detonated near his Humvee in Iraq’s Anbar province, according to the Defense Department. He was the 228th person killed in the Iraq war to be buried at Arlington.\nAbout 30 friends and relatives gathered yesterday to honor him. Three wreaths, fastened with red, white and yellow flowers, sat near a box holding Ramseyer’s ashes. Uniformed Marines folded a U.S. flag and handed it to his wife, Amanda. Ramseyer is also survived by two daughters, Rylee and Kadence.\nAfter Navy Chaplain Lt. Ron Nordan delivered a sermon, Marines fired three volleys and a bugler played taps.\nRamseyer was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. A corporal in his battalion, Eric R. Lueken, 23, of Dubois, Ind., died two days after Ramseyer in the same area.\nRamseyer was born in Florida and moved with his family to North Carolina in 1990.\n“He stood out because he had great manners, a lot of respect and a lot of pride. Few have that,” recalled Sharon Watts, an administrator at West Caldwell High School in Lenoir, a town of about 20,000 at the northwest foothills of North Carolina.\nRamseyer is the first person from Lenoir to die in Iraq, said Edward Terry, editor of the town’s newspaper, the News-Topic. Flags in Lenoir have flown at half-staff since last week, when the Pentagon announced his death, Terry said. On Saturday, about 400 mourners gathered in the town to remember a local hero.\nRamseyer, who played soccer and baseball at West Caldwell High, wanted to join the Marines from an early age, his mother, Cynthia Hicks, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel last week. Once he enlisted, he never questioned the demands of his profession.\n“He was proud to go, proud to serve his country,” Hicks said.\nIn online postings, friends and relatives recalled a similar sense of purpose in Ramseyer.\n“Unfortunately [I had] only known Ram for about 7 months, but the first time I saw him I thought to myself, now there is a ‘Marine’s Marine,’ ” wrote Staff Sgt. Newt Sanson of Kailua, Hawaii.\n“He is certainly going to be missed by the Marine Corps and the Marines that knew him. He had something that just made Marines want to follow him.”\nCopyright © Washington Post 2006\nBronze Star with Combat Distinguishing Device\nJason Ramseyer (Posthumous)\nFor heroic achievement in connection with combat operations involving conflict with an opposing force while serving as Platoon Commander, Jump Platoon, Headquarters and Service Company, 3d Battalion, 3d Marines, Regimental Combat Team-7, I Marine Expeditionary Force Forward, from 15 March to 20 April 2006, in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.

{"question":"What is the relationship between molecular structure and viscosity in polymer solutions, and how does temperature affect their mixing properties?","answer":"At the molecular level, polymer solutions consist of chains that can coil and uncoil, represented by beads and springs in simulation models. These chains respond to flow by stretching and tumbling, contributing to the solution's complex properties. The molecular configuration affects material properties, including viscosity. Regarding temperature effects, viscosity is significantly impacted by temperature changes - heating causes thick fluids to become less viscous. This temperature sensitivity is so important that industrial equipment requires warm-up of lubricants before operation. The understanding of both molecular behavior and temperature effects is crucial for successful processing, as nearly half of all fluids in engineering applications are non-Newtonian.","context":["In this module we present a Brownian dynamics simulation in which the user may interact by adjusting important model parameters and flow conditions. In this way, the user will be able to experience a simulation of what takes place at the molecular level as macromolecules (or polymer chains) flow in solution. Rheology is the study of the flow and deformation of material. We focus specifically on the rheology of dilute polymer solutions, although the methods and concepts used here will apply to a wide range of other materials such as concentrated polymer melts, biological fluids such as blood, electromagnetic fluids and ferrofluids, inks and particle suspensions, just to name a few. These fluids all have complex microstructure which gives rise to complex material properties. This module will help you investigate this relation between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic properties.\nUnlike low-molecular weight fluid (e.g., water, air, acetone, etc.) these more complex fluids require more detailed models to describe their behavior and properties. For example, water can be well described by the classical Navier-Stokes equations when a single material constant, the viscosity, is known. In comparison, a polymer solution requires a viscosity function that depends on the shear rate and two normal stress function of shear rate just to describe steady shear flow. For other types of flow, such as elongational flow, other unique material properties are required. It is estimated that nearly half of all fluids used in engineering applications are non-Newtonian and require this more detailed modeling for successful processing. Unfortunately, in many applications the process is designed by empirical experience or old-fashion trial and error. Our goal for this module is that the user will develop an understanding of the relation between the microstructure behavior and the macroscopic material function used in designing engineering applications.\nThe simulation focuses on a single polymer chain represented by beads (i.e., hydrodynamic resistance sites) and springs (i.e., intra-molecular potentials that model the action of the chain coiling and uncoiling). The chain is placed in an infinite bath of fluid. Initially the chain is at equilibrium and remains coiled up although the configuration fluctuates due to the Brownian forces interacting with it. The fluid can be set into motion by specifying the flow rate and the flow type, for example, a simple shear flow at either a low or high flow rate. The chain will respond to the flow by stretching and tumbling depending on the flow type and flow rate. The type of spring can also be adjusted from a simple Hookean spring for which the force is proportional to the bead separation, to a nonlinear force law in which the force increases more strongly with bead separation; and therefore, maintains the beads in closer proximity. Material properties are calculated from the average configuration of the ensemble of chains. The user will be able to explore different flow types in a two-dimensional flow. These include elongation, shearing and rigid-body rotation and all two-dimensional flow in between by setting a flow-type parameter we call a.

Öttinger, Stochastic Process in Polymeric Fluids: Tools and Examples for Developing Simulation Algorithms,” (1996) Springer Verlag","Viscosity plays a significant role in creating an optimal mixing system. By switching up the agitator impeller design, size and shape of the mixing vessel, and mixing speed, we can create precise mixing solutions, no matter what kind of viscosities are involved. In this installment of Mixing Basics, we’re breaking down viscosity, an often misunderstood piece of the mixing puzzle.\nMany of our customers don’t have a good handle on how viscosity affects their mixing application. They incorrectly believe that by increasing the speed of their mixer agitator, they will achieve better results. While this may work for your morning smoothie, it won’t work for an industrial mixer agitator, especially when different viscosities are involved. So how can you achieve the best mixing results? To start, you’ll need a quick lesson in fluid dynamics.\nWhat exactly is viscosity?\nDefining viscosity, as with defining any scientific term, is complex. Viscosity is the mathematical ratio of the tangential frictional force per unit area to the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of flow of a liquid. Essentially, viscosity describes a fluid’s resistance to deformation or the “thickness” of a fluid.\nLiquids like honey, molasses, and syrup have high viscosities. They are thick and flow quite slowly. There are also some fluids with viscosities so high they resemble solids.\nWater, acetone, and methanol are examples of liquids with low viscosities. They are thin and flow very fast. Liquids with a viscosity of zero are called “superfluids.” When stirred, they will rotate indefinitely.\nHow is viscosity measured?\nViscosity is measured with either a viscometer or rheometer. A rheometer is necessary to measure non-Newtonian fluids. These fluids change their viscosity depending on the stress or force applied to them. Ketchup is an example of a non-Newtonian fluid: its viscosity lowers after you give the bottle a good shake!\nThere are several units quoted for viscosity, the most common being centipoise (cP). Water has a viscosity of 1.0 cP at 20 degrees Celsius, while honey has a viscosity of >2,000 cP.\nThe viscosity of a fluid is also greatly affected by temperature change. Heat a thick syrup, and it will become less viscous. This is why it’s important to let lubricants warm-up before industrial equipment is put into operation.\nHow does viscosity affect mixing?\nAs stated above, blend time and speed, agitator impeller selection, and mixing vessel characteristics can all be altered to achieve your desired mixing results.\nFor low viscosity blending, material densities, shear characteristics, and blend time are the most important factors in agitator impeller design and selection. Selecting the right agitator impeller is crucial for mixing efficiency.\nFor high viscosity blending, using a low-shear impeller keeps fluids at a uniform viscosity in the blending tank. It often makes sense to use a close clearance impeller such as a spiral or anchor-style impeller, or a high viscosity aerofoil impeller to keep uniform viscosity in the blending tank.\nA low-shear impeller ensures that all contents of the container are mixed adequately. If a high-shear impeller is used for highly viscous blending, the fluids around the impeller will behave much differently than the fluids in the outer areas of the mixing tank. This may result in an inferior final product.\nAs viscosity increases, the drag on tank walls and other internal elements (like baffles) increase. Highly viscous fluids may not need baffles to achieve the desired flow characteristics. Fluids with low viscosity may benefit from the extra agitation provided by baffles.\nUltimately, the design of a mixing system must demonstrate close attention not only to the initial viscosity of the fluids but also to changes in viscosity based on temperature and shear rates. (Quote Format)\nWhat are some of the most common mixing problems with respect to viscosity?\nSolid suspension makes measuring viscosity difficult. The viscosity of solid suspensions needs to be measured using a Stormer viscometer which keeps solids in suspension as it measures viscosity over a range of shear rates.\nUsing too many baffles in the tank can hinder the mixing process. Highly viscous fluids are naturally baffling because of their resistance to flow so baffles that are too large or numerous cause low or no flow at the tank walls.\nUsing an impeller that’s too small! Impellers that are too small don’t create enough flow near the tank walls. Having knowledge of agitator impeller design is critical when creating the perfect mixing system for viscous materials.\nAt Sepro Mixing & Pumping, our extensive knowledge of fluid dynamics allows us to create agitator impeller designs for optimal mixing results. Whether you’re mixing fluids with high or low viscosities, and Newtonian or non-Newtonian properties, we’ve got you covered. Contact us today to see if we have an agitator impeller design and mixing system for your industrial process."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:96d201ea-218a-4701-b5c8-8a4d40310cb4>","<urn:uuid:63e26b0e-5610-47f1-a5b3-c140df791395>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Digoxin vs heparin - what pregnancy precautions?","answer":"According to the documents, for digoxin, patients must inform their doctor if they are pregnant or breast-feeding before starting treatment. For heparin, it is actually recommended for pregnant women in certain situations, particularly when antiphospholipid antibodies are present, as it does not cross the placenta into the fetus. However, heparin is not recommended for long periods as it may increase the risk of osteoporosis.","context":["Digoxin is usually taken once a day in the morning.\nYour doctor will occasionally ask you to have some blood tests.\nIf you start vomiting, develop diarrhoea, get blurred/yellow vision, or become dizzy, you should contact your doctor for advice.\n|Type of medicine||A cardiac glycoside|\n|Used for||Fast and erratic heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter\n|Available as||Tablets, oral liquid and injection|\nAn arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat - your heart may skip a beat, beat irregularly or beat at the wrong speed. This can cause you to feel dizzy and breathless, and you may have chest pain and palpitations. Digoxin works by slowing down the rate at which your heart beats. When your heart rate is brought down to normal, your heart becomes efficient again and your symptoms usually improve.\nDigoxin also strengthens the force of your heartbeat, which is why it is useful in heart failure. Heart failure is a condition where your heart does not work as well as it should.\nBefore taking digoxin\nSome medicines are not suitable for people with certain conditions, and sometimes a medicine may only be used if extra care is taken. For these reasons, before you start taking digoxin it is important that your doctor knows:\n- If you have any heart problems other than those you are currently seeing your doctor for.\n- If you have kidney or thyroid problems.\n- If you have problems with your breathing.\n- If you have been told by a doctor that you have low levels of potassium or magnesium, or high levels of calcium in your blood.\n- If you are pregnant or breast-feeding.\n- If you are taking any other medicines. This includes any medicines you are taking which are available to buy without a prescription, such as herbal and complementary medicines.\n- If you have ever had an allergic reaction to a medicine.\nHow to take digoxin\n- Before you start this treatment, read the manufacturer's printed information leaflet from inside your pack. The leaflet will give you more information about digoxin and a full list of side-effects which you may experience from taking it.\n- Take digoxin once daily exactly as your doctor tells you to. There are three strengths of tablets (62.5 micrograms, 125 micrograms and 250 micrograms) - your doctor will prescribe the strength which is right for your condition. Your dose will be on the label of the pack to remind you.\n- If you have been given liquid medicine, it is important that you take the right amount. Use the dropper that comes with the bottle to measure out your doses. Ask your pharmacist to show you what to do if you are unsure.\n- Try to take your doses at the same time of day each day as this will help you to remember to take them. Digoxin can be taken before or after food, but it is probably best if you eat a diet containing a lot of fibre (such as wholemeal breads, cereals, fruit and vegetables) if you take it before you eat this type of food.\n- If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If you do not remember until the following day, skip the missed dose. Do not take two doses together to make up for a forgotten dose.\nGetting the most from your treatment\n- Try to keep your regular appointments with your doctor. This is so your doctor can check on your progress. Your doctor will want you to have some blood tests from time to time during this treatment, to check the levels of your electrolytes (salts) and to make sure your kidneys are working well. Sometimes your doctor may do a blood test to check the level of digoxin in your body. If so, you may be asked to delay taking your dose until after the test is taken.\n- If you start vomiting, develop diarrhoea, get blurred or yellow vision, or become very dizzy, you must contact your doctor straightaway. These are signs that the dose of digoxin may be too high for you.\n- Treatment with digoxin is usually long-term unless you experience an adverse effect. Continue to take it unless you are advised otherwise.\n- If you buy any medicines, check with a pharmacist that they are suitable to take with your other medicines. This is because some medicines and herbal remedies may interfere with digoxin.\n- If you are having any treatment like an operation or dental treatment, tell the person carrying out the treatment that you are taking digoxin.\nCan digoxin cause problems?\nAlong with its useful effects, digoxin can cause unwanted side-effects although not everyone experiences them. Many of the side-effects of digoxin are similar to the effects you may experience if your dose is too high. Because of this, speak with your doctor or pharmacist if any of the following side-effects continue or become severe.\n|Common digoxin side-effects - these affect less than 1 in 10 people who take this medicine||What can I do if I experience this?|\n|Feeling dizzy||Getting up or moving more slowly should help. If you begin to feel dizzy, lie down so that you do not faint, then sit for a few minutes before standing|\n|Blurred or yellow vision||Make sure you can see clearly before you drive or use tools or machines|\n|Feeling or being sick||Stick to simple foods - avoid rich or spicy meals|\n|Diarrhoea||Drink plenty of water to replace any lost fluids|\n|Skin rash||Discuss this with your doctor if it is troublesome|\nIf you experience any other symptoms which you think may be due to this medicine, speak with your doctor or pharmacist.\nHow to store digoxin\n- Keep all medicines out of the reach and sight of children.\n- Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct heat and light.\nImportant information about all medicines\nNever take more than the prescribed dose. If you suspect that you or someone else might have taken an overdose of this medicine, go to the accident and emergency department of your local hospital at once. Take the container with you, even if it is empty.\nThis medicine is for you. Never give it to other people even if their condition appears to be the same as yours.\nDo not keep out-of-date or unwanted medicines. Take them to your local pharmacy which will dispose of them for you.\nIf you have any questions about this medicine ask your pharmacist.\nFurther reading & references\n- British National Formulary; 64th Edition (Sep 2012) British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, London\n- Manufacturer's PIL, Lanoxin® 125 Tablets; Aspen, The electronic Medicines Compendium.

What is Heparin used for?\n- 1 What is Heparin? What is Heparin used for?\n- 2 What is Warfarin? What is Wafarin used for?\n- 3 Heparin and Warfarin mechanism of action\n- 4 Differences and similarities between Warfarin and Heparin\n- 5 Side effects, Heparin vs Warfarin\n- 6 Can you take warfarin and heparin together?\nHeparin or unfractionated heparin (UFH) is medication which is used as an anticoagulant or blood thinner in order to prevent the formation of blood clots. It is a heterogenous preparation of sulfated anionic glycosaminoglycan polymers that weights in a range from 3000 to 30,000 Da. It is a naturally released from mast cells. This medicine comes as a solution that should be injected under your skin but it also comes as a solution for intravenous use. You will receive your first injection at a hospital. A healthcare provider is going to show you how to give yourself the injection for remaining doses. Heparin’s FDA approved indications are:\n- Consumption coagulopathy\n- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)\n- Interstitial Cystitis\n- Thrombosis, Venous\n- Unstable Angina\n- Venous Thromboembolism\n- Peripheral arterial embolism\n- Prophylaxis of Pulmonary embolism\nFDA approved heparin in 1939.\nWhat is Warfarin? What is Wafarin used for?\nWarfarin is a generic name for an anticoagulant drug that works by reducing the blood clots formation. It is available both in a generic from and as a brand name. As a Brand name it is most commonly available as: Coumadin, Rodex, Jantoven, etc. Warfarin FDA approved indications are:\n- Myocardial Infarction\n- Systemic Embolism\n- Venous Thrombosis\n- Transient ischemia attacks\n- Prophylaxis of Pulmonary embolism\nDespite high therapy effectiveness, warfarin has several limitations. Many drugs interact with warfarin and also some foods predominantly leaf vegetable foods may also as they contain large quantities of vitamin K1. Warfarin dosing has to be exclusively individual. To ensure that a right and safe dose is taken, blood testing and counting of INR (international normalized ratio) should be performed during warfarin’s therapy. INR is value that measures warfarin’s activity. A high INR value influence patients to have increased risk of bleeding, while an INR values below the expectance and therapeutic target may indicate that warfarin dose is unsatisfactory to protect against thromboembolic events.\nUnder its brand name Coumadin it is available in tablet form in following doses: 1 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7.5 mg and 10 mg. It also available as an injection for intravenous use. FDA approved warfarin in 1954.\nHeparin and Warfarin mechanism of action\nWarfarin inhibits enzyme called vitamin K reductase, resulting in a depletion of the vitamin K reduced form vitamin KH2. Vitamin K is a cofactor on the N-terminal parts of vitamin K-dependent proteins, for the glutamate residues carboxylation. Inhibition limits chemical reaction of gamma-carboxylation and subsequent stimulation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. This results in the inhibition of synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins S and C. Results of the inhibition of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, and X is decreased prothrombin amounts and a decrease in the levels of thrombin produced and bound to fibrin. This reduces the clots thrombogenicity.\nHow does the anticoagulant heparin work?\nHeparin’s mechanism of action is ATIII-dependent. It works by accelerating the neutralization rate of certain activated coagulation factors by antithrombin, however there are also other mechanisms as well that may be also involved. Heparin’s antithrombotic effect is correlated to the inhibition of factor Xa. Heparin is not a thrombolytic or fibrinolytic agent. It just prevents progression of existing clots by inhibiting further clotting.\nDifferences and similarities between Warfarin and Heparin\nStructurally these medicines are different, they also work with different mechanisms however they are both used as anticoagulants.\nChemically warfarin is organic compound known as 4-hydroxycoumarins, while heparin is glycosaminoglycan polymer. Heparin and warfarin work in somewhat different ways, but both inhibit the production of cofactors that work together to help your blood to clot. Warfarin reduces blood clotting by preventing vitamin K working correctly while heparin works by preventing fibrin and thrombin, from working correctly.\nWarfarin is one of the most widely used anticoagulants, but because every human differs in their physiological function, dosage requirements differ from person to person. Patients on warfarin therapy must take their blood tests on every 2-4 weeks in order to confirm that their blood is thinning to the right degree without causing bleeding complications. INR test may be needed several times a week at the beginning of therapy to ensure that you are started on the correct dose. Generally, INR values of 2.5 to 3.0 shows that patient is receiving the correct dose of warfarin; INR values above 5.0 can be very dangerous with high risk of causing bleeding, and those below 1.0 indicate no warfarin effect. Compared to warfarin, Heparin works faster, so it is usually given when an immediate anticoagulant effect is needed. For example, heparin is commonly given in hospitals to prevent growth of a previously detected blood clot. Heparin is also recommended for pregnant women in situations when antiphospholipid antibodies have been discovered, since warfarin may harm the unborn child. However, heparin is never recommended for a long periods of time, as this medicine might increase the risk of osteoporosis. Usually patients are switched to warfarin when long term anticoagulant treatment is needed.\nWarfarin is available only in tablet form while heparin must be given as an injection. The amount of medication that is needed differs from person to person and by different situation, and patients receiving these medications should be closely monitored by their health care providers to ensure that they are being given the correct dose.\nWarfarin is not safe during pregnancy because it can cause birth defects and fetal bleeding. Women who take warfarin must be switched to heparin or low molecular weight heparin before they become pregnant, since these medicines do not cross the placenta into the fetus.\nThe two most serious side effects of anticoagulants including heparin and warfarin are bleeding and gangrene of the skin. Bleeding may occur in any organ or tissue. Bleeding in the kidneys usually causes severe back pain and blood in the urine. Stomach bleeding can cause weakness, fainting, vomiting of blood and black stools. Brain bleeding can cause severe headache and paralysis, and joints bleeding can cause joint pain and swelling.\nSide effects, Heparin vs Warfarin\nHeparin possible side effects Warfarin possible side effects Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (10-30% ) Cholesterol embolus syndrome Mild pain Intraocular hemorrhage Hematoma Abdominal pain Hemorrhage Flatulence Local irritation Alopecia Erythema Rash Injection site ulcer (after deep SC injection) Pruritus Increased liver aminotransferase Taste disturbance Anaphylaxis Tissue necrosis Immune hypersensitivity reaction Headache Osteoporosis (long-term, high-dose use) Lethargy Heparin resistance Dizziness Gasping syndrome in infants due to benzyl alcohol preservative Hematuria Hypersensitivity Anemia Hepatitis Respiratory tract bleeding Hypersensitivity reaction Hemorrhage Blood dyscrasias Fever \"Purple toe\" syndrome Increased fracture risk with long-term usage Calciphylaxis\nCan you take warfarin and heparin together?\nEven, concomitant use of heparin and warfarin is commonly used in clinical practice, the potential for additive anticoagulant effects and increased risk of severe bleeding should be considered. Oral anticoagulants may also prolong the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) in patients who are on heparin therapy, while heparin may prolong the INR values in patients receiving warfarin.\nWhy is heparin given before warfarin?\nHeparin works faster compared to warfarin, so it is usually given when an immediate anticoagulant effect is required. It is because of the delay in factor II also known as prothrombin suppression. Heparin is given concurrently for 4-5 days to prevent thrombus propagation. Loading doses of warfarin are not warranted and may result in bleeding complications. For example, heparin is commonly given in hospitals to prevent growth of a previously detected blood clot.\nWhat medications and foods should I avoid while using Heparin and Warfarin?\nWhile taking Heparin or Warfarin you have to avoid supplements with vitamin K. Taking vitamin K may reduce the effectivenss of these medicines and increase the risk of blood clots. In addition, always avoid drugs that can increase the risk of bleeding. These medications include NSAIDs, aspirin, corticosteroids, multivitamins with vitamin K, and fish oil. Antibiotic may change the warfarin’s INR test values. Always take with your doctor if you have to take antibiotic while you are on warfarin therary and always speak with your doctor before starting any new therapy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e233a1e6-d4cc-4978-9f25-12fa1a8ced55>","<urn:uuid:ad7b6852-032e-4c4a-a954-2cd99b5e11f5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the technical capabilities of tunnel boring machines for limestone, and what environmental damage can tunnel mining cause?","answer":"Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) are capable of effectively excavating through limestone, which is considered a medium-difficulty material. These machines, costing $10-30 million, have a crew of 10-20 operators and work by excavating ground while installing concrete rings in 5-foot increments. However, mining activities can cause significant environmental damage, including erosion, formation of sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, and contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water by chemicals. Additionally, mining operations often require deforestation to create space for debris storage.","context":["Home > Article\nVOL. 42 | NO. 16 | Friday, April 20, 2018\nHow does one tunnel beneath downtown?\nBy Kathy Carlson\nWhen talk of tunneling under downtown Nashville first surfaced last fall, many wondered if it could be done. After all, common wisdom had it that Nashville is built on limestone, so subways are out of the question.\nNot so. Tunnels can and have been dug through limestone, and what is being proposed for Nashville is in keeping with what has been done in other places.\n“On a scale of geomaterials, (limestone is) not the hardest and not the softest,” says Michael A. Mooney, Grewcock Chair professor of underground construction and tunneling at Colorado School of Mines “It’s certainly a material that can be tunneled through.”\nThe plan for Nashville is to run two 20-foot-diameter tunnels side by side down 5th Avenue from near Charlotte on the north to near the Music City Center on the south. Each tube would accommodate trains and electric buses in one direction. Larger spaces would be mined out underground to accommodate a station.\nThe tunnel would go directly under 5th Avenue but wouldn’t go directly under the existing Music City Central transit building between 4th and 5th and Charlotte, explains Jim Czarnecky, associate vice president of HDR, the engineering firm that is working with Metro on the Let’s Move Nashville plan.\n“We will take great care not to disturb any of the existing infrastructure and buildings, and the intent is to keep all of the tunnel in the existing public right-of-way,” he adds. If a portion of any station needs to extend beyond the right of way, Metro may need to obtain property easements – permissions to use underground areas - from landowners, but shouldn’t have to acquire any property itself, he says.\nMooney says that 20-foot diameter tunnels that run 1.8 miles through limestone are “well within the realm of tunnels built all around the world. … Tunnels twice the diameter and many times longer have been successfully constructed.”\nMoreover, the machinery used to create this type tunnel – a 20-foot transit-type tunnel boring machine – is a common type, Mooney adds. The machines can be built to specifications at a cost of perhaps $10-30 million, and sometimes a refurbished machine can be used. It takes about a year to get a TBM delivered to the site from a manufacturer.\nMooney said the TBMs have a crew of 10-20 operators who operate and maintain the machine. The TBM excavates the ground, brings out the material that has been bored through and installs concrete rings at the tail of the machine as it inches through the ground, he continues.\nThe cycle of excavation followed by concrete ring build work is done five feet at a time, and repeated until the tunnel is complete.\nThe two tunnels would probably have to be at least 10 feet apart, or half the diameter of a tunnel.\nOnce the tunnels are bored, emergency egress tunnels would have to be created to link the two tunnels so passengers could escape in case of emergency. Generally, the emergency egress tunnels are from 800 to 1,000 feet apart, he says.\nThere are about five TBM manufacturers around the world, Mooney adds. Two are in North America – one in Ohio, one in Toronto – and both are owned by Chinese companies. Much of the world’s tunnel boring equipment is made in China.","Mining has several bad effects.

Also try to pick one that’s bright white and not starting to discolour and brown on the outside of the florets.\nWhat does it go with?\nCheese is a real crowd pleaser, but there are also so many other options. Try it with anchovies - boil some chopped cauliflower well, then add to a pan with plenty of anchovies, garlic, parsley and olive oil and mix with pasta. Spices and curry flavours are a match made in heaven with cauliflower (think cumin or garam masala). As a member of the brassica family, it will also go great with salty pork flavours, as with our special recipe at the bottom.\nDon't throw away those leaves! Roast 'em up in a hot oven with olive oil and salt for 20 mins or so until the leaves are browned and wilted, and the white rib of the leaf is tender. Delicious!\nWhat does the nutritionist say?\nOur featured nutritional specialist Emily Moreton tells us: Cauliflower is a great source of Vitamin C, just a quarter of a small sized cauliflower will give you 43 mg of Vitamin C, which is your entire daily requirement!\nYou could have a go at a fermented Piccalilli, if not for the potential health benefits for your gut microbes, then for the electrifying colour and tangy crunch. Cauliflower is a core ingredient in the yellow preserve piccalilli which uses vegetables of the garden with Indian spices and makes a great addition to a Christmas cheese board. Although the scientific literature is quite limited at the moment around fermented foods, anecdotally speaking this doesn’t mean to say that they don’t have any health benefits, we just need more evidence.\nWhat are our favourite ways to prepare it?\nRoast your cauliflower in a very hot oven and it will start to colour, char even. As it goes brown it will develop a delicious nutty flavour; try roasted cauliflower with a tahini sauce! Simply boiled and cooled it’s also great in a salad with a tangy dressing and herbs. It also makes a simple and luxurious soup, as with our delicious recipe below.\nWhat did you say?\nWe asked on our Instagram what you love to do with the cauli. 'Roasted' was the answer we saw most. Of course, we got lots of cauliflower cheese shouts...I mean who doesn't love it doused in cheddary bechamel?! The curry combo was also very popular....two words: aloo gobi! We had some other really inspiring answers...poached in butter, deep fried, dipped in aioli, and au gratin!\nRecipe Time: Our Cauliflower Recipe for Eat the Seasons.\nThis soup is a beauty. It won't take you all day and has relatively few ingredients. It's not excessively heavy but it feels super indulgent as it's silky, thick and bursting with luxurious flavour. The nuts and crispy pork add texture and contrast; feel free to leave out the pancetta if you are veggie. If you like truffle, you can also drizzle a little truffle oil over it at the end! If you want to bring a cauliflower '2 ways' kind of vibe to the soup, you can also roast a few florets in the oven and then serve on top of the soup with the other garnishes!\nClick HERE for the visual recipe guide on our Instagram!\nCreamy Cauliflower Soup with Crispy Pancetta and Roasted Hazelnuts\n- 100g pancetta or gunaciale, cut into lardons if not bought chopped. (Guanciale is cured pig cheek, and in Italy it's not a proper Carbonara or Amatriciana unless you use Guanciale! But it's hard to find so pancetta is also fine.)\n- Handful of hazelnuts, roughly chopped\n- 1 white onion, finely sliced\n- 2 cloves garlic, chopped\n- 1 small/medium cauliflower, chopped into small pieces\n- 500ml milk\n- 500ml water\n- 50ml of cream\n- Handful of grated Parmesan\n- Glug of extra virgin olive oil\n- Chives, chopped, to garnish\n- Salt and pepper, to season\n- Fry the pancetta, or guanciale in a frying pan on a medium heat until nice and crispy. You don't need any oil in the pan to cook it, it will release its own fat. Once brown and crispy, remove from the pan and put on some kitchen paper.\n- Put the hazelnuts in the pan in which you cooked the pancetta and toast the nuts on a medium heat for around 5 mins until lightly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside, leaving the fat in the pan.\n- Add the onion to the pan; there should be some pork fat left in the pan, depending on the fattiness of the pancetta. Add a good glug of good olive oil to help with frying the onions (unless the pork was super fatty and the pan is already swimming with oil). Add a good pinch of salt and fry on a medium heat for around 10 minutes, until the onions are well softened. Add the garlic and fry for a futher 2 minutes.\n- Pour the contents of the onion pan into a deep saucepan, then add the cauliflower, milk, cream, Parmesan and water. The cauliflower should be just covered in liquid. Bring to the boil and simmer for around 20 minutes, depending on how small you chopped your cauliflower. We are looking for the cauliflower to be completely soft and cooked through, not 'al dente', otherwise it won't blend to a smooth soup.\n- Once you are happy the cauliflower is well cooked and soft, pour the mixture into a blender and blend until luxuriously smooth. You can also put a stick blender in the pan and blend that way. Season well with salt and pepper and check the taste; it needs to be well seasoned to make it sing - you can also add more Parmesan if you feel it needs it! If you're feeling a bit naughty you could also whisk in a little butter ;)\n- Ladle into bowls and garnish with the pancetta, hazelnuts and chives. Enjoy with some freshly baked bread and butter!","Vitamin C is an antioxidant present in many fruits and vegetables. Also known as L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C has a wide variety of uses in the body. It supports normal growth and development and helps the body repair damaged tissue.[2, 3] Vitamin C also assists in the production of collagen, a protein that’s necessary for healthy skin, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels.\nTo say that vitamin C is beneficial would be an understatement. It influences iron absorption and helps fight cell-damaging free radicals. A 16-year study found that regular vitamin C supplementation promoted heart health. Additionally, people who consume foods rich in vitamin C or other antioxidants may lower their risk of high blood pressure.[7, 8, 9]\nHigh Doses of Vitamin C\nIn the 1970s, chemist and Nobel Peace laureate, Linus Pauling, proposed that high doses of vitamin C could help prevent the common cold. Many people swear by Pauling's claim that vitamin C can boost the immune system naturally, but the research is still inconclusive.\nA number of studies have examined whether high-dose vitamin C can provide extraordinary therapeutic results. Results thus far are inconclusive. However, animal studies have found that vitamin C may make traditional therapies more effective.\nNatural Dietary Sources of Vitamin C\nMany types of food are fortified with vitamins and vitamin C is usually in the mix. However, like all vitamins, it’s best to get your daily intake from organic, natural sources and the best, natural sources of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables. Below are some of the best foods for vitamin C.\n|Sources of Vitamin C|\n|Food and Serving Size||Vitamin C (mg/serving)|\n|Red or Yellow Bell Pepper, Raw, 1/2 cup||95|\n|Orange Juice, 3/4 cup||93|\n|Orange, 1 medium||70|\n|Grapefruit Juice, 3/4 cup||70|\n|Kiwifruit, 1 medium||64|\n|Green Bell Pepper, raw, 1/2 cup||60|\n|Broccoli, cooked, 1/2 cup||51|\n|Strawberries, fresh, sliced 1/2 cup||49|\n|Brussels sprouts, cooked, ½ cup||48|\n|Grapefruit, ½ medium||39|\n|Broccoli, raw, ½ cup||39|\n|Tomato juice, ¾ cup||33|\n|Cantaloupe, ½ cup||29|\n|Cabbage, cooked, ½ cup||28|\n|Cauliflower, raw, ½ cup||26|\n|1 Lemon Yield, 48g||18.6|\n|Potato, baked, 1 medium||17|\n|Tomato, raw, 1 Medium||17|\n|Spinach, cooked, 1/2 cup||9|\n|Green peas, frozen, cooked, 1/2 cup||8|\nDaily Intake of Vitamin C\nThe amount of vitamin C that a person needs may vary with factors like age or whether a person is smoking, pregnant, or even breastfeeding. These are the guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Dietary Supplements:\n|Recommended Daily Allowances of Vitamin C|\n|Age||Female||Male||Pregnant female||Breastfeeding female|\n|0-6 months||40 mg||40 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|7-12 months||50 mg||50 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|1-3 years||15 mg||15 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|4-8 years||25 mg||25 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|9-13 years||45 mg||45 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|14-18 years||65 mg||75 mg||80 mg||115 mg|\n|19+ years||75 mg||90 mg||85 mg||120 mg|\nDangers of Vitamin C Deficiency\nA lot of people might think “scurvy” is just pirate lingo, but it’s actually a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C. Symptoms of scurvy include fatigue, gum disease, anemia, scaly skin, and easy bruising. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in the United States these days but some people remain at risk.\nPeople who get too little variety in their food may not receive adequate nutrition. Normally, when we hear \"malnourished\" many of us think \"starving\", but what it's more likely to mean is that a person is deficient in specific nutrients and it's affecting their health. Those who rely on a carnivorous diet might miss their daily quota for vitamin C as meat and dairy don’t contain much of this critical nutrient. Infants fed evaporated or boiled cow's milk may not get enough vitamin C, especially since cow’s milk is low in vitamin C to begin with. Breast milk and infant formula are both better sources of vitamin C.\nSome medical conditions can cause vitamin C deficiency. Digestive tract injuries or inefficiencies, genetic diseases, and other issues can negatively affect not just vitamin C absorption, but nutrient absorption as a whole. Kidney disease and some types of cancer can also cause vitamin C deficiency.\nSmoking cigarettes is a bad idea for many reasons. One of the effects of the tissue damage it causes is the body using up vitamin C at a faster rate than normal. As a result, smokers and people exposed to second-hand smoke may need an extra 35 mg of vitamin C a day.\nVitamin C Supplementation\nUsually, if you follow a balanced diet with a foundation of organic fruits and vegetables, you’ll get all the vitamin C you need. If you don’t, vitamin C supplementation might be something to consider and discuss with your healthcare provider.\nBe aware of the difference between synthetic and natural vitamins. Synthetic supplements are manufactured with unnatural ingredients and chemicals. They are made to mimic natural vitamins but not everyone is convinced of their efficacy. Conversely, natural supplements are made using ingredients drawn straight from their natural sources.\nVitamin C supplements are usually available as ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, or calcium ascorbate. Synthetic and natural ascorbic acid have similar properties, but I always recommend a natural, plant-based source.[15, 16]\nIf your diet isn’t providing you with enough vitamin C, you should consider that it's not providing you with all the other nutrients your body requires, either. In such a case, you may want to skip the vitamin C supplement and look for a solid multivitamin. I recommend IntraMAX® and believe, without a doubt, that it’s the best multivitamin available anywhere. It’s an organic, liquid formula loaded with all the nutrients you need, as well as powerful antioxidant and immune system stimulators. It's as complete as it gets.\nWhere do you get your vitamin C?

{"question":"How does UNCLOS establish maritime boundaries and rights, and what challenges does China pose to this legal framework in the South China Sea?","answer":"UNCLOS establishes maritime boundaries and rights through several key provisions: it defines the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending up to 200 nautical miles from shore, where coastal states have exclusive rights over resources in both the water column and seabed. It also establishes continental shelf rights over seabed resources, which can extend beyond 200 nautical miles based on natural prolongation. When states' claims overlap, delimitation should be guided by the principle of equity. However, China poses significant challenges to this framework in the South China Sea by violating multiple UNCLOS provisions. China makes illegal baseline claims, unlawfully requires prior permission for innocent passage of foreign warships, improperly claims jurisdiction over security matters in its contiguous zone, and illegally attempts to regulate foreign military activities in its EEZ. China has also militarized artificial islands, interfered with other states' resource rights, and refuses to comply with the South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal ruling that declared its nine-dash line claims contrary to UNCLOS. These actions threaten the rules-based order that has governed maritime affairs for decades.","context":["By Cornell Overfield\nThe UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), more than any other implement of international law, has underpinned the orderly delimitation and governance of the world’s oceans. Despite its status as an unparalleled accomplishment of diplomacy and international law, the treaty is not exhaustive or without ambiguities. One outstanding issue in delimitation arbitration is the relationship between the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf – specifically whether one state’s EEZ rights can overlap with another state’s continental shelf rights. What deserves greater attention is how recent court maritime boundary delimitations derided by some observers as legislation from the bench in fact follow the black letter of the law more closely than state practice or previous court decisions.\nGeological continental shelves are underwater plateaus of sediment from the adjacent continent that generally terminate in a sharp slope leading to the deep sea. The legal continental shelf, first articulated in U.S. President Harry Truman’s 1946 Proclamation on the Continental Shelf, claims the resources, particularly hydrocarbons, of the continental shelf for the coastal state as a “natural prolongation” of the state’s landward territory. UNCLOS recognizes continental shelf rights over resources on the seabed and subsoil, including both deposits in the subsoil and creatures that live on the seabed. Legal continental shelves can either run to the “outer edge of the continental margin” or “to a distance of 200 nautical miles” from baselines if the continental shelf is shorter than 200 n.m. (the 350 n.m. limit is a general rule with various caveats). Article 83 clarifies that when states have adjacent or opposing coasts, shelf delimitation should be guided by the pursuit of an equitable solution.\nUNCLOS also establishes a related legal zone – the exclusive economic zone. The EEZ can only extend up to 200 nautical miles from shore. In the EEZ, the coastal state enjoys exclusive rights over resources found in the water column, particularly fish, and in the underlying seabed and subsoil. As with continental shelves, where states’ EEZ claims overlap, the delimitation should be guided by the principle of equity. The coastal state also has exclusive jurisdiction over artificial platforms, including those used for oil extraction, in its EEZ.\nThis language yields two ambiguities. First, in the section of the Convention dealing with the shelf, do shelf rights based on distance or natural prolongation take precedence when the distances involved are less than 200 nautical miles? Second, when the area to be delimited is less than 200 nautical miles from one or both states, can EEZ and continental shelf rights be separated, since EEZs also address access and rights to the shelf’s resources?\nHistorically, distance has taken precedence over natural prolongation and states and courts have simply delimited the continental shelf along with the EEZ, making moot the question of whether shelf and water column rights can be allocated to different states.\nThe ICJ issued the landmark ruling on shelf delimitation in the 1985 Malta v. Libya, in which it ruled that a delimitation based on equidistance was equitable. Libya and Malta’s coasts faced one another and were separated by less than 400 nautical miles. Libya maintained that the seafloor’s geomorphology entitled it to a portion of the continental shelf on Malta’s side of the equidistance line. The Malta Trench is a discontinuity in the continental shelf lying between Malta and the equidistant line. Since shelf rights stemmed from the principle of natural prolongation and the Malta Trench represented a break in natural prolongation for both the Maltese and Libyan coasts, Libya argued that the continental shelf boundary should run along the Trench. The ICJ, however, ruled against Libya and established a shelf boundary based on equidistance, not geomorphology. In doing so, the Court set a precedent that equity meant equidistance, not shelf delimitation based on morphology.\nAs states claimed EEZs, the delimitation of which has also been guided by an equidistance-as-equity principle, comprehensive EEZ-shelf borders have become the norm when within 200 n.m. of two states. A single delimitation for the EEZ and continental shelf is rooted in state practice, rather than treaty law. In a separate but related tradition, today’s court delimitations for the EEZ and continental shelf follow a three-step procedure. First, the court draws a provisional, comprehensive equidistance line between the relevant coasts. Second, the court checks for factors calling for a shift. And finally, the court checks for a disproportion between the lengths of each state’s relevant coastlines and the areas of relevant ocean allocated to each state. The result, historically, has been a single maritime boundary covering both the EEZ and continental shelf.\nThe Bay of Bengal’s Grey Area\nIn 2012, the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), the specialized court established by UNCLOS, shocked observers by appearing to repudiate the precedent of a comprehensive boundary. In Bangladesh v. Myanmar, both parties claimed that the other party lacked shelf rights beyond 200 n.m. Bangladesh argued that the shelf underlying the Bay of Bengal is a natural prolongation of Bangladesh, but not Myanmar, and thus Bangladesh should have all shelf rights beyond 200 n.m. Myanmar argued that equidistance-based delimitation within 200 n.m. would cut Bangladesh’s rights off short of the 200 n.m. mark and thus prevent Bangladesh from having a shelf entitlement beyond 200 n.m.\nThe court struck a compromise between these two claims. If the court had applied the logic of a single boundary based on equidistance, Bangladesh’s rights would have terminated short of 200 nautical miles. But Bangladesh’s natural prolongation argument ran contrary to the established legal (if not geological) definition of natural prolongation. Instead, the court adjusted the comprehensive boundary line, both within and beyond 200 n.m. It replaced the equidistance line with a geodetic angle bisector that preserved Bangladesh’s access to the continental shelf beyond 200 n.m. In the map below, Bangladesh has rights to the left of the solid black line, while Myanmar has rights to the right of the line.\nCourt adjustments to equidistance lines are commonplace, but the result here – to connect Bangladesh to a continental shelf beyond 200 n.m. – was unprecedented.1 As a result, in one area the court’s adjusted line was over 200 n.m. from Bangladesh’s basepoints but within 200 n.m. of Myanmar’s. In this “grey area” Bangladesh could not claim an EEZ, but Myanmar’s claim was unopposed.\nTo preserve Bangladesh’s access to its “outer” continental shelf, the court thus ruled that Bangladesh would have shelf rights in the “grey area” while Myanmar would have all other EEZ rights. The grey area reappeared in the ICJ’s subsequent Bangladesh v. India (2014) ruling, for the same reason. (Collectively, Bangladesh v. Myanmar and Bangladesh v. India are referred to as the Bay of Bengal cases.) In both Bay of Bengal cases, the court refrained from providing a rigorously explicit justification for this unprecedented move. Observers were fairly critical of the decision, with noted international lawyer W. Michael Reisman characterizing the rulings as legislation from the bench that overturned longstanding precedent.\nThe grey area established in the Bay of Bengal cases can create governance headaches for two reasons, which would be present anywhere State A has shelf rights while State B has EEZ-based water column rights. First, while State A has the right to any oil in the subsoil, State B has jurisdiction over the permitting and operation of any artificial platforms State A or a concessionaire would construct to extract the oil. Second, State A would have a right to the “creatures of the shelf” who live on the seabed, while State B would have rights to all other living creatures in the water column. This could create harms for either party, if say, fishermen from State B employ trawling methods that capture, kill, or disrupt the creatures of the shelf to which State A has rights.\nThe Grey Area is Proper\nDespite these growing pains and contra critics, the “grey area” is actually the correct if inconvenient interpretation of UNCLOS. The text of the convention in fact permits what the court did and ITLOS in particular is guided by treaty law. Instead of overturning the precedent cemented by state practice, the Bay of Bengal cases establish a new precedent for a different subset of cases.\nConsider two important differences between past precedent and the Bay of Bengal cases that make them substantially different. First, state-negotiated delimitations are not strictly bound by the Convention. When states cannot agree on a delimitation treaty, however, and refer the dispute to ITLOS, the relevant treaty law becomes far more important. Second, Malta v. Libya and other precedent-setting cases (such as Romania v. Ukraine) involved only areas within 200 n.m. of both parties, whereas the Bay of Bengal’s grey areas involved a potential “outer continental shelf” entitlement. Together, these differences make the Bay of Bengal cases significantly different to Malta, and thus the courts’ decisions are not the repudiation of precedent they sometimes are portrayed as.\nMore importantly, the text provides a clear justification of the courts’ separation of the water column from the seabed, even if the courts themselves did not explicitly make any argument defending their unprecedented ruling. Article 56.3 UNCLOS provides that the EEZ rights regarding the seabed set out in Part V “shall be exercised in accordance with Part VI [Articles 76-85].” Following Article 56.3’s directive to reference Part VI leads to a clear and rational basis for the court’s decision in the Bay of Bengal cases. Article 77 clarifies that continental shelf rights exist automatically, and thus logically exist prior to EEZ rights, which must be claimed. Furthermore, Article 78.1 explicitly states that the rights of a coastal state over the continental shelf (N.B., not the “outer continental shelf” – the Convention contains no mention of the “outer continental shelf”) do not affect the legal status of superjacent water columns or air. This clause applies to the EEZ as much as it does to the high seas. Taken together, this reasoning indicates that, under a strict interpretation of UNCLOS, the court’s function in a delimitation involving both the EEZ and the continental shelf is to identify first pre-existing continental shelf rights (including those beyond 200 n.m.) and delimit based on equity and thereafter construct and delimit EEZ rights.\nWhere does this leave the courts and future delimitation? The ship has long since sailed on delimitations within 200 n.m. of both states in a dispute. Much as with flags of convenience, state practice and custom have overtaken the convention’s black-letter language when delimiting EEZ and continental shelf rights within 200 n.m. While the court can determine continental shelf rights within 200 n.m. without prejudicing its subsequent award of the water column, it is too much to expect that it will embrace this reasoning in all future cases. Nevertheless, the court should utilize the logic above to justify the grey area where appropriate to compensate geographically disadvantaged states and ensure access to shelf resources beyond 200 n.m. A cursory analysis of outstanding boundary disputes indicates that the Bay of Bengal precedent may be of use on the Pakistan-India and Nigeria-Togo-Benin border.\nFinally, the grey area itself ought not to be feared. The challenges of overlapping shelf and water column rights is not an issue of rule of law versus governance, but rather one of rule of law versus rule of habit. Instead of complaining about inconvenience, the Bay of Bengal case is not only a triumph for written law on the international stage but also an opportunity for states to cooperate. Prodded along by their economic self-interest, as they were when drafting the Convention itself, states sharing a grey area should find innovative ways of managing resources at a time when multilateral management of the seas is more important than ever.\nCornell Overfield is an Associate Research Analyst at CNA Corporation, a nonprofit research and analysis organization located in Arlington, VA.

Outer continental shelf entitlements are usually caught in a circular trap, where the specialized body designed to verify their existence cannot verify if the entitlement is subject to dispute, but the courts will not resolve the dispute as long as the body has not verified the OCS’ existence.\nFeatured Image: Emblem of the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) at its headquarters in Hamburg, Germany. (Tom Vierus/Livingdreams.tv)","- Raul Pedrozo\nChina and the Rules-Based Legal Order for the Indo-Pacific\nFor once, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has made an accurate observation about the South China Sea. On August 9, 2021, a London-based “journalist” and guest contributor to China Global Television Network wrote an article indicating the United States “cannot make the rules in the South China Sea.” Naderi is absolute correct—the United States does not make the rules, but neither does China.\nAs with all the world’s oceans, the South China Sea is governed by customary international law rules, most recently codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), that have been developed over the past two centuries. The United States Navy has championed these customary norms since the beginning of the Republic, and it has, on more than one occasion, gone to war to preserve these navigational rights and freedoms. If challenged, the United States would inevitably fight again to preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\nAs in by-gone days, the rules-based order that has effectively regulated lawful uses of the seas is once again under attack, this time by China, Russia, and other rogue nations that want to change the rules to advance their nationalistic agendas. So, while the United States may not make the rules, it certainly has a right and obligation, along with other states governed by the rule of law, to safeguard freedoms of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the sea associated with those freedoms.\nII. The China Threat\nNaderi tows the CCP line that China does not pose a threat to its neighbors and that U.S.-led naval exercises are being used by Washington to fraudulently project the illusion of the “China threat.” Yet some dozen partners from India to Oceania are combining efforts and strengthening their armed forces in recognition that China poses the greatest threat to peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region since World War II. Naderi’s assertion that China’s efforts to create a new regional order should be supported because it is based on strict respect for international law and the U.N. Charter, as well as the right of states “to decide their futures freely and without external threat and pressure” is equally incredulous. Such a misrepresentation is disingenuous at best.\nOn the eve of the opening ceremonies of the Tokyo Olympics, the CCP aired a video where China threatened Japan with continuous nuclear strikes and “full-scale war” if Tokyo interfered in Chain’s handling of Taiwan. This statement was made despite the fact that China has a “no first use policy,” which states China will only use nuclear weapons in response to an nuclear attack against China and unconditionally undertakes not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear-weapon states (like Japan). Perhaps it is time for Tokyo to join the nuclear club as a counterbalance to China’s increasing nuclear capabilities?\nMoreover, China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels continue to illegally intrude into the waters surrounding the Senkaku Islands, which are clearly Japanese territory and have been under the administrative control of Tokyo since 1972. In 2021, CCG vessels operated in Japanese waters for 152 consecutive days, the highest number on record since 2012. It should, therefore, come as no surprise that Japan identified China as its number one security threat in its 2021 White Paper.\nThe CCP’s threat against Japan should come as no surprise given the increasing level of aggression directed at Taiwan since September 2020. Between 1954 and 2020, the Davis Line (the median line in the Taiwan Strait) was reportedly breeched only four times by Chinese aircraft. Beginning in September 2020, however, Chinese intrusions have increased in both scope and size raising the possibility that these unprecedented incursions are not consistent with the peacetime right of overflight in international airspace, but rather constitute a threat to use force against Taiwan in violation of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. Four of the more provocative intrusions occurred in September 2020 (19 combat aircraft), March 2021 (20 combat aircraft), April 2021 (25 combat aircraft), and August 2021 (11 combat aircraft). Moreover, between January 1 and November 30, 2020, Chinese warplanes penetrated Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) about 380 times, compared to six intrusions in 2016 and 20 intrusions in 2017. Given the heightened cross-strait tensions, these acts of coercion by combat aircraft are designed to alter the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and clearly raise the risk of miscalculation and military confrontation.\nAlthough the United States maintains a “One-China Policy,” this policy is premised on the condition “that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means” and that any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means would be viewed with grave concern by the United States. Moreover, China recently sought to increase tensions by publicly telling Taipei that the United States would abandon the idea of defending Taiwan, citing the recent fall of Kabul to the Taliban as precedent. China’s current aggression toward Taiwan demonstrates it has not lived up to its end of the bargain. Perhaps it is time for the United States to reconsider and abandon the misguided “One-China Policy” and reestablish diplomatic ties with Taipei.\nSouth China Sea and ASEAN Regional States\nChina routinely ignores the provisions of the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) by threatening and using force against the other South China Sea claimants and engaging in activities that raise tensions and undermine regional peace and stability, such as occupying, reclaiming, and militarizing a number of uninhabited South China Sea features. China routinely interferes with the resource rights of the regional states, purporting to control their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and continental shelves by arresting or sinking fishing boats, harassing survey vessels and offshore oil rigs, and illegally seizing fishing equipment and fish catch. China has blocked access to over $2.5 trillion in unexploited oil and gas resources, resulting in enormous economic loss for the other South China Sea claimants. This aggression upends the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the regional states and runs counter to their ability to fulfill U.N. goals of sustainable development.\nChina has also established seven military outposts on massive artificial islands that have changed the status quo of the South China Sea. Militarization of these outposts clearly violates China’s commitment to exercise self-restraint in conducting activities that could complicate or escalate the ongoing disputes and affect regional peace and stability. These shore-based infrastructure improvements, such as airfields and hangars for combat aircraft, port facilities and deep-water channels to improve access for large warships, communications and surveillance facilities, fixed-weapons positions, and improved logistics hubs (water and fuel storage facilities), provide China with a persistent and robust power projection presence that will be used to threaten the sovereignty of regional nations, impede free and open access to the South China Sea, and endanger global prosperity.\nAt an August 2021 meeting of the U.N. Security Council, under the chairmanship of India, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken discussed many of these concerns, underscoring the importance to defend, uphold, and revitalize the rules-based international order reflected in UNCLOS, which regulates all activities in the oceans and is critical to global stability and the security and prosperity of all nations. He emphasized that the international order is under serious threat in the South China Sea where China has engaged in dangerous and provocative actions to advance its illegal maritime claims and intimidate and bully other claimant states “from lawfully accessing their maritime resources.”\nChina objected to the discussion of the South China Sea issue in the U.N. Security Council, indicating that the U.S. remarks were irresponsible, that China and ASEAN countries were capable of maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea, and that the United States was stirring up trouble by sending ships and aircraft to the region. China additionally emphasized that the United States has no credibility on maritime issues given that Washington has failed to join UNCLOS, “but considers itself a judge of the convention.”\nChina has a point—the United States is not a party to UNCLOS and maybe it should be so it can deflect future Chinese criticism. Nonetheless, since 1983, the United States has publicly accepted and acted in accordance with the provisions of the convention regarding traditional uses of the oceans and recognized the rights of other states in waters off their coasts, as reflected in UNCLOS, so long as the rights and freedoms of the United States and other nations are recognized by the coastal states. Concomitantly, the United States has also exercised and asserted its navigational rights and freedoms on a worldwide basis, consistent with the convention, and has demonstrated its non-acquiescence in unilateral acts of other states that restrict the navigational rights and freedoms of, and other lawful uses of the sea, by the international community.\nChina, on the other hand, despite being a party to UNCLOS, is recognized globally as a serial violator of the convention. Virtually all of its domestic legislation applicable to its maritime claims is inconsistent with UNCLOS and customary international law. Most of China’s claimed straight baselines along its mainland coast do not meet the geographic requirements of UNCLOS (articles 5 and 7) and are therefore illegal. Similarly, China’s claimed baselines around the disputed Paracel Islands and part of the Senkaku Islands are unlawful. As a continental state, China may not draw straight baselines around its claimed mid-ocean archipelagoes (UNCLOS articles 46 and 47). China has failed to demonstrate its open, notorious, effective, and continuous exercise of authority over the Gulf of Bohai and Hainan Strait, as well as a showing of actual acquiescence by foreign states in the exercise of that authority. Thus, China’s claim that the gulf and strait constitute internal waters based on historic rights is inconsistent with international law.\nLikewise, China’s requirement in its 1992 territorial sea law that foreign warships and other government non-commercial vessels require prior permission to conduct innocent passage through the territorial sea is contrary to UNCLOS (articles 17 and 19) so long as the ship does not engage in any activities that is considered to be prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state. China’s claim that it has jurisdiction over security-related matters in its contiguous zone violates the plain language of UNCLOS (article 33), which limits coastal states authority in the contiguous zone to prevent and punish infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea.\nChina’s purported authority to regulate all foreign military activities in its EEZ is equally untenable and in direct contravention of international law. While China exercises exclusive rights to the resources of the zone and jurisdiction over marine scientific research (MSR), all states have an absolute right under international law to conduct military activities beyond the territorial sea of another state. Within the EEZ, all states enjoy high seas freedoms of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the seas related to those freedoms (UNCLOS articles 56, 86 and 89). Military operations, exercises, and activities, to include military marine data collection and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations, have always been regarded as internationally lawful uses of the sea and the right to conduct military activities in the EEZ is not affected by the convention.\nChina’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), which was established in 2013 and encompasses much of the East China Sea, also does not comport with state practice and customary international law. All nations enjoy freedom of overflight in international airspace seaward of the territorial sea. The purported application of ADIZ regulations to transiting aircraft that do not intend to enter Chinese national airspace interferes with the freedom of overflight and is therefore inconsistent with international law.\nFinally, China’s reprehensible refusal to comply with the award of the South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal reaffirms Beijing’s disdain for contemporary international law and accentuates its devious plans to alter the rules-based international order to advance its illegal maritime claims. The tribunal ruled that “China’s claims to historic rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction, with respect to the maritime areas of the South China Sea encompassed by the relevant part of the ‘nine-dash line’ are contrary to the Convention and without lawful effect….” The tribunal’s award is final and binding, and as a party to the convention China has a legal obligation to comply with the ruling (UNCLOS article 296, Annex VII article 11). Beijing cannot pick and chose which decisions it will observe or reject.\nIV. “Policing” the South China Sea\nIf China acted as a responsible state actor and did not engage in activities that intimidate its neighbors, no one would have to police the South China Sea. But, Naderi is correct in saying that no one has deputized the U.S. Navy to be the South China Sea policeman. Nonetheless, as Secretary Blinken astutely observed before the Security Council in August 2021, every state has the responsibility “to defend the rules that we’ve all agreed to follow and peacefully resolve maritime disputes” and if a state like China “faces no consequences for ignoring these rules, it fuels greater impunity and instability everywhere.”\nA conflict in the South China Sea would devastate the global economy and have serious, long-term consequences for international peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Some of the world’s busiest and most strategic sea lines of communication (SLOC) traverse the South China Sea, with nearly one-third of global maritime trade and two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments transiting these waters annually. This includes between $3.4 and $5.3 trillion in ship-borne trade, including $1.2 trillion bound for U.S. ports. Thus, the United States has an abiding interest in “policing” and ensuring the South China Sea SLOCs remain open to protect U.S. and allied economic interests and maintain regional and global peace and security.\nLike it or not, the Indo-Pacific region will only enjoy continued stability, economic growth, and prosperity if the United States and its partners maintain peaceful and deliberate military operations in the region to counter Chinese hegemony. As a maritime domain, the Indo-Pacific requires the continuous presence of naval and air forces of allies and partners to ensure it remains free and open. Continued U.S. naval operations in the Indo-Pacific will buttress regional peace, stability, and security and counterbalance China’s efforts to alter the rules-based international legal order that has preserved peace and stability in the region for eight decades. As a Pacific nation, global leader, and premier maritime power, the United States remains committed to countering China’s unlawful intimidation and coercion against its neighbors, which threaten their sovereignty and reinforce China’s efforts to advance its illegal maritime claims. The rules-based order has benefited all nations and it will continue to do so unless bullies like China are allowed to change the status quo and alter the rules that have effectively governed the world’s oceans for centuries.\n*** The views expressed herein belong solely to the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of JTMS or the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies.

{"question":"¿How to make rosé wine? Podrias explicar los different methods para producir vino rosado in the Loire Valley?","answer":"Rosé wine can be produced using two main methods: 1) Maceration: red wine grapes are left to rest in the juice for a period of time, after which the entire batch is finished into rosé wine. 2) Saignée (Bled) Method: during the first few hours of making red wine, some juice is bled off and put into a new vat to make rosé, while the remainder continues the red wine making process. This bleeding not only produces rosé but also concentrates the red wine's intensity. A third method, blending red and white wines, is only used in the Champagne district and not in Loire Valley.","context":["The Wines of the Loire Valley\nA world of wine in all types and all colours.\nRed, White, Rosé, Sparling and Sweet.\nA world of wine in all types and all colours.\nLoire Valley produces a great deal of excellent white wine but this is not to say that you cannot find great red wine in the Loire; you just have to know where to look.\nArguably the best Loire reds are produced from Cabernet Franc grapes in the famous appellations of Bourgueil, Chinon, St. Nicolas de Bourgueil and Saumur-Champigny. These appellations border the Loire river and, in the case of Chinon, the Vienne, and are protected from cold north and east winds by large areas of forest. Located west of Tours, they are on limestone, clay or sandy soils and in a climatic zone influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. All these things combined give warmer average temperatures than in the rest of the Touraine, greatly helping ripening.\nWhile Saumur-Champigny is fashionable, Bourgueil can be the beefiest, longest-living Loire red of all, while the lighter St-Nicolas de Bourgueil is rarely seen outside the region. Chinons can often be aged for decades and an old Chinon is a rare pleasure.\nOther red grape varieties are cultivated in the Loire Valley, including Pinot Noir, Malbec (called Côt here) and Gamay. Very little Cabernet Sauvignon is grown as it struggles to ripen in this northerly climate.\nBourgueil, Chinon, St. Nicolas de Bourgueil and Saumur-Champigny have already been noted, but throughout the Touraine excellent reds are produced, often a blend of varieties as in Touraine-Chenonceaux where malbec/cabernet franc blends dominate.\nTowards Burgundy in the east, Pinot Noir is the major red variety and those of Sancerre, aged with or without oak, can be very fine indeed.\nWorld class white wines are produced throughout the length of the Loire Valley but differ according to grape variety, soil type and region.\nIn the far west, by the estuary on the Atlantic, dry whites are produced on granite and schist soils using Melon de Bourgogne and Folle Blanche grapes.\nMoving up river Chenin Blanc – also known as Pineau de la Loire - takes over, while the east, especially along the banks of the river Cher, is Sauvignon Blanc country.\nOther white grapes include Chardonnay, typically zesty and unoaked and most often used in blends, Pinot Gris and the rare Romorantin, which is indigenous to the Loire and found only in AOC Cour-Cheverny.\nMost regions of the Loire Valley produce white wine but some stand out as being amongst the best in the world. Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé produce Sauvignon Blanc wines which, at their best, are of remarkable quality. The same variety is used in Reuilly, Quincy, Menetou-Salon and several Touraine appellations, regularly winning awards for their fresh, dry whites.\nAround the city of Tours Chenin Blanc comes into its own, with the wines of Vouvray and Montlouis sur Loire being particularly appreciated. Chenin Blanc continues down the Loire, through Savennières towards Angers.\nMuscadet de Sèvre-et-Maine and Muscadet sur lie are best drunk young and fresh with oysters and sea food.\nRosé wine can be produced in one of two ways : Maceration or Saignée (Bled) Method. A third way – the blending of red and white wines – is used in the Champagne district, where a tiny proportion of Pinot Noir is added to Chardonnay to produce sparkling rosé Champagne.\nMaceration involves leaving red wine grapes to rest, or macerate, in the juice for a period of time and afterward the entire batch of juice is finished into a rosé wine. The Saignée method is when during the first few hours of making a red wine, some of the juice is bled off and put into a new vat to make rosé. The remainder continues on the red wine making process. The bleeding off of some of the juice not only produces a lovely rosé, but it also concentrates the red wines’ intensity.\nRosé wines regularly go in and out of fashion but can be excellent with light foods or drunk on its own. Colour can vary tremendously and the taste depends on the red grape varieties used in its production. Needless to say, the Loire produces excellent rosé wines.\nAOC Touraine-Noble-Joué is a tiny appellation located between the Cher and the Indre rivers, producing only rosé wine from Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot Gris grapes. Other rosés are produced notably in the Touraine and Chinon is a personal favourite.\nAnjou, the name of the region around the city of Angers, is associated with the often grimly sweet commercial Rosé d'Anjou as well as the extraordinarily long-lived, fine pink Cabernet d'Anjou.\nSparkling wines are made in the Loire Valley in much the same way as in Champagne, involving a secondary fermentation in the bottle and the removal of yeast by Disgorgement, (or dégorgement). Wines will be aged “sur lies” stacked on their sides in limestone caves throughout the region.\nIn the Loire Valley the principle grape used for sparkling wine is the Chenin Blanc, with its decidedly un-champagne-like flavours and fantastically low prices. Other grapes used in some appellations include Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc while red grape varieties such as Pinot Noir may be used to create rosé.\nIn the west, Saumur stands out with many Champagne houses having outposts here. In the middle Loire, Vouvray and it’s little sister across the river, Montlouis sur Loire, are also famous for producing sparkling wine of high quality.\nThe Touraine appellations often feature sparkling wine while the reputation of the more rigorously made Crémant de Loire is well established.\nSweet wines are the result of the concentration of natural sugars in the grapes during a good, sunny summer and autumn. Several appellations of the Loire are famous for them. Chenin Blanc is the grape mostly used, but Sauvignon Blanc can also produce interesting sweet wines in warm years.\nThe degree of sweetness varies according to the amount of residual sugar remaining in the wine and a complete range can be found. These moelleux and liquoreux wines can last in the bottle for decades.\nIn the Angou region, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Coteaux du Layon and, especially, the particularly well-favoured enclaves Chaume, Quarts de Chaume and Bonnezeaux within it, can produce great, honeyed, long-living sweet white wines to rival some of the best in the world.\nVouvray and Montlouise sur Loire, often considered the home of Chenin Blanc, also produce world class sweet wines which couple low alcohol with naturally high acidity levels. Clients who claim not to enjoy sweet wines are often converted by these exquisite examples.\nThe Loire Valley produces wine in a wide range of colours and styles. Our tours give you a unique opportunity to taste these wines, look at the production facilities and often meet the owners. As enthusiasts ourselves, we make a point of seeking out the best."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e2898f00-03a5-46d9-8bdb-6bd7c60dc4cc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain how Native American languages differ from English in their approach to describing the world?","answer":"In English, approximately 70% of vocabulary words are used for people, places, and things. In contrast, in Anishinaabe languages, about 70% of words refer to beings. This means that elements like water, trees, and grasses are referred to as beings rather than objects. This linguistic difference reflects a fundamentally different worldview that recognizes the consciousness and life-force of everything in the environment.","context":["Los Angeles-based Cauleen Smith (b. 1967) is an multidisciplinary artist whose work employs elements of film, sculpture, installation, and sound. A California native, Smith recently returned to the Golden State after seven years in Chicago. Last year, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, organized a solo exhibition of her work, Give It or Leave It, which combined multi-channel video, found objects, and sound elements to explore four narratives tied to musician Alice Coltrane, religious activist Rebecca Cox Jackson, artist Noah Purifoy, and photographer Bill Ray. In addition to solo exhibitions at The Art Institute of Chicago and The Kitchen, Smith was featured in both the Whitney Biennial in New York and Prospect 4 in New Orleans in 2017. In advance of the opening of Give It or Leave It at the Markel Center at the VCU Institute for Contemporary Art in Richmond on February 16, I spoke with Smith about her recent work. Our conversation was conducted in writing in January 2019 and has been edited for publication.\nAmanda Dalla Villa Adams: When did you decide to pursue a multidisciplinary approach to art-making?\nCauleen Smith: The interdisciplinary nature of filmmaking has always kept me invested in it as a discipline. A film director, regardless of genre, must consider everything inside of the frame, from the figure to the texture of the walls, to the choreography of action, to ambient sound, to the color of light to rhythm and pacing. Each attempt at making a moving image is a new opportunity to think about all these things and what they might mean working in concert. When I’m working in an art space, I approach it the same as when I make a film, except that all the different disciplines get atomized into discrete materials and objects.\nADVA: Research is an important part of your practice: for Give It or Leave It, for example, you’ve researched the lives of figures including Sun Ra, Alice Coltrane, Noah Purifoy, and Rebecca Cox Jackson. How do research methods inform your work? How do you choose who and what to research?\nCS: Brilliant humans of the past have left us breadcrumbs so that we can build the futures we want and need. One of the things I love about contemporary art is the way it allows people who are earnestly concerned with the world to try to understand it through the idiosyncratic explorations of artists. If I am interested in a person or a place, I don’t have to make a factual travelogue documentary or biopic: I can use the things that person made to make new things that connect us to our pasts and speculate about possible futures—about who we want to be, and even what we want to leave behind.\nWhenever I make work, I am imagining a future audience, an audience that does not exist. And what I’ve learned by studying the work of individuals like Sun Ra and Alice Coltrane is that they too understood the ways in which they were building future worlds. They were devoted to mentoring young people. They built things and shared them. They are models, not just for what to make but how to live.\nWhen I’m researching a person or a place, I feel that I am having a conversation with their work, and like any good conversation, something emerges that you did not know or did not expect. In terms of deciding what to research, I guess curiosity, affinity, and affection are the first things, and then as I learn stuff, I start discovering interesting pockets of knowledge that feel generative, and then I pursue them. I also think about accountability and the difference between consuming a culture versus practicing a culture. Sometimes an interest sits around for years before I develop it into a project—the Shaker Gift Drawings, for example, I had no idea even why I liked them. It wasn’t until I read Alice Coltrane’s books and she described things that were in these drawings that I decided to formalize my relationship to that material and make it part of my work. And many things just remain stuff I like, stuff I appreciate, and never bloom into artworks or films.\nADVA: Can you also talk about your interest in jazz and music, especially as it relates to your video Space is the Place (A March for Sun Ra) (2011) and performance works?\nCS: Ah, well, another word for jazz music is creative music, and this term was coined in Chicago by the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians in the middle of the twentieth century by musicians who made their compositions through an improvisational process. In the dominant cultural understanding of the word improvise, people generally think of making things up, winging it, compensating for lack or preparation or for something going wrong. But in Black culture, improvisation is a high art discipline and signifies high achievement or mastery (forgive the gender bias) over one’s discipline. You cannot improvise or create in real time unless you have a very deep understanding of your craft. Film is a craft in which it is very difficult to improvise. But I’ve always wanted my work to have the power and the innovation of the great improvisers of the twentieth century, so how do we do that? I decided to try out creating situations and conditions in which a film would be made. So A March for Sun Ra was designed to be a carefully planned film shoot around a flash mob with five camera operators who then had to improvise in order to gather materials that I would then edit into a film. It worked. I keep trying to expand on this way of making. One of my greatest experiences as a filmmaker was watching the footage from five operators and seeing what they brought me—seeing what they saw, seeing how they responded to gorgeous, disciplined young people performing their hearts out in the rain. I was like, “Wow! Look at that shot…and that shot!” I provided the event, set up conditions and parameters, and then selected excellent collaborators. In this way, I am able to generate a kind of improvisational dynamism.\nADVA: You have said, “I actually think that art might be the only thing at this point. Not protesting, and not politics, but art may be the only thing that could actually create conversation and dialogue or reconciliation or mediation. Because politics has just completely failed us. What I hope my work is capable of is for individuals, it’s for just any one person. If there’s just enough of an opening in them that they think about themselves or the world or just think, and not even think differently, but just think for a moment. Just contemplate. Just open up a little bit, then I’ve done my job.”\nDo you consider your work to be a form of activism?\nCS: My understanding of activism is that it is tied to political concerns, tied to drawing attention to policy problems and attempting to use protest and grassroots organizing to create pressures that make policy changes that change political tides. Activism is—to my understanding—about the masses, it’s about creating mass consensus, it’s about influencing power. My work does none of those things. My work is connected to things that happen in the world, but politics, like art, is a discipline and a practice. I think if people better understood that, they would better understand their roles in both art and politics. As a citizen I have deeply vested concerns about political change and about how to make that happen. As an artist, I am dealing with individuals who are looking to learn something, experience something. I’m not trying to bludgeon people into conforming to an ideology, I’m trying to open them to their own hearts and minds and the hearts and minds of those around them, right next to them in the adjacent car, or at the grocery store.\nADVA: Ritual, religion, and spirituality seem important in Give It or Leave It, which weaves together images of the Shaker community, Simon Rodia’s construction of Watts Towers, and Alice Coltrane’s spiritual transformation, among others. How do you think a religious impulse might or might not inform your recent work?\nCS: Religion is the organization of spiritual practices and beliefs into cultural, political, and economic power bases. The work I make, regardless of the individuals I might research, has nothing to do with religion, but it does, like most art, depend greatly on the spirit.\nADVA: What are you reading right now or intending to read in the year ahead?\nCS: I’m trying to learn as much as I can about contemporary Indigenous life culture and practices in the United States and Canada. My Native American brothers and sisters are marginalized, silenced, and rendered invisible in contemporary life. America has never reckoned with the ways in which the founding of this country was dependent upon the genocide of Indigenous peoples. This country refuses to tell itself the truth about this. We need some truth and reconciliation. We need some serious atonement. And I personally need to not be so ignorant about the people whose land sustains me.\nEven more urgent for me is the fact that the languages and cultures of Indigenous peoples are have been systematically undermined. I’ve been trying to learn about Native American restorative justice practices. I’ve been thinking about the ways in which the language one speaks determines one’s understanding of the world. So in English about seventy percent of the words in our vocabulary are for people, places, and things. But in Anishinaabe languages, it’s my understanding (and I’m just still learning) that about seventy percent of words refer to beings. So water is a being, trees are beings, grasses are referred to as a being. Can you imagine our country if instead of eradicating this world view, we had studied it, incorporated it, and embraced it? Can you imagine? So that’s what I’m thinking about now. Imagining a country in which we are able to recognize the consciousness and life-force of everything around you, people, places, things all alive and all worthy of respect and consideration and love.\nCauleen Smith’s solo exhibition Give It or Leave It is on view at the Markel Center at the VCU Institute for Contemporary Art in Richmond from February 16 through May 5, 2019."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:50afeb40-f589-4e2a-82f8-47d8acaa205b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Ashoka tree bark and Dong Gui (Chinese Angelica) compare in their effects on women's reproductive health and menstrual disorders?","answer":"Both Ashoka tree bark and Dong Gui are used to treat menstrual disorders, but they have some distinct properties.

Although taking over-the-counter painkillers such as Advil may temporarily alleviate your pain, certain Chinese herbs have the ability to stop menstrual cramps in their tracks.\nDo painful period cramps plague you every month? You are not alone, as 50% of menstruating women have the same experience month after month. But why suffer when you could be living pain free? NSAIDs only mask the pain for a few short hours. Chinese herbal medicine, on the other hand, has been used for centuries with well-documented results. An international nonprofit organization, known as the Cochrane Collaboration, studied the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medicine in relieving menstrual pain compared to western drugs. Their conclusion: “Chinese herbal medicine for primary dysmenorrhea roughly doubled pain relief and improvement in overall symptoms compared with conventional Western pharmaceuticals,” reported Xiaoshu Zhu.1\nHere are a few common Chinese herbs used for painful menstrual cramps:\n1. Dong Gui (Chinese Angelica or Angelica Sinensis)\nThis herb is also known as the \"female ginseng,\" and is commonly used to regulate the menstrual cycle and relieve menstrual cramps. It also helps to relieve menopausal symptoms, reduce PMS and anemia and to re-establish a menstrual cycle after cessation of birth control pills. It is commonly sold as a single herb tea, bagged or loose. Dong Gui is caterogized as a king herb (premier herb) in Chinese gynecological disease because of its ability to harmonize the blood in Chinese medicine. Dong Gui is also considered antispasmodic. The coumarin chemicals present in this herb may help dilate blood vessels and relax the smooth muscles of the uterus, thus relieving menstrual cramping.\n2. Chuan Xiong (Chuanxiong Rhizoma)\nThis herb can help relieve pain, improve blood circulation, and promote the flow of \"qi\" or vital energy. Chinese women, dating back to the Song Dynasty, used to take this Chinese herb in the form of soup. The soup is called a Four Substance Decoction and includes three other herbs: angelica, red peony and Chinese foxglove. The soup and tea are still used today as a blood tonic to relieve PMS, stop menstrual pain and improve overall health, especially after giving birth.\n3. Bai Shao (White Peony Root)\nWhite Peony Root nourishes the blood and improves circulation. It is also used for a wide variety of gynecological problems. The peony root is considered a liver tonic in Chinese medicine. By strengthening the liver, it helps to increase the efficiency of protein and fat metabolism, thus inhibiting the excessive synthesis of prostaglandins that may cause an over-active uterus and endometrial pain.\n4. Yi Mu Cao (Chinese Motherwort)\nLeaves from this herb are used to treat menstrual problems. They have been shown to improve blood circulation and clear blood clots that occur in menstrual disorders and after childbirth. The leaves also promote diuresis and relieve edema. Studies on the alkaloid leonurine showed that this substance stimulates the uterus of rabbits, cats, dogs and guinea pigs.2\n5. Yan Hu Suo (Corydalis Rhizome)\nThis Chinese herb has the ability to strengthen blood circulation and to relieve pain. In conjunction with chuan xiong, it is known to help both body aches and headaches. Corydalis is related to the opium poppy. Although only 1% in strength compared to opium, it is a very effective pain reliever. The active chemical constituent di- tetrahydropalmatine (THP) is a neuroactive alkaloid with analgesic action that relieves cramping pain.\nGroups of Chinese herbs, also known as formulas, are more beneficial than single herb remedies because the herbs work synergistically for conditions such as menstrual cramps. The Cochran study also stated that: “The herbal remedies were also significantly better at relieving painful cramps and other symptoms than acupuncture or a hot water bottle, with overall promising findings… Chinese herbs overall, whether standardized or tailored, yielded better pain relief than conventional pharmaceutical therapies.”\nChinese herbal medicine can be a bit intimidating when you don’t know anything about these herbs, and the five herbs above are only a few of the herbs beneficial for menstrual cramps in the Chinese herbal encyclopedias. Asian pharmacies sell prescriptions of herbal teas and pills daily, and Asian cultures have used herbs successfully for hundreds of years. By replacing NSAIDs with Chinese herbs, women receive an additional benefit of avoiding the nasty NSAID3 side effects such as upset stomach, heartburn, ulcers and rashes, and liver damage, to name a few. Women don’t need to suffer month after month. You can use Chinese herb supplements to be pain free and PMS symptom free all month long.\nPrimary source: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews\nSource; Zhu X, et al \"Chinese herbal medicine for primary dysmenorrhoea\" Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2007;3: CD005288.\n1.

{"question":"What common symptoms do both encephalopathy and Huntington's disease share in terms of movement and cognitive changes?","answer":"Both conditions share several symptoms affecting movement and cognition. These include involuntary movements or muscle twitching, cognitive decline, personality changes, and difficulty concentrating. Both can also cause problems with coordination and speech. However, in Huntington's disease, the involuntary movements specifically develop into chorea (jerking or twitching movements), while encephalopathy's movement symptoms can vary depending on the underlying cause.","context":["What to Know About Encephalopathy\nEarly treatment of many types of encephalopathy can bring significant improvement, including curing the disease completely.\nThis article explains encephalopathy in further detail and goes over its symptoms, causes, and treatment.\nEncephalopathy is an umbrella term for diseases, disorders, and malfunctions that specifically target the brain. It presents primarily as an altered mental state.\nAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), some types of encephalopathy can cause a gradual loss of memory and cognitive ability. Others can also cause personality changes and an inability to concentrate.\nTypes of encephalopathy\nThere are two main types of encephalopathy: reversible encephalopathy and irreversible encephalopathy.\nReversible encephalopathy, as the name suggests, is encephalopathy that is curable. Examples include metabolic problems and brain tumors.\nIrreversible encephalopathy, on the other hand, is permanent and untreatable. Examples include chronic traumatic encephalopathy and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.\nEncephalopathy can arise from a wide variety of medical conditions and physical injuries.\nHere are some of the most common causes:\n- Hashimoto’s encephalopathy: This is a rare disorder that occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid. The thyroid is a gland that produces growth-regulating substances for the body.\n- Brain tumor: This is the growth of unhealthy cells in the brain. One of the main risk factors for brain tumors is long-term exposure to X-ray radiation.\n- Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a nervous system disorder that occurs when toxins the liver is unable to remove accumulate in the brain. It can occur in people who have cirrhosis and in those who have taken an overdose of acetaminophen or other similar drugs.\n- Toxic metabolic encephalopathy: This is a brain dysfunction that results from a chemical imbalance in the blood. It commonly occurs with serious diseases such as diabetes, liver disease, and kidney failure.\n- Uremic encephalopathy: This is a brain disorder that results from acute or chronic kidney failure. It causes an accumulation of toxins in the blood.\n- Glycine encephalopathy: This is an inherited disease characterized by an excess of the amino acid glycine in the brain. It occurs when there is not enough enzyme to break up glycine in the body.\n- Brain infections: These occur when viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites attack the brain and cause inflammation. The most common types of brain infections are encephalitis and meningitis.\n- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy: This is a degenerative brain condition that results from repeated trauma to the head. It is generally associated with contact sports, such as boxing and football.\n- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy: This is a brain dysfunction that occurs when the oxygen supply to the brain stops temporarily. It can occur with carbon monoxide poisoning, drug overdose, or near-drowning.\nSymptoms of encephalopathy vary depending on the underlying cause. However, most people with the condition experience:\n- memory loss\n- personality changes\n- involuntary muscle twitching\n- involuntary eye movement\nSome people may also experience:\n- difficulty concentrating\n- speech problems\n- muscle atrophy and weakness\n- difficulty swallowing\nYou should seek medical advice if you are experiencing any of the above symptoms, particularly if they are severe. Severe symptoms include personality changes, speech problems, involuntary movements, or seizures.\nTo make a diagnosis, your doctor may perform lab tests, such as:\n- Blood tests: These can measure the levels of toxins in the blood. They can also detect infections.\n- Spinal fluid exam: This looks for toxins, viruses, and infections such as encephalitis and meningitis.\n- CT or MRI scan: This can look for signs of brain swelling and brain tumors.\n- Electroencephalogram (EEG) test: This measures electrical activity in the brain.\nAccording to the NINDS, treatment for encephalopathy depends on the type and severity of the condition.\nBecause of this, your doctor will need to identify the underlying cause before administering treatment. In the case of seizures, your doctor may prescribe anticonvulsants.\nYour doctor may also recommend dietary changes and nutritional supplements to slow the damage to your brain. In some cases, a person with encephalopathy may also require dialysis or organ replacement surgery.\nThe outlook for encephalopathy varies depending on the type.\nA 2021 study that sampled 188 people with hepatic encephalopathy found the probability of survival to be around 44% and 35%. This was at 12 and 24 months, respectively.\nOverall, encephalopathy, in all its forms, is a very serious condition. However, in many cases, it is still survivable if treated promptly and effectively.\nEncephalopathy has the potential to cause severe complications, such as:\n- loss of consciousness or coma\n- permanent brain damage or loss of life\n- heart failure\n- blood poisoning\n- hearing loss\nGetting prompt and effective treatment may help you avoid these complications.\nYou can reduce your risk of encephalopathy by adopting a healthy lifestyle. You can start by:\n- eating a healthy diet\n- reducing your exposure to X-ray radiation and toxic substances\n- avoiding alcohol\nEncephalopathy refers to any condition that interferes with the regular functioning of the brain. It can be reversible or irreversible. It can also be acquired or inherited.\nCommon examples include Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, brain tumor, hepatic encephalopathy, and toxic metabolic encephalopathy.\nMany people with encephalopathy experience memory loss, subtle personality changes, and involuntary muscle twitching. Others also experience seizures and tiredness.\nEarly treatment of many types of encephalopathy can result in considerable improvement, including a complete alleviation of symptoms. Be sure to seek early treatment if you feel you have this condition.","Feeling confused or overwhelmed about Huntington's disease? You are not alone.\nThe Huntington's Disease Foundation is here to help you in any way we can. We are expanding our reach and programs and will be adding new information to the web site.\nPlease remember that this information is a brief overview and is for educational purposes only. It is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult your health care provider with any questions you may have regarding your specific medical condition.\nWhat is Huntington's Disease (HD)?\nHuntington disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability (cognition). Adult-onset Huntington disease, the most common form of this disorder, usually appears in a person's thirties or forties. Early signs and symptoms can include irritability, depression, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many people with Huntington disease develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may have trouble walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with this disorder also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. Individuals with the adult-onset form of Huntington disease usually live about 15 to 20 years after signs and symptoms begin.\nA less common form of Huntington disease known as the juvenile form begins in childhood or adolescence. It also involves movement problems and mental and emotional changes. Additional signs of the juvenile form include slow movements, clumsiness, frequent falling, rigidity, slurred speech, and drooling. School performance declines as thinking and reasoning abilities become impaired. Seizures occur in 30 percent to 50 percent of children with this condition. Juvenile Huntington disease tends to progress more quickly than the adult-onset form; affected individuals usually live 10 to 15 years after signs and symptoms appear.\nThe Genetic Cause of HD\nHD is caused by mutation in a gene located on chromosome 4. This gene is found in every human being, and contains a CAG repeat sequence. We have not yet discovered the gene's normal function. In a case of HD, the gene contains an abnormally large number of CAG repeats. The larger the number of triplet repeats, generally speaking, the earlier in life one will develop HD. Furthermore, when the gene is passed from father to child (but not when passed from mother to child) the gene may lengthen even more, resulting in an earlier age of onset for the disease. This phenomenon is known as anticipation.\nGenes for diseases can be either dominant or recessive. The gene for HD is dominant. Each child of an affected parent has a 50/50 chance of getting the mutant gene, and therefore has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. On the other hand, if people with a parent suffering from HD do not inherit the mutant gene, they cannot pass it on to anyone else.\nWhat genes are related to Huntington disease?\nMutations in the HTT gene cause Huntington disease. The HTT gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. Although the function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.\nThe HTT mutation that causes Huntington disease involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 10 to 35 times within the gene. In people with Huntington disease, the CAG segment is repeated 36 to more than 120 times. People with 36 to 39 CAG repeats may or may not develop the signs and symptoms of Huntington disease, while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop the disorder.\nAn increase in the size of the CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein. The elongated protein is cut into smaller, toxic fragments that bind together and accumulate in neurons, disrupting the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of Huntington disease.\nHow common is Huntington disease?\nHuntington disease affects an estimated 3 to 7 per 100,000 people of European ancestry. The disorder appears to be less common in some other populations, including people of Japanese, Chinese, and African descent.\nHow do people inherit Huntington disease?\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. An affected person usually inherits the altered gene from one affected parent. In rare cases, an individual with Huntington disease does not have a parent with the disorder.\nAs the altered HTT gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases in size. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. This phenomenon is called anticipation. People with the adult-onset form of Huntington disease typically have 40 to 50 CAG repeats in the HTT gene, while people with the juvenile form of the disorder tend to have more than 60 CAG repeats.\nIndividuals who have 27 to 35 CAG repeats in the HTT gene do not develop Huntington disease, but they are at risk of having children who will develop the disorder. As the gene is passed from parent to child, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat may lengthen into the range associated with Huntington disease (36 repeats or more).\nImportant Information About HD Testing\nIt is important to understand that while people are born with the mutated gene for HD, in most cases they will not develop the symptoms until later in life. Therefore someone can be without symptoms or presymptomatic for a number of years. In the past, there was no way to test for the abnormal gene, but now a blood test can determine whether or not an individual carries the gene for HD. This test can be used in cases of suspected HD, to confirm the diagnosis, or it can be used as a predictive test in individuals who are at risk for HD. People who are at risk may want to undergo predictive testing in order to put their minds at ease, to plan for their medical needs, or prior to having children. The decision to have such a test is a momentous one and should not be taken lightly. Most centers that do predictive testing, require a period of counseling before and after the test.\nWhat Are the Characteristics of HD?\nOnset is usually in mid-life, but can occur any time from childhood to old age. The initial signs of this disorder may be subtle. HD is characterized by a movement disorder, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. Additional characteristics of HD include personality changes, weight loss (probably from a combination of difficulty eating, and calories burned by the involuntary movements), difficulty swallowing, and hard-to-understand speech.\nThe Course of HD\nOnce an individual develops signs of HD the course of the disease can last anywhere from ten to thirty years. Typically, the course of HD can be roughly divided into three stages.\nEarly Stage:In this stage patients can still perform most of their usual activities. They may still be working and may still be able to drive. Involuntary movements are mild and infrequent, speech is still clear, and dementia, if present at all, is mild.\nMiddle Stage:At this stage patients are more disabled and may need assistance with some of their activities of daily living. Falls, weight loss, and swallowing difficulties may become a problem. Dementia is more obvious to the casual observer. Involuntary movements are more pronounced.\nLate Stage:Patients entering this stage of the disease require almost total care and may reside in hospitals or nursing homes, although some remain at home. They may no longer be able to walk or speak. They may be more rigid now and show fewer involuntary movements. Individuals in this stage may or may not be able to swallow food. At this stage most patients do not seem to suffer much as they are apparently unaware of their surroundings. When the patient passes away, the cause of death is usually related to malnutrition, pneumonia, or heart failure.\nWhat Treatments Are Available?\nAt this time, there is no cure for HD. Researchers are working on a number of treatments that may slow down the progression of the disease. There are a number of interventions available today that improve the quality of life for HD sufferers. In the early and middle stages of the disease, medications can be given in small doses to HD patients to help suppress the involuntary movements. Depression and other psychiatric conditions in people with HD can be quite effectively treated. Proper nutrition, exercise and precautions in the home can help minimize many of the potential consequences of HD such as weight loss, falls, and choking on food. Finally contact with other HD sufferers, family members, and care-providers can be a vital source of support for HD patients and their families.\nPeople with HD should discuss their concerns and wishes about treatments/interventions (e.g. feeding tubes, resuscitation requests) and autopsies with their families and doctors while they are still able to speak for themselves."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:309f6bd0-ad91-4220-a567-bae701ea4341>","<urn:uuid:84b729b4-0f1c-47cd-b48f-439fcd5a7620>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the architectural styles of the Saint Michael and Saint George Palace in Corfu with the Temple of Apollo Epicurius, highlighting their unique design elements and historical significance? Please provide a detailed analysis.","answer":"The Saint Michael and Saint George Palace and the Temple of Apollo Epicurius represent distinct architectural traditions. The Palace, built between 1819-1824, is the only example of Georgian architecture in the Mediterranean, featuring a Doric arcade on the facade and decorative bas-reliefs of the seven Ionian islands. It includes ionic columns, Corinthian columns, and three distinctive halls on the ground floor. In contrast, the Temple of Apollo Epicurius, built between 420-400 BC, combines both archaic and innovative elements. Its exterior strictly follows the Doric order, while its interior features Corinthian elements, including the oldest surviving Corinthian capital. The temple was uniquely designed to incorporate natural light, with its central column possibly aligned to reflect the summer solstice's first rays. Both structures demonstrate careful consideration of their surroundings - the temple uses local grey limestone to blend with its environment, while the Palace was constructed with tufo from Malta.","context":["THE BUILDINGS OF THE OLD TOWN\nWalking in the old city of Corfu you can admire different buildings interesting from an historical, cultural and architectural point of view.\nSAINT MICHAEL AND SAINT GEORGE PALACE\nThis palace, projected by colonel G. Whithmore, was realized with tufo of Malta between 1819 and 1824 and it’s the only example of Georgian architecture in all Mediterranean.\nAt the beginning was the mansion of the British Governor Sir T. Maitland, then became the summer residence of the Greek Royal Family and recently was restored with a view to the European Union Summit (1994).\nIn the past it was the seat of the Order of Knights of Saint George and Saint Michael, from which the palace takes his name, and then the seat of the Ionian Republic Senate.\nToday inside the palace there are the Museum of Asian Art, the council art gallery and the Department of Classical Antiquities of Corfu.\nFrom the architectonic point of view the Palace of Saint Michael and Saint George is characterized by Doric arcade on the facade and bas-reliefs representing the seven Ionian islands along the length of the ledge.\nCorfu is symbolized by a ship, Paxi by a trident, Kitira by Aphrodite with a dolphin and the other islands by the faces of their heroes.\nAll these bas-reliefs were created by Paul Prosalentis.\nOn the ends of the palace there are two arches, on the left there is Saint George arch, under which cars can pass to reach the old port, while on the right there is Saint Michael arch that leads to an inner garden.\nIn front of this neoclassical palace there are a garden and a fountain that has in the middle the bronze statue of Sir Frederick Adam, the man who supervised the construction of the aqueduct in the city.\nInside the palace there are a wonderful hall decorated with ionic columns and frescoes with scenes of Odissea and a splendid stairs that brings to the antechamber of the first floor decorated with Corinthian columns.\nOn the ground floor there are three halls: the ballroom that is round, the Throne Hall and the banquets hall.\nThere are also on the first floor the Museum of Asian Art, in the east wing an art gallery with works of Corfiots artists of XIX century and also temporary exhibitions, a municipal library and a coffee bar with on the walls maps of great historical and artistic value.\nThe Liston is an arched stone colonnade in front of the Spianada.\nIt is the heart of the diurnal and nocturnal life of the old town and beyond the tourists it is also full of Corfiots that come here to drink a coffee and to meet friends.\nUnder the portico there are a lot of nice restaurants and different snack bars to drink a coffee or an aperitif in a beautiful setting.\nMathieu de Lesseps devised and constructed the Liston during the French domination (1807-1814) modelled on the Rue de Rivoli that is a famous road of Paris.\nIt was completed during the British Protectorate (1815-1864).\nThe Liston is constituted of two adjacent buildings with a long covered walk that overlooks a wide and paved road.\nFrom the Liston you can admire the garden of the Spianada where Corfiots play cricket and, during the Easter, it becomes a place important for the procession in honour of the Saint patron.\nThe municipal building is situated in Voulgareos road and overlooks one of the most beautiful public squares of the old town that in the past was the heart of the Corfu life.\nOriginally the Town hall was the Lodge of the Nobles and today it’s the only building that has walls covered with carved stone of Sinies.\nIts construction began in 1663 and went on for thirty years.\nThis building changed several times its use, from society of the nobles became in 1720 the lyric theatre “Saint James” (from the name of the catholic church that is in this square) and then in 1903 was added a floor and became the municipal building of Corfu.\nFrom the architectonic point of view it shows, on the facade and on the back, stone decorations representing masks, historical engravings and other symbols like the emblem of the island (a boat).\nOn one side of the building there are the mutilated bust of the admiral F. Morosini, the description of his enterprises and also four children around him who symbolize his virtues.\nThe bust was mutilated due to the wicked bombing of 1687 ordered by the admiral.\nThe Ionian Parliament was constructed by Ioanni Chroni in 1855 and it’s situated in Mustoxidi road.\nThis is a neoclassical building characterized by a Doric arcade in the front and engravings in Greek and English on the two sides.\nThe inscriptions remember the proclamation of the Ionian Islands annexation to the Greece that has been voted just in this building in 1864. After the annexation, the State donated this building that before became a protestant church and later, in 1978, was restored and turned into a Museum dedicated to the freedom fighters of the Ionian Islands.\nThis building date back to XVIII century and in origin it was a Venetian barracks called “Grimani”.\nIn the following century and to be precise in 1824 it became the seat of the Ionian Academy and later, after the unification of the Ionian Islands with Greece, became the municipal Library.\nThe Ionian Academy was known in all Greece as the centre of a literary rebirth with the head of the poets Solomos and Mavilis.\nIn 1943 the building was partially destroyed from Italian bombing but it was soon restructured.\nCurrently it’s the seat of Rectorate of the Ionian University, that is the only university in all the Ionian Islands.\nThe building where Capodistria family lived, that is an excellent example of neoclassical architecture, it’s situated in Arsenio street and it was built under the English domination.\nIt was designed by I. Chroni who planned also the Ionian Parliament and it was used as seat by the President of the Ionian Senate.\nIoanni Kapodistrias, the future first President of Greece, was born in 1776 just in this building and here he lived for many years.\nHis family owned this building from generations and donated it to the State to be used before as Prefecture and Prefect’s mansion and then as seat of the Ionian University’s.","Apollo Epicurius - the architecture of the divine\nIn the central Peloponnese, at Vasses in ancient Figaleia, at an elevation of 1.130 metres, stands the eternally proud temple of Apollo Epicurius. The inspiration behind its construction and the architect is considered to be the great Ictinus. This universal architectural gem was the first of the great monuments of Greece to be recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1986. The temple can be approached from Ilia, after an enchanting journey along the banks of the river Neda, or from Tripoli and Megalopolis.\nVasses (ancient Bassae) was always a sacred place, host to numerous temples. The region’s name means \"little valleys\". And indeed, the mountainous Peloponnesian land creates a magical landscape and within it rises the imposing site of the temple. The mountains of Kotylio, Lykaio, Tetrazio and Elaio stand guard around the valley of Vasses. All the gods of antiquity - Pan, Aphrodite, Artemis, and of course, Apollo, as both ‘Vassitas’ and ‘Epicurius’, that is, “the helper” - were worshipped in this natural sanctuary, and it was here that one of the greatest religious centres of the entire of Hellenic world was to be erected.\nPower, Beauty and Harmony\nThe temple in its current form was built between 420 and 400 BC. Archaeologists are convinced that under its foundations lies an even more ancient temple, probably from the seventh century BC. This “new” temple, a unique monument to the skills of its architect, Ictinus, embodies in its structure the entire wealth of architectural knowledge of Greek civilization. With both archaic and innovatory elements, it has been greatly admired by all visiting travellers through the centuries. Pausanias, the great traveller and geographer, who arrived in Vasses in the 2nd century AD, was stunned by its majesty and strength. It is speculated that the central column of the temple was designed to reflect the first rays of the summer solstice, symbolizing the eternal light of the sun god, Apollo. If this is true, then this is the first large scale sculptural work of art in the history of mankind to represent an abstract concept.\nWhen man created the divine\nIctinus made an extensive study of the surrounding area when he undertook the building of the temple. He preferred to use grey limestone for construction, which is endemic to the site. This choice had the result of making the temple appear as a natural element of its surrounding environment, standing proud and eternal. The proportions of length and width are such that the enormous size of the temple is balanced by the grace it exudes. Light itself is used by the great artist as one of the building blocks of the temple. The play of light and shadow creates the illusion that the temple is smaller than its actual size, revealing its true dimensions to the observer only gradually as they draw near. In this way the monument does not force or impose its volume on the space, but exudes power and inspires awe when one is close to it. At the same time, it creates an evolving relationship with the god himself, Apollo, with light being the main element in this gradual revelation.\nThe outer elements of the temple are strictly of Doric order. Inside the temple the sculptural compositions and architectural ornamentation display exquisite artistry and beauty. The central column, which presides over the temple, is Corinthian and its capital is the oldest surviving example of the order. The monumental temple frieze, of great historical and artistic value, which depicts Hercules, the Centaurs and the Amazons, is today to be found in the British Museum.\nThe temple was in use throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods. In 1765, guided by the writings of Pausanias, the French architect Joachim Bocher was able to identify certain finds as coming from the great Temple of Apollo. The first systematic excavations were started in 1812 by a group of eminent European archaeologists. They were continued in 1902 by the Archaeological Society of Athens, under the supervision of the archaeologists Constantinos Kourouniotis, Constantinos Romaios and Panagiotis Kavvadias. Thus, this brilliant achievement of Greek civilization was given back to humanity once again in all its glory."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8f2a5f80-274c-4c35-b820-9387b4f826f9>","<urn:uuid:42cc3a02-6529-484e-b567-db10902a3ec8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When and in what formats was The Abyssinian Mass released?","answer":"The Abyssinian Mass was released on March 18, 2016, in CD and MP3 formats. It was released as a two-CD, DVD package that was beautifully packaged and included liner notes and color photographs from the piece's 2013 tour.","context":["Title: The Abyssinian Mass\nArtist: Jazz at Lincoln Center with Wynton Marsalis (featuring Damien Sneed and Chorale Le Chateau)\nLabel: Blue Engine Records\nFormats: CD, MP3\nRelease date: March 18, 2016\nIs jazz sacred or secular music? Some folks argue that the secular nature of jazz is undeniable, even positioning it as “the sound of modernity.” Others point to the music’s roots in the Black church as a sacred component of the art form.\nTo this belabored question, Wynton Marsalis has provided an answer, contemporary and clear: jazz is inseparable from the Black Christian experience. The trumpeter, bandleader, composer, and nine-time Grammy winner makes his point through his ambitious and well-funded project, The Abyssinian Mass. This two-CD, DVD package began as Marsalis was commissioned to write a piece in celebration of Abyssinian Baptist Church’s 200th anniversary. The church is an historic African American institution in Harlem, whose past proves Marsalis’ argument: Fats Waller’s father was a minister of the Baptist church and the funeral for the “Father of the Blues,” W.C. Handy, was held at Abyssinian.\nBringing together the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra (JALC), Chorale Le Chateau, and Abyssinian’s pastor, Rev. Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, the work mixes gospel and jazz, big band and choir, while it leads listeners through a long-composed form inspired by the Black Baptist Church. Rev. Dr. Butts describes this deep, contemporary dialog between two pillars of Black traditions—jazz and the Black Church—as “a cosmopolitan approach to faith.”\nWhile Marsalis has certainly reached cosmopolitan status through his career, he draws deeply upon his experience as a youngster in New Orleans, upbringing in the Black church, and knowledge of African American history to inform his compositions. In the project’s accompanying DVD, Marsalis narrates the music as it is performed, giving listeners a “director’s cut” version of the compositions. In the video below, Marsalis details his thought process for “Devotional,” the first song of the album’s spiritual experience.\nIn this context, Marsalis’ genius is on display: for him, music is not just notes and rhythms, but is a rich metaphorical wellspring, which he draws on readily and with a child-like enthusiasm, when composing and improvising.\nAt times, Marsalis has been accused of being a jazz traditionalist and museumifying the art form. But in the case of The Abyssinian Mass, Marsalis’ vision is a perfect theoretical fit. Many of the musicians he has selected for the JALC Orchestra have direct experience in the Black church and hail from areas of the Southern United States that serve to authenticate the project. The Chorale Le Chateau, led by Georgia-native and African American Damien Sneed, is comfortable in gospel and classical music, which complements the Orchestra’s musicality and professionalism. It is not a stretch for these musicians to find jazz in the church, and the church in jazz.\nIn practice, this professionalism denies the opportunity for musical magic, or the moments when musical risks reap unexpected benefits. Said another way: The Abyssinian Mass’ brilliance lies in its design, rather than its exacting performance.\nOn the other hand, the professionalism of the album’s packaging does not go unnoticed. In a time of where physical CD releases are staring hard at their demise, The Abyssinian Mass is a brave box-set: the release is beautifully-packaged, features provocative liner notes from Leon Weiseltier, and dazzling display of color photographs from the piece’s 2013 tour. Online, one can find videos of this tour, each spotlighting a different member of the JALC Orchestra or the Chorale Le Chateau and produced with a restrained flair.\nThe Abyssinian Mass is not a work to be digested quickly. It is a musical tome for a historic African American institution, led by one of the leading African American musicians of our time. In his effort to bring together profound strands of the Black experience, Marsalis has found fertile ground for musical inspiration, deep pockets to realize his vision, and incorporated his trademark stylistic approach. The results are worthy of blessings from the Patron Saint of cosmopolitans.\nReviewed by Douglas Dowling Peach"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4bcc3774-9b22-4413-ac33-a7ea60f9c4d6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the advantages of raised bed gardens for plant growth, and what considerations should be made regarding water stress in these gardens?","answer":"Raised bed gardens offer several key advantages for plant growth: they warm more quickly in spring allowing earlier planting, provide better drainage, prevent soil compaction, and allow easy soil customization for specific plants. Additionally, they require less maintenance than conventional garden beds after initial construction. Regarding water stress, while raised beds tend to drain faster than conventional beds, proper bed preparation is essential. Adding soil amendments like compost helps improve soil structure and balance between water and air. Most situations will require some watering during the growing season, and it's important to note that overwatering problems typically occur from too frequent irrigations rather than excessive water in a single application. Even drought-tolerant plants need sufficient water during their establishment period to develop deep roots.","context":["Raised bed gardens are the saviors of gardeners with poor soil everywhere. The basic idea of a raised bed is that instead of battling against poor soil conditions, you build above ground, where you have absolute control over the soil texture and ingredients.\nWhat is a Raised Bed Garden?\nA raised bed garden is a garden built on top of your native soil, sometimes incorporating native soil, sometimes not.\nThese gardens can be contained, such as when you build a wood or stone structure to keep the bed intact, or they can be more free form, with soil and amendments merely piled several inches high. You can plant anything from herbs and vegetables to perennials and shrubs in a raised bed.\nAdvantages of a Raised Bed Garden\nAside from avoiding the issue of gardening in poor soil, raised beds offer several advantages:\n- They warm more quickly in spring, allowing you to work the soil and plant earlier.\n- they drain better.\n- The soil in raised beds doesn't get compacted, because they are constructed with accessibility in mind.\n- It's easy to tailor the soil for your raised bed to the plants you plan to grow there.\n- After the initial construction process, less maintenance is required than there is for conventional garden beds.\nHow to Make a Raised Bed Garden\nContained raised beds are the most popular type, and they're great for vegetable and herb gardens, as well as flower gardens.\nFruits, such as strawberries, grapes, blueberries, and raspberries, also do very well in a this type of bed.\nYou can choose from a variety of materials to construct your frame. Wood is a very popular choice, because it is easy to work with and it is inexpensive. Concrete blocks, natural stone, or brick are also nice options, but there is definitely an added expense and labor to consider in using them.\nSome gardeners go the ultra-simple route, and simply place bales of hay or straw in whatever configuration they desire, then fill it with good soil and compost and plant it up. This solution will only give you a year or so of use, because the straw will decompose, but it's worth trying if you don't mind replacing the bales yearly, or if you're still developing a more permanent solution.\nSince most contained raised beds are constructed from wood, here are instructions for building your own wood raised bed garden.\nStep One: Select your site. If you know that you'll be growing vegetables or herbs, or sun-loving flowers in your new garden, select a site that gets at least eight hours of sun per day. A flat, level area is important, and you should also make sure that the area has easy access to water sources as well as room for you to work.\nStep Two: Determine the size and shape of your garden. Make sure that you can access all parts of the garden without stepping into the bed. One of the main advantages of a raised bed is that the soil doesn't get compacted the way it might in a conventional bed because they are planned for accessibility. It is a good idea to keep the garden to around four feet wide, because this way you can access the middle of the bed from either side.\nIf you're placing your bed against a wall or fence, it should be no more than three feet wide. Any length you like will work, as long as you keep the width in control. In terms of depth, six inches is a good start, and many vegetables grow well in a bed that is six inches deep. As with many things, though, if you can do more, more is better! Ten to twelve inches would be ideal. If you have decent subsoil (not too clayey or rocky) you can simply loosen the soil with a garden fork and build a six to eight inch deep bed. If your soil is bad, or you are planning to grow crops like carrots or parsnips that need a deeper soil, your bed should be at least ten inches deep.\nStep Three: Prep Your Site. Once you know the size and shape of your bed, you can get to work prepping the site. How much prep you will have to do is determined by the depth of the bed you're planning, as well as the plants you're planning to grow there.\nIf you are planning a vegetable or herb garden, a six-inch deep bed is perfect. To save yourself some labor, you can use newspaper, landscape fabric, or cardboard to cover and smother it, then put your soil and amendments right on top. However, to ensure that your plant's roots have plenty of room to grow, it is a good idea to dig out the existing sod and loosen the soil with a shovel or garden fork to a depth of eight to twelve inches.\nStep Four: Construct the Bed. Using rot-resistant lumber such as cedar or one of the newer composite lumbers, construct your bed. Two by six lumber is perfect, as it is easy to work with and will give you six inches of depth. Cut your pieces to the desired size, then attach them together to make a simple frame. You can attach them in a variety of ways. You can make a simple butt joint at each corner, pre-drilling and then screwing the corners together with galvanized screws. You can use a small piece of wood in the corner,and attach each side to it.\nStep Five: Level Your Frames. Using a level, make sure your frame is level in all directions. This is a necessary step because if your bed is not level, you will have a situation where water runs off of one part of the garden and sits in another. If part of your frame is high, just remove some of the soil beneath it until you have a level frame.\nStep Six: Fill Your Garden. The whole point of a raised bed garden is that it gives you the opportunity to garden in perfect soil. Take this opportunity to fill your bed with a good mixture of quality topsoil, compost, and rotted manure. Once they're filled and raked level, you're ready to plant or sow seeds.\nMaintaining a Raised Bed Garden\nHappily, raised beds require very little maintenance. Each spring or fall, it's a good idea to top dress with fresh compost and manure, or, if your bed only holds plants for part of the year, go ahead and dig the compost or manure into the top several inches of soil. As with any garden, mulching the top of the soil will help retain moisture and keep weeds down.\nMoisture retention is important, because raised beds tend to drain faster than conventional beds.","Not many plants will look good, grow actively and flower heavily from spring to fall. Some like it cool and some like it warm. Seasonal variation in temperature will limit their usefulness as well as where they are placed in the garden. Cool season flowers such as dianthus, snapdragon, pansies, Virginia bluebells, and primrose prefer the spring and fall or a spot where they can be protected and shaded from direct sun from about noon to 4 p.m. Planting in protected locations helps to extend the useful bloom time for these plants.\nHeat-loving plants such as melampodium, portulaca, yarrow, sedum and verbena like it warm and dry for best performance. Heat tolerance is a very valuable characteristic for plants being grown in midwestern gardens.\nLight and temperature are closely related. Plants that prefer lower light may tolerate more sun if the temperatures are cooler and if moisture is in good supply. When evaluating light exposure, note how much and at what intensity of light the site receives. Four hours of full sun in the morning are cooler than four hours of full sun in the afternoon. In a shaded location, the degree of light getting to the plants can vary. In general, if a site receives more than three hours of unfiltered mid-day sun, it is probably best treated as a full-sun site and plants should be selected accordingly.\nPartial sun can be thought of as a site that gets unfiltered morning sun but shaded during the afternoon hours or \"dappled\" shade throughout the day. Areas in deep shade receive very little direct mid-day light and less than 60 percent of the sun's intensity during the remainder of the day. Mismatching plant light preferences with actual light conditions can lead to a reduction in flowering, tall, leggy growth, stunting of plants, or leaf scorching.\nWater stress can go from areas that remain wet and damp to areas that are drought prone — even in the same landscape and often in close proximity to one another. Bed preparation is essential for avoiding moisture excess or drought conditions.\nFor most situations, some watering may be needed at some point during the growing season. For sites where soils are dry or where irrigation is going to be minimal, choose plants that are drought-tolerant. Keep in mind that even drought-tolerant plants will need a period of establishment with sufficient water to get them deeply rooted in the soil, so they can successfully handle drier conditions. The best insurance against excessive moisture is proper bed preparation coupled with either drain tile or the construction of raised beds.\nPlant choices can be made based upon the plant’s ability to tolerate wet soils or even flooded conditions.\nA majority of overwatering problems, assuming a well prepared site, occurs from too frequent irrigations rather than from too much water applied at any one time.\nShaded dry soil creates a difficult site for plants to grow in. It is especially important to understand that dry shade, such as under a heavy tree canopy, imposes a number of stresses that only a select group of plants can adapt to. Plant selection is important when working with these conditions. Keep in mind that plants for dry shade will be successful if given proper conditions to get well established.\nPlants depend on the soil for support, moisture and nutrients. Heavy rains or frequent irrigation in combination with poorly drained beds reduces plant performance and increases the chance for loss due to root disease. On the other hand, beds that have excellent drainage may have little water holding capacity and require frequent watering to maintain plants. Improving the water holding capacity coupled with drought tolerant plants make gardening in these sites more enjoyable. Adding soil amendments such as compost aids in improving soil structure and the critical balance between water and air in the soil. Both are all important elements for good root growth, which leads to successful plant growth. No one thing is more important in reducing stress to plants than proper bed preparation prior to planting.\nWhen looking for plants to fit the conditions of a particular site, there are many choices. When you want to expand your plant palette beyond impatiens and petunias, some of the choices may not be familiar. The directory that follows offers some familiar along with some overlooked but very useful garden plants. This listing does not intend to be a complete list of species or cultivars available. There are many more in the market place. These examples include plants suitable or tolerant of some challenging gardening locations such as dry to moist shade, sunny, dry conditions as well as wet sites.

{"question":"What are the power generation limitations of solar panels during different conditions, and how does this compare to the operational restrictions of maritime vessels?","answer":"Solar panels have specific operational limitations - they don't generate power at night and produce reduced output during cloudy weather, requiring homes to draw from the main grid when solar generation is insufficient. As for maritime vessels, they have operational restrictions based on jurisdiction - for example, certain licenses like the Master/Mate Inland license only permit operation in harbors, rivers, and lakes. Vessels also have specific operational rules, such as right-of-way procedures in narrow channels and proper protocols for overtaking other vessels.","context":["Originally Posted by ScreaminAsian\nwhat are you gonna be a captain of?\nyou can captain lots of stuff. boats, planes, zeppelins and other assorted airships, you can be a land captain if you're in the military and you stick with it long enough/are a college boy. sounds like an interesting and diverse field with lots of opportunities. good luck with it!\nOh, my bad.

There are several types of licenses, but the one I am going for is a Master/Mate Inland only (meaning I can only operate in harbors, rivers, and lakes) of vessels up to 50 Gross Tons. I have to pass 3 separate tests, as well as a thorough physical, drug test, and background check. I just applied for my TSA issued ID badge called a \"TWIC\" card last week, which I should be getting soon.\nThe test is quite difficult for most people, even though I'm taking the smallest one. It consists of 3 sections: Rules of the Road (traffic rules basically), Navigation, and Deck General + Safety. There's a 4th test called \"Plotting Practical\" which is just chart plotting, but since I can only get an inland license, I don't need to bother with it. Here are some sample questions from each section:\nDeck General and Safety (50 questions, 70% req.)\nConsidering manning requirements for US flag vessels, your 2 watch cargo vessel has a deck crew of 20 people, exclusive of officers. How many of these people do the manning regulations require to be able seamen?\n5: You are standing the wheelwatch when you hear the cry, \"Man overboard starboard side\". You should instinctively __________.\na. give full left rudder\nb. give full right rudder\nc. put the rudder amidships\nd. throw a life ring to mark the spot\n6: Which statement about a tunnel bow thruster is TRUE?\na. It provides lateral control without affecting headway.\nb. It is fully effective at speeds up to about six knots.\nc. It can be used to slow the ship in addition to backing down.\nd. It will allow you to hold a position when the current is from astern.\nRules of the Road (30 questions, 90% required)\n4: INLAND ONLY A vessel proceeding downstream in a narrow channel on the Western Rivers sights another vessel moving upstream. Which vessel has the right of way?\na. The vessel moving upstream against the current\nb. The vessel moving downstream with a following current\nc. The vessel located more towards the channel centerline\nd. The vessel sounding the first whistle signal\n5: INLAND ONLY You are overtaking a power-driven vessel in a narrow channel and wish to leave her on your starboard side. You may __________.\na. attempt to contact her on the radiotelephone to arrange for the passage\nb. proceed to overtake her without sounding whistle signals\nc. sound five short blasts\nd. All of the above\n8: INLAND ONLY If you were coming up on another power-driven vessel from dead astern and desired to overtake on the other vessel's starboard side, which whistle signal would you sound?\na. One short blast\nb. One prolonged blast\nc. Two short blasts\nd. Two prolonged blasts\nNavigation and Weather (20 questions, 70% required)\n140: You are underway on course 050░T and your maximum speed is 12 knots. The eye of a hurricane bears 080░T, 100 miles from your position. The hurricane is moving towards 265░T at 22 knots. If you maneuver at 12 knots to avoid the hurricane, what could be the maximum CPA?\na. 76 miles\nb. 69 miles\nc. 63 miles\nd. 56 miles\n85: Your longitude is 179░59'W. The LMT at this longitude is 23h 56m of the 4th day of the month. Six minutes later your position is 179░59'E longitude. Your LMT and date is now __________.\na. 00h 02m on the 4th\nb. 00h 02m on the 5th\nc. 23h 50m on the 5th\nd. 00h 02m on the 6th\n111: Green lights may appear on __________.\na. horizontally banded buoys\nb. vertically striped buoys\nc. yellow buoys\nd. spherical buoys\nSo, I'm preparing for that right now. I've passed the test twice before, so it's nothing new. I'm quite rusty though and the amount of material is HUGE - they draw from a pool of over 30,000 questions. So we'll see how i do. The only section I struggled with is Deck.","Frequently Asked Questions\nQ: How much does it cost to install solar panels?\nA: The price of solar systems has dropped dramatically over the past few years, making it an increasingly attractive option for homes and businesses.\nThe upfront cost of your solar PV system is affected by a number of different factors, including:\n- government incentives and support schemes available\n- contractor installation costs\n- type and number of solar panels, which affect the output of your system in kilowatts (kW)\n- type and size of inverter (the part of the system that converts the electrical output of your solar panels into AC electricity for use in your home or business)\n- type of framing equipment and other system components\n- height and accessibility of roof and whether it is tiled, metal or concrete\n- any after-sales service agreements\nAs a very rough guide, the total cost of getting a home solar system up and running is between $2500 (for a small 1.5 kW system) and $11,500 (for a top-of-the-line 5 kW system).\nFor businesses, the approximate cost of installing solar ranges from around $15,000 (for a 10kW system) to more than $200,000 (for a high-capacity 100 kW system).\nQ: How much money will I save with solar panels?\nA: The amount of money your household will save on power bills by going solar is affected by a number of factors, including:\n- Your energy consumption and the size of your solar power system – if you use more power than your system is capable of producing, your savings will be reduced. This can be avoided by choosing the right-sized system for your needs.\n- Your feed-in tariff – this is the amount your electricity retailer pays you for any excess power your solar panels generate.\n- Your usage patterns – solar panels can only generate electricity while the sun is shining. This means that households that use a lot of power during the day may attract greater savings than those that consume most of their power at night. However, you will still receive a feed-in tariff for any excess electricity you generate during the day.\n- Where you live – some areas of Australia receive a lot more sunlight than others, so a solar PV system in Brisbane will usually generate more power than one in Hobart.\nBusinesses have a couple of other things to take into account, including the tax implications of any revenue received from feed-in tariffs.\nQ: What is a solar feed-in tariff (FiT)?\nA: A feed-in-tariff is the amount your electricity retailer pays you for any electricity your solar PV system generates that you don’t use, and is instead fed back into the grid.\nQ: What is a small-scale technology certificate (STC)?\nA: STCs are government incentives that help reduce the upfront cost of installing your solar PV system. The value of STCs your system receives differs depending on its size and location.\nTo be eligible for STCs, your solar system must be installed by Clean Energy Council accredited installer.\nQ: How can I tell if my installer is accredited?\nYou can find an accredited installer in your area using our find an installer tool.\nRemember, to be eligible for government rebates in the form of STCs, your system must be installed by a Clean Energy Council accredited installer.\nQ: Where can I find a list of approved solar PV modules and inverters?\nA: The Clean Energy Council maintains a list of all solar modules and inverters that meet Australian Standards for use in the design and installation of solar PV systems. Only systems that use products from the approved lists are entitled to rebates in the form of small-scale technology certificates (STCs).\nPlease note that the Clean Energy Council does not certify modules and inverters directly. For a product to be included on our approved lists, the manufacturer must provide a certificate of compliance from a recognised certifying body.\nQ: Can I recycle my solar panels?\nA: Reclaim PV Recycling operates an Australian solar panel take back and reclaiming scheme throughout Australia.\nWhen you are buying your solar panels, check with your supplier whether they have a recycling program in place.\nQ: Is solar power safe?\nA: The Australian solar industry is well regulated and safe.\nSolar panels and inverters sold in this country must comply with a range of standards that maximise safety and reliability. The Clean Energy Council maintains a list of currently approved solar panel modules and inverters.\nThe Clean Energy Council’s Solar Accreditation scheme ensures that the people who design and install solar PV systems are across all the latest safety requirements. Accredited installers are qualified electricians who have undergone additional training and assessment in the installation of solar PV systems. Systems must be installed by a Clean Energy Council accredited installer to be eligible for small-scale technology certificates (STCs).\nInitiatives such as the Clean Energy Council’s Approved Solar Retailer scheme are also ensuring that the Australian solar PV sector stays safe and reliable.\nTo keep your system running safely and effectively for many years, you will need to maintain it correctly. See our after installing solar PV section for details on inspecting, maintaining and upgrading your system.\nQ: Do solar panels work at night or during cloudy weather?\nA: Solar panels do not generate power at night. Once the sun goes down, your home or business will start to draw power from the main grid as usual.Solar panels still work on a cloudy day; however they will not generate as much electricity as when the weather is clear and sunny.\nQ: What should I do if my solar PV system stops working?\nA: If your solar PV system is still under warranty, you should contact the retailer you purchased your system from to arrange repairs. If you bought from a Clean Energy Council Approved Solar Retailer, you can rest assured that every part of your system is covered under warranty for at least five years.If your system is out of warranty, you should contact your retailer or an accredited solar installer. However, you may be responsible for the cost of any repairs.For more information on what to do if your system stops working, refer to solar PV warranties, complaints and disputes."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4550a74c-68d6-49d3-b339-08926466fb87>","<urn:uuid:81b5328a-b0a4-45f1-91a0-5ad6da341126>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the differences between MPP's licensing process for generic manufacturers and EurSci4Health's approach to involving SMEs in healthcare innovation? Could you detail how each organization addresses the challenges faced by smaller companies?","answer":"MPP has a structured licensing process for generic manufacturers through Expression of Interest (EOI), involving a rigorous two-stage assessment process. Manufacturers must provide detailed information about their capacity, capabilities, track record, and specific plans for product development and distribution. MPP encourages applications from qualified manufacturers serving demand in limited regions or selected countries. In contrast, EurSci4Health acknowledges that SMEs face difficulties in moving through all phases of development, noting that their impact as innovators is not well reflected in marketing authorizations. EurSci4Health aims to address this by encouraging new business models with clearer intellectual property rights definitions and evaluation pathways for regulatory authorities, while promoting closer integration between academic and private partners to support innovation.","context":["A key objective of the Medicines Patent Pool’s licence agreements is to help improve access to safe, effective, more appropriate and affordable essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries, by reducing prices, improving supplies or adding capacity.\nYou are a patent holder working on essential medicines and would like to know more about our licensing mechanism for public health and how it could benefit your company.\nThe Medicines Patent Pool is the first patent pool with a clear public health mandate, established by Unitaid in 2010. MPP operates as a non-profit voluntary licensing mechanism through partnerships with originator pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers that facilitate access and promote innovation.\nWhat MPP has to offer:\n- Direct support to licensors: MPP offers tangible actions and services, namely the management of licensees and information provision.\n- Increased knowledge: insight into disease areas in countries where the originator presence is absent or reduced. MPP works with governments, the World Health Organization and other international public health agencies and stakeholders and can contribute to a better understanding of the global health area.\n- Reputational impact: as access becomes more and more important, innovators can be seen to make a concrete contribution to supporting access through a mechanism with a proven track record.\nTogether with MPP, sustainable access to effective and affordable innovative quality-assured treatments administered in resource-limited settings can become a reality.\nPlease contact our business development team to discuss how we could work together: email@example.com\nYou are a generic manufacturer and would like to develop, manufacture and supply MPP’s licensed products:\n- MPP invites interested developers anywhere in the world to express their interest in obtaining a sublicence for any of the 11 NIH technologies by submitting an e-mail to firstname.lastname@example.org providing as much detail as possible as to what the developer intends to do with a sublicence.\n- MPP invites interested manufacturers based anywhere in the world to express their interest in obtaining a sublicence for the ELISA antibody technology (COVID-19 diagnostic test) by submitting a single email to email@example.com with complete, detailed responses to the questionnaire provided here.\n- MPP invites interested developers anywhere in the world to express their interest in obtaining a sublicence for MVA-S(3P) (Vaccine Candidate) by submitting an e-mail to firstname.lastname@example.org providing as much detail as possible as to what the developer intends to do with a sublicence.\n- MPP invites interested developers anywhere in the world to express their interest in obtaining a sublicence for Vaccine MVC-COV1901 by submitting an e-mail to email@example.com providing as much detail as possible as to what the developer intends to do with a sublicence.\n- MPP invites interested developers anywhere in the world to express their interest in obtaining a sublicence for Technology that detects the presence of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by submitting an e-mail to firstname.lastname@example.org providing as much detail as possible as to what the developer intends to do with a sublicence.\nWe invite qualified product developers to apply for licences to manufacture and sell licensed treatments in low- and middle-income countries. We do this through an Expression of Interest (EOI) process. By granting multiple sublicences, we aim to encourage adequate sources of supply, and competitive pricing models.\nIf you wish to apply, you should complete an online Expression of Interest (EOI) form, which serves as your proposal to use our licensed intellectual property to create or improve access to relevant medicines in countries enabled by the licence.\nYou will need to provide details of your capacity, capabilities and track-record for manufacturing quality-assured medicines, your R&D, regulatory compliance and financials. You should also provide specific plans for the products you wish to license. These should cover development, manufacturing, regulatory plan, distribution and predicted investments. Among other criteria, we will consider your organisation’s state of readiness with needed formulations, including fixed-dose combinations and paediatric formulations.\nOur EOI form has two sections. One is about your organisation and the second concerns your state of readiness and plans for the products and licence in question. You do not need to complete the first section more than once; you can update it as needed. The second section is specific to each licence, so you should complete it for each separate application.\nMethod for granting sublicences\nThe EOI assessment is rigorous and objective and follows a two-stage process. A panel assesses each EOI and the final decision makers do not know the applicant’s identity. Each question carries a weighting and a maximum score. Responses are graded using a standardised tool and top-scoring applicants are selected. The number of licences we grant is based on WHO-MPP forecasts for the product in question. Criteria such as viability of development plans (especially in case of projects requiring specific capital expenditure or investments), quality and past performance (especially in case of serious breaches of voluntary licence agreements) may result in us rejecting an application.\nFor accurate assessment, we encourage applicants to provide as much detail as possible to ensure the EOI represents their actual capacities, capabilities and plans. Incomplete EOIs risk rejection.\nIn line with our mandate to promote local manufacturing in developing countries, we also encourage applications from qualified manufacturers for servicing demand in a limited region or selected countries.\nEOIs usually open immediately after we announce that we have obtained a patent licence from a patent holder, and there is normally a three to four weeks period to apply online. If you have any queries regarding the process or specific questions on the EOI form, please email email@example.com.\nWe will not disclose or use any commercial and technical information we receive in EOIs for any purpose other than assessment. We will always ask you for permission to use your details for any other purpose.\nCompanies not approved will be offered an explanation on why they were not selected. Companies may appeal to the MPP Board within 14 calendar days if they wish to challenge the decision made in the EoI process. The grounds for appeal are (a) the EoI process was not followed by MPP or (b) critical new information that would have led to a significantly different outcome in the EoI assessment has become available that was not available when the EoI was submitted.","EurSci4Health (mission statement)\nEuropean Science for Health (EurSci4Health) is a platform to promote innovative research and technologies, enabling affordable and transformational changes in healthcare, by mobilizing scientists and citizens.\nIts objective are to advise scientific policies for health, within European institutions, in order to facilitate the integrated development, regulation and use of diagnostics, therapeutics and other health technologies.\nDrug discovery and development is undergoing a paradigm shift where an increased emphasis on understanding pathology, from molecular to systems biology, will lead to more targeted therapies with disease-modifying properties.\nIt is imperative to effectively integrate the new tools available for drug discovery and development, including machine learning and digitalization, across the whole sector. This requires both education and innovation, the long-term development of which is best met by building upon the fundamental and translational research conducted in European universities and associated SMEs, while aligning with major pharma companies. Actions that foster academic discovery research and improve synergy between both academic and private partners will ensure both the continued development of a highly skilled workforce and, ultimately, improved clinical outcomes in the future.\nSimilarly, improved integration of the development and regulation of diagnostics, drugs and devices is a clear need in making innovation more patient-centric and personalised. An increasing role for cell and gene therapy, and tissue engineering is also apparent.\nIn the clinical assessment of new treatments, there will be more focus on studies using data from ‘real world’ patients, involving greater collaboration with independent patient organisations.\nAccordingly an important goal, in assessing future needs, is to promote further expansion of the traditional components of pharmaceutical sciences, to include improved integration with other medical sciences, medicinal chemistry, bioengineering, imaging, computational sciences, robotics, data analytics, pharmacoepidemiology, pharmaco-economics and the social sciences at large. All of these developments will have important implications for the education and training of researchers, as well as that of health care professionals. They will also have a profound impact on decision-making in medicines discovery and development, reimbursement and pricing.\nExamples of specific areas of concern in medicines research include:\n- A pipeline that is skewed towards oncology, hampering developments in other therapeutic areas. An urgent need is for the development of new antibiotics and antivirals, an area that is not seen to be cost-effective by most of major Pharma.\n- The impact of SMEs as innovators has not been well reflected in marketing authorisations, reflecting their difficulties in moving through all phases of development.\n- The affordability of innovation for health care systems, with impact on regulation and pricing, health technology assessment (HTA) and forward planning by governments and specialised agencies (g. EUnetHTA, Valetta, Benelux, Visegrad).\nTherefore the objectives of EurSci4Health include:\n- To appraise the current status of innovative research and technology, enabling affordable and transformational changes in healthcare.\n- To establish, by 2020, a permanent, expanded pan-European platform/forum of relevant stakeholders (academic, industry, regulatory, societal representatives), to foster innovative research and initiatives that will bring major health benefits to all European citizens.\n- To promote closer integration of the phases of drug discovery and development, by suggesting ways in which silos can be broken down in order to speed up the process.\n- To emphasise the importance of developing approaches for the treatment of patients with co-morbidities, and for dealing with the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance and emerging viruses.\n- To facilitate the integrated development, regulation and use of diagnostics, drugs and devices.\n- To encourage new business models with clearer definition of intellectual property rights and of pathways for evaluation by regulatory authorities and for health technology and societal impact assessment.\n- To consider how best to use ‘big data’ intelligently, to improve medicines usage and health outcomes.\n- To enhance the role of the patient and the social sciences, in developing science policy in the health care sector.\n- To promote further efforts to involve academia and learned societies as stakeholders in European health research.\n- To support continuing efforts to modernise the education of medicinal chemists, pharmaceutical scientists and health care professionals.\n- To review the scientific and evidence-base for the widespread use of ‘alternative remedies’ for the treatment of illness and the promotion of wellness.\nTo provide a platform for communicating scientific results both directly to the public and via appropriate media/governmental outlets."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f964bac1-185b-4182-91ee-f6aed61bdfd1>","<urn:uuid:dfef5e53-2259-40de-91fe-acc86ffc15cb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do government policies impact both geographical labor mobility and social mobility? What factors are shared between these two types of mobility?","answer":"Government policies can influence both types of mobility, but in different ways. For geographical labor mobility, governments can increase mobility by supporting transportation options, helping raise living standards, and implementing policies that facilitate movement within an economy - as seen in the European Union's efforts to help qualified workers cross borders. For social mobility, government policies related to education access, economic conditions, and anti-discrimination measures can significantly impact people's ability to move between social classes. Both types of mobility share common influencing factors including education levels, economic conditions, and societal structures. Education particularly stands out as a key determinant - higher education generally enables greater geographical labor mobility, while it's also a crucial factor for upward social mobility.","context":["What is Geographical Labor Mobility?\nGeographical labor mobility refers to the level of flexibility and freedom that workers have to move from one region or locale to another in order to find gainful employment in their field.\n- Geographic labor mobility refers to the ability of workers within a specific economy to relocate in order to find new or better employment.\n- Workers' mobility is determined by several factors, from transportation options to standards of living and other government-related policies.\n- The rate of geographic labor mobility within the United States has been consistently declining since the 1980s.\nUnderstanding Geographical Labor Mobility\nGeographic labor mobility refers to the ability of workers within a specific economy to relocate to find new or better employment. It can be compared to occupational labor mobility, which is workers' ability to change jobs or professions irrespective of geographical location. Geographical labor mobility can also be related to capital mobility or the mobility of economic goods.\nThere are several determinants of geographic labor mobility. The ease of movement and migration and the economic incentives to relocate are the main determinants of an economy’s fluidity of geographic labor mobility. Physical, geographic, and political barriers to movement are key factors that can make moving more difficult. At the economic level, a region's size, distance, and aggregate job opportunities determine the geographic labor mobility. At the personal level, however, determinants of the individual’s specific personal circumstances, such as family situation, housing issues, local infrastructure, and individual education affect geographic labor mobility. An economy's level of trade is also a direct factor in the geographic labor mobility of its workforce. For example, increasing the level of domestic and international trade requires that offices and other institutions be opened in various parts of a country, increasing job opportunities in these locations.\nOther Elements That Affect Geographic Mobility\nIn addition to the major root factors, there are other, specific key factors that can make geographic labor mobility more or less available. First, the aggregate level of education influences the mobility of the labor force, with a higher education generally resulting in greater ability to move in order to find employment.\nPersonal and cultural attitudes also drive labor mobility. For example, if an individual employee has no motivation to seek employment elsewhere, they will not, which results in low geographic labor mobility. Agricultural developments can also affect labor mobility as they drive people from densely populated areas to less-densely populated areas during busy seasonal periods.\nAnother key determinant is industrialization. Highly industrialized economies provide more blue collar job opportunities, which increases the labor mobility of the economy. More specifically, an industrialized economy helps workers move from rural locations to larger cities where there are more job opportunities.\nGovernment policies can also heavily influence geographic labor mobility. In global economic terms, the European Union actively tries to increase the geographic labor mobility of individuals by helping qualified workers find employment in other countries and cross national borders to spur individual, corporate, and national economic growth. If a government wants to increase geographic labor mobility, there are several actions it can take. The country can support transportation options, help raise the standard of living, and advance government policies that help with mobility within an economy.\nOne negative result of geographic labor mobility is the brain drain, or human capital flight, from developing regions and nations.\nPros and Cons of Geographic Labor Mobility\nGeographic labor mobility provides several benefits to a nation's economy. Chief among them is better allocation of the supply of labor and productivity. When workers can move to where the jobs are, more workers find employment and businesses can obtain the labor they need, where they need it. An economic study published in The Yale Law Journal in 2017 points out that geographic labor mobility makes managing macroeconomic stability easier and that local barriers to mobility can make macroeconomic policy less effective.\nOn the other hand, while geographic labor mobility is promoted as an ideal situation in blackboard economic models, it also has its downside. Labor mobility is associated with the dissolution of local communities and extinction of indigenous cultures as members migrate to seek economic opportunities and resettle in areas in which they are culturally alien. This tends to erode social capital in both the locations that workers leave and in new areas they move into. Geographic labor mobility is also the direct cause of the brain drain, or human capital flight, from developing regions and nations.\nGeographic Labor Mobility In the United States\nThe United States presents an interesting case study of geographic labor mobility during and after the development of economic systems.\nWhen the country was expanding westward and new industries were being developed, geographic labor mobility was at its peak as new migrants and the existing population moved to places with economic promise. However, it has declined consistently since the 1980s. According to U.S. Census data, the rate of movement between states has fallen by nearly half since 1989 while the rate of mobility between counties has declined by almost a third.","Social Mobility is a concept widely used in the discipline of Sociology.\n‘Social mobility is generally defined as the movement of people from one social class to another.’\nJohn Macionis has defined social mobility as ‘a change in one’s position in the social hierarchy’.\nSimilarly, according to R.T. Schaefer, “Social Mobility is a movement of individuals or groups from one position of a society’s stratification system to another”.\nIn any society, people are divided into different classes or strata, i.e. belonging to the elite class, the middle class, or the lower class of society. Social mobility is the movement of people from one class of society to the other class. For example, a person belonging to the middle class moves to the elite class of the society on the basis of different factors, like education, job, new relations, etc.\nDifferent Types of Social Mobility\nTerritorial Mobility – Change in place\nIt is the change in locality or territory – when an individual moves from one place to another place. Territorial social mobility is common in urban areas as compared to rural areas in any society.\nHorizontal Mobility – No change in status\nIt is defined as a movement from one position to another within the same social level, as changing jobs without altering occupational status, or moving between social groups having the same social status, i.e. getting the same clerical job in another department of the same organization.\nVertical Mobility – Change in status\nIt is a movement of individuals or groups to positions in society that involve a change in class, status, and power. For example, getting allocation in civil services directly from a college teacher changes one status from the middle class to the elite class.\nIntergenerational Mobility – Change after a generation\nIntergenerational mobility is a measure of the change of the social status or class of individuals as compared to their parents. For example, the father is a farmer while the son gets the job of Assistant Director in some government organization.\nIntra-generational Mobility – Change during one’s life span\nIt is the movement of a specific individual from one social status or class to another within his or her lifetime. For example, born in a lower-class poor family and becomes an Army officer.\nOccupational Mobility – Change in occupation/profession\nIn simple terms, occupational social mobility refers to changes in individual occupational status.\nFactors that determine Social Mobility\nThere are numerous factors that influence the mobility of an individual in society.\nFirst and foremost, education plays a key role. An individual from a lower class or lower middle class of society can move upward through education and getting a good job.\nSimilarly, in today’s era, the widespread availability and infusion of the internet and information and communication technology have given way to upward/vertical mobility of individuals in a society.\nMoreover, a person’s social status can also change through marriage and new relations.\nOn contrary, overt discrimination against different genders, racial and ethnic minorities in society seriously limits upward mobility.\nApart, many social and economic conditions also influence mobility in society.\nFor example, in a liberal or democratic society, it is more feasible than in a religiously conservative society.\nAlso, the economic conditions of a society heavily influence mobility.\nSocieties with a weak economy cannot uplift the living standards of individuals.\nOn the other hand, strong economies help their people in upward mobility. For example, more than 850 million Chinese people have been lifted out of extreme poverty with their vertical mobility."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bd8cfd80-ae56-4ab4-afae-419be20defdb>","<urn:uuid:aa4c1597-2d88-43a4-8b2f-a96b6e3952f8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What unique feeding behavior do shoveler ducks display during winter?","answer":"During winter, shoveler ducks form large circles and turn in unison to feed. This is a fascinating behavior that can be witnessed during the winter months.","context":["Winter time brings a heap of different birds returning to the UK to spend their time in a slightly warmer climate – looking for food, they often bring their families and young in-tow. Sometimes we see a surge in garden birds with siskins returning to our feeders and additional thrushes with Scandinavian blackbirds joining our resident birds. Redwing and fieldfares also visit from Scandinavian countries to spend their winters looking for berries and apples. But there’s so much more to see each winter.\nLarge flocks of waders build up during the winter months, instead of seeing small pockets of birds in different areas, we see large flocks with a mixture of species merging together in mixed flocks. The majority of species are those mentioned in the October edition with redshank and greenshank often mixing together, you may be lucky to see a spotted redshank too! These birds have barring along their sides and tails and a slightly darker colour on their back than the redshank. Ruff, ringed plover, curlew, knot, dunlin all return in numbers and merge in with other species or gather in large numbers them-selves. There is nothing quite like waking up early and sitting on an estuary or coast and just listening to the fantastic sound surrounding you with a heap of different waders all calling at once! Another mix of species we see are black-tailed godwits and bar-tailed godwits, the latter being the one in smaller numbers and often the harder one to pick out of the flock. Often, it’s easier to look at their tails as bar-tailed have a barring along their tail as opposed to a large black segment, the beak is also different with bar-tailed having a slight upturn at the end of their bill.\nFrom the usual breeding birds, we see during the spring and summer months, there’s a surge in the number of duck species that arrive in the winter. Common scoter are often seen in large flocks around the UK with Rhossili being a great place to see thousands of these birds rafting on the sea – you may be lucky to see some surprise species in the flock such as surf scoters, velvet scoters or even long-tailed ducks which are one of the most adorable looking ducks. A fantastic thing to witness during the winter is groups of shoveler forming a large circle all turning in unison to feed! But aside from the species mentioned, we can see vagrant species such as greater scaup, lesser scaup and ring-necked ducks, these species are difficult ones to pull out of a flock of tufted ducks, particularly the females of the species but the drakes (the male ducks) are gorgeous birds each with a different bill and back pattern.\nFinally, voted one of the best duck species, the humble smew – the females, known as redheads, are easy to pick out of duck flocks as these birds are sawbills meaning they look completely different from any other duck and resemble a small red-breasted merganser although the males are a gorgeous white colour with a large quiff of hair – very easy to spot!\nIt’s not just ducks we see in large numbers across our coasts during the winter months, geese are another group of birds that return to the UK to seek food, bringing their families in tow. The most common species we see in Swansea is the dark-bellied Brent goose, around Whiteford and Gower – we can see groups of 50+ of these birds filled full of character! Alongside the usual greylags and Canada geese, we will also see Eurasian white-fronted geese, they look a little bit similar to greylags but are smaller and have barring on the belly and a little white piece on the base of the bill. We occasionally get a similar species with Greenland white-fronted geese, the latter has a slightly different belly pattern and often a darker orange colour on the bill and legs. Finally, another early morning start will let you see another species – skeins of pink-footed geese! Often you don’t quite get to see this species, instead you see triangles of geese flying ahead usually honking. Geese fly in V formations to save energy on long flights, with each bird taking its turn to fly at the front of the formation to keep up the speed of the group which uses a lot of energy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c42c21b1-5141-4af7-a865-594df71694f7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the process of blinding work in randomized controlled trials, and why is it considered essential for minimizing bias in medical research studies?","answer":"Blinding in randomized controlled trials is a process where critical information about treatment allocation is hidden from patients, observers, or evaluators to minimize bias. In double blinding, neither the investigator nor study participant knows the treatment assignments, while in single blind trials, only the investigator knows the allocation. Blinding ensures there are no differences in how groups are assessed or managed, as knowledge of treatment assignment could influence how outcome data is measured or interpreted by investigators, or affect participants' responses to treatment. The intervention and placebo treatments must appear identical to maintain effective blinding.","context":["Learning objectives: You will learn about interventional study design and its strengths and weaknesses.\nInterventional studies are often performed in laboratories and clinical studies to establish beneficial effects of drugs or procedures. The present section introduces the readers to randomised controlled study design.\nRead the resource text below.\nIntervention studies are considered to provide the most reliable evidence in epidemiological research. Intervention studies can generally be considered as either preventative or therapeutic .\nTherapeutic trials are conducted among individuals with a particular disease to assess the effectiveness of an agent or procedure to diminish symptoms, prevent recurrence, or reduce mortality from the disease.\nPreventative trials are conducted to evaluate whether an agent or procedure reduces the risk of developing a particular disease among individuals free from that disease at the beginning of the trial, for example, vaccine trials. Preventative trials may be conducted among individuals or among entire communities\nTypes of experimental interventions may include:\n- Therapeutic agents\n- Prophylactic agents\n- Diagnostic agents\n- Surgical procedures\n- Health service strategies\nCharacteristics of an intervention study\n* A distinguishing characteristic of an intervention study is that the intervention (the preventative or therapeutic measure) being tested is allocated by the investigator to a group of two or more study subjects (individuals, households, communities).\n* Subjects are followed prospectively to compare the intervention vs. the control (standard treatment, no treatment or placebo).\nThe main intervention study design is the randomised controlled trial (RCT).\nA pre-post clinical trial/cross-over trial is one in which the subjects are first assigned to the treatment group and, after a brief interval for cessation of residual effect of the drug, are shifted into the placebo /alternative group. Thus, the subjects act as their own control at the end of the study. However, such studies are not feasible if there is mortality, or if the disease is easily cured by one of the interventions.\nRandomised controlled trials\nThe randomised controlled trial is considered as the most rigorous method of determining whether a cause-effect relationship exists between an intervention and outcome . The strength of the RCT lies in the process of randomisation that is unique to this type of epidemiological study design.\nGenerally, in a randomised controlled trial, study participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group receiving the intervention that is being tested and a comparison group (controls) which receives a conventional treatment or placebo. These groups are then followed prospectively to assess the effectiveness of the intervention compared with the standard or placebo treatment.\nThe random allocation of subjects is used to ensure that the intervention and control groups are similar in all respects (distribution of potential confounding factors) with the exception of the therapeutic or preventative measure being tested. The choice of comparison treatments may include an existing standard treatment or a placebo (a treatment which resembles the intervention treatment in all respects except that it contains no active ingredients).\nNote that ethical constraints limit the choice of comparison treatments.\nFigure 1. General outline of a two armed randomised controlled trial.\nBasic outline of the design of a randomised controlled trial\n1. Development of a comprehensive study protocol. The study protocol will include:\n- Aim and rationale of the trial\n- Proposed methodology/data collection\n- Definition of the hypothesis\n- Ethical considerations\n- Background/review of published literature\n- Quality assurance and safety\n- Treatment schedules, dosage, toxicity data etc.\n2. Formulation of hypothesis.\n3. Objectives of the trial.\n4. Sample size calculations.\n5. Define reference population.\n6. Choice of a comparison treatment - placebo or current available best treatment.\n7. Selection of intervention and control groups, including source, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and methods of recruitment.\n8. Informed consent procedures.\n9. Collection of baseline measurements, including all variables considered or known to affect the outcome(s) of interest.\n10. Random allocation of study participants to treatment groups (standard or placebo vs. new).\n11. Follow-up of all treatment groups, with assessment of outcomes continuously or intermittently.\n12. Monitor compliance and losses to follow-up.\n13. Interim analysis.\n14. Analysis - comparison of treatment groups.\n15. Interpretation (assess the strength of effect, alternative explanations such as sampling variation, bias).\nThe aim of randomisation is to ensure that any observed differences between the treatment groups are due to differences in the treatment alone and not due to the effects of confounding (known or unknown) or bias. That is, that the groups are similar in all respects with the exception of the intervention under investigation.\nMethods of random allocation are used to ensure that all study participants have the same chance of allocation to the treatment or control group, and that the likelihood of receiving an intervention is equal regardless of when the participant entered the study. Therefore, the probability of any participant receiving the intervention or the standard treatment/placebo is independent of any other participant being assigned that treatment.\nThe assignment of study subjects to each intervention is determined by formal chance process and cannot be predicted or influenced by the investigator or participant. In a well designed RCT, random allocation is determined in advance.\nMethods of randomisation - allocation of subjects to intervention and control groups\n1. Simple randomisation\nFor example, computer generated random number tables. Simple randomisation is rarely used.\n2. Block randomisation\nBlock randomisation is a method used to ensure that the numbers of participants assigned to each group is equally distributed and is commonly used in smaller trials.\n3. Stratified randomisation\nStratified randomisation is used to ensure that important baseline variables (potential confounding factors) are more evenly distributed between groups than chance alone may assure. However, there are a limited number of baseline variables that can be balanced by stratification because of the potential for small numbers of subjects within each stratum.\n4. Minimized randomisation\nThis method may be used when the study is sufficiently small and simple randomisation will not result in balanced groups.\nNote that deterministic methods of allocation such as by date of birth or alternate assignment to each group are not considered as random.\nAdvantages of randomisation\n- Eliminates confounding - tends to create groups that are comparable for all factors that influence outcome, known, unknown or difficult to measure. Therefore, the only difference between the groups should be the intervention.\n- Eliminates selection bias.\n- Gives validity in statistical tests based on probability theory.\n- Any baseline differences that exist between study groups are attributable to chance rather than bias. Though this should still be considered as a potential concern.\nDisadvantages of randomisation\nDoes not guarantee comparable groups as differences in confounding variables may arise by chance.\nBlinding in randomised controlled trials\nBlinding is a process where the critical information on allocation of treatment is hidden either from the patients, or from observer or the evaluator in the study. The method of blinding in RCT is used to ensure that there are no differences in the way in which each group is assessed or managed, and therefore minimize bias. Bias may be introduced, for example, if the investigator is aware of which treatment a subject is receiving, as this may influence (intentionally or unintentionally) the way in which outcome data is measured or interpreted. Similarly, a subject's knowledge of treatment assignment may influence their response to a specific treatment.\nBlinding also involves ensuring that the intervention and standard or placebo treatment appears the same.\nDouble blinding is when neither the investigator nor the study participant is aware of treatment assignments. However, this design is not always possible.\nA single blind RCT is when the investigator but not the study participants know which treatment has been allocated.\nStrengths of a randomised controlled trial\n- A well designed randomised control trial provides the strongest evidence of any epidemiological study design that a given intervention has a postulated effectiveness and is safe.\n- A RCT provides the best type of epidemiological study from which to draw conclusions on causality.\n- Randomisation provides a powerful tool for controlling for confounding, even by factors that may be unknown or difficult to measure. Therefore, if well designed and conducted, a RCT minimizes the possibility that any observed association is due to confounding.\n- Clear temporal sequence - exposure clearly precedes outcome.\n- Provides a strong basis for statistical inference.\n- Enables blinding and therefore minimizes bias.\n- Can measure disease incidence and multiple outcomes.\nWeaknesses of a randomised controlled trial\n- Ethical constraints - for example, it is not always possible or ethical to manipulate exposure at random.\n- Expensive and time consuming.\n- Requires complex design and analysis if unit of allocation is not the individual.\n- Inefficient for rare diseases or diseases with a delayed outcome.\n- Generalisability - subjects in a RCT may be more willing to comply with the treatment regimen and therefore may not be representative of all individuals who might be given the treatment.\n1.

{"question":"How do the historical origins and early influences of Spenserian stanzas and sonnets differ in terms of their development and spread across Europe?","answer":"The Spenserian stanza was invented by Edmund Spenser in the Elizabethan period, drawing inspiration from three Italian metres (Ottava Rima, Terza Rima, and Ballade Stanza) to create a new form for narrative poetry. In contrast, the sonnet originated in the 13th century with the Sicilian school of court poets, influenced by Provençal troubadours, and was later perfected by Petrarch in 14th century Tuscany. While the Spenserian stanza remained primarily associated with English poetry, influencing Romantic poets like Byron, Keats, and Shelley, the sonnet spread widely across Europe, being adapted into various languages including Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Polish, each adapting to their native metrics.","context":["Spenserian Stanza Definition\nThe Spenserian Stanza is named after Edmund Spenser, the inventor of the style for its unique stanza pattern. The harmony of the nine line stanza (called the Spenserian stanza), consisting of eight iambic pentameter and one iambic hexameter (called the Alexandrine) with the rhyme scheme of ab ab bc bc c, contributes largely to the creation of Spenserian Sonnets. In addition, the stanza ‘adapts itself reading to the different demands of narrative, descriptive and moral poetry’. Its verbal musicality reaches a high point with the use of onomatopoeia, alliteration, assonance and rhyme. The unified lyric tone and the fairyland setting serve an additional function by bringing the digressions into single harmony.\nSpenserian Stanza Examples\nA glaring example of Spenserian stanza is discovered from Book I of The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser:\n“A gentle knight was pricking on the plaine,\nYcladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,\nWherein old dints of deepe woundes did remaine,\nThe cruell markes of many a bloody fielde;\nYet armes till that time did he never wield:\nHis angry steede did chide his foaming bitt,\nAs much disdayning to the curbe to yield:\nFull jolly knight he seemed, and faire did sitt,\nAs one for knightly jousts and fierce encounters fitt.”\nThe romantic poets make full use of Spenserian stanza in their poetry. Byron’s Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, Keats’s “The Eve of St. Agnes,” and Shelley’s “The Revolt of Islam” and “Adonais.” Shelley is perhaps the greatest master of the Spenserian stanza after Spenser himself. Here is the third stanza from “Adonais“:\n“Oh weep for Adonais-he is dead!\nWake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep!\nYet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed\nThy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep,\nLike his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep;\nFor he is gone where all things wise and fair\nDescend. Oh dream not that the amorous deep\nWill yet restore him to the vital air;\nDeath feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair .”\nThe Victorian poets were not far behind of using Spenserian stanza. Lord Alfred Tennyson uses this in his poem, “The Lotos Eaters”.\n“Courage!” he said, and pointed toward the land,\n“This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon.”\nIn the afternoon they came unto a land\nIn which it seemed always afternoon.\nAll round the coast the languid air did swoon,\nBreathing like one that hath a weary dream.\nFull-faced above the valley stood the moon;\nAnd like a downward smoke, the slender stream\nAlong the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.\n(First Stanza, The Lotos Eaters)\nSpenserian Stanza : A Study\nEdmund Spenser stands among the greatest writers of Elizabethan period whose precious contributions fashioned new tradition in English literature. Spenser’s rich and vigorous imagery and careful treatment of metrical structure left a profound influence on the succeeding poets and ensured his place as one of the seminal literary artists in the flamboyant field of English literature. Spenser reached the highest pinnacle of his art and invention with his romantic tour de force The Faerie Queene. It has been hailed as Spenser’s masterpiece, the supreme triumph of the poetic art in English literature.\nThe Faerie Queene is written in the Spenserian Stanza, a form which the poet himself invented as a suitable vehicle for a long narrative poem. Suggestions for its construction were taken from three Italian metres – the Ottava Rima, The Terza Rima (The Sonnet) and the Ballade Stanza. The Spenserian Stanza is characterized by eight lines of lambic Pentameter followed by one line of lambic Hexameter, or an Alexandrine.\n“a gen/ tle Knight/ was prick/ ing on/ the plaine”\nfollowed by one iambic hexameter, or Alexandrine (six accents). e.g.\n“as one/ for Knight/ ly giusts/ and fierce/ en count/ ers fit”\nThe rhymes are arranged in the following order: ab ab be bcc. It will be observed that the two quatrains are bound together by the first two b rhymes, and the Alexandrine, which rhymes with the eighth line, draws out the harmony with a peculiar lingering effect. In scanning and reading it is necessary to observe the laws of accentuation and pronunciation prevailing in Spenser’s day.\nThe rhythm of the meter is also varied by the alternating of end-stopped and run-on lines, as in the last quotation. An end-stopped line has a pause at the end, usually indicated by some mark of punctuation. A run-on line should be read closely with the following line with only a slight pause to indicate the line-unit. The use of alliteration, i.e. having several words in a line beginning with the same letter, is another device frequently employed by Spenser for musical effect, e.g.\n“In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare.”\n“Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleep them biddes.”\nLike Lyly, Marlowe, and Shakespeare, Spenser felt the new delight in the pictorial and musical qualities of words, and invented new melodious and word pictures. He aimed rather at finish, exactness, and fastidious neatness than at case, freedom, and irregularity, and if his versification has any fault, it is that of monotony. The atmosphere is always perfectly adapted to the theme. The peculiar diction of the Faerie Queene should also receive the careful attention of the reader. As a romantic poet,\nSpenser often preferred archaic and semi-obsolete language to more modern forms. He uses four classes of words that were recognized as the proper and conventional language of pastoral and romantic poetry; viz. (a) archaisms, (b) dialect, (c) classicisms, and (d) gallicisms. He did not hesitate to adopt from Chaucer many obsolete words and grammatical forms. Examples are: the double negative with ne; eyen, lenger, doen, ycladd, harrowd, purchas, raught, seely, stowre, swinge, owch, and withouten.\nHe also employs many old words from Wycliffe, and Langland, like swelt. Younglings, noye, kest, hurtle, and loft. His dialectic forms are taken from the vernacular of the North Lancashire folk with which he was familiar. Some are still a part of the spoken language of that regions, such as, brent, cruddled, forswat, fearen, forray, pight, sithen, carle etc.\nNotwithstanding Spenser’s use of foreign words and constructions, his language is as thoroughly English in its idiom as that of any of our great poets. Leigh Hunt says:\n“I think that if he had not been a great poet, he would have been a great painter.”\nAnd Alexander Pope says:\n“After reading a canto of Spenser two or three days ago to an old lady, between seventy and eighty years of age, she said that I had been showing her a gallery of pictures. I do not know how it is, but she said very right. There is something in Spenser that pleases one as strongly in old age as it did in youth. I read the Faerie Queene when I was about twelve, with infinite delight, and I think it gave me as much, when I read it over about a year or two ago.”\nThe reader hears in its lines a stately and undulating rhythm that intoxicates the ear and carries him on with an irresistible fascination, he sees the unsubstantial forms of fairyland go sweeping by in a gorgeous and dreamlike pageantry, and he feels pulsing in its luxuriant and enchanted atmosphere the warm and beauty-loving temper of the Italian Renaissance.","Sonnet, fixed verse form of Italian origin consisting of 14 lines that are typically five-foot iambics rhyming according to a prescribed scheme.\nThe sonnet is unique among poetic forms in Western literature in that it has retained its appeal for major poets for five centuries. The form seems to have originated in the 13th century among the Sicilian school of court poets, who were influenced by the love poetry of Provençal troubadours. From there it spread to Tuscany, where it reached its highest expression in the 14th century in the poems of Petrarch. His Canzoniere—a sequence of poems including 317 sonnets, addressed to his idealized beloved, Laura—established and perfected the Petrarchan (or Italian) sonnet, which remains one of the two principal sonnet forms, as well as the one most widely used. The other major form is the English (or Shakespearean) sonnet.\nThe Petrarchan sonnet characteristically treats its theme in two parts. The first eight lines, the octave, state a problem, ask a question, or express an emotional tension. The last six lines, the sestet, resolve the problem, answer the question, or relieve the tension. The octave is rhymed abbaabba. The rhyme scheme of the sestet varies; it may be cdecde, cdccdc, or cdedce. The Petrarchan sonnet became a major influence on European poetry. It soon became naturalized in Spain, Portugal, and France and was introduced to Poland, whence it spread to other Slavic literatures. In most cases the form was adapted to the staple metre of the language—e.g., the alexandrine (12-syllable iambic line) in France and iambic pentameter in English.\nThe sonnet was introduced to England, along with other Italian verse forms, by Sir Thomas Wyatt and Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, in the 16th century. The new forms precipitated the great Elizabethan flowering of lyric poetry, and the period marks the peak of the sonnet’s English popularity. In the course of adapting the Italian form to a language less rich in rhymes, the Elizabethans gradually arrived at the distinctive English sonnet, which is composed of three quatrains, each having an independent rhyme scheme, and is ended with a rhymed couplet.\nThe rhyme scheme of the English sonnet is abab cdcd efef gg. Its greater number of rhymes makes it a less demanding form than the Petrarchan sonnet, but this is offset by the difficulty presented by the couplet, which must summarize the impact of the preceding quatrains with the compressed force of a Greek epigram. An example is Shakespeare’s Sonnet CXVI:\nLet me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments. Love is not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover to remove:\nOh, no! it is an ever-fixéd mark,\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;\nIt is the star to every wandering bark,\nWhose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken.\nLove’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle’s compass come;\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.\nIf this be error and upon me proved,\nI never writ, nor no man ever loved.\nThe typical Elizabethan use of the sonnet was in a sequence of love poems in the manner of Petrarch. Although each sonnet was an independent poem, partly conventional in content and partly self-revelatory, the sequence had the added interest of providing something of a narrative development. Among the notable Elizabethan sequences are Sir Philip Sidney’s Astrophel and Stella (1591), Samuel Daniel’s Delia (1592), Michael Drayton’s Idea’s Mirrour (1594), and Edmund Spenser’s Amoretti (1591). The last-named work uses a common variant of the sonnet (known as Spenserian) that follows the English quatrain and couplet pattern but resembles the Italian in using a linked rhyme scheme: abab bcbc cdcd ee. Perhaps the greatest of all sonnet sequences is Shakespeare’s, addressed to a young man and a “dark lady.” In these sonnets the supposed love story is of less interest than the underlying reflections on time and art, growth and decay, and fame and fortune.\nIn its subsequent development the sonnet was to depart even further from themes of love. By the time John Donne wrote his religious sonnets (c. 1610) and Milton wrote sonnets on political and religious subjects or on personal themes such as his blindness (i.e., “When I consider how my light is spent”), the sonnet had been extended to embrace nearly all the subjects of poetry.\nIt is the virtue of this short form that it can range from “light conceits of lovers” to considerations of life, time, death, and eternity, without doing injustice to any of them. Even during the Romantic era, in spite of the emphasis on freedom and spontaneity, the sonnet forms continued to challenge major poets. Many English writers—including William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning—continued to write Petrarchan sonnets. One of the best-known examples of this in English is Wordsworth’s “The World Is Too Much With Us”:\nThe world is too much with us; late and soon,\nGetting and spending, we lay waste\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon,\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers,\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\nIt moves us not.—Great God! I’d rather be\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\nHave glimpses that would make me\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreathéd horn.\nIn the later 19th century the love sonnet sequence was revived by Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Sonnets from the Portuguese (1850) and by Dante Gabriel Rossetti in The House of Life (1876). The most distinguished 20th-century work of the kind is Rainer Maria Rilke’s Sonnette an Orpheus (1922)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:007edbc1-deeb-4bd7-b303-9bd75719cbe1>","<urn:uuid:138f1677-1cc7-415a-b2d6-92c5dda8adbc>"],"error":null}

The primary shortcoming with these devices is their size and cost. Multi-sensors using miniature vibrating beams to sense Coriolis forces developed by hinged proof masses have also been developed to sense both acceleration and angular rate. These later devices have small size and low cost advantage but fall short of inertial grade accuracy.\nThe purpose of the present invention is to provide a miniature gyroscope capable of measuring angular rate to inertial grade accuracy at substantially reduced cost and size compared to existing instruments.\nThe angular rate sensing mechanism employs Coriolis specific force sensing techniques, and in its preferred form is fabricated using state of the art micro machine chemical or plasma etch techniques for forming cyrstalline silicon parts. The mechanism can also be fabricated from other materials using an anisotropic depth etch, x-ray lithography, electroplating and moulding process known as LIGA.\nIn general, an open top box structure is formed on a base, such as a crystalline silicon substrate, and drive and sensing devices are fabricated on the substrate. The drive or actuator components induce resonant vibration in the box walls. Output transducers sense acceleration changes by processing signals representing changing force components at the corners of the box structure, wherein the corners assume the role of relatively stationary nodes compared to the vibrating walls. In a preferred embodiment, a magnet is used to coact with alternating drive current in electrodes on the box substrate to impart vibration to the box walls and to excite force sensing transducers of the double ended tuning fork (DETF) type that in turn are responsive to stress-strain forces at the box corners.\nFIG. 1 is an isometric view of a miniature box structure in which the walls of the box are driven into a natural mode of vibration by drive actuators and the Coriolis effect causes forces on the box walls that are a measure of angular rate of rotation of the structure;\nFIGS. 2A, 2B, and 2C are respectively top plan view, side sectional view, and enlarged fragment of a parallelogram box structure fabricated from a wafer substrate of crystalline silicon in accordance with the preferred embodiment;\nFIGS. 3A and 3B are corresponding top and side sectional views of the box structure of FIGS. 2a and 2b in which dotted line positions of the box walls indicate the natural structural vibration of the walls induced to measure Coriolis rate;\nFIG. 4 is an enlarged fragmentary view of the drive and sensing devices including conductor pads formed on the under side of a silicon wafer substrate base of the box structure and DETF force sensors radiating from beneath a center mounting abutment out to the four corners of the box walls;\nFIG. 5 is a computer simulated isometric view of the box structure induced into a natural mode of vibration and illustrating that the opposed walls of the box vibrate 180 degrees out of phase;\nFIG. 6 is a sectional view of the preferred rate sensor package including an annular housing that surrounds and supports the internal vibrating box structure, cylindrical field magnet, field return path box support structure, and connecting leads, in which the housing is also part of the magnetic return path; and\nFIG. 7 is a view similar to FIG. 4 of an alternative embodiment using piezo resistive sensor elements on the substrate base, in place of the DETF transducers to convert sensed forces at the corners of the vibrating box walls into electrical signals representing angular rate.\nThe vibrating miniature gyroscope 10 described herein, is shown in FIGS. 1, 2A, 2B, and 2C and excites a box structure 12 into a primary vibrational mode driven by periodic forces F induced by a current I through conductor electrodes 20a-d (FIG. 4) and a magnetic field B perpendicular to the conductors. The force developed is given by:\nF=Force exerted on the conductor\nI=Current carried by conductor\nIn all descriptions and figures, the X, Y and Z axes represent both the inertial coordinate system and the crystal axes of the silicon. For a silicon device that has cubic symmetry, the axes are arbitrary as far as the device is concerned. The Z axis is the input axis of the rate sensor about which rotation is sensed, the X and Y axes are the axis along which the Coriolis velocity vector is generated.\nThe basic mechanism as shown in FIG. 1 consists of an open top, i.e., open faced \"box\" structure 12. In FIG. 1, the preferred abutment mounting structure 14 is shown in the center of the box; however, alternate mounting means are also appropriate. In order to achieve practical dimensions, the walls of the box of crystalline silicon are etched in the 110 plane of the silicon. This will result in a parallelogram shaped \"box\" as shown in FIGS. 1, 2A and 2b, with included angles of 70.5 and 109.5 degrees, respectively, determined by the crystalline structure of the silicon substrate and an etching fabrication process. For example, a potassium hydroxide silicon etching described by H. A. Waggener in \"Electrochemically Controlled Thinning of Silicon\", Bell Systems Technical Journal, Vol. 49, No. 3, 1970, p. 473, may be used. Other fabrication processes may be used including reactive plasma etching with a silicon wafer having silicon on insulator (SOI) to provide etch stop for potassium hydroxide etching or for deep silicon anisotropic reactive ion etching (RIE). LIGA micromachining is still another available process. The box walls 20 and central mounting structure 14 are the result of etching a silicon wafer down to a relatively thin epitaxial layer that serves as the box base 15.\nOpposite walls 12a,c and 12b,d of the box are driven into resonance such that they vibrate 180 degrees out of phase as shown in FIGS. 3A, B. The corners 13a-b, 13b-c, 13c-d and 13d-a of the box are \"nodal\" points which remain substantially stationary on base 15 compared to the moving walls in this resonance mode.\nWhen the device is rotated about the Z axis, the Coriolis forces produced by the vibrating walls is given by:\nm=mass of wall\nΩ=rotation about Z axis\ndr/dt=velocity of wall along X or Y axis\nA rotation about the Z axis will result in forces substantially parallel to the walls of the parallelogram box 12. Opposite corners will have opposite Coriolis induced forces, the adjacent corners will also have opposite forces. By sensing the forces at all the corners in accordance with the preferred embodiment, common mode rejection sensing techniques result in substantial cancellation of temperature and acceleration errors.\nThe resonant mode may be driven by an actuator electrode configuration in a permanenet magnetic field B as shown in FIG. 4. Four current conducting electrodes 20a, 20b, 20c and 20d paralleling the box walls are located proximate the center mounting structure 14 on epitaxial base 15 to serve as vibration drivers of the desired mode. The primary electrode current paths are oriented parallel to the walls they are driving.\nThe resulting Coriolis effect forces may be sensed by a variety of techniques. The preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 4 uses a set of four double ended tuning forks (DETFs) 22a, 22b, 22c and 22d etched in the plane of bottom base 15 of the \"box\" radiating between corners 13 of the walls and inner center mounting structure 14. These DETFs 22a-22d are preferably excited by the same magnetic field B which is used with drive current electrodes 20a-20d to excite the walls 12. Contact pads 24 for DETFs 22, and control pads 23 for electrodes 20 are disposed on the underside of base 15 opposite center mounting structure 14 for receiving connective wire leads.\nFIGS. 1, 2A-C, 3A-B, and 4 disclose a preferred embodiment of a vibrational gyroscope using the invention. The vibrating wall box has dimensions of approximately 3 mm per wall measured along the epitaxial base 15. The central mounting structure 14 is also a parallelogram with sides of 1 mm in length measured along the base. The thickness of the base 15 in the region between the walls 12 and the center mounting structure 14 is about 5 microns thick. This can lend itself to fabrication techniques used for crystalline silicon where this is the thickness of an epitaxial layer and used as a stop during the etching process. The walls 12 are about 100 microns thick and have a total height of about 2 mm resulting in a height to thickness ratio of about 20:1. A finite element simulated model of these dimensions was constructed to compute the modal vibration response. The desired mode is the first mode computed as 71311 Hz. A plot of this mode is shown in FIG. 5. A peak displacement of 240 μinches of each wall will produce stresses in the silicon structure of approximately 15000 psi which is below allowable limits and is measurable by the DETF sensors 22.\nThe Coriolis force per degree of rotation may be estimated from:\nω=frequency of desired vibration mode\nThe average displacement of each wall may be estimated as the peak displacement divided by four. The force developed in gs along each axis (two walls) is approximately 1.3 μg/deg/hr. For DETFs having a tine length of 0.8 mm, a width of 0.0034 mm and the thickness of the epi layer of 0.005 mm, the DETF frequency will be approximately 42000 Hz and the sensitivity of each DETF will be approximately 0.5 mili-Hz/deg/hr. When the output frequency change of two DETFs in opposite corners is denoted by f1 and f2, and the change of the remaining two by f3 and f4 the rate will be given by:\nS is a scale factor\nThe sensitivity of the device is enhanced by a factor of four and temperature effects are rejected since they will tend to cancel by common mode subtraction.\nA suitable packaging configuration is shown in FIG. 6 which embodies the above rate sensing transducer, and includes an annular housing 30 and a permanent magnet 28 providing flux field B and a return path magnetic structure 32 that also serves as an attachment structure to which the center aubutment 14 is attached such as by bonding. The magnet 28, structure 32 and housing 30 which is also a high permeable material provide an efficient B field path 35 to the drive electrode transducers 20 and sensor DETFs 22. Permanent magnet 28 is disposed in close proximity to the transducer components to provide a magnetic flux B in a direction perpendicular to the base 15 of the silicon structure containing the electrodes. Permanent magnet 28 is secured to the inside bottom wall of housing 30 and structure 32 is likewise secured to the underside of a housing header 30a. Connective leads indicated by dotted lines 36 pass through sealed connections 37 in housing header 30a and extend to contact pads on the underside of base 15 of gyroscope 10. In addition, temperature compensation can be enhanced by known per se techniques such as using a thermistor or other temperature sensor within the package.\nAn alternate preferred embodiment replaces the DETFs with four piezo-resistive sensing elements 26 positioned in etched triangular shaped doped regions fabricated in base 15 at the corners of the walls as shown in FIG. 7. The drive electrodes are the same. A still further embodiment may replace the drive B field electrodes with capacitor drives doped on the silicon base 15.\nWhile only particular embodiments have been disclosed herein, it will be readily apparent to persons skilled in the art that numerous changes and modifications can be made thereto, including the use of equivalent means, devices, and method steps without departing from the spirit of the invention.\n|Cited Patent||Filing date||Publication date||Applicant||Title|\n|US4896268 *||Nov 25, 1987||Jan 23, 1990||Sundstrand Data Control, Inc.||Apparatus and method for processing the output signals of a coriolis rate sensor|\n|US5226321 *||May 17, 1991||Jul 13, 1993||British Aerospace Public Limited Company||Vibrating planar gyro|\n|US5476007 *||Oct 29, 1993||Dec 19, 1995||Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.||Vibrating gyroscope|\n|1||\"Carousel 400: a new family of inertial navigation systems\" (4 pg brochure), Delco Electronics (undated).|\n|2||\"Delco's Space Inertial Reference Unit\" (2 page brochure), S92-156, Aug. 1992, 2 pgs, Delco Electronics.|\n|3||\"Hemispherical Resonator Gyro\" (2 page info sheet), Delco Avionics Sales, Milwaukee, WI (undated).|\n|4||\"Hemispherical Resonator Gyroscope; Response to RFI for LEAP IMU\" prepared for Boeing Aerospace by Delco Sys.

generation of electrical energy, comprising a rotor with at least one coil, a stator with at least one magnet and at least one electrical consumer located on the rotor and connected to the at least one coil.\nIn apparatus with generation of electrical energy, comprising a rotor with at least one coil, a stator with at least one magnet and at least one electrical consumer, the at least one to consumer is generally located on the stator side. The electrical energy generated in the rotor is thus transmitted to the fixed part by means of sliding contacts.\nPatent Abstracts of Japan Vol. 008, No. 250 (E-279), 16th Nov. 1984 (1984-11-16) and JP 59 1275566 A(Mobuo Kiyokawa) 23rd Jul. 1984 (1984-07-23) disclose an apparatus with generation of electrical energy, comprising a rotor with at least one coil, a stator with at least one magnet and at least one electrical consumer, wherein on the rotor there is located a diode bridge connected to the coil and connected to a further consumer. Where the further consumer is located and of what type it is cannot be inferred from the document.\nDE 27 10 148 A (Voith Getriebe KG) 14th Sep. 1978 (1978-09-14) discloses a blade rotor designed as a wind energy converter wherein electrical lights are located on the rotor. These should form a closed advertising space for the eye when the rotor turns sufficiently rapidly. The thus designed energy converter is provided with a generator which supplies the current for the lights. For further details refer to Lueger, Lexikon der Technik, 1965, Vol. 7, pages 574-581. In this additional literature wind power plants are described where a separate generator with its own rotor is provided in each case in addition to the blade rotor. In this arrangement the current for the lights is transmitted from the generator rotor to the blade rotor.\nThe invention now proposes an apparatus of the type specified initially, wherein the at least one electrical consumer located on the rotor and there connected to the at least one coil is a light-emitting element and/or a non-luminous signal transmitter.\nA particularly interesting and advantageous application of the invention is obtained if the a apparatus is designed as a windmill and the rotor is provided with blades. The invention is particularly suited for this application because, as a result of the generation of electrical energy, sliding contacts between the rotor and the stator are dispensed with on the rotor and in addition a low running and starting resistance of the rotor can be achieved which is particularly important for a windmill.\nIf at least one light-emitting diode (LED) is used as the consumer on the rotor, this will light up as soon as the windmill begins to be turned by the wind. In particular, this can lead to attractive effects when a plurality of differently coloured light-emitting diodes are used on the; blades of the windmill.\nAdvantageous and therefore preferred embodiments and further developments of the invention are characterised in the dependent claims.\nThe invention will be explained in detail hereinafter with reference to examples of embodiment in connection with the drawings, wherein the examples relate to an apparatus according to the invention constructed as a windmill, where\nFIG. 1 is a perspective exploded view of a windmill according to the invention cut in half;\nFIG. 2a) is a top view of the mounting surface of the stator provided with a corresponding number of permanent magnets and bordering on the said gap and b) is a sectional view of the magnets and an appropriate mounting plate (section 2—2 in view a));\nFIG. 3a) is a top view of the mounting surface of the rotor provided with several coils and bordering on the gap between rotor and stator and b) is a sectional view of the magnets and an appropriate mounting plate (section 3—3 in view a));\nFIG. 4 is a preferred wiring of the rotor coil with several light-emitting diodes; and\nFIG. 5 is a schematic view of the rotor of the windmill with a plurality of light-emitting diodes.\nThe apparatus in FIG. 1 is a windmill of a handy size such as can be installed, for example, for decorative purposes in the garden of a house, on a balcony or in a similar location.\nThe windmill in FIG. 1 comprises a stator 10 and a rotor 20 provided with blades 21. The stator has means 14 for its attachment to a stay-bar or similar. The parts shown between the stator 10 and the rotor 20 belong to the stator 10 and comprise four axially-magnetised permanent magnets 11 which are arranged such that they are distributed uniformly around the rotor or stator axis, as shown in FIG. 2. On the rotor 20 are provided four coils 22 corresponding to the number of permanent magnets 11, which like the permanent magnets 11 are also arranged uniformly around the rotor or stator axis and at the same distance therefrom. This is shown in FIG. 3. On the blades 21 of the rotor 20 there are located light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 23 wherein here only one such light-emitting diode is shown per blade. The light-emitting diodes 23 are electrically connected to the coils 22. The rotor 20 is supported on an axial bearing pin 12 of the stator 10, which engages in an axial bearing hole 24 in the rotor 20.\nWhen the rotor 20 turns, for example, as a result of being driven by the wind, an alternating voltage is induced in the coils 22 of the rotor 20 as said coils move past the permanent magnets 11 of the stator 10 and are thereby exposed to an alternating magnetic field. This results in a voltage at the light-emitting diodes 23 as the electrical consumer, which makes these light up when a threshold voltage of typically 2 V-2.5 V is reached. Since this voltage or the appropriate current is generated directly in the rotor 20 on which the light-emitting diodes 23 are located as consumers, there is no need to transmit the current from the stator 10 to the rotor 20 via sliding contacts (slip rings) which would bring about an additional turning resistance for the rotor 20. The rotor 20 can thus advantageously be moved even by relatively gentle wind.\nIn order to avoid cogging moments and thereby further facilitate starting of the windmill at low wind strengths, the coils 22 are preferably implemented with an air-gap winding or an iron-free winding. They can be self-supporting coils e.g. so-called backlag coils.\nThe magnets 11 are preferably mounted on a disk of magnetic material, especially an iron disk as shown in FIG. 1 and denoted by 13. By this means the flux guidance is improved, i.e, higher magnetic flux is obtained in the coils 22.\nIf the magnets 11, as is preferred, all have the same polarisation relative to the direction of the axis, e.g. NNNN as shown in FIG. 2, and there are gaps between them as also shown in FIG. 2, a field having an opposite direction of flux forms between the magnets, as is indicated by SSSS in FIG. 2. Thus, with a given number of magnets it is possible to construct a generator with twice as many poles. In the case with four magnets taken as an example, a generator with eight poles is thus obtained. This is therefore advantageous because as a result of a large number of poles a sufficiently high voltage to operate the light-emitting diodes 23 can be achieved even at low speed. The voltage is namely proportional to the number of poles in addition to the speed. Additionally savings on magnets are hereby made.\nIf, as is further preferred, the coils 22 on the rotor 20 are also mounted on a disk made of a magnetic material, again especially iron sheet, the magnets 11 arranged on the stator exert an attractive force on the rotor 20 in the axial direction. A corresponding iron sheet is denoted by 25 in FIG. 1. As a result of said force, the rotor 20 does not need to be attached on the bearing pin 12 of the stator in the axial direction. It is sufficient to simply press it onto the bearing pin where it is then held axially by the magnetic forces. This is especially advantageous with respect to the possibility that the stator, 10 and rotor 20 can be simply joined together or separated one from the other and thus, for example can be packaged separately one from the other and dispatched. The axial attraction between stator and rotor can be adjusted precisely and simply by varying the thickness and the spacing of the disk 25.\nThe light-emitting diodes 23 are used simultaneously as rectifier elements and lighting elements. In this respect it is preferable to arrange two light-emitting diodes always in pairs and anti-parallel one to the other in order to utilise both half-waves of the alternating voltage.\nAs already mentioned, the voltage induced in the coils 22 of the rotor 20 is proportional to the rotor speed. In order to ensure,: on the one hand, that the light-emitting diodes light up even in only gentle wind and at only a low rotor speed but, on the other hand, to avoid the current being too high above the failure limit of the light-emitting diodes in very strong wind and at correspondingly high speed, voltage stabilisation can be used.\nIn order to avoid voltage stabilisation, the dimensions can be selected so that the current through the light-emitting diodes themselves does not exceed the maximum permissible value even at the highest predicted speed.\nFIG. 4 shows an arrangement with four pairs of light-emitting diodes a-d connected anti-parallel to one another for which voltage stabilisation is also not required. In this arrangement four coils A, B, C and C are connected in series in this order. Only the pair of diodes d is connected in parallel with the coil D. The pair c is in parallel with the two coils C and D. The: pair b is in parallel with the three coils B-D and finally the pair a is allocated to all four coils A-D.\nThe arrangement in FIG. 4 has the advantage that as the speed increases, the current is distributed to increasingly mart pairs of diodes and is thereby somewhat stabilised. Thus, initially only the pair of diodes a which sees the voltage from all four coils A-D begins to light up. As the speed increases, the other pairs of diodes b, c and d are then added one after the other The current through the individual light-emitting diodes thus remains substantially constant over a wide operating range.\nThe arrangement in FIG. 4 also has the advantage that as a result of the dependence of the number of burning light-emitting diodes on the speed, on the one hand an interesting optical effect is obtained and on the other hand, the speed of the windmill can be identified and read off by the observer which allows conclusions to be drawn on the force of the wind driving the windmill.\nFIG. 5 shows a possible design of the rotor 20 in a front view wherein respectively several light-emitting diodes 23 are arranged radially spaced on the blades 21 of the rotor. These could, for example, also be differently coloured. If the light-emitting diodes are also wired as in FIG. 4, they could be arranged for example such that as the speed increases, they begin to light up from the inside to the outside or conversely.\nThe design of the apparatus according to the invention described above as an illuminated windmill is only an example. Other realisations are fundamentally also feasible. Another very interesting possibility is, for example, a corresponding illumination of vehicle wheels, especially bicycles, motorcycles, prams, inline-skates or similar, wherein the illumination then also has a safety aspect. The number and size of the coils and magnets is within certain limits arbitrary. Especially, FIG. 4 can be extended to further coils and consumers. The coils and the magnets can have different shapes and sizes. Especially suitable for the magnets are flat or disk shapes with rectangular or round cross-sections. On account of their strength, neodymium magnets are particularly advantageous. In addition to light-emitting diodes, other light-emitting elements such as incandescent lamps, halogen lamps or light-emitting polymers can also be considered as consumers. Non-luminous signal transmitters, e.g. those of an acoustic nature could fundamentally also be used. Here it can be envisaged that a melody or similar is produced during a revolution.\n|Cited Patent||Filing date||Publication date||Applicant||Title|\n|US1560535 *||Mar 27, 1922||Nov 10, 1925||Burton Carl O||Anemometer|\n|US2619527 *||Dec 31, 1949||Nov 25, 1952||Int Standard Electric Corp||Airport wind indicating and warning system|\n|US4191988 *||Dec 27, 1977||Mar 4, 1980||Shokichi Kumakura||Identification lamp apparatus|\n|US4298910 *||Feb 19, 1980||Nov 3, 1981||Rjm Industries, Inc.||Roller skate wheel with self-contained generator|\n|US4782431 *||Jan 18, 1986||Nov 1, 1988||Park Seung M||Lighting apparatus for wheels of vehicles|\n|US4805329 *||Jun 25, 1987||Feb 21, 1989||Tsai Hung Chie||Self-powered computerized advertisement board|\n|US5552972 *||Nov 28, 1994||Sep 3, 1996||Rezvani; Vahid||Self-powered lighted wheel|\n|US5580093 *||Oct 16, 1995||Dec 3, 1996||Pervis Conway||Light generating and emitting roller skate wheel|\n|US5718499 *||Jul 15, 1996||Feb 17, 1998||De Caro; Frank||Roller blade wheel lighting system|\n|US5873600 *||May 7, 1996||Feb 23, 1999||Conway; Pervis||Modular light generating and emitting roller skate wheel|\n|DE2710146A1||Mar 9, 1977||Sep 14, 1978||Voith Getriebe Kg||Windmill blades for display surface - has inbuilt generator producing power for display bulbs mounted in blades|\n|JPS59127566A||Title not available|\n|KR20010096698A *||Title not available|\n|1||Lueger et al., \"Lexicon der Technik\", 1965, vol. 7, pp. 578-581.|\n|Citing Patent||Filing date||Publication date||Applicant||Title|\n|US7361074||Feb 18, 2005||Apr 22, 2008||Rapid Pro Manufacturing, Martin And Periman Partnership||Rotating light toy|\n|US7400287||Feb 17, 2006||Jul 15, 2008||Honeywell International Inc.||Smart chaff|\n|US20060092621 *||Oct 29, 2004||May 4, 2006||Lai Marcos Y S||Tailpipe decoration|\n|US20070109787 *||Nov 14, 2005||May 17, 2007||Chin-Ping Wu||Light emitting heat sink fan|\n|US20080143579 *||Feb 17, 2006||Jun 19, 2008||Honeywell International, Inc.||Smart chaff|\n|WO2009048348A1 *||Oct 9, 2007||Apr 16, 2009||Veniamin Yakovlevich Veinberg||Wind lighting fixture|\n|U.S. Classification||290/55, 362/35|\n|International Classification||H02K21/26, F03D1/00, H02K7/18, F03D9/00, G09F13/30|\n|Cooperative Classification||H02K7/183, Y02E10/725, F03D9/002, H02K21/26, F03D1/00, F03D9/00, G09F13/30|\n|European Classification||H02K7/18A2W, F03D1/00, F03D9/00, G09F13/30, F03D9/00C|\n|Nov 19, 2007||FPAY||Fee payment|\nYear of fee payment: 4\n|Jan 30, 2012||REMI||Maintenance fee reminder mailed|\n|Jun 15, 2012||LAPS||Lapse for failure to pay maintenance fees|\n|Aug 7, 2012||FP||Expired due to failure to pay maintenance fee|\nEffective date: 20120615"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7d49eda5-a54c-4f42-94d6-290fe4838f9e>","<urn:uuid:138f5116-c759-4d24-bbb8-0bf9f2d5af47>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do treatment approaches for depression differ between teens and adults, considering both therapeutic techniques and medical interventions?","answer":"Treatment approaches for depression vary between teens and adults. For teens, there's an emphasis on interactive therapeutic techniques like the 'Three S's' framework which helps them monitor wellness by checking their feelings/thoughts, trying self-care activities, and reaching out to trusted adults. Teens also benefit from specialized activities like 'Visualizing Movies of Success and Joy' and mindful exercises. Additionally, relationship-building exercises like 'Teen Mentors Adult' and 'Imaginary Feelings X-ray' are specifically designed for adolescents. For adults, treatment typically focuses on antidepressant medication combined with psychotherapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) which helps change thinking patterns and behaviors. CBT treatment usually shows best results after 12-16 weeks, and research indicates that combining medication with therapy is most effective for moderate to severe depression in adults.","context":["What can you do to help a teen who has depression? During our Spring 2018 Teen Depression Webinar, Matthew Selekman, MSW, LCSW, shared many strategies to equip you and your teen to focus on the positive and nurture the practices that work.\nWatch our free webinar for additional suggestions from Matthew Selekman. You’ll also hear from Elizabeth and Danielle, sharing insights from their lived experience of teen depression as mother and daughter.\nThe Three S’s\nThis is a great place to start with a teen (and even for yourself). The Three S’s is a framework and philosophy that helps your teen check in and monitor wellness.\nFirst, the teen learns to pay close attention to feelings and thoughts. How are the thoughts affecting feelings? By focusing on their emotional and physical wellbeing, the teen can begin to think about what activity or practice may bring them comfort.\nIn this step, the teen checks in with themselves to see if the self-care activity is making a difference for their emotional and physical distress. If not, the teen moves on to the next step.\nThe last S encourages the teen to turn to a trusted adult and ask for help. Consider helping the teen make a list of people they can turn to (e.g., parent, other family member, community member, school nurse, doctor, and others).\nThe following activities are not one-size-fits-all. It’s important to share many different activities with teens so they can choose the models that work best for them. It’s also important to note that even though an activity works once, that doesn’t mean it will always be effective.\nVisualizing Movies of Success and Joy\nMatthew often uses this practice with teens who self-harm. This activity is a way to help a young person recall and relive positive experiences.\nTo try this activity, first have the teen identify the theater they usually go to for a movie. Imagine sitting in the chair and looking up at the blank screen. Have them close their eyes and picture the blank movie screen. Using all their senses, have them create and describe a movie of something that they have achieved and that makes them really proud of themselves. Matthew shared that “what typically happens, with their eyes closed they start to smile. It triggers positive emotions which can then neutralize negative emotions.” Learn more about how to perform this exercise here.\nMatthew described a mindful eating exercise he calls “Taking a Trip to Popcorn Land,” but there are many different mindful eating exercises teens can try. Our personal favorite is Mindfulness and the Art of Cholate Eating! Mindful eating is a great way to introduce the concepts of mindfulness to teenagers and make it an enjoyable experience.\nHow many of us take a walk and really pay attention to our surroundings? More and more we see people focused on their phones. Mindful walking encourages you and your teen to be grounded in the moment by paying attention to what you see, hear, and smell.\nEncourage the teen to keep a journal of events or experiences that make them happy, smile, laugh, or feel joy. The teen can pull out this journal when they are struggling as a way to boost their mood and encourage positive emotions. Laughing can release endorphins and support physical wellness!\nMany of the exercises above can be done individually, partnered, or as a family. However, the following exercises are specifically used to encourage relationship building and connection.\nTeen Mentors Adult\nPut the adolescent in charge of mentoring the parent, guardian, or caring adult in a skill that the teen excels in. The parent has to be a good student and respect the authority of the teen teacher. The teen has to be a good teacher by being patient and sharing their knowledge. This activity encourages the adult to recognize a skill the teen has and build a relationship through something the teen enjoys.\nImaginary Feelings X-ray\nHave the teen lay down on a long sheet of paper. A parent or sibling can draw an outline around the teen’s body. Then ask, “Suppose we have a magical feelings x-ray machine that shows us pictures of what we feel. Draw where those feelings live in your body. You can draw scenes in your life that capture those feelings.”\nMatthew shared that this exercise can be very powerful to do in the company of family members. For some, this could be the first time they really understand what is going on internally for the teen.\nKeep learning!

Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in America. Sometimes referred to as major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it is different from less severe feelings of sadness. The good news is that depression is highly treatable. In this blog, we'll go over how to treat depression.\nWhat are the symptoms of depression?\nThe symptoms of depression can vary from person to person. Below is a list of depression symptoms from the American Psychological Association. You might experience these symptoms if you are struggling with depression.\n- Prolonged sadness or feelings of emptiness\n- Feeling helpless or hopeless\n- Feeling guilt or worthlessness\n- Anger and irritability\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Changes in sleep patterns\n- Changes in appetite\n- Chronic pain, headaches, or stomach aches\n- Loss of interest in activities\n- Withdrawal from friends and family\n- Thoughts of death or suicide\nWhat causes depression?\nJust like substance abuse, there is no one cause for depression. The causes of depression will be different for each person and can be the result of a combination of factors.\nBiological risks for depression include having a family history of depression, being diagnosed with a co-occurring mental health disorder, having a terminal illness, and being a woman. In fact, women experience depression at twice the rate of men, with one in eight women experiencing clinical depression in their lifetime.\nEnvironmental risks for depression include things like prolonged stress from work, major life changes, and trauma. Sometimes, environmental risks are called sociological or psychosocial risks since they are not biological (genetic) and are a result of things that happen as a part of day-to-day life.\nThere are also developmental risks for depression. For example, experiencing trauma or abuse during childhood can increase your risk of developing clinical depression later in life.\nHow do you treat depression?\nDepression is highly treatable. While each person’s specific treatment may vary, generally speaking, depression can be treated with antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy used to treat depression, anxiety, and PTSD.\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy works by helping you to change the way you think and helping you to change your behaviors. The best results are typically seen after 12-16 weeks of treatment. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is offered at our counseling centers. If you are looking for a counseling center that offers treatment for depression, check out our counseling center locations.\nCan I treat depression on my own?\nYou might wonder if it’s possible to treat depression on your own, or with only medication, or only therapy. Remember, people experience depression differently. What causes your depression might not be what causes depression in someone else. This means that there is no one way to treat depression.\nResearch has concluded that depression is best treated with the help of a qualified mental health professional and that a combination of medication and therapy is most effective for moderate to severe depression. It’s best to seek the advice of a mental health professional, like a therapist who understands depression and is qualified to work with you on developing a treatment program that is unique to your needs.\nLearn more about depression:\nLooking to learn more?

{"question":"What are the essential components of building cross-cultural competence in professional interactions, and how does vocabulary development contribute to effective communication across cultures?","answer":"Building cross-cultural competence involves progressing through six stages, from denial of cultural differences to full integration, where professionals become experts at interpreting behaviors according to cultural frameworks. Key components include awareness of personal biases, understanding different communication styles, and adapting language to clients' needs. Regarding vocabulary development, effective communication requires knowing at least 2,000 words for simple conversations, while comprehending challenging texts needs 10,000+ words. Vocabulary includes not just singular words but also set phrases, variable phrases, phrasal verbs, and idioms. The development of these language skills must be supported by varied learning activities and repeated exposure, as turning short-term memory into long-term requires approximately 17 repetitions.","context":["Memory and building a larger vocabulary are dependant on exercising the brain. The United States Department of Education explains there is a correlation between learning new words is easier through repetition.\nEven though the brain is not technically a muscle, it benefits from regular exercise. Turning a short-term memory into long-term requires repeated exposure to a word. According to researchers, 17 repetitions is optimum.\nAuthor, Robert Marzano explains repeated exposure to words using the same activity is ineffective for most learners. Exercises should not be boring, he adds the lessons should use visual, audio, kinesthetic, graphics, and oral activities.\nSuggested memory-building activities for learning new vocabulary words include: having the students sort words into two groups, those known and not known; give them a definition, explanation, or an explanation; have them fill out a multiple choice exercise; students can draw pictures relating to the word; if applicable, the instructor can use morphology and highlight prefixes, suffixes, and root words, and more.\nThe definition of vocabulary is more than singular words. There are four additional classifications; set phrases, variable phrases, phrasal verbs, and idioms.\nThe bulk of any language is singular words. In most languages, there are thousands to learn. To be able to carry on simple conversations a person needs to know at least 2,000 words. Adding 1,000-word families enable most to early learners to read through “authentic texts.” To comprehend challenging texts understanding 10,000+ words is necessary.\nNumber 2 is set phrases like on the other hand; ladies and gentleman; and all of a sudden cannot be said any other way. The word order is fixed and cannot be varied.\nThe third group is variable phrases, these are similar to set phrases in that they are fixed but can vary in terms of word order, personal pronouns, and possessive adjectives. For example, “it has come to our attention” can be written as “it has come to my attention,” if grammatically correct.\nGroup number 4, phrasal verbs are set of two or three words with the verb being first, the second and sometimes a third word is a particle. Commonly found verbs include, put, go, get, make, call, take, and come. There are nine particles used with verbs to create unique words, they are: up, down, on, off, in, out, back, back and over. The verbs need to be used in their proper form such as take-off, versus took off, or take up, takes up, or took up.\nThe final vocabulary group is idioms or idiomatic expressions and are found in all languages. They are defined as a type of informal language that is different from the meaning of the words in the expression. Idioms are set phrases, one does not change the words and either literal or figurative. Examples are:\n- Hold your tongue means to refrain from speaking. This is figurative as one does not use a hand to hold their tongue.\n- Let the cat out of the bag is used when a person reveals a secret. Also, figurative since there is no cat or bag.\n- To kick the bucket is a figurative expression used when someone is uncomfortable using the word die.\n- The ball is in your court can be literal or figurative. It’s meaning: it is up to that person to make the next decision or step.\n- Beat around the bush has two slightly different meanings; avoiding the main topic or not speaking directly about the issue.\nLearning new vocabulary can be fun or frustrating but using repetition increases long-term memory and better recall of new words. Building one’s language skills increase the ability to converse and read.\nWritten by Cathy Milne-Ware\nThoughtCo: 17 Reps to Build Vocabulary Muscles\nU.S. Department of Education: Six Vocabulary Activities for the English Language Classroom\nEnglish Language Smart Words: Famous Idioms | Meaning\nFeatured Image Courtesy of Enokson’s Flickr Page – Creative Commons License\nTop Inset Image Courtesy of Paula Fisher’s Flickr Page -Creative Commons License","Being Culturally Competent: Why Is This Important?\nAgatha, a litigation lawyer, conducts a pre-trial examination. During the examination, the witness avoids her gaze and dodges her questions. Indeed, Agatha struggles to get direct and concise answers. It doesn’t take much else for her to conclude that the witness is lying to her, but is that really the case?\nThere are many differences in language, gender or culture that influence the quality of our dealings with our clients, colleagues and even opposing parties. These differences also colour our interpretation of certain behaviours. In a context of globalization, which brings many changes such as increased trade and interdependence at the political, social and economic levels, cultural skills are undeniably major assets that lawyers in all fields of law must possess.\nThis article has three objectives: to define the concepts of culture and cultural competence, to provide food for thought on your cultural skills and the main obstacles to communication and, finally, to suggest preventive measures to avoid misunderstandings underlying cultural differences.\nCulture and Cultural Competence: Some Definitions\nIn this article, we will take a broad view of the concept of culture. More specifically, culture refers to any behaviour or value of an individual in relation to his or her identity characteristics. In addition to ethnicity, identity characteristics include: the individual’s gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and intellectual and physical abilities.\nSimilarly, we understand cultural competence to mean an individual’s ability to maintain his or her effectiveness in a context marked by cultural differences, as well as his or her ability to understand and adapt to these differences. In other words, cultural competence not only requires an awareness of cultural differences, it also requires an active engagement in learning and adaptive behaviours to maintain healthy relationships with our culturally diverse clients.\nAssessment of My Cultural Competence\nHumans are made in such a way that it is easier for us to relate to individuals who are like us. Each lawyer therefore has his or her own level of comfort with diversity.\nWe propose to identify your stage of cross-cultural sensitivity and emotional competence with the help of the Development Model of Intercultural Sensitivity designed by Dr. Milton Bennett. Dr. Bennett identified the following six stages of cultural competence:\nStage 1: Denial\nThis refers to lawyers who overlook the cultural dimension of their business relationships. They ignore the differences that may still exist with respect to values, beliefs, taboos and communication styles. In general, lawyers at this stage find it difficult to build trusting relationships with clients from different cultures. Similarly, there are more conflicts and misunderstandings caused by a lack of understanding of cultural differences.\nStage 2: Defence\nLawyers at this stage acknowledge the existence of cultural differences, but view them negatively. In other words, instead of trying to understand behaviour that is different from their own, they criticize the behaviour or make a false or stereotypical judgment.\nStage 3: Minimization of difference\nAt this stage, lawyers recognize cultural and linguistic diversity. Nonetheless, they consider their own values and beliefs to be universal and superior to those of others. When interacting with culturally different clients, they tend to misinterpret the clients’ behaviours or opinions in the mistaken belief that the clients share their own values.\nSuch lawyers will face many communication barriers due to their propensity to minimize the importance of the cultural differences that may exist between them and their clients.\nStage 4: Acceptance of difference\nLawyers at this stage are aware of the cultural differences that exist and grasp the importance of understanding them to improve the quality of their relationships and the effectiveness of their communications with their clients. In other words, the relationship between the lawyers and their culturally different clients is respectful and free of negative bias. The lawyers’ flexibility and open-mindedness allows them to adequately analyze the needs of culturally different clients.\nStage 5: Adaptation to difference\nAt this stage, lawyers not only perceive cultural differences, but also interact skillfully within those differences. In other words, they adapt!\nStage 6: Integration of difference\nAt this stage, lawyers have become experts in interpreting their clients’ behaviours according to their cultural framework. They pay particular attention to both verbal and non-verbal language.\nPlease rest assured that this is in no way a value judgment on a particular stage. On the contrary, identifying the stage we are at, even if it is not the desired one, allows us to identify our strengths and weaknesses. In fact, it’s about raising awareness so that we can target the actions that need to be taken to perfect our communications with culturally different clients. This leads us to end this section by sharing a quote from Shunmyo Masuno, a Buddhist monk, on open-mindedness: “If you debate endlessly about black or white, you fail to see the beauty of grey”.\nCultural Differences and Barriers to Good Communication\nLet’s look at three cultural differences that may arise in your daily practice and that are the source of many misunderstandings.\nHigh-hierarchy vs. low-hierarchy cultures\nDuring a meeting with a client to explain his opinion on the file, Max has difficulty getting clear instructions from the client. Despite Max’s encouragement, the client asks few questions, simply stating that he understands. Is the client merely shy or is there a cultural element involved?\nThe question is relevant. In high-hierarchy cultures, a high degree of respect is shown to individuals who have certain characteristics such as age, gender, education, type of employment, workplace seniority, etc. Thus, out of deference, people who adhere to this type of culture speak little in meetings or ask permission before speaking. They also tend to avoid challenging the ideas of those they perceive as hierarchically superior.\nConversely, in low-hierarchy cultures, individuals view challenging ideas positively, as long as opinions are expressed with respect.\nIt should be noted that low-hierarchy countries are the minority. Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom are countries with a low-hierarchy culture.\nCulture of direct vs. indirect communication\nMarie, a family law lawyer, meets for the first time with a new female client who is married, is 35 years old and has two children. The client arrived in Canada less than a year ago and has difficulty expressing herself in English. Based on her discussion with the client, Marie perceives that the client seems to be emotionally abused by her spouse and wants a divorce. Despite a frank and direct question about the client’s intentions, the client evades the question.\nThe way in which people communicate also varies from one culture to another. For some, conversations are “cloaked” in the sense that metaphors, references to culturally shared norms or examples are used to express one’s thoughts. Indeed, cultures that favour indirect communication perceive direct communication as inappropriate or crude. Cultures favouring indirect communication are mostly found in ethnically homogeneous countries.\nConversely, in countries with great diversity, communication tends to be direct to ensure that the other person has understood the meaning of what is being said. Canada is an excellent example of a culture of direct communication.\nGroup vs. individual culture\nHarold, a litigation lawyer, is at a settlement conference with his client. His analysis of the case suggests it is in his client’s favour and the judge seems receptive to their position. Despite his recommendations to try to obtain higher monetary compensation, the client is more concerned about obtaining a letter of apology and re-establishing the business relationship with the opposing party.\nSo-called group cultures place greater importance on the interests of the group as opposed to individual interests. Collaboration and consensus building is common. Conflicts must be avoided and social cohesion is paramount.\nIndividualistic cultures value the defence of individual rights and interests.\nBy being sensitive to cultural differences, it is possible to see the misunderstandings and errors that can result.\nSome Preventive Measures...\nIn light of the above, here are some preventive measures to improve how you communicate with culturally diverse clients:\n- Be aware of your biases and thought patterns. During a meeting with a culturally different client, ask yourself what certain behaviours mean and how your own cultural context influences your interpretation. Avoid assuming that a gesture has the same meaning as in your culture.\n- Don’t underestimate the role of stress. Anxiety negatively influences the interpretation of events and behaviours by both lawyers and clients. So, in times of stress, why not take a step back to ensure that your interpretation is accurate and free of bias? As far as the client is concerned, encourage breaks if the conversation becomes anxiety-provoking. These breaks will allow the client to better assimilate information and make well-thought-out decisions.\n- Allow sufficient time for the client during your meetings. When planning a meeting, allow time to answer all of the client’s questions and work to dispel preconceived ideas, if any.\n- Practice active listening techniques. Make your client understand that you are attentive to the problem they are presenting to you, in particular by rewording certain sentences. In all cases, it is important to reserve judgment and validate your understanding.\n- Adapt your language. Two people may face a similar legal problem but have different language needs due to cultural differences. The person with a low level of education will appreciate clear, concise and jargon-free language. Conversely, a client who is a businessman involved in his tenth business transaction might find this language too simplistic. Another illustration is that of a client from a culture where communication is indirect. This client may be uncomfortable with your direct approach.\n- Avoid assuming that something is simple and that you don’t have to explain it. Some clients, out of fear of demonstrating ignorance or out of deference, do not ask any questions. They claim to have understood everything, when in fact this is not true! It is therefore crucial that you ensure clients understand all relevant information so they can make informed decisions in their case.\n- Encourage clients to ask questions. Through their questions, clients will provide you with valuable insights into their understanding of the case. It is suggested that lawyers replace the so-called “closed” questions such as “Do you understand?” or “Is my strategy the right one for you?” with “open” questions such as “What do you think of the proposed strategy?”.\n- Be proactive. Learn about different cultures. For example, find out about business etiquette before attending a meeting involving culturally different people.\nTo return to our original issue about the importance of cultural competence, it goes without saying that cultural competence remains essential to effectively target client needs and expectations. In an era of increased individual mobility and competitiveness within firms, cultural competence contributes to providing good client service. It is therefore not irrelevant to reflect on how to improve this type of competence.\nMe Nora Rock, Cultural Competence: an essential skill for success in an increasingly diverse world, Lawpro Magazine, 2014, vol. 13, no. 2.
