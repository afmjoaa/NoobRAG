{"question":"What role did manufacturing innovations play in the histories of Bianchi and the Flanders automobile company's production methods?","answer":"Bianchi and Flanders represented different eras and approaches to manufacturing innovation. Bianchi, founded in 1885, is the oldest surviving bicycle manufacturer in the world, with their designs benefiting from decades of input from professional riders. The Flanders company, on the other hand, was revolutionary in its early automotive manufacturing approach - Walter Flanders had been instrumental in setting up assembly lines at Ford, and brought this expertise to his own company. The Flanders '20' featured innovative modular construction, with the engine mounted in a separate subframe that could be easily removed for repairs, allowing quick unit replacement rather than lengthy repairs - a feature meant to revolutionize garage practices of the time.","context":["Words Kenny Pryde | Photos Daniel Gould\nLooking to insure your new bike? Compare quotes from across the market here, in partnership with Protect Your Family\nWe can try to resist as much as we like, but none of us is immune to the snake-oil charms of marketing. The fact that an object (a salt cellar! A pair of jeans! Shampoo!) has a label or a logo on it somehow imbues it with some magical added value. It’s largely bogus, of course, but we can still fall for it.\nIn some cases, a brand name has credibility because the company has a long history and a hard-won reputation for producing the goods and knowing what it’s doing. In cycling, one such name is Bianchi. The Bergamo-based company was founded in 1885 by Eduardo Bianchi and claims — reasonably — to be the oldest surviving bicycle manufacturer in the world.\nBianchi bikes have been associated with some of the most famous names and moments in racing history. Even if the names of Fausto Coppi, Felice Gimondi and Marco Pantani don’t mean anything to you, you can be assured that, over the decades, input from some of the world’s best riders has found its way into Bianchi designs.\nWhich is a long-winded way of saying that this Vertigo is a sweet-handling, good-natured bike that you could ride from Lombardy to Loch Lomond and still feel fresh. It looks like a ‘racer’ and it pretty much rides like a ‘racer’ but with added comfort engineered in. If you are looking for the stiffest and least forgiving frameset on the road, this is not it. Which is absolutely not a bad thing.\nThe carbon monocoque frame has been designed with comfort at the top of the must-have list. It’s all very well looking for a rigid and unyielding frame if you are a full-time bike rider and your body is accustomed to taking a beating every time you cycle. If you’re not, why put yourself through the post-ride, next-morning ache-fest?\nIf you’ve been used to riding a bike with an on-trend, oversized, tapered headstock and fork crown, you’ll notice that a lot less road buzz gets through to your hands — that’s because the front-end of the Vertigo is a more finely sculpted affair. In fact, the frame and fork both offer a more cosseted ride; they are mated to a Shimano WH-500 wheelset and fat Hutchinson Equinox 2 tyres, which absorb vibrations on rougher roads.\nSome modern bikes have front ends (headstock and forks) that hit bumps and ripples in the road like a powerboat smacking a wave — they just hit it, skim over it and plough on. The Bianchi’s front end is more like a surfboard being paddled out to a break; it seems to rise and fall with the waves, more riding the crest than battering both self and rider. That’s an exaggeration, of course, but you get the general idea.\nThe overall comfort of the ride is helped by a rather more relaxed C2C geometry than on Bianchi’s racier frames. The combination of more laid-back head and seat angles allied to a slightly more stretched-out wheelbase adds up to handling that’s lively and responsive without ever reacting to your input like a nervous racehorse. The combination of frame construction and geometry makes this a bike that’s very easy to get on with and just… ride.\nOn the money\nThe components on the bike are spot-on for this price-range. It’s rare that you find Shimano 105 cranks and geartrain as well as a wheelset, and the shifting is a slick step above the mix ’n’ match options you often find on bikes this price. The San Marco Ponza saddle is a decent touch, while the costs have been kept down with the own-brand Reparto Corse stem, non-ergo bars, seatpost and brakes. The brakes might look pretty, but they felt rather wooden — some initial bite but not much more, regardless of how much harder you squeezed those nicely sculpted Shimano 105 levers.\nFor those who still believe that stiffness or rigidity is the one true way for a road bike frame, well, walk away now. On the other hand, for those sportive riders who don’t enjoy having their fillings rattled out or bouncing sideways, this bike is worth throwing a leg over.\nNewcomers who fancy a slice of cycling history but don’t want to suffer for the privilege should book a test ride and start practising essential Italian — Vai, non è lontano!\nBianchi Vertigo 105 £1,600\nFrameset Carbon monocoque\nFork Carbon fork, aluminium steerer\nGears Shimano 105 10-speed\nChainset Shimano 105 (50/34)\nBrakes Reparto Corse\nWheels Shimano WH-R500\nTyres Hutchinson Equinox 2\nBars/stem Reparto Corse\nSaddle San Marco Ponza Power\nSeatpost Reparto Corse\nSize range 49, 51, 54, 57, 60cm\nWeight 8.6kg (18.96lbs)\nCannondale CAAD10 5\nIf Bianchi is old, then Cannondale is a thrusting young brand from the new world — Bethel, Pennsylvania, to be precise.

We thought he was underestimating our manly thews, but we weren’t laughing long.\nThe pressed steel bodywork sports a Dietzler Diamond Yellow finish that’s a real treat after the dark earth tones on so many brass-era cars, and makes it a popular attraction whenever Steve shows it. As a semi-retired teacher and a serious Studebaker collector, that’s part of the attraction for him, and he loves being able to use it as a platform to talk to younger enthusiasts about Studebaker’s significance in the early years of the industry. It’s a small car, but still sits up high to modern eyes, at 68 inches tall on 30-inch wood artillery-spoke wheels. He had the top up for us when we visited him, which adds another six inches of height.\nStarting is straightforward, and easier than many brass cars. Open the clamshell front hood to expose the big 155-cubic inch, 20hp inline four, and turn the stopcock to open the gas line. Back on the dashboard, you set the Remy ignition to battery (“B”) from its off position, set the throttle and retard the spark. And make sure it’s in neutral, the wheels are chocked and the handbrake is on, while you’re at it, as more than one early car owner was killed when hand cranking a car left in gear.\nBack under the hood, a brass priming-cup is located over each cylinder. Steve fills them to overflowing with gas from a plastic bottle (drenching the engine and whatever happens to be underneath in raw gasoline) and opens the petcocks to let gas prime the cylinders. Then, you’re ready to unstrap the crank at the front (held in the traditional non-thumb-breaking grip) and crank. Once it catches, it’s time to juggle the hand throttle on the steering column a little and switch the ignition over to the Splitdorf magneto. It sounds more complicated than it is, and aside from a little too much gas getting into the updraft carburetor at first, didn’t take more than five minutes until the car was ready to roll.\nIt’s a nicely broken-in straight-four, probably of about 4.5:1 compression—although no-one seems to know for sure—and not too hard to crank over. It sounds good, runs smoothly, and doesn’t require any spark adjustment for toodling around town after it’s warmed up, but boy, two 21st Century-sized people aren’t going to be strangers after five minutes side-by-side in the tufted-leather bench seat. After climbing up into the cabin, we had to use the door to squish ourselves in there. A toolbox on the drivers’ runningboard means both passengers enter from the other side. Once sitting down, we could tell how much change Steve had in his pocket, and the driver has to allow for the tall brass handbrake and shifter levers on the floor inside his right knee. We do not recommend slouching during gear changes.\nThe leather-faced cone clutch has a reputation for being persnickety, but Steve keeps his properly oil lubricated. The sliding gear three-speed transmission is located in a rear transaxle, and it’s almost like changing gears in a modern car. Brake and clutch pedals are located where you’d think and the contracting band brakes on the rear are certainly no worse than any of the car’s contemporaries—a very light 1,200 pound curb weight is a huge aid in this regard, and with a 4:1 rearend makes it quick off the line, too. Even the small accelerator pedal…button…between the two other pedals isn’t difficult to deal with, and the engine responds nicely to it.\nBut Steve wasn’t kidding about the worm-and-roller steering. Something was seriously out of whack, and it required a mammoth effort to get the wheel away from center, at which point the car darted nimbly for the ditch. And repeat, in the other direction. We paid so much attention to our drunken weaving that it was five minutes before we realized that we were being fooled by the reverse H pattern of the transaxle-mounted three-speed and grinding the gears, and there was nothing at all wrong with the drivetrain. “Keep trying,” said Steve, displaying no visible fear. Eventually, we settled into a steering rhythm and got the shift pattern down, and found that it was actually very easy shifting. In fact, the whole experience was quite easy and didn’t take much readjustment. Then we came to the first turn, and went sailing blithely off into the far reaches of the (thankfully deserted) intersection. For the record, Steve has since decided that a bad wobble in the right rear wheel was to blame: “What that’s doing is putting a torsional twist on the front axle. There also some loose play in the steering box; I’m going to have a machinist look at that, so hopefully I can drive it a little more safely in the summer.”\nWhen it’s all sorted out, a Flanders “20” has a reputation as a fine touring car. Without shock absorbers, the light weight again comes into play and allows the use of relatively soft springs for a reasonable ride. Third gear is a nice 0.875:1 overdrive, and the car is happy making long distance runs, including as the 1911 Glidden Tour pathfinder tour car, where it ran from New York City to Jacksonville, Florida. Flanders “20”s made other pathfinder trips in 1911 and ’12, including Seattle, Washington to Hazelton, British Columbia (over 850 miles), and an astonishing “Under Three Flags” run from Quebec to Mexico City—well over 3,000 miles!\nOf course, the Flanders “20” had to be good—Walter Flanders had it aimed straight at the Model T.\nThe Flanders occupied one brief, shining moment. Walter Flanders had entered the industry at Ford, where the huge man with the personality to match knocked heads with the puritanical Henry Ford. “The scuttlebutt that I’ve read is that [Walter Flanders] heard that Henry Ford was very jealous of him, because he was doing such a fantastic job in setting up some of the assembly lines and machine tools,” said Steve. “He heard Henry Ford was going to fire him because he was too good. So he ran up the stairs as fast as he could, and said, ‘You can’t fire me! I quit!’”\nHe turned up at E-M-F (as the “F”). Flanders had one mission in mind: Beating Ford at his own game, and the first E-M-Fs rolled off the line four months after Ford announced the Model T—and four months plus one week after Flanders walked out of Ford. But E and M—Everitt and Metzger—walked away from the company in 1909 to pursue other projects, sold their share to Studebaker, and took key personnel with them. While this elevated Flanders to President and GM, Studebaker, which was distributing the E-M-F, stocked the rest of the management at E-M-F with their people.\nSecond place had never been the goal for Flanders; he was determined to be one of the titans of Detroit. In July 1909, he convinced Studebaker to finance the acquisition of the assets of the DeLuxe Motor Company, whose factory and machinery he would use to produce the car that from job one would be made to beat Ford. Famously, Flanders opened his negations for DeLuxe in the morning, and two hours later started moving in. Poised to make the switch, he had 150 workers, materials and tooling on the way before the ink on the contract was dry.\nAt an announced price of $750, the Flanders “20” would beat the ($850) Model T at it’s own game, and offer more power and size, to boot. Few people have remarked on Henry Ford’s generosity to his competitors, however, and he wasn’t willing to be undercut in price by an upstart ex-employee for very long.\nFlanders debuted his car on a 100-inch wheelbase, with the sound cast-en-bloc four it carried for the next three years. As with a few other cars of the era, the engine was completely separate from the chassis in a subframe, making it easily removable. If this sounds to you like a recipe for success in commercial applications, you’re right, and they had good sales in that sector. That was only a side effect of their aims, though: According to John M. Daly’s of the E-M-F Registry, company publicist E. LeRoy Pelletier said that: “We expect this feature to revolutionize present garage practice which necessitates laying up the car for days at a time while some minor repair is being made. In case of any repair or replacement in a Flanders “20”, however serious or simple, the easiest way is to replace the entire unit, send the owner away rejoicing with his car and then, when time best suits and with parts most accessible, make the necessary repair at a minimum of time and expense.”\nIf the car (with the exception of a short-lived and disastrous experiment with a two-speed transmission, each one of which Flanders replaced at enormous expense) was going smoothly, the relationship with Studebaker was going downhill fast. In a letter sent simultaneously to South Bend, the Detroit press and the major car publications, Walter Flanders declared their relationship “rescinded and annulled.” John Daly writes that Flanders blamed “the failure of the South Bend people to accept and pay for contracted cars; their unfair discounting of the cars; their advertising which misled readers into believing Studebaker owned a controlling interest in E-M-F, which it did not. Thus was begun what was called the \"bitterest legal battle\" (The Automobile) and the \"most engrossing litigation\" (Motor Age) in the history of the industry thus far.”\nStudebaker’s Frederick Fisk brought out the big guns, and enlisted financier J.P. Morgan, who helped finance the acquisition of the remaining 64 percent of E-M-F they didn’t already own. For Flanders, this was Paul Revere riding with the news through his factory, and he realized that once again he was going to end up as second fiddle in the outfit. By February of 1911, he took Studebaker’s offer of $1,000,000, a $30,000 salary, one percent of the profits and a three-year contract as GM of Studebaker Cooperation in exchange for his interest. On Valentine’s Day, E-M-F and Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company merged.\nAgain, for Walter Flanders, nothing was simple. Even as he was assuming a leadership role at Studebaker, he assembled four other auto businesses into the Flanders Manufacturing Company. Studebaker was not amused, and while his contract there as General Manager seemed ironclad, that didn’t prevent them from creating a Corporate General Manager above him and installing James Newton Gunn.\nAnother acrimonious and public debate led to an unexpected result, when Flanders announced he’d reconciled with Everett and Metzger at the Metzger Motor Car Company (and if you’re not confused enough, they were building an automobile called the Everett 30 and later renamed the company for Flanders). Studebaker had enough, and to both parties’ relief, soon released Flanders from his contract.\nAt Studebaker, the fact that Flanders the man and Flanders the company were gone, and were now even competition, didn’t stop them from continuing to build a model with a sterling reputation. “The fact that Walter Flanders had struck out on his own had no bearing on Studebaker’s continuation of the model or name,” said Richard Quinn, Editor of the Antique Studebaker Review. “In fact it was the best-selling year with 14,562 units assembled,” or about half of total Flanders “20” production. John Daly adds that, “It may be more appropriate to call them ‘Studebaker E-M-Fs’ or ‘Studebaker Flanders.’ The technology used in the cars was purely E-M-F or Flanders, but after the acquisition by Studebaker, the Studebaker name started to appear more and more on the cars and advertisements.”\n“I love it when people ask, well, what happened to E-M-F, what happened to Flanders?” said Steve Dillon. “I say, ‘Well, when you see a Chrysler going down the road, you can thank E-M-F and Flanders, because of the direct relationship between Flanders, Maxwell and Walter Chrysler.’ There’s a tremendous amount of early history there, all the companies were buying and selling and being taken over, but if you look at the flow diagram, it’s really neat to see that so many automobiles of today, even Cadillac, have roots to E-M-F.”\nBy the end of 1912, Flanders had discovered that the company he’d joined wasn’t able to live up to it’s commitments, and in a complicated deal with Benjamin Briscoe, unloaded Everett/Metzger/Flanders to U.S. Motors—which he then acquired. After selling off the dross, a new company emerged, one that would have great and complicated future of its own: Maxwell.\nI’ve had in interest in Studebakers ever since I was 16 years old, and I used to get rides home from work with a fellow that had a ’57 Studebaker Golden Hawk. We used to drag race, and we used to kick ass on all the ’57 Chevys and the ’57 Fords and so forth, because we had a supercharger. Not quite so good off the line, but boy, once we got going up to 30, 40 miles an hour, when that supercharger kicked in, boy it was hell on wheels.\nWhen I was 12 years old, my dad bought me my first car, it was a 1930 Model A Ford, and he said, “Steve, you’re 12 years old now, you’ve got to start thinking about what you want to do in life. I’m going to do like my dad did: I’m going to buy you a car, and we’re going to restore it, and you’re going to learn all the basics about automobiles, in case that’s something you want to pursue when you want to get older.”\nThen I got into older Studebakers, and bought a 1921 Light-Six touring. I did a body-off restoration, and really enjoyed doing it, and enjoyed talking to people in the older Studebaker stuff, and that’s when I bought my Flanders.\nOne of the things I really love about the Studebaker, and the really early ones, is the fact that when you talk to people about Studebaker, they think about the bullet-nose, because they’re not old enough to realize that Studebaker has been around since 1902.\nP.O.

{"question":"¿Cómo afecta el monitoreo preciso del progreso médico a los resultados del tratamiento y qué papel juegan los factores de motivación en la adherencia del paciente?","answer":"Precise monitoring of medical progress allows for fine-tuning of therapeutic approaches and helps patients adapt to individual treatments by providing rapid reinforcement of positive actions and identifying unhelpful behaviors quickly. This monitoring, supported by electronic medical records and online communities, can help connect behavior to outcomes. Regarding motivation, the COM-B framework identifies two types that affect adherence: reflective motivation (including patient beliefs about treatment necessity and efficacy) and automatic motivation (including mood states and cognitive disorders). Both precise monitoring and proper motivation are essential for treatment success, as even the best medicines only work if patients take them regularly.","context":["Remarkable advances in biology and genetics offer the promise of understanding disease at the molecular level, enabling a healthful future where physicians can offer “personalized medicine”–the right treatments to the right patients at the right time–perhaps even before disease symptoms are present. However, unless this technological progress is coupled with advances in understanding of human behavior, our dreams of improved health may fall far short of the mark.\nCharacterizing illness at the molecular level has radically expanded our view of disease, allowing us to recognize that many of the terms we typically use–hypertension, cancer, etc.–actually obscure a dizzying array of disease subtypes that are distinguished through molecular fingerprints or “biomarker profiles.” Paul’s hypertension may not be the same as Judy’s hypertension–they may have profoundly different molecular causes and respond best to very different types of treatments. Understanding the different categories of disease, and segmenting a large patient population into smaller, more precisely defined classes, enables medical researchers to discover new, tailored treatments and considerably improve chances of survival and quality of life.\nOf course, those suffering from devastating conditions such as pancreatic cancer or ALS would embrace such targeted medicines immediately; for these patients, the new treatments would represent the difference between life and death.\nFor most patients, however, the individualized therapies promised by personalized medicine represent incremental improvements in the treatment of asymptomatic conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol and osteoporosis; will patients in the future embrace tailored treatments with more enthusiasm than patients diagnosed and treated today? Will a more personalized, more definitive risk assessment improve a patient’s willingness to adhere to a particular regimen? What will be the response of patients who learn about their susceptibility to cancer and heart disease years before these diseases show up?\nWe’ve already learned that behavioral improvement is urgently needed even when effective medications are available. While patients with acutely life-threatening conditions such as cancer and HIV are understandably quite diligent about their medicines, many of us tend to be more cavalier, especially if the condition seems relatively unobtrusive, such as high blood pressure or low bone density. Despite effective monitoring and treatment options, diabetes remains the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and amputation in the U.S. Similarly, while detection and treatment of high cholesterol has been clearly demonstrated to be of enormous benefit, less than half of patients who start on a statin even refill their prescription.\nThe best medicines only work if you take them. And many patients require cholesterol or diabetes medicine in the first place because they are unable to adjust their unhealthy eating and exercise habits. The bottom line is that changing behavior is as difficult as it is essential. Consequently, our ability to harvest the benefits of personalized medicine may depend upon our ability to meaningfully change our behavior.\nThe “behavior gap,” as we call this, is likely to increase as scientific advances create new, more precise risk assessments and expand our diagnostic tools. Many people will suddenly discover they are “at risk,” well before pharmacological treatments are available. In some cases the diagnostic testing may suggest the person is in a segment of patients for whom existing therapies have lower chances of success. Consequently, technological advances may actually further fuel the need for improved behavioral options.\nThe ability to monitor progress more precisely, and identify treatment response earlier, can allow for a fine-tuning of therapeutic approach, and can also help patients adapt to individual approaches. Monitoring could also help patients stick with treatment regimens, since the benefits of positive actions might yield rapid reinforcement, while unhelpful behaviors could be identified quickly and avoided in the future.\nInformation technology can also help close the behavior gap. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records will facilitate the organization of important health data, and will help patients and doctors connect behavior to outcome. Online communities of patients are also providing compelling behavioral support options, emphasizing both the increasingly important role of the Internet in health care as well as the trend for patients to play a central and more active role in the management of their own conditions.\nFor all the advances of modern science, the future of medicine will look a lot like the present, and will provide physicians and patients with many of the same challenges. While sophisticated science may yield a more precise segmentation of disease states, and a few magic bullets, we’ll likely still be left with many more diseases than drugs, and our health will likely continue to depend upon our ability to modify our behavior, whether that means passing on dessert or taking our medicines regularly.\nFortunately, the same medical technologies that enable us to gauge our risk may also provide us with opportunities to develop more effective behavioral strategies that can be targeted with exquisite precision. But if we let our excitement about molecular advances obscure the pressing medical need to improve our understanding of behavior, we may be surprised by how difficult it is to translate biological progress into something the really matters–improved health outcomes for patients.\nDavid Shaywitz, a physician-scientist, is a New Jersey-based management consultant in the health care practice of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Some of these are modifiable.\n- There is therefore a need for a comprehensive framework that assesses and understands adherence.\n- COM-B is a framework that encompasses Capability, Opportunity and Motivation, allowing a precise understanding of the relationship between the individual and adherence.\nA comprehensive framework for the assessment of adherence is needed\nNon-adherence is multi-faceted. Systematic reviews have suggested many reasons why patients may not adhere to their treatments.1 Some of these may be modifiable, such as patient understanding of their condition and the support available to them, and others may be fixed (such as the age and gender of the patient).1\nA review of 51 such systematic reviews, assessing non-adherence to therapies for chronic diseases in 19 categories, identified over 750 individual factor items. The majority of these were linked to the implementation of treatment, with a small proportion related to persistence.1\n|Treatment implementation1||How well a patient’s dosing corresponds to the prescribed dosing regimen|\n|Persistence1||The length of time between starting the medicine and taking the final dose before discontinuation|\nA large proportion of patients receiving treatment with PERT for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency may be non-adherent, despite improvement of symptoms being correlated with appropriate use.2,3 Possible reasons for non-adherence may include cost, incorrect timing of ingestion or inadequate dosing.4\nThis suggests that multifaceted interventions may be required to satisfactorily address poor adherence.1 This might include support from friends and family of the patient.5\nCOM-B – a new approach to classifying causes of non-adherence\nCOM-B is a framework for understanding behavior.6 The factors that influence health-related behaviors can be divided into three categories:6,7\n|Capability||‘The physical or psychological ability to engage in the activity concerned’, e.g. a patient receiving PERT may find it difficult to swallow their medication, or struggle to remember to take it|\n|Opportunity||‘All the factors that lie outside the individual that make the behavior possible, or prompt it’, e.g. the patient may be unable to access appropriate healthcare due to its cost|\n|Motivation||‘Brain processes that energize and direct behavior’, e.g. a patient with chronic pancreatitis may not feel they need to take their treatment when symptoms are not bothersome|\nThe basis of the model is that the interaction between these three elements results in Behavior. Each of them can directly impact on behavior – opportunity and capability may also influence motivation. Since performance of a behavior itself may influence capability, opportunity and motivation, the framework can be considered dynamic.7\nCOM-B has now been applied to adherence, and can be used as a starting point to choose effective interventions in clinical practice.7\nDefinition: The individual’s psychological and physical ability to engage in an activity, including the possession of the necessary knowledge and skills.6\nPsychological factors relating to adherence would include understanding of the disease and treatment, memory, capacity to make judgements, and the capacity to plan.7\nPhysical capabilities can be important in allowing patients to adapt to changes in their lifestyle, such as diet or social behaviors. The ability to swallow, or general dexterity, may be important in allowing patients to self-administer medications.7\nDefinition: Factors that either make a behavior possible, or prompt it. These are categorized by physical and social factors.7\nPhysical, in this context, relates to the physical opportunity possible within the environment. For adherence, this would include factors such as cost of and access to medication, the medication itself (its route of administration, and if oral, its taste, smell, size and shape) and the complexity of the dosing regimen.7\nSocial opportunity factors would include social support, and also takes into account the standard of communication between the patient and their doctor.7\nDefinition: Brain processes that energize and direct behavior. As part of the COM-B framework, these motivational factors are described as either ‘Reflective’ or ‘Automatic’.7\nReflective motivations include evaluations and plans. This would include patient perception of illness (such as its cause, consequences and whether acute or chronic), their beliefs about the treatment (e.g. whether they need it, how well it works, concerns about current and future and adverse events), what they expect to be the outcome of treatment, and their self-efficacy in terms of sticking to their treatment.7\nAutomatic motivations are formed by associative learning and innate dispositions. These include cues for action, mood states and any cognitive/mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety, that may have an impact on adherence.7\nCOM-B – advantages in characterizing adherence\nAs a broader model than its predecessors, such as social cognition models, COM-B has various advantages in explaining adherence behavior.

{"question":"How do terraced craters on Mars provide evidence of subsurface ice, and how does the planet's orbital eccentricity affect the stability of this ice throughout its seasons? 🤔","answer":"Terraced craters on Mars indicate the presence of subsurface ice because they form when impact shock waves propagate differently through layers of varying materials. In Arcadia Planitia, researchers found an enormous slab of water ice 40 meters thick beneath the surface, covering an area equivalent to California and Texas combined. This ice's stability is affected by Mars' high orbital eccentricity, which causes the planet's distance from the Sun to vary from 1.64 AU to 1.36 AU over a Martian year. Combined with its axial tilt, this creates extreme seasonal changes that should theoretically cause the ice to sublimate into the atmosphere. This variation in solar distance means that southern hemisphere summers are much warmer than northern ones, as Mars is closer to the Sun during southern summer.","context":["26 August 2015\nTerraced craters: Windows into Mars’ icy past\nPosted by lcooper\nBy Robin Tricoles\nIt was a “crazy-looking crater” on the face of Mars that caught Ali Bramson’s eye. But it was a simple calculation that explained the crater’s strange shape.\nCombining data gleaned from two powerful instruments aboard NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, or MRO, Bramson and her colleagues determined why the crater is terraced — not bowl-shaped, like most craters of this size.\nA digital terrain model of the crater researchers investigated as part of a new study in Geophysical Research Letters.\nCredit: Ali Bramson, American Geophysical Union\n“Craters should be bowl-shaped, but this one had terraces in the wall,” said Bramson, a graduate student in the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) in Tucson.\nTerraces can form when there are layers of different materials in the planet’s subsurface, such as dirt, ice or rock.\n“When the crater is forming, the shock wave from an object hitting a planet’s surface propagates differently depending on what substrates are beneath the area of impact,” Bramson said. “If you have a weaker material in one layer, the shock wave can push out that material more easily, and the result is terracing at the interface between the weaker and stronger materials.”\n“It’s worth mentioning that terraced craters of this size are quite rare,” said Shane Byrne, an associate professor with the LPL. “But in this area of Mars (Arcadia Planitia), there are a lot of terraced craters. The craters may have formed at different times, but they all have terraces, which indicates something weird is going on in the subsurface.”\nThanks to Mars’ unstable obliquity — the degree the planet tilts on its axis — its climate changes often. Unlike Earth, Mars doesn’t have a large moon to keep it stable. Instead, it wobbles on its axis, and that wobbling leads to dramatic climatic shifts. Those shifts, in turn, have led to intermittent ice ages.\nUsing MRO’s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, or HiRISE, camera, which is operated out of LPL, the researchers created three-dimensional models of the area’s craters, which allowed them to measure the depth of their terraces. The researchers then used MRO’s Shallow Radar, or SHARAD, instrument to beam radar pulses to Mars, allowing them to measure the time it took for the radar signals to penetrate the surface’s buried layers and bounce back.\nBramson combined the two data sets to measure the radar waves’ speed, a pivotal clue to the layers’ composition.\nIn this crater’s case, the layers turned out to be ice, and lots of it. Just beneath Mars’ dirt surface, or regolith, the researchers found an enormous slab of water ice, measuring 40 meters (130 feet) thick, and covering an area equivalent to that of California and Texas combined. The researchers’ results were published today in Geophysical Research Letters, an American Geophysical Union journal.\nWhile the presence of ice came as little surprise to Bramson and Byrne, its age, amount and location did. Although scientists have known for some time about Mars’ icy deposits at its poles and have used them to look at its climatic history, knowledge of icy layers at the planet’s midlatitudes, analogous to earthly latitudes falling between the Canadian-U.S. border and Kansas, is something new.\n“Knowing where the ice is and how thick it is can tell you about Mars’ past climates,” Byrne said. “The fact that the ice is so thick and widespread leads us to think it came into place during one of Mars’ past climates when it snowed a bunch, ice accumulated, was buried, and then preserved.\n“There have been a lot of climate changes between now and the tens of millions of years ago when we suspect the ice was put there. But it shouldn’t be stable today, and other past climates of ice instability in this region mean the ice should’ve sublimated away into the dry Martian atmosphere by now. So, that’s what we need to investigate.\n“What kept the ice around all this time? There’s no climate model that we have now that explains this.”\n– Guest blogger Robin Tricoles is a science writer at the University of Arizona.

On Earth, axial tilt determines nearly all of the annual variation, because Earth's orbit is nearly circular. But Mars has the highest orbital eccentricity of any planet except Mercury and Pluto; the distance from the Sun to Mars varies from 1.64 AU to 1.36 AU over a martian year. This large variation, combined with an axial tilt slightly greater than Earth's, gives rise to seasonal changes far greater than those we experience even in the coldest areas on our own planet.\nThe temperature of a location on a planet is largely determined by the amount of sunlight falling on that location. If planets had no axial tilt, then the temperature would be greatest at the equator, where sunlight falls most directly, and would drop towards the poles. However, if the planet has axial tilt, the angle at which sunlight falls on a point will change throughout the year. For example, the poles will be in darkness for half the year, and in sunlight the other half.\nThe effect of the axial tilt of Mars can be seen in the following image. The topmost image shows the vernal equinox, or start of spring in the northern hemisphere, when the sun falls directly at the equator. On the left is the summer solstice, when the pole is in sunlight during the entire day. At the bottom is the autumnal equinox, when the sun again falls directly at the equator, and finally on the right is the winter solstice, when the north pole is in continuous darkness.\nNote that the solstices and equinoxes are named for the seasons in the northern hemisphere; conditions are reversed in the southern hemisphere. Scientists studying seasonal changes on Mars often use the solar longitude (also known as L sub s or Ls), to indicate the season. Ls is the angle from the Mars-Sun line to the Mars-Sun line at the vernal equinox, so at the vernal equinox, Ls is 0. For example, at the summer solstice, Ls is 90, and at the winter solstice, Ls is 270.\nAnnual variations, such as the growing and shrinking of the polar caps, have been observed from Earth for hundreds of years, although it was not until spacecraft visited the Red Planet that it was recognized that these variable caps are not composed of water, but of carbon dioxide (CO2) frost. During the polar darkness, temperatures drop below the point at which CO2, the primary constituent of the martian atmosphere, turns from a gas to a solid. So much carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere that the global atmospheric pressure decreases by 25%.\nWe can see this variation in measurements taken by Viking Lander 1. This table, of average atmospheric pressure over the course of three martian years, shows that the pressure at VL1 changes from less than 7 millibars (mb) to almost 9 millibars over a year.\nday of year pressure (mb) ---- -------- 0 8.0 57 8.25 114 8.4 172 7.75 229 7.0 286 6.9 343 7.25 400 8.0 458 8.8 515 8.9 572 8.5 629 8.0\nThe atmospheric pressure is controlled by a complex balance between the cold and warm pole. When the south pole is in total darkness, the north pole is experiencing continuous sunlight, so we might expect that the pressure would stay roughly constant over the year, as CO2 vaporized at one pole only to freeze at the other. However, remember the eccentricity of Mars' orbit -- this causes the solar input when one pole is in sunlight to be significantly different than that when the other pole is in sunlight. We can plot the solar input, or insolation, as a function of time in the martian year (horizontal axis, with the start of northern spring at the left) vs. latitude (vertical axis, with the south pole at the bottom.) Blue indicates the least insolation, and red the most.\nInsolation at noon\nPressure at VL1\nNote that the insolation image shows that summer in the southern hemisphere is much warmer than summer in the northern hemisphere, because Mars is farther from the Sun during northern summer. (In contrast, the eccentricity of Earth's orbit is low, and although Earth is actually closer to the Sun during northern winter, the effect of the small variation in solar distance is not noticable.)\nBelow the insolation plot, we have plotted the pressure at VL1 as a smooth curve. Note that it reaches a maximum during southern spring and summer, has its deepest minimum near the end of southern winter, and has a smaller minimum at the start of northern spring.\nIn 1977, Viking Orbiter 2 acquired sporadic coverage of the recession of the southern polar cap. Using software developed for Mars Observer Camera (MOC) mission planning, I took 300 VO2 images and constructed the following crude \"movie\" of the cap shrinking. (Unfortunately, variability in lighting and resolution caused by the eccentricity of VO2's orbit, and the use of different filters and exposure times, make the quality of these mosaics rather poor. In 1998, we hope to make a one-frame-per-day movie of the cap recession, in color and with uniform resolution and brightness, using MOC2 data from Mars Global Surveyor.)\nOrbit 142 Ls 183.1 1/9/1977\nOrbit 161 Ls 195.2 1/30/1977\nOrbit 163 Ls 196.5 2/7/1977\nOrbit 241 Ls 247.0 4/24/1977\nOrbit 267 Ls 262.2 5/19/1977\nOrbit 287 Ls 274.5 6/7/1977\nOrbit 292 Ls 277.5 6/11/1977\nOrbit 313 Ls 289.7 7/1/1977\nOrbit 335 Ls 302.2 7/22/1977\nOrbit 348 Ls 306\nOrbit 352 Ls 311.8 8/7/1977\nOrbit 402 Ls 338.2 9/23/1977Mike Caplinger (email@example.com)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e10fc4d7-119b-4bde-8d06-eb04a38e9b4c>","<urn:uuid:7c215132-77c7-4b2e-871d-d915576b7f9c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can anyone tell me difference between missile defense and herbal medicine studies from 1500s? Both look important for humanity! 🤔","answer":"While both fields are significant, they serve very different purposes. Missile defense, as discussed in Contemporary Nuclear Debates, is focused on current global security threats, particularly against weapons of mass destruction, with various deployment systems like sea-based and space-based options being debated. In contrast, herbal medicine studies from the 1500s, as exemplified by Leonhart Fuchs's work, focused on documenting and understanding medicinal plants. Fuchs created detailed drawings of approximately 500 plants and documented their medicinal uses, establishing one of the first German botanical gardens in 1535 and advocating for the use of simple herbs rather than complex medieval concoctions.","context":["The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in the hands of both states and terrorist networks, is considered by many to be the greatest threat to global security today.

His chief notability is as the author of a large book about plants and their uses as medicines, a herbal, which was first published in 1542 in Latin. It has about 500 accurate and detailed drawings of plants, which were printed from woodcuts. The drawings are the book's most notable advance on its predecessors. Although drawings had been used in other herbal books, Fuchs's herbal book proved and emphasized high-quality drawings as the most telling way to specify what a plant name stands for.\nFuchs was born in 1501 in Wemding in the Duchy of Bavaria. After attending a school in Heilbronn, Fuchs enrolled at the University of Erfurt. In 1521 he became Magister Artium at the University of Ingolstadt, and received his medical doctorate there in 1524.\nFrom 1524–26 he practised as a doctor in Munich, until he received a chair of medicine at the University of Ingolstadt in 1526. From 1528–31 he was the personal physician of Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach in Ansbach.\nFuchs was called to Tübingen by Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg in 1533 to help in reforming the University of Tübingen in the spirit of humanism. He created its first medicinal garden in 1535 and served as chancellor seven times, spending the last thirty-one years of his life as professor of medicine. Fuchs died in Tübingen in 1566. For the 500th anniversary of his birth, a glass and steel pavilion was opened in 2001 in the Botanischer Garten der Universität Tübingen.\nLike his medieval predecessors and his contemporaries, Fuchs was heavily influenced by the three Greek and Roman writers on medicine and materia medica, Dioscorides, Hippocrates, and Galen. He wanted to fight the Arab hegemony in medicine, as it had been transmitted by the Medical School of Salerno, and to \"return\" to the Greek authors. But he saw the importance of practical experience as well and offered botanical field days for the students, where he demonstrated the medicinal plants in situ. He founded one of the first German botanical gardens.\nEponymy (proper name)\nFuchs' name is preserved by the plant Fuchsia, discovered in the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean in 1696/97 by the French scientist and Minim monk Charles Plumier. He published the first description of \" Fuchsia triphylla, flore coccineo\" in 1703. It is sometimes thought that the color fuchsia is also named for Fuchs, but that derives from fuchsine, an early trade name for the dye rosaniline hydrochloride, which produces a brilliant pink-purple color. Magenta is another competing trade name for the same dye in England. The dye was given the name of fuchsine in France by its original manufacturer Renard frères et Franc to capitalize both on the increasing popularity of the genus Fuchsia in fashionable gardens and the fact that Renard in French and Fuchs in German both mean fox. An 1861 article in Répertoire de Pharmacie in fact confirms that the name was simply chosen for these two reasons and irrelevant of the actual colors of any flowers in the genus Fuchsia.\n- Errata recentiorum medicorum (\"Errors of recent doctors\") (Hagenau, 1530), his first publication, in which he argued for the use of \"simples\" (herbs) rather than the noxious \"compounds\" of arcane ingredients concocted in medieval medicine.\n- De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes (\"Notable commentaries on the history of plants\", Basel, 1542), his great herbal, which was offered, with varying degrees of fidelity to his text, as \"New Kreüterbuch\" in a German translation (1543), \"New Herbal\" in English, \"Den nieuwen Herbarius, dat is dat boeck van den cruyden\" (1543) in Dutch.\nFuchs tried to identify the plants described by the classical authors. Over a decade, Fuchs began to prepare for the publication of his herbal. He stocked the garden attached to his house with rare specimens solicited from friends around Europe, and he assembled a large botanical library. The book contains the description of about 400 wild and more than 100 domesticated plant species and their medical uses (\"Krafft und Würckung\") in alphabetical order: Fuchs made no attempt at presenting them in a natural system of classification. The first reports of Zea mays and of chili peppers were among the exotic new species. The text is mainly based on Dioscorides. The book contains 512 pictures of plants, largely growing locally, in woodcuts. The illustrators were Heinrich Füllmaurer and Albrecht Meyer, the woodcutter Veit Rudolph Speckle, portraits of whom are contained in the volume. It was printed at the famous shop of Michael Isengrin in Basel. Its appeal to gardeners, botanists, bibliophiles, and the casual viewer was immediate, while the clarity of its plant pictures continues to define a standard for botanical illustrators.\n- Eyn Newes hochnutzlichs Büchlin/und Anothomi eynes auffgethonen augs/auch seiner erklärung bewerten purgation/Pflaster/Tollirien/Sälblin pulvern unnd wassern/wie mans machen und brauchen sol (A new, very useful book and anatomy of the open eye/also an explanation of useful purgatives/plasters/poultices/salves, powders and waters/how one should make and use them), 1539.\n- Alle Kranckheyt der Augen (All diseases of the eye), 1539.\n- Den nieuwen herbarius (in Dutch).

{"question":"what common maintenance technique helps prevent dental issues pets humans","answer":"Regular brushing is the primary maintenance technique for both pets and humans. For pets, it's described as one of the most important steps in dental health, requiring a special pet toothbrush with soft bristles and pet-specific toothpaste. For humans, while brushing is essential, it's noted that brushing alone isn't enough - even with regular brushing and flossing, both pets and humans will develop plaque and calculus buildup that requires professional cleaning to remove.","context":["National Pet Dental Health Month\nFebruary is National Pet Dental Health Month! Proper pet oral hygiene can help protect pets from serious health and dental problems, including periodontal disease, gum disease, and other related illnesses. Comment below some tips and trick you have for keeping your pet’s dental health in check!\nWhat is Periodontal Disease?\nPeriodontal disease is when plaque accumulates on the tooth and irritates and inflames the gum line and surrounding areas.¹ It affects 80% of dogs and 70% of cats.\nSymptoms of periodontal disease include:\n- Bleeding or inflamed gums\n- Discolored teeth\n- Loose or missing teeth\n- Bad breath\n- Weight loss\n- Bloody or “ropey” saliva\n- Drop in appetite\n- Favoring one side of the mouth when chewing\n- Excessive drooling\n- Blood in water bowl or on chew toys¹\nHow to Stay on Top of Your Pet’s Dental Health!\n- Brush your pet’s teeth regularly\n- Consider water additives for pets that don’t like teeth cleaning\n- Use pet dental chews\n- Provide pet toys that can help keep their teeth healthy\n- Visit the vet for regular checkups and cleanings\nBrush Your Pet’s Teeth Regularly\nDon’t turn your nose to your dog’s bad breath! Brushing your pet’s teeth regularly is one of the most important steps in pet dental health. Regular brushing of your pet’s teeth is one of the most effective ways to maintain oral hygiene. Pet owners should use a toothbrush specifically designed for pets, which has softer bristles than human toothbrushes. To make brushing easier, you can use a pet toothpaste that comes in several flavors. If your pet does not like their teeth brushed, start by getting them used to having their mouth and teeth touched before starting regular brushing.\nFor pets that don’t like having their teeth brushed, bluestem and Zymox water additives can be used to help reduce plaque buildup on pet’s teeth. Bluestem water additives are created with coactiv+ and scientifically formulated to improve your pet’s breath while simultaneously reducing the accumulation of biotin and bacteria. This additive is easy to apply; just place two capfuls into your pet’s water bowl every day for the best results. Next, Zymox can be used for both cats and dogs because it contains no xylitol. It’s recommended for all pets in need of gentle, non-drying everyday oral care. This can help pet owners maintain pet dental health without having to brush their pet’s teeth every day if their pet doesn’t enjoy that process.\nPet Dental Chews\nFurthermore, using pet dental chews is another important step in pet oral hygiene. Pet dental chews, like Benebone, are designed to reduce plaque build-up and freshen breath by gently scraping off tartar, plaque, and bacteria when your dog chews. In addition to pet dental chews, other products like Greenies and Nylabone for puppies can help keep your pet’s teeth clean. They are also designed to scrape off plaque and tartar build-up while providing a tasty treat.\nDental toys, like Mammoth, are also great for helping maintain your pet’s dental health. The chewing action helps stimulate their gums and remove some of the plaque from their teeth, similar to floss. Provide pet toys that are specifically designed to promote healthy chewing habits to naturally keep your pet’s teeth clean and gums healthy.\nSchedule Teeth Cleanings with Your Vet\nIn addition to at-home pet dental care, it is important to schedule regular visits with your veterinarian for professional cleanings and checkups, similar to humans. During these vet visits, the pet’s teeth will be examined closely for signs of disease or infection and any signs of tartar or plaque will be professionally removed to prevent any serious illnesses from occurring or progressing further.\nBy following these simple guidelines during National Pet Dental Health Month – and all year long – pet owners can help protect their beloved furry friends from unnecessary health issues associated with poor oral hygiene. A healthy mouth can mean a longer and healthier life for your pet, so why wait? Happy National Pet Dental Health Month and happy brushing!\n¹“Guilford-Jamestown Veterinary Hospital.” Vets in Greensboro NC: Greensboro Veterinarians and Animal Hospital, https://www.guilfordjamestownvet.com/site/blog-greensboro-vet/2020/08/13/periodontal-disease-dogs-symptoms-causes-treatment","Prevention is Key – Routine dental exams & Hygiene visits twice per year\nAn ounce of prevention…The best way to maintain a healthy mouth and to save money on dental care is to have routine comprehensive dental exams. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that adults and children have a dental exam approximately every six months.\nWhat is done in a routine dental exam?\nAt a routine exam (dental checkup) we examine the outside of your mouth (including the TMJ or jaw joint), and the inside of your mouth. We check to make sure that the tissues in your mouth are healthy, and we examine your gums to check for gum disease and/or periodontal disease. And of course, we check your teeth to make sure that all of your existing crowns and fillings are intact, and to make sure that you don’t have any new cavities present. And as part of our intraoral exam, we perform an oral cancer screening.\nA Cleaning Every Six Months is Critical\nThe ADA recommends that you have a dental cleaning and exam every six months.\nBrushing alone isn’t enough\nMany people believe that they don’t need to have dental cleanings because they brush and floss their teeth regularly. And others think that they can skip brushing and flossing and that having their dental cleaning will “fix everything.” In fact, both assumptions are wrong.\nAs much as you brush and floss at home, you will get a buildup of plaque and hardened plaque (calculus) that you simply cannot remove with a toothbrush. Some people have light amounts of this type of buildup, and other people have extensive buildup. Regardless of the cause, only a professional cleaning can remove this type of debris on your teeth.\nAnd if you don’t brush and wait until your cleaning to care for your teeth, the chronic inflammation you will likely have can lead to serious problems\nWhat if I don’t have regular dental cleanings?\nIf you don’t have regular dental cleanings or if you don’t take care of your teeth in between cleanings, you may wind up losing teeth. You won’t lose teeth right away, but not caring for your teeth over a long period of time can lead to chronic inflammation and weakening of the gum tissues that hold the teeth in place. This condition is called periodontal disease (gum disease), and in many cases, it’s preventable.\nDo I need x-rays at every visit?\nGenerally speaking, no. We do take a full set of x-rays the first time you see us as a patient, and after that we recommend a full set every 3-5 years. And although the levels of radiation used in dental x-rays are incredibly low (we use digital x-rays for the lowest exposure possible), we do need to take routine check-up x-rays when indicated.\nPatients who have a history of extensive decay, or with conditions that can lead to decay such as dry mouth (xerostomia), often need x-rays more frequently than patients who have never had a cavity, and who have normal flow of saliva.\nContact us today to schedule your exam & cleaning – it’s never too late to get a fresh start with your oral home care."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd49beb5-04c9-44c1-b528-b01473530e13>","<urn:uuid:460e6445-c217-4f9c-8a3e-2237b5c2fb02>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is allopatric speciation and how does geographical isolation contribute to the formation of new species?","answer":"Allopatric speciation is the process of new species formation through genetic divergence following geographical isolation. It occurs when different populations of a single species become separated and cease to interbreed over time. The formation of new species happens due to changes in genetic makeup resulting from adaptation to different environments or through genetic drift. A classic example is the evolution of different but related species on islands separated from mainland populations.","context":["How do new species form? One key process is by genetic divergence following geographical isolation – allopatric speciation. This can happen when different populations of a single species are separated, cease to have contact over time and no longer interbreed. This separation, divergence and formation of new species will often be attributed to changes in genetic makeup as a result of adaptation to different environments or ecosystems, or simply to accumulated genetic changes - genetic drift.\nWhen it's difficult for individuals from the population to cross geographical barriers, it's possible to explain how isolation of populations occurs, and therefore why speciation has happened. An example would be the different but related species found on islands separated from the mainland, where a few individuals managed to cross the water barrier and form a new population that eventually became a distinct new species. Charles Darwin collected specimens of mockingbirds on the Galapagos, for example, that are related to mainland species but which have diverged from the parent population to become a separate species, living in a new and different environment.\nIn the sea, however, many animals have pelagic larvae – free-floating planktonic forms - that can be carried for many hundreds of kilometres in currents, even though the adults have limited mobility on the sea bed. This pelagic mobility means that closely related species from different places are potentially connected over distances of 1,000 km or more, so it is unclear how allopatric speciation is achieved – the populations appear to be capable of connection in geographical terms.\nZoology PhD student Martine Claremont, together with her Museum supervisors Drs Suzanne Williams and David Reid, and university supervisor Professor Tim Barraclough, sampled populations of the intertidal muricid gastropod genus Stramonita (a marine snail) throughout the Atlantic Ocean and used statistical analysis of DNA sequences to identify the number of distinct species, their distributions and relationships.\nFor species in which the larvae spend only a short time in the plankton, it is possible for populations to be clearly isolated geographically by currents, island chains or other factors such as the immense flow of fresh water flowing from the mouth of the Amazon. However, Stramonita spends 2-3 months as a planktonic larval form, theoretically permitting genetic contact across the entire ocean basin, which might lead to expectations that a single population would be found around the Atlantic.\nStramonita brasiliensis, the new species described in the work (E, Plymouth, Tobago, BMNH acc. no. 2341; F, holotype, Sao Paulo, Brazil, BMNH 20100324)\nHowever, Martine and her supervisors found five distinct species in the Atlantic (one of which is described as new). They suggest that this speciation might be attributed in part to past changes or interruptions in ocean currents, preventing free circulation and isolating populations for sufficient time to enable speciation. Other factors that seem to be of importance are the ancient separation of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico and the development of ecological specialization.\nClaremont, M., Williams, S.T., Barraclough, T.G., Reid, D.G.

{"question":"When measuring flour for baking and handling raw ingredients safely, what's the correct technique for measuring, and what safety precautions should I take to avoid contamination? Please help!!","answer":"For measuring flour properly, you should use the 'spoon & level' method: scoop flour into the measuring cup using a spoon without packing it down or tapping the cup, then level off the top with a knife. Never scoop directly with the measuring cup as this could result in 150% of the correct measurement. For safety, it's crucial to handle raw ingredients properly to prevent contamination. Don't wash raw meat or poultry as this can spread germs to countertops and other surfaces. Additionally, avoid eating raw batter or dough containing flour or eggs since these may contain harmful bacteria like E. coli or Salmonella. Always wash hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds with soap and running water before and during food preparation.","context":["Today we’re focusing on something that may seem trivial to you, but it is easily the most important step in every recipe you bake. Measuring ingredients properly is imperative. The difference between a recipe success and a recipe failure could lie within 1 mis-measured tablespoon of flour or sugar. I’m being serious!\nBaking is not very forgiving. It is a science. (Nerds unite.) Estimating the measurements of an ingredient in a recipe spells disaster. While you can easily get away with a handful of this or that when you’re cooking dinner, even the slightest miscalculation could turn your soft-baked chocolate chip cookies into rocks. Understanding the correct measuring technique for a particular ingredient will guarantee better baking results. Soft cookies, fluffy cakes, flaky crust!\nIn terms of measuring your ingredients, it pays off to be a perfectionist.\nFlour is the most common mis-measured ingredient.\nWhen measuring flour, use the “spoon & level” method. Do not scoop the flour out of the container/bag with your measuring cup. Believe me, I catch myself doing it often! Scoop the flour and you could end up with 150% of the correct measurement. Rather, using a spoon, scoop the flour into the measuring cup. Do not pack the flour down and do not tap the measuring cup– both cause the flour to settle in the cup. After you’ve spooned the flour into the measuring cup, use the back of a knife to level off the top of the measuring cup.\nDrill this in your head: spoon & level flour– do NOT scoop.\nI often use dry old-fashioned rolled oats in recipes like granola, oatmeal bars, or oatmeal cookies. These are also called whole oats. Sometimes I use quick oats, which are finely chopped whole oats. Quick oats have a more powdery consistency than whole oats. I actually never keep quick oats in the house. However, some recipes call for quick oats (when a more powdery, fine oat is ideal). To make my own quick oats, I simply grind up whole oats in the blender or food processor for about 3 seconds. A few quick pulses chops them up into quick-oat-consistency.\nMake sure you are using the correct type of oats that the recipe calls for. To measure oats, use the same spoon & level method that you use with flour. (see above!)\nBaking Powder & Baking Soda\nShake up the baking powder or baking soda container a bit. Using a measuring spoon, lightly scoop out of the container. Use a knife to level it off.\nAlways remember the differences between the two. Each expire after 6 months, though I find they begin losing strength after 3 months. Write the date on the box so you know when to replace.\nActive Dry Yeast\nTypical yeast packets are 2 and 1/4 teaspoons, which is 1/4 ounce. Measure yeast how you would measure baking powder or soda. Check to see if your yeast is active by sprinkling it in a small dish with 2 Tablespoons of warm water (105F-115F degrees) and waiting about 5 minutes for it to begin foaming. If the mixture does not foam, the yeast is not active. This little step is called proofing the yeast. Some recipes already work “proofing” into the first step.\nWhite (Granulated) Sugar\nUnlike flour, sugar is measured by scooping the measuring cup or spoon into the container/bag until it is overflowing, then leveling it off with the back of a knife. Sugar is more forgiving in recipes than other ingredients because the sweetness of a finished product depends on your tastebuds. However, it is always best to measure the ingredients exactly as the recipe states because sugar crystals are imperative to break down other ingredients. Sugar also aids in proper browning and stabilization.\nMeasure brown sugar like you would granulated sugar. Unless the recipe states otherwise, brown sugar should be packed into the measuring cup or measuring spoon. For most of my recipes, I pack the brown sugar.\nConfectioners’ Sugar (Powdered Sugar/Icing Sugar)\nI usually always sift confectioners’ sugar. I especially do this when I make frosting to avoid lumps. You don’t always have to sift confectioners’ sugar (unless the recipe calls for it), I just prefer it. Whether you sift or not, confectioners’ sugar must be measured using the spoon & level method– explained in the flour section above.\n1 cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted means that the sugar is sifted after measuring.\n1 cup sifted confectioners’ sugar means that the sugar is sifted before measuring.\nThis is the case with any ingredient, not just confectioners’ sugar.\nLike confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder is full of lumps. If a recipe calls for sifting it, make sure you do so. Measure cocoa powder using the spoon & level method, as you would measure flour or confectioners’ sugar.\n(maple syrup, agave, honey, molasses)\nTo easily measure and use sticky liquid sweeteners in your recipe, spray the inside of the measuring cup lightly with nonstick spray. This will make it much easier to get the sweetener out of the cup! I do this with sticky, thick sweeteners every time.\nOther Liquid Ingredients\n(oil, water, milk)\nLiquids like water or oil need to be measured at eye level. Using a liquid measuring cup, pour the liquid into the cup. Then, bend down to make sure the liquid is EXACTLY at level with the measuring requirement from the recipe.\n(chocolate chips, dried fruit, chopped candy, sprinkles, etc)\nEasy. Just scoop or pour into the measuring cup. These ingredients aren’t typically used to make up the structure of a baked good.\n(applesauce, yogurt, sour cream, peanut butter, etc)\nMeasure semi-liquid ingredients in dry measuring cups. They are much too thick to be accurately measured in liquid cups. Spoon & level, like you do with sugar or flour, then use a rubber spatula to help release the ingredients into the mixing bowl.\nI find these baking equivalent charts helpful when I’m in the kitchen.\nDry Ingredient Equivalents:\n- 1 Tablespoon = 3 teaspoons\n- 1/8 cup = 2 Tablespoons\n- 1/4 cup = 4 Tablespoons\n- 1/3 cup = 5-1/3 Tablespoons\n- 1/2 cup = 8 Tablespoons\n- 2/3 cup = 10-2/3 Tablespoons\n- 3/4 cup = 12 Tablespoons\n- 1 cup = 16 Tablespoons\nLiquid Ingredient Equivalents:\n- 1 cup = 8 fluid ounces = 1/2 pint\n- 2 cups = 16 fluid ounces = 1 pint\n- 4 cups = 32 fluid ounces = 2 pints = 1 quart\n- 8 cups = 64 fluid ounces = 4 pints\n- 4 quarts = 128 fluid ounces = 1 gallon\nThe most accurate way to measure? Weigh your ingredients!\nWeighing takes out the guesswork.\nWeighing is how I measure when developing recipes. Some people might say it’s a waste of time, but if you want the exact results you see on my blog and in my books– weighing your ingredients will help you get there. A cup isn’t always a cup, but a gram/ounce is always a gram/ounce. Here is the food scale I own.\nI refer to this master chart often. If you can’t find an ingredient listed below, go there!\nHere are a few common ingredients:\n- 1 cup all-purpose flour = 125 grams (4 1/2 ounces)\n- 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour = 115 grams (4 ounces)\n- 1 cup bread flour = 130 grams (4 1/2 ounces)\n- 1 cup sifted bread flour = 121 grams (4 1/4 ounces)\n- 1 cup (packed) brown sugar = 200 grams (7 1/2 ounces)\n- 1/2 cup butter = 1 stick = 115 grams (4 ounces)\n- 1 cup cake flour = 115 grams (4 ounces)\n- 1 cup sifted cake flour = 100 grams (3 1/2 ounces)\n- 1 cup chocolate chips = 180 grams (6 1/4 ounces)\n- 1/2 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder = 41 grams (1.6 ounces)\n- 1 cup confectioners’ sugar = 120 grams (4 1/4 ounces)\n- 1 cup sifted confectioners’ sugar = 115 grams (4 ounces)\n- 1/4 cup cornstarch = 28 grams (1 ounce)\n- 1 cup granulated sugar = 200 grams (7 1/2 ounces)\n- 1 Tablespoon honey = 21 grams (3/4 ounce)\n- 1/2 cup maple syrup = 156 grams (5 1/2 ounces)\n- 1 cup milk = 227 grams (240ml; 8 ounces)\n- 1/4 cup molasses = 85 grams (3 ounces)\n- 1 cup oats = 95 grams (3 ounces)\n- 1/2 cup peanut butter = 135 grams (4 3/4 ounces)\n- 1 cup sour cream or yogurt = 227 grams (8 ounces)\n- 1 cup whole wheat flour = 113 grams (4 ounces)\nNow go bake up something incredible!","We all want to keep our families safe and healthy. But sometimes a simple mistake in how we handle and prepare food can lead to serious sickness. With some germs like Salmonella, just a small amount in undercooked food is enough to cause food poisoning. And just a tiny taste of food with botulism toxin can cause paralysis and even death.\nYou can protect your family by avoiding these mistakes.\nMistake #1: Washing meat, chicken, or turkey\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Washing raw meat, chicken, turkey, or eggs can spread germs to your sink, countertops, and other surfaces in your kitchen. Those germs can get on other foods, like salads or fruit, and make you sick.\nSolution: Don’t wash meat, chicken, turkey, or eggs. Cooking them thoroughly will kill harmful germs.\nMistake #2: Eating raw batter or dough, including cookie dough, and other foods with uncooked eggs or uncooked flour\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Uncooked flour and eggs may contain E. coli, Salmonella, or other harmful bacteria.\nSolution: Cook or bake flour and eggs thoroughly. Don’t eat foods that contain raw or undercooked eggs, such as runny eggs, homemade mayonnaise, hollandaise sauce, and eggnog. Don’t eat raw (uncooked) dough or batter that contains contains flour or eggs. Keep raw dough away from children, including play dough. Wash hands, work surfaces, and utensils thoroughly after contact with flour, raw eggs, and raw dough.\nMistake #3: Thawing or marinating food on the counter\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Harmful germs can multiply very quickly at room temperature.\nSolution: Thaw food safely\n. You can thaw it:\n- In the refrigerator,\n- In cold water, or\n- In the microwave.\nAlways marinate food in the refrigerator no matter what kind of marinade you’re using.\nMistake #4: Not cooking meat, chicken, turkey, seafood, or eggs thoroughly\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Undercooked foods may have germs that can make you sick.\nSolution: Use a food thermometer to make sure you cook food to a safe internal temperature.\nGet a detailed list\nof foods and safe temperatures. Also, if you won’t be serving hot food right away, keep it hot (at 140°F or above) until serving.\nMistake #5: Peeling fruits and vegetables without washing them first\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Fruits and vegetables may have germs on their peeling or skin. It’s easy to transfer those germs to the inside of fruits and vegetables when you cut or peel them.\nSolution: Wash all fruits and vegetables under running water even if you’re going to peel them. Use a clean vegetable brush to scrub firm fruits and vegetables like melons, avocados, and cucumbers. Washing fruits and vegetables with soap, detergent, or commercial produce wash is not recommended. Do not use bleach solutions or other disinfecting products on fruits and vegetables.\nMistake #6: Not washing your hands\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Germs on your hands can get on food and make it unsafe.\nSolution: Wash hands the right way—for at least 20 seconds with soap and running water. Wash hands before, during, and after preparing food; before eating; and after using the toilet or changing a child’s diaper.\nMistake #7: Eating risky foods if you are more likely to get food poisoning\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Anyone can get food poisoning. But some people are more likely to get sick and to have a more serious illness. This includes:\n- Adults aged 65 and older\n- Children younger than 5 years\n- People who have health problems or who take medicines that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness (weakened immune systems)\n- Pregnant women\nSolution: People who are more likely to get food poisoning should not eat:\n- Undercooked or raw animal products (such as meat, chicken, turkey, eggs, or seafood)\n- Raw or lightly cooked sprouts\n- Unpasteurized (raw) milk and juices\n- Soft cheese (such as queso fresco), unless it is labeled as made with pasteurized milk\nLearn the best ways to protect yourself from food poisoning at home or in restaurants.\nMistake #8: Putting cooked meat back on a plate that held raw meat\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Germs from the raw meat can spread to the cooked meat.\nSolution: Always use separate plates for raw meat and cooked meat. The same rule applies to chicken, turkey, and seafood.\nMistake #9: Tasting or smelling food to see if it’s still good\nWhy It’s a Mistake: You can’t taste, smell, or see the germs that cause food poisoning. Tasting only a tiny amount can make you very sick.\nSolution: Check the storage times chart\nto see how long you can store food safely. When the time is up, throw it out.\nMistake #10: Leaving food out too long before putting it in the fridge\nWhy It’s a Mistake: Harmful germs can grow in perishable foods (including meat, chicken, turkey, seafood, eggs, cut fruit, cooked rice, and leftovers) if you leave them out of the refrigerator 2 hours or longer.\nSolution: Put perishable foods in the refrigerator within 2 hours\nor within 1 hour if the food is exposed to a temperature over 90˚F (like in a hot car). Divide roasts and large portions of food, such as pots of stew or chili, into smaller containers so they will chill quickly. It’s OK to put warm or hot food into the refrigerator, as long as it’s packaged in amounts small enough cool quickly.\n- Food Poisoning Symptoms\n- People With a Higher Risk of Food Poisoning\n- Foods That Can Cause Food Poisoning\nReport Food Poisoning\nIf you think you or someone you know got sick from food, please report it to your local health department. Report it even if you don’t know what food made you sick. Reporting an illness can help public health officials identify a foodborne disease outbreak and keep others from getting sick.\nOriginal Article – https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ten-dangerous-mistakes.html"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e00e3298-6746-44b1-8715-c1c2ded2cf08>","<urn:uuid:a1430e6b-4800-4811-b953-2eee2176b3bd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does seed mix composition affect prairie restoration success, and what were the historical outcomes of different mix ratios?","answer":"Based on four years of research data, seed mix composition significantly affects prairie restoration outcomes. Expensive, forb-dominated mixes produced high pollinator forage but resulted in excessive bare ground and perennial weed cover. Conversely, inexpensive, grass-dominated mixes achieved high native cover and stem density but provided little pollinator forage. The most successful approach was using diverse, moderately priced mixes with balanced grass-to-forb ratios, which produced floral resources comparable to forb-dominated mixes while maintaining native cover and stem density similar to grass-dominated mixes. For native grass establishment in general, research shows that following specific steps such as proper soil preparation, competition elimination, and appropriate planting techniques are crucial for success.","context":["Native grass plantings are of increased interest to producers. The pros relative to introduced perennial pasture grasses are noteworthy - little need for fertilizer after establishment, drought hardiness if properly grazed, and increased wildlife habitat, to list a few. However, after the cons are considered - low germination and seedling survival rate, low seedling vigor, low tolerance to competition, and general unpredictability of stand success (not to mention lower stocking rates) - few producers decide to attempt a native grass planting. Successful establishment can occur, and the common denominator between most successful plantings is the attention to detail throughout the establishment process. The following are steps to guide producers who want to establish a new stand of native grass.\n- Identify the species of native grass plants found on good condition native range sites of your soil type. The quickest means to find this information is on the Web Soil Survey. This entails locating your property or area of interest (AOI) on the interactive map and finding the plant community similar to your ecological site description or the desired plant community. The listed native grasses include both high and lower successional grasses. Most of these grasses should be included in the seed mixture.\n- Analyze the soils to be seeded well ahead of the proposed planting date. If soils are deficient in phosphorus or potassium, or have a low pH, these nutrients or lime need to be supplied in adequate quantities and incorporated into the soils prior to planting. In addition, if organic matter is lower than 2 percent, plant green manure crops or cover crops (usually annuals) for a couple of years and incorporate residues into the soil at peak production or after grazing. Organic matter increases the water-holding capacity of the soils and contributes to the soil ecology.\n- Eliminate competition prior to planting. Native grass seedlings are not tolerant of competition. Where possible, all existing forages need to be eliminated through tillage and/or appropriate herbicides. Difficult-to-control species such as bermudagrass, johnsongrass, crabgrass and ryegrass may require several tillage operations or herbicide treatments during the growing season to reduce seedling competition.\n- Prepare a smooth, firm, weed- and debris-free seedbed the fall before native grass planting. After the weed species and existing forages have been eliminated, and soil nutrients and organic matter have been added and incorporated into the soil, it is time to prepare the seedbed. Work soil to a depth of 3 to 5 inches until it is free of clods and plant debris is well incorporated. The use of a drag or harrow behind the last tillage improves the smoothness and uniformity of the field. Follow with a culti-packer or other packing implement to firm the seedbed. Complete all operations prior to December.\n- Purchase a seed mixture similar to the plants listed in the Web Soil Survey (or the county soil survey book) for the ecological site of the targeted planting area. Include the mid-successional species in equal proportion to the high successional species. The mid-successional species will often emerge earlier and in greater frequency during the first growing season. Plant the mixture at a seeding rate of about 10 pounds per acre or more of pure live seed (PLS). It is recommended that you identify a regional seed source at least six months ahead of planting. Seek a range professional to assist in the seed mixture formulation.\n- Plant native grasses during the winter season at the proper rate and depth using a calibrated seeder designed to handle native grass seeds. Air-flow seeders, Brillion seeders and other seeders with agitators running through a seed box designed to handle \"fluffy\" seeds work well. Calibrate the drill to ensure a proper seeding rate. Seed should be planted in most cases at a depth of about 1/2 inch. Planting during the winter allows for the native grass seed to be naturally cold-stratified, which is a necessary process for germination of most native grasses.\n- Control weed competition throughout the growing season. Most native grasses will not germinate until soil temperatures reach 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Herbaceous weeds emerge soon thereafter. If the grassy weeds have been eliminated, herbaceous weeds will be the main competition. Manage weeds by mowing or treatment with an appropriate herbicide when weeds reach about a 4-inch height or before they begin to shade emerging grasses. Seek a range professional to assist in herbicide selection and treatment.\n- Avoid grazing new stands during the establishment year or lightly (top) graze only after plants are well established. A full growing season deferment allows new plants to develop a good root system. Always leave adequate residual height during grazing events even in subsequent years, and never graze more than half the leaf tissue at any grazing event during the growing seasons.\nThere are no guarantees when attempting native grass plantings, but following each of these eight steps will provide the best opportunity for success. Leaving out even one of these steps could ensure stand failure.","Assessing Surface and Drill Seeding Methods\nBoth broadcast and drill seeding methods are commonly employed to establish tallgrass prairie vegetation, but is one more cost effective than the other given the high price of seed? Does surface seeding favor small seeded species that may be easily be buried or rely on light to germinate?\nWe installed a pilot experiment with a completely randomized design consisting of four replicates in May 2019 .We randomly assigned a seeding method, surface seeding or drill seeding, to each plot (n = 8). We used a seed mix with 31 species of contrasting seed sizes, where we included small-seeded species (defined as having 1,058 seeds/g or greater) at approximately 10 times the rate of large-seeded species (defined as having 423 seeds/g or fewer).\nBased on a pilot study with two years of data:\n- Surface seeding is a more cost effective method than drill seeding when using a seed mix dominated by small seeded species\n- Small seeded species were roughly twice as abundant in surface-seeded compared to drill-seeded treatments\n- Both methods produced stands with similar native cover and species richness\n- Seed should be sown in planting equipment that allows large seeded species to be drilled into the ground while small seeds are placed on the surface (most native seed drills can be modified or calibrated to achieve this)\nPrairie Enhancement of Cool-season Grass Stands\nCan roadsides dominated by cool-season grasses be enhanced by direct seeding and frequent first year mowing? This simplified management technique would reduce costs associated with weed control and site preparation, increase simplicity in equipment and skill requirements, add flexibility in planting options, and improve pollinator/monarch habitat and water quality in roadsides at comparatively low cost.\nWe established three research sites testing native plant establishment with and without mowing in three different Iowa counties (Benton, Linn, Fayette) consisting of experiment plots paired with demonstration plantings. We used a diverse prairie seed mix with 71 species and standardized seeding rates for milkweed species. We conducted site-preparation by mowing and removing the duff layer in April 2017, then seeded using a no-till drill in late April. We conducted establishment mowing every three weeks from June 1- August 30.\nBased on our first year of data:\n- Most prairie species established poorly when seeded (no-till drilled) into established stands of non-native grasses\n- Milkweed seedlings emerged at sufficient densities to create monarch habitat (> 0.6 plants/m2) with minimal site preparation (duff removal only) and no follow-up management, but it is still unknown whether that translates to adult milkweed establishment\n- First year mowing does not reduce competition enough for sufficient native seedling establishment- initial herbicide is likely necessary\nBuilding Multifunctional, Cost-effective Prairies\nMany conservation programs are highly specified in their restoration objectives, and program design (enhance pollinators or halt surface erosion for example) may focus entirely on optimizing one ecological metric at the expense of others. Can multifunctional seed mixes be designed to meet many objectives at once, or is continuing single objective optimization the most effective conservation strategy? What is the most cost-effective way to do it?\nWe established a randomized complete block experiment testing seed mix designs typical in CRP plantings (grass to forb seeding rate ratios, site customization) with and without mowing in northeastern Iowa. We assessed an economy grass mix ($130/ac, 21 spp., 3:1 grass-to-forb seeding ratio), a diversity mix ($291/ac, 71 spp., 1:1 grass-to-forb), and the pollinator mix ($368/ac, 38 spp., 1:3 grass-to-forb). We conducted site-preparation by disking and cultivating the site and seeded using a no-till drill in late April 2015. We conducted establishment mowing three times during the first year, but did no other management afterwards.\nBased on four years of data:\n- Expensive, forb-dominated seed mixes produce high pollinator forage, but also have excessive bare ground and perennial weed cover\n- Inexpensive, grass-dominated seed mixes produce high native cover and stem density, but little pollinator forage\n- Diverse, moderately priced grass/forb balanced seed mixes produce floral resources comparable to forb-dominated mixes, and native cover and stem density comparable to grass dominated mixes with high cost-effectiveness\n- Frequent first year mowing accelerated establishment, leading to more ecosystem functioning over a typical 10 year contract.\nReconstructing Cost-effective, Multifunctional Prairies on Dry Marginal Lands\nPaired with incentive-based conservation programs, converting farmland on marginal soils to native perennial vegetation may represent a viable conservation land-use choice for many farm owners, but there is a need to better understand how site soils influence establishment outcomes and how seed mixes can be designed to be adaptive to those influences. How does seed mix design, specifically the effect of species habitat matching to soils, affect plant establishment, ecosystem function, and cost-effectiveness in dry marginal lands?\nWe established a small completely randomized experiment testing seed mix design (soil moisture customization) on dry (sandy) marginal lands. We assessed two mixes- a mix using species adapted to dry soils, and a mix using species adapted to medium soils (developed using the Tallgrass Prairie Seed Calculator, tallgrassprairieseedcalculator.com). We did minimal soil preparation, and seeded the experiment using a no-till drill in late November 2017.\nBased on one year of data:\n- Key prairie species establish well even in dry conditions. Native warm and cool season grasses establish well in marginal dry soil, along with important summer and fall flowering forbs.\n- Seed mixes customized for dry soils result in more ecological functionality at similar price. Dry adapted forb species established better than their medium to wet soil counterparts, resulting in more functional groups present. The entire spring forb functional group was missing from the non-customized mix.\n- Cost-effectiveness of native perennial vegetation comparable in productive vs marginal soils. Number of plants produced from one dollar of seed is similar for many native grass and forb species in medium and dry soils."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:94fedf8b-dcf3-4473-9d18-17d7139ff67d>","<urn:uuid:4d1943cb-bf1c-4805-ac1c-a4879f2163be>"],"error":null}

Your student has been preparing for this test for weeks, skipping social events and family dinners. They’re definitely prepared, in fact, they may be overprepared.\nYet, when they sit down for the exam, their mind goes blank, their heart starts racing, and they forget to put down their own name. These aren’t just normal nerves, they’re a sign of test anxiety.\nTest anxiety is a type of academic anxiety, which is “an overwhelming stress around academic achievement,” says Kate Sheehan, LCSW, managing director of the UCLA Center for Anxiety, Resilience, Education and Support (CARES).\nYour student is far from alone. A recent study in the Journal of School Psychology found test anxiety to be a highly common experience for students across ages and cultures, with potential negative effects for their learning outcomes later on.\nHowever, test anxiety is addressable, and you can begin to support your student by first recognizing its signs.\nRecognizing the signs\nTest anxiety can present itself in your student’s physical wellness, ability to think and their behavior. And academic anxiety affects younger students just as much as it affects high school and college students.\n“A lot of times, young kids will have frequent stomach aches, and they go to the pediatrician again and again to have it explained. It could be anxiety because our stomach is really linked to our fight-flight-freeze response.”\nThe signs can also affect behavior. Irritability, procrastination, laziness and avoidance are all common, says Sheehan.\n“A lot of kids are actually so worried about their homework that they can't find a place to start, and then it looks like they just don't care. But actually, they care a lot.”\nParents can help prepare their students to manage test anxiety before, during and after the exam, Sheehan says.\nBefore the test\nPreparation is key to reducing the anxiety of tackling an exam. Here are recommendations to share with your student.\nFirst, it is helpful to set a realistic expectation for how much they need to perform. Students with anxiety often go into exams thinking they will fail, the worst-case scenario.\nThe brain leans on this “negativity bias,” causing us to pay more attention to problems than things that are going well.\nGoing over the worst case scenario beforehand can be useful. In this process, students may find that the catastrophe they’re imagining isn’t so catastrophic after all.\nThis comes up often with the students Sheehan works with. “If the worst-case scenario includes getting a 60, they just need the mindset of ‘I just need 15-20 points on top of that.’”\nDuring the test\nEncourage your student when beginning an exam to create a clear roadmap and start with what they know.\n“Sit down, put your name on the test,” says Sheehan. “Congratulations, you’ve already done one thing you know!”\nIt’s also helpful to break the exam down into smaller portions. If they have 30 questions to tackle, they can draw lines between each set of ten and answer them section by section.\nOn occasion, physical anxiety may get in the way of students remembering what they know, Sheehan says.\n“When they get anxious, their body turns to fight-flight-freeze mode. Their heart may race, their breaths may become shorter, their vision may narrow and their digestion may shut down to put all of their energy into survival.”\nIt’s much more difficult to access your memory in this state, Sheehan explains. Anxious thoughts tend to play on a loop in your brain, interrupting your thinking and efforts to demonstrate and access your knowledge.\nAnxiety tends to wind the body in a circular feedback loop. “What we want is to unwind it in the opposite direction,” says Sheehan.\nIt is helpful for students to practice relaxation techniques they can employ during the exam. Practicing beforehand helps them kick in automatically, Sheehan says: “Like when you get in a car, you will put your seat belt on automatically because you’re reminded again and again over the years.”\nStudents should think about what part of their body holds the most tension, whether it’s the brows, the neck or shoulders, Sheehan says. Every time they check the clock, they can try raising and lowering their shoulders to allow their body to reset.\n“When they start, they can take a breath and try to hold the exhale just a second longer than they usually would. Shifting their focus to their exhale and counting to two automatically lets them inhale more deeply. “\nAfter the test\nAfter the exam is a rich time for parents to step in as cheerleaders and potential problem-solvers, says Sheehan.\nTalk with your student about what went well, what went wrong, and what they can improve on for the next time. It will help them narrow down and verbalize their sources of anxiety.\n“Parents can correct whatever story is happening in the kid’s head if we get them to say it out loud. If they don't say it out loud, we never know what story they're telling themselves.”\nWhen to seek further guidance\nIf your student frequently experiences symptoms of intense anxiety during or long after the test, it may be a sign to seek further medical advice.\nThe CARES Center publishes fact sheets for parents, teachers and students with tips to recognize and face the concerns of test anxiety. You can learn to recognize these signs and address them inside and outside the classroom. Read the fact sheets. and watch a tutorial on recognizing anxiety in the classroom.\nMaanasi Kademani is the author of this article."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ec597d5a-6047-4927-89c0-3bc60a449eac>","<urn:uuid:0391d6a1-1f55-4026-af69-061c092b1c1f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do school gardens blend educational benefits with environmental sustainability?","answer":"School gardens combine education and sustainability by creating dual-purpose spaces. They serve as educational resources where students can participate in activities like winter seed sowing, planting, and wildlife observation, while simultaneously providing ecological benefits. These gardens help improve water runoff management, increase biodiversity, and create wildlife habitats. For example, the Living Stage project demonstrates sustainability by being recyclable, biodegradable, and created from locally reclaimed materials, while wildlife gardens incorporate native plants specifically chosen for local conditions and ecosystem services. Both approaches emphasize zero-waste principles and community involvement to ensure long-term sustainability.","context":["This post* comes from Creative Carbon Scotland who run ‘Green Tease’ arts and sustainability events every month. A few weeks ago I was invited to speak at the Edinburgh Green Tease about the latest Living Stage project with Eco Drama’s Emily Reid and Edinburgh based designer Mona Kastell. Here is their lovely summary of our work.\nThis Edinburgh Green Tease was led by Eco-Drama, the schools-touring programme of the Whirlybird Theatre Company. Their aim is to use theatre, music, storytelling and creative workshops to engage, entertain and inspire people of all ages to care for our natural world. Director Emily Reid, alongside Set Designer Tanja Beer and Assistant Set Designer Mona Kastell, came to discuss their latest production Uprooted, which features Scotland’s first ever Living Stage.\nThe Living Stage is exactly as it sounds: a stage composed of living plants. It is recyclable, biodegradable, edible and created from locally found and reclaimed materials. Tanja Beer, author of this wonderful idea, has travelled all over the world working with local permaculturalists and theatre-makers to create living sets. Since its debut at the 2013 Castlemaine State Festival in Australia, the project has only grown (no pun intended) and has since travelled to Cardiff where it was part of the Trans-Plantable Living Room and now into Scotland.\nThe Living Stage for Uprooted was created as part of Eco-Drama’s ‘Out to Play’ programme, working with four Glasgow primary schools to design, grow and build the living theatre set. Having seen that many of these inner-city schools only have concrete playgrounds, the idea of a touring garden developed to give the children a chance to experience the natural world. They were involved in designing aspects of the production (plants growing out of a toilet proved particularly popular) and they planted the first seeds in March 2015.\nOf course there are many challenges to creating a Living Stage and touring it in a sustainable manner. They’ve successfully tackled this latter problem by becoming the proud owners of an electric car and ‘The Magic Van’, which runs entirely on repurposed vegetable oil (the best stuff comes from Indian and Chinese takeaways by the way – chippy oil has been used too many times). Some of the other challenges include having stunt-doubles for some plants which have active performance roles (so that they each have a time to recuperate) and ensuring that there is enough time to be sustainable.\nTiming is key in any sustainable production. 80% of a product’s sustainability is locked in at the design stage, with the earliest stages of the design process having the greatest influence over its environmental impact. Careful planning is needed and sufficient time granted to locate sustainable components and, in this case, to grow the plants needed in the production. Gardening is arguably the slowest of the performance arts and cannot be rushed – a sunflower doesn’t care when you’re supposed to go on tour, it will bloom when it pleases!\nThe final challenge is deciding what to do after the production has finished. The Living Stage is a ‘Zero-Waste’ set so nothing will be thrown away or discarded. Rather, it is going to return to one of the schools which helped plant it and be installed as a permanent feature – turning an ugly metal fence into a thing of beauty. It will be in a public, and therefore unprotected, space but the hope is that, because the community helped to create the garden, they will have a deeper connection to it (and a desire to care for it) than if it had merely been dumped upon them.\n*This blog was originally posted on http://www.creativecarbonscotland.com/august-green-tease-reflections/\nSee more images of Uprooted here","Pour le français, cliquez ici.\nWritten by Eugenie Waters and Christina Keys\nWildlife gardens are a wonderful way for children, educators, and the local community to connect with nature, increase biodiversity, and beautify school grounds. They can also provide ecosystem services that can improve the functioning of school yards for caretakers and children alike. A wildlife garden may be a native plant garden, a pollinator garden, or butterfly garden. What they all have in common is a focus on attracting wildlife to school grounds for children’s learning and enjoyment.\nWe, Eugenie Waters and Christina Keys, have recent experiences navigating all the steps involved in establishing native plant gardens at schools. We were involved in conception, planning, funding, planting, engaging with students and teachers, as well as maintaining native plant gardens at two Ottawa elementary schools. Each has unique challenges and opportunities, but we hope our experiences in establishing school gardens will inspire and reassure you - it is possible!\nFirst steps to garden creation - gather your team and scope out the schoolyard\nFind an interested teacher, school staff member, fellow parent, or community member to take this journey together. We found each other through the Ottawa Wildflower Seed Library Facebook group. The more the merrier, but even just one to two people taking the lead can accomplish so much! Spend some time on the school yard to get a sense of some possible locations for a native plant garden. Some important considerations include:\n- Light conditions: Does the potential garden have full or part sun or full or part shade?\n- Soil conditions: Is the soil dry, moist, or compacted?\n- Children: Is the garden in a play area? Are there spaces available on school property that are not frequently used by children?\nIt can be very helpful to observe how the school yard is used during recess and during school hours as well as after school. Some schools may already have garden beds that have not been maintained or are full of weeds or invasive species, waiting to be rehabilitated. Each school’s situation is unique, but every school has space for a native plant garden of some size (see photo of “Pollinator Strip” below)!\nBuild a relationship with the school\nOnce you have a few people interested and some ideas, approach decision-makers at the school, starting with some informal conversations. Perhaps there is already a teacher thinking about how to make use of some long-abandoned garden boxes at the school, or the school has applied to the Canadian Wildlife Federation’s WILD Spaces free native plant program for schools. Check if the school has a schoolyard committee. Parent or school councils are a great way to navigate the school community for this type of project, as is speaking to the principal and key caretaker. Some schools already have an environmentally focused student club or staff environmental committee. There are usually supportive people just waiting for someone to take the initiative.\nIn your preliminary conversations, focus on the benefits of wildlife and native plant gardens for students and how they connect with their learning. Emphasise the learning opportunities for the children at all grade levels as well as the mental-health benefits of school yard greening. However, be sure you are ready for the questions about risks of insect stings for children, maintenance plans, costs and bureaucratic liability. Our experience has been that the concerns about insect stings are easily overcome with education (most native bees are solitary and do not bite unless provoked), language choice (native plant garden or butterfly garden is less likely to put people on high-alert than pollinator garden, which makes people think of bees specifically), and open communication.\nTime to find some funding (and free resources!)\nWithin the city of Ottawa, a great source of funding is the Community Environmental Projects Grant Program (CEPGP). The application is due at the end of March every year, and it regularly funds many native plant gardens in public spaces, including on school grounds. Be sure to read through all the requirements before considering submission, including insurance needs, landowner permissions, and required timelines. Usually the principal can write a letter granting landowner permission on behalf of the school board for any application, and the school board’s insurance can cover the grant’s requirements. Be sure to check how the funding will be received and managed, including tracking receipts and reimbursements. Public schools get a partial reimbursement for HST on purchases, so you may be able to stretch your funding a bit further if it is administered by the school.\nOften you can supplement your grant with in-kind donations, and some grants require this. Usually these donations are simply volunteer hours. Consider also asking local retailers for donations, like wood, soil, plants, and garden tools. Having a letter you’ve drafted and signed by the principal outlining the project and its needs is useful in talking to a garden centre or hardware store manager to solicit donations. Ontario Native Plants’ parent company Verbinnen’s Nursery offers their plants at wholesale prices to non-profit organisations such as schools and community associations. Other sources of native plants locally include Ferguson Tree Nursery, Ritchie’s Feed and Seed’s native section (Windmill Ln location), Beaux Arbres, and A Cultivated Art seedlings.\nChoosing plants, and how to make sure they survive!\nPlant selection is key for ensuring your garden will thrive. This is especially important in the difficult growing environments common in school yard gardens. They often have dry, compacted soil and experience heavy salt runoff in winter. Plants can also be trampled by kids, which is a risk each spring and during the plant establishment phase. The concept of “right plant, right place” is useful in plant selection guidance; choose only plants that naturally grow in the existing conditions instead of trying to change the conditions. This means you need to do some research about each and every plant you select. Is it drought tolerant? Is it salt tolerant? Does it like full sun or part shade? How does its height compare to others around it?\nThe plants also need to be chosen based on their ‘sociability’ which means how they interact with other plants. Canada Goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), for example, is a bully! It will grow very tall and slowly expand through its rhizomes to take over the entire garden bed. Alternatively, early goldenrod (Solidago juncea) is a shorter, less aggressive goldenrod that plays nicely with others. Attention to sociability is especially important to minimise maintenance and ensure plant survival. Wonderful resources for learning about sociability are the books A Garden for the Rusty Patched Bumblebee: Creating Habitat for Native Pollinators and Prairie Up: An Introduction to Natural Garden Design.\nAnother key aspect for plant survival is planning for paths or fencing. In the early days of establishing perennials, it is important to protect them from excessive trampling. In some cases, this may mean a DIY fence with wood posts and twine or creating a path from flat rocks or a few paving stones to direct students. In more compact school yards or those for younger children, a more robust fence of soft plastic may be needed for the first year or two, but try to keep it short to help maximise student interaction with the garden.\nUsing the garden as an educational resource\nOne of the keys for success for any school garden is planning for student and teacher involvement at each step. Regular communications and solicitation of volunteers is important. In the planning phase, be sure teachers have input about what would help maximise the garden’s role in their curriculum. Budgeting early on for lots of educational signage can be helpful if you hope that teachers will have input into the content. Activities that kids can more easily be involved with include winter sowing seeds in pots (bigger seeds like butterfly milkweed and pale purple coneflower are more suited for this), planting plants, watering, and creating cute signs. Budgeting for supplies for these class activities is an important consideration. Your budget proposal may include:\n- Pots and potting soil for winter sowing by students\n- A dozen watering cans\n- A dozen trowels\n- A laminator, heavy-duty stapler, and waterproofing spray for temporary student signage\nA successful school garden improves the school yard by providing ecosystem services like improving water runoff, by beautifying, and by creating habitat for local wildlife. But the most successful school garden fosters deep connections between the students and the natural world. School gardens focused on wildlife spark curiosity about the little green bees, the red and black butterflies, and the birds eating the seed heads. In this way, school gardens can enrich the education of young people while also enriching lives in the broader community including the local wildlife.\nEugenie Waters and Christina Keys have led the establishment of native plant gardens at their children’s schools in Ottawa, École élémentaire publique Trille des Bois and Manor Park Public School, respectively. They also work together on various community native plant garden projects through their involvement with the Manor Park Community Association’s (MPCA) Environmental Sustainability Committee.\nDozens of native plants were planted by Manor Park Community Council’s Summer Day Camp kids in August 2023 on Manor Park Public School grounds. In an existing planter box, we created ten sections by stapling twine across the planter, then stapled laminated photos to the front of each section. This way, the campers knew where to plant each seeding and can observe over time how each type looks as it grows and flowers. (Photo: Christina Keys)\nAs part of Trille des Bois’s CEPGP grant from the City of Ottawa, parent volunteers of the School Council’s schoolyard committee and students transformed this area that suffered from excessive rainwater run-off and soil erosion (left) into a thriving rain garden (right). Over all, the project added 90 native shrubs (8 species) and over 250 native plants (over 25 species) to multiple areas of the school yard, including creating new planting areas and revitalising existing garden beds. (Photo: Eugenie Waters)\nEven small planters like this one at the Manor Park Community Council at 100 Thornwood Rd can provide enormous learning benefits for students and teachers. The Canadian Wildlife Federation says, “Evidence shows that teaching outdoors can make educators happier, healthier, less likely to experience teacher burnout and can also help strengthen the bond between teachers and students. Time spent outdoors can increase students’ ability to concentrate, help with symptoms of learning challenges and may even improve overall test scores. Furthermore, children who have positive experiences outdoors with a trusted adult are more likely to develop a strong conservation ethic.” (Photo: Christina Keys)\nThe Manor Park Native Plant Demonstration Garden was created by the Manor Park Community Association’s Environmental Sustainability Committee. It is located on land used by both the Manor Park Community Council and Manor Park Public School. The principal was able to provide landowner permission for City of Ottawa’s CEPGP funding, and the MPCA provided insurance coverage. Temporary signage and fencing protected the young garden in early spring 2023. (Photo: Christina Keys)\nBy fall 2023, permanent signage had been posted, and fencing was no longer needed at the Manor Park Native Plant Demonstration Garden. (Photo: Christina Keys)\nThis narrow “Pollinator Strip” is only 12” wide and runs along the south-facing wall of the school building at Trille des Bois. The school is in an urban area and has a relatively small schoolyard, given the sizable student population. When adding plants and shrubs we were very mindful to not take away precious play-space from the children.\n- Community Environmental Projects Grant Program (CEPGP)\n- Tree Canada’s Greening Canada’s School Grounds\n- TD Friends of the Environment Foundation Grant\n- Eco-Schools Canada Funding Opportunities\n- Desjardins Foundation Prizes\nIdeal Plants for Dry, Salty Soil in Full Sun\n- Canada Columbine (Aquilegia canadensis)\n- Canada Wild Rye (Elymus canadensis)\n- Hairy Beardtongue (Penstemon hirsutus)\n- Butterfly Milkweed (Asclepias tuberosa)\n- Pale Purple Coneflower (Echinacea pallida)\n- Nodding Onion (Allium cernuum)\n- Hoary Vervain (Verbena stricta)\n- Black Eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta)\n- Pearly Everlasting (Anaphalis margaritacea)\n- Little Bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium)\n- Heath Aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides)\n- Gray Goldenrod (Solidago nemoralis)\n- Lanceleaf Coreopsis (Coreopsis lanceolata)\n- Smooth Blue Aster (Symphyotrichum laevis)\n- Spotted Beebalm (Monarda punctata)\n- Sideoats Grama (Bouteloua curtipendula)\nCheck out In Our Nature for more plant lists for different conditions.\n- Canadian Wildlife Federation’s WILD Spaces\n- Ottawa Wildflower Seed Library website\n- Ottawa Wildflower Seed Library Facebook group\n- David Suzuki Butterfly Way Rangers\n- CAFES Ottawa\n- Your local community association\n- Your school’s parent council"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0573a117-db1b-494e-8bc6-3f9d266971e5>","<urn:uuid:6cf82548-9f27-4519-b0fb-eccc5d4d5e5a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What method used at Eden Shale Farm for water harvesting?","answer":"At Eden Shale Farm, they use a water capturing system that includes 3,000 gallon storage tanks and a system of cisterns, gutters, and drain pipes to capture rainwater runoff from barns. The water is then used for watering cattle. The system works in two ways: water flows to a trough made from a tractor tire using gravity, and cisterns use solar-powered pumps to run water to similar troughs.","context":["Water Quantity Management\nHarvesting one of earth's most precious natural resources\nWhen considering what natural resources we need the most to survive, water ranks at or near the top. According to NASA Science, \"So far, scientists know of no living things, even the smallest microorganisms that can live without liquid water.\"\nFarmers certainly know how precious it is and depend on it to grow their crops, water their livestock and ultimately make a living. That being the case, it would only make sense to store or stock up on water when it is plentiful to utilize when it's not.\nWater harvesting is a term often used when referring to this water-capturing act. At its simplest form, many people use rain barrels connected to their home gutters to catch rain water for use on outside plants and gardens.\nBut when thinking about growing acres and acres of row crops, the amount of water needed is far beyond the capacity of a few rain barrels.\nMark Ferguson, State Resource Conservationist with the Natural Resources Conservation Service said there are two ways of thinking about water storage, one being structurally and the other through agronomic practices.\n\"When referring to water storage, most people think about ponds, reservoirs or water tanks, but one big thing they don't think about is soil, itself,\" he said. \"The soil, especially cropland has a huge capability to hold water from rainfall. The soil acts like a sponge and can hold a tremendous amount of water. A soil with one percent organic matter in the top six inches can hold up to 27,000 gallons of water per acre.\"\nBecause of that capability, soil health becomes very important when related to the water holding ability of that cropland. Ferguson said specific conservation measures can not only help improve water quality but also conserve water and improve water efficiency to crops. Some of those measures include conservation crop rotation, no-till production practices, cover crops, mulching, mulch tillage, nutrient management and pest management.\nWhile retaining moisture within the soil potentially holds the best promise for storing the largest of water supplies, structural measures can provide needed water supplies especially when related to the watering of livestock. That can mean something as simple as fenced ponds with limited livestock access, or something more mechanical such as pumping stations conveying water from wells to watering troughs.\nIn the same vein as the antiquated rain barrel, research at the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Agriculture, Food and Environment takes that idea to a larger scale although it works in much the same way.\nDr. Steve Higgins, Director of Animal and Environmental Compliance for UK's Agricultural Experiment Station has been working on a water capturing project at Owen County's Eden Shale Farm that utilizes different methods of retaining water and using existing resources.\nThrough the use of 3,000 gallon storage tanks and a system of cisterns, gutters and drain pipes rainwater runoff is captured from barns and is stored to use for watering cattle. In the case of the water containers, water flows to a trough made from a tractor tire utilizing gravity. The cisterns use a pump on solar energy to run water to a similar trough.\n\"The concept of this water harvesting is at least 3,000 years old so this is old-school. But we use practices the farmers can understand and want to see it make an impact in the first year because many of these operations are working on a shoestring budget,\" he said.\nIn addition to water harvesting, the farm space has been used to its optimum ability to feed and move cattle. All these projects tie together to help obtain the ultimate goal; making it and operations like it more profitable. But in doing so, the fringe benefits have included better utilization of existing resources and better conservation results.\n\"The focus here is really about making a profit. We are designing a facility that takes advantage of access, location, shape, soil improvement and its organic material, and thus we are saving money on inputs,\" he said. \"Now if you design it correctly, the environment and conservation takes care of itself.\"\nEden Shale is under the direction of Kentucky Beef Network's (KBN) five managers who are appointed by the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association while an advisory committee made up of three representatives from UK and KBN oversee the overall direction and goals of bringing farmers in to be educated on the practices created at the farm.\nWhen discussing adequate water supplies, the farm community and urban users are generally responsive to each others needs. But in the case of severe drought conditions, the two never want to be pitted against each other. Kentucky for instance, has grown its livestock production over the past two decades to the point it is the largest cattle producing state east of the Mississippi.\n\"Having the ability to water livestock in times of drought not only helps the producers but takes an added stress off of municipal water supplies,\" said Gary Larimore, Executive Director of Kentucky Rural Water Association. \"One thing that will help especially when it comes to livestock production, is further initiatives to help with surface water development.\"\nKentucky is positioned, through research efforts, legislative initiatives and a desire to maintain farmland for generations to come, to be a national model when it comes to wise use of its precious natural resources; something which will benefit not only farms but all families."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6db19872-9254-45c5-85ea-6ec6cb2c097c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do founding beliefs and multicultural values compete in shaping citizenship in both Western democracies and China's meritocratic system?","answer":"In Western democracies, there is an ongoing tension between founding beliefs that organize political communities and claims for multicultural expansion of those beliefs. This creates a pull between inclusion and exclusion that significantly impacts citizenship meaning. Similarly, China's meritocratic system faces challenges in balancing traditional governance values with modern needs for representation. While China's system emphasizes technical expertise and merit-based selection, it must also adapt to include more democratic characteristics and address multicultural representation. Both systems struggle with the fundamental question of how to represent diverse members of a polity while maintaining coherent governing principles, though they approach this challenge through different institutional frameworks.","context":["Pages: 192 Size: 6x9\nConcern with representation figures inescapably in the study of citizenship. From the initial formulations of a notion of citizenship in ancient Greece, in which citizens were persons charged with representing the interests of the city-state, concern about who and what gets represented, as well as how and why those people and things get represented, has been central in formulas describing the citizen’s relationship to a political community. Since the seventeenth century, the tension between citizens as representatives of the interests of the state and the state as representative of the interests of its citizens has found both practical and theoretical elaborations in understandings and exercises of citizenship. Today, the concept of representation resonates widely within citizenship studies, and its general ambiguity gives expression to many of the key issues of community membership, creating in this way a critical vocabulary through which those issues can be expressed. It is this vocabulary of representation that this book examines.\nRepresentation and Citizenship is a collection of seven essays that speak to the pull in citizenship studies between founding beliefs that organize political communities and claims for multicultural and cosmopolitan expansions of those community beliefs. Each contributor takes a stance on supporting either founding beliefs or multicultural values, yet none are at the exclusion of the other. The essays explore the relevance of specific national contexts, including the United States, Canada, and Korea, and as a whole, argue that the tension between inclusion and exclusion retains significance for any assertion of what citizenship means.\nThe audience for this book includes, but is not limited to, students and scholars in citizenship studies, history, law, political science, and social science, especially those interested in issues of patriotism and multiculturalism.\nRepresentation and Citizenship addresses membership conundrums with fresh ideas regarding the problem of representation, community, and citizenship. Rogers Smith and Will Kymlicka in their opening chapters analyse these contradictions in terms of the constitutional foundations of membership (\"a civic union\") and the empirical realities of ethno-cultural-religious diversity. The multicultural diversity characteristic of modern societies needs a robust notion of cosmopolitanism to engender a shared membership. These foundational issues of citizenship are illustrated in subsequent chapters with case studies of various vocabularies of representation for minorities, migrants, and aboriginals. An original and creative contribution to citizenship studies.\n– Bryan S. Turner, The Graduate Center, CUNY\nHow to represent the diverse members of a polity within the fiction of equivalence among citizens has been a problem that has engaged political activists and philosophers from classical times to the present. This collection of essays fruitfully explores from a variety of angles the possibilities and tensions that arise from the coexistence of universalistic values and particularistic ties.\n– Frederick Cooper, author of Citizenship between Empire and Nation: Remaking France and French Africa, 1945–1960\nWho is in, who is out, what does it mean to belong, and what kind of polity do we belong to? These are the fundamental and timely questions explored in Representation and Citizenship, a valuable resource for anyone interested in issues of citizenship.\n– Peter Levine, Lincoln Filene Professor of Citizenship and Public Affairs in the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life, Tufts University","This week there has been a fair amount of hoopla about the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, a document signed in a field in Runnymede that became the bedrock of the English-speaking world’s rule of law. If anything, the Americans take the ‘Great Charter’ even more seriously than the Brits, seeing in it the progenitor of their own Declaration of Independence.\nIndeed, the sheer amount of news coverage given to the Magna Carta this week is a reminder of how seriously the Anglo-Saxon world takes what it stands for. Few actually know exactly what was in the original document, or even care that it was signed by a bloodthirsty bunch of medieval barons. Today when the words Magna Carta are uttered, they are associated with the flowering of democracy, first on a small damp island, and then on a vast continent.\nAnd in one of those strange paradoxes – for WiC doesn’t imagine it was a deliberate publishing strategy – this month, coinciding with the Magna Carta celebrations, a book has been published that asks which is the more effective: Western democracy or China’s one-party system.\nThe China Model is by Tsinghua University professor Daniel Bell and its central premise will likely be viewed as heresy by some readers. In fact WiC imagines that many Western reviewers are going to have a lot of trouble with this book. How could anyone prefer Beijing’s authoritarian system to the universal franchise?\nIn fact, Bell argues that China’s one-party state has produced a successful system that he terms ‘political meritocracy’. His proof? The hundreds of millions of Chinese lifted out of poverty over the past three or so decades. Bell argues that only a political system capable of grooming smart, technically expert leaders could have achieved that.\nHowever, Bell is also at pains to stress that past success does not guarantee that the exact same formula will work over the next three decades. Conditions have changed, he points out. That said, he sees no prospect of nationwide multi-party elections occurring in China, run along either the Washington or Westminster models. He argues instead that the best outcome would be a hybrid formula that blends choosing the most capable leaders for top roles with grassroots democracy (more on which later; it’s problematic).\nSo why did he write the book? “Over the past few years I came to realise that China’s political system has meritocratic characteristics, if only because my own high-achieving students at Tsinghua University were increasingly recruited by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). I realised I had stumbled onto something of political importance and wrote some op-eds in leading media outlets in China and the West. However, I was ruthlessly savaged by critics, and accused of being an apologist for the CCP.”\nHe has spent five years on the book and readily admits, “I would have been shocked by some of my own arguments had I read them two decades ago.” But he feels The China Model (subtitled ‘Political Meritocracy and the Limits of Democracy’) is explaining a concept few grasp in the West: “There is a much better understanding of Western-style democracy in China than Chinese-style meritocracy in the West, and my book is meant to provide some symmetry.”\nHis book begins by taking issue with the common view – at least in the West – that democracy is the best (or in Churchill’s famed phrasing “least worst’) form of government. To do so he focuses primarily on what he views as the failings of the US system. He starts his critique with the voters themselves: “Given that most voters lack the time, motivation and cognitive skills to acquire political knowledge, it should come as no surprise that most voters often seem ignorant on key issues. For example, 79% of Americans cannot identify their state senators… In 1987 – before the Soviet Union collapsed – about half of Americans thought Karl Marx’s dictum ‘from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs’ was in the US constitution.”\n(As an aside, the protagonist of HBO’s satirical comedy Veep moaned in this week’s episode that the American voters “were ignorant and dumb as shit, and that’s democracy”.)\nIn the realm of policymaking, such ignorance can prove disastrous in dealing with future problems, Bell believes: “Poor knowledge of science in the voting community also has negative political consequences. Most obviously, the disjunction between expert opinion and voter ignorance makes it harder for US policymakers to counteract climate change, which perhaps ought to be the biggest political issue of our day.”\nBell adds short-termism and self-interest to US democracy’s list of short-comings, as well as money: “The influence of money on politics is the scourge of most existing democracies, and the US is perhaps the most extreme case… From tax laws to deregulation to corporate governance to safety net issues, business interests pressured government to enact policies to allow those who were already wealthy to amass an ever-increasing share of the nation’s wealth.”\nThen there is the matter of the elected officials themselves. He cites Sun Yat-sen, the founder of modern China who in his own day was critical of US democracy because of the low quality of its politicians: “With respect to elections, those endowed with eloquence ingratiated themselves with the public and won elections, while those endowed with learning and ideals but lacking eloquence were ignored. Consequently, members of America’s House of Representatives have often been foolish and ignorant people who made its history quite ridiculous.”\nThis brings him to the Chinese system – one where to become a senior leader is to prove your worth over decades, rising from amid a competitive talent pool of over 80 million Party members. He calls it a political meritocracy (likening it to what Singapore achieved under Lee Kuan Yew). Its advantage? “Once Chinese leaders reach positions of political power, they can react more quickly to crises and undertake great infrastructure projects that underpin economic development. Meritocratically selected leaders can make long-term oriented decisions that consider the interests of all relevant stakeholders, including future generations. In multiparty democracies with leaders chosen on the basis of competitive elections, by contrast, leaders need to worry about the next election and they are more likely to make decisions influenced by short-term political considerations that bear on their chances of being re-elected.”\nBell points out that public service exams in China are designed to filter out those without superior analytical skills, commenting “it is highly unlikely that someone like Sarah Palin could pass such examinations”.\nThe author believes a meritocracy can deliver superior results: “A meritocratic system can be explicitly designed to increase the likelihood that political leaders have the motivation and ability to enact sound policies and in that sense China has a clear advantage over electoral democracies that leave the whole thing up to the whims of the people unconstrained by the lessons of philosophy, history, and social science.”\nActually, one of the most revealing passages in the book is a conversation Bell had back in 2012 with Li Yuanchao, then minister of the Party’s Organisation Department. “To illustrate the rigorous [meritocratic] nature of selection at higher levels of government, Minister Li described the procedure used to select the Secretary General of the Organisation Department of the Party’s China Central Committee. First, there was a nomination process, including retired cadres. Those who received many nominations could move to the next stage. Next, there was an examination, including questions such as how to be a good Secretary General. More than 10 people took the exam, and the list was narrowed to five people. To ensure that the process was fair, the examination papers were put in the corridor for all to judge the results.\n“Then, there was an oral examination with an interview panel composed of ministers, vice-ministers, and university professors. To ensure transparency and fairness, ordinary cadres who work for the General Secretary were in the room, which allowed them to supervise the whole process. Three candidates with the highest scores were selected for the next stage. Then, the department of personnel led an inspection team to look into the performance and virtue of the candidates, with more emphasis placed on virtue. Two people were recommended for the next stage. The final decision was made by a committee of twelve ministers who each had a vote, and the candidate had to have at least eight votes to succeed.”\nOver the past 30 or so years this style of personnel system has generated impressive results: “The key priority of government – to reduce poverty – has been widely shared among both leaders and people. And since economic growth is an essential condition for the reduction of poverty, government officials were often promoted according to the level of economic growth in their district. At least partly as a result of this promotion mechanism, China has seen perhaps the single most impressive poverty alleviation achievement in human history.”\nBell’s attacks on democracy may put off some readers, and there are passages in the book that will rile his liberal critics (“I will not pursue the question of whether China should adopt one person, one vote and competitive multiparty politics”; “There is little doubt that the large majority of Chinese consider the current political system to be the appropriate system for their country”; China is “more harmonious than large democratic countries such as India and the US”).\nHowever, his book also makes plain that the Chinese system must adapt too. What worked in the prior 35 years, he makes clear, may no longer be fit for purpose.\nFor example, in the past it was straightforward to tie bureaucratic promotions with local GDP growth. Now, with China’s severe environmental concerns, the incentives are tougher to devise. “The more serious problem is that the appropriate standard for measuring performance needs to change… Most obviously China’s growth has come at the expense of the environment and people’s well-being, with pollution now surpassing land disputes as the leading cause of social unrest in China.”\nBell admits it is very difficult to create measuring tools that link cadre achievements with such economic externalities (after all, when you don’t do something environmentally destructive, it often doesn’t show up in any figures).\nHe also concedes that China’s political meritocracy remains far from the ideal: “The system is still in its early stages and plagued by imperfections: officials are selected and promoted not just on the basis of ability and morality, but also (if not more so) on the basis of political loyalty, social connections and family background. The political system is notoriously corrupt and the practice of buying and selling posts at lower levels of government in poor areas has yet to be completely eradicated.”\nIn fact, a major chunk of Bell’s book is taken up with the problem of corruption. He clearly feels that the country is at a crossroads and the Party’s own legitimacy is being undermined by graft (ironically, the opportunities to behave corruptly have grown for China’s poorly-paid officials as a byproduct of the wealth generated by their successful stewardship of the country’s economy).\n“The overall level of corruption has exploded over the past three decades,” he observes. “In a political meritocracy such as China, the system is supposed to select leaders with superior virtue, meaning that rulers are supposed to use power to serve the political community, not themselves. In other words, the higher the level of political corruption, the less meritocratic the political system. Put negatively, the regime will lack legitimacy if its leaders are seen to be corrupt.”\nIn this respect, Bell notes: “Electoral democracy may not guarantee superior rulers, but at least voters can get rid of their rulers if it turns out they made a bad choice.”\nBell is less convincing on whether the corruption in the ‘China Model’ is fixable. Anticorruption campaigns may not succeed. “The connection between low salaries and high levels of corruption is familiar to students of Chinese history: in the Ming Dynasty, when officials’ salaries were the lowest and anticorruption campaigns the fiercest, the level of corruption stubbornly remained the highest.”\nHe suggests that public salaries be raised and the monopolies of the state-owned enterprises broken in favour of greater competition. But these financial fixes are not likely to be enough: “Money per se is not sufficient to deter corruption. This brings us to the fourth cause of corruption in China: lack of ethics… At the end of the day, corruption in China can be substantially curtailed only if it is seen to be deeply shameful and being clean is seen to be a matter of honour for private officials.”\nOf course, for the shame culture to work there needs to be transparency. Here he has another model in mind: “Nondemocratic Hong Kong relies on a powerful and independent anticorruption agency, the rule of law, and a relatively free press.”\nIn fact, he thinks the Chinese model may need to look to the West after all. “Sustainable political meritocracy requires features typical of democratic societies: the rule of law to check corruption and abuses of power, and freedom of speech and political experimentation to prevent the ossification of political hierarchies.”\nHowever, one thing that is glaringly absent from the book is any discussion of how likely it is that rule of law will prevail in China. Since coming to power in 1949, Party diktat has always trumped legal code. It remains hard to see how a one-party state would surrender its supremacy and instead subordinate its decisions to those made by independent courts and judges.\nIn fact, in his most recent book Political Order and Decay Francis Fukuyama has argued that China is the only world civilisation that never developed “true rule of law” (see WiC258).\nIn his final chapter Bell looks at a series of alternative ways of governing China and concludes that the nation is going to need a model that incorporates political meritocracy at the central government level, and more democracy at the local level. But he doesn’t specify how the judicial branch will interact with either, and in WiC’s view that’s really the ‘Magna Carta question’ facing China.\nTowards the end of this political study Bell states “I want to emphasise this book is not a defence of the status quo” and indeed, he points to a lot of the problems within the existing system.\nHowever, his most concrete suggestion may in fact be the rebranding exercise he proposes in his final paragraph. He says the Chinese Communist Party “needs” to change its name because “the CCP is neither Communist nor a party… it is a pluralistic organisation composed of meritocratically selected members of different groups and classes, and it aims to represent the whole country. A more accurate name might be the Chinese Meritocratic Union (Zhongguo xianneng lianmeng). A more politically correct name – given the importance of the term democracy (minzhu) in official Chinese political discourse and among independent Chinese intellectuals, as well as the fact that the political system as a whole incorporates democratic characteristics – might be the Union of Democratic Meritocrats (Minzhu xianneng lianmeng).”\nIt remains to be seen whether Xi Jinping sees merit in such an idea…\n© ChinTell Ltd.

That’s called a “get,” in addition to cases where it can be given were points regarding infidelity, punishment, otherwise irreconcilable differences. Into the Orthodox Judaism, a religious separation must go through procedures in advance of a great rabbinical court just before an effective “get” is supplied.\nBeginning in India, Hinduism isn’t just one, unitary religion, but, rather, a set of standards sensed a life. There is no one sacred text message such a beneficial Bible or Torah, but some Hindus have confidence in dharma, the religious password that governs your perform and you will obligations.\nDivorce is allowed in Hinduism, but it appears to be unusual in that faith in comparison to anybody else. And since Hinduism considers ent and life-long promise made in the presence of several gods, divorce was never an option. However, the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 in India allowed divorce under certain conditions, including infidelity, abandonment, cruelty, and absence of communication, among other reasons.\nIslam, the world’s 2nd-prominent faith, believes in a single God, Allah, along with his prophet, Muhammad. Muslims believe they need to yield to the will off Allah, and proceed with the Qur’an, its central and you can sacred religious text message.

Variations range from the concept you to definitely men can also be quickly remarry shortly after a legitimate split up whereas a lady should not remarry for a good particular time frame (constantly three months).\nSince Buddhism doesn’t have rigid tenets on the wedding, divorce proceedings is acceptance regarding religion which is open-ended. Splitting up could actually be necessary in the event the an unsatisfied relationship causes be concerned otherwise distress.\nStudies have shown that religious involvement can reduce divorce rates (from the around 14 per cent based on you to). And at least one study reported that people that attended chapel together have been less likely to want to separation and divorce. But that doesn’t make the process any easier or less complicated for those considering going through it.\nAfter all, no matter your religion, divorce can be a touchy subject. Though views on divorce have changed with time, there can be a stigma associated with it that’s hard to shake. Some people undoubtedly worry a divorce will cause judgment or even shame from others in a religious community.

{"question":"What role does environmental protection play in both Japanese urushi production and the Teikei farming system near Kinosaki?","answer":"Both systems demonstrate strong environmental consciousness. In the Teikei farming system near Kinosaki, farmers actively work to preserve wetland habitats and have helped reintroduce the endangered Oriental Stork (konotori) through organic farming practices that protect the birds' food sources like frogs and fish. This led to the first natural stork hatching in 2007 since 1964. In urushi production, there is also environmental consideration - the urushi trees are carefully managed, with skilled collectors making precise cuts every 4-5 days during collection season to allow trees to restore their strength. Each tree can only be harvested for one season, yielding about 200ml of sap, after which new trees must be planted, showing a sustainable approach to resource management.","context":["Community supported foods and farming. The Urgenci International Network, Kobe Conference April 2010\nJudith Hitchman, abril 2010\n. Author of the form : Judith Hitchman\nInternational Newsletter on Sustainable Local Development Newsletter #67 – April 1st, 2010\nComité International d’URGENCI Site internet : www.urgenci.net/\nCountry ; Japan\n« Infra » : Tamba city, he Hyogo Prefecture en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamba,…\n3. Activity area(s) : (tick one or 2 boxes)\no Agriculture, alimentation o Marketing, distribution, consumption\n1. Initial objectives\nSince when ? To satisfy which need(s) ?\nThree separate initiatives came together, led largely by Yoshinori Kaneko, to form the Japanese Teikei system. A similar unrelated birth occurred in Switzerland around the same period. As Elizabeth Henderson, one of the leading figures in the field of CSA and the global fight for local solidarity-based partnerships between producers and consumers so rightly says: “A century of ‘development’ has broken the connection between people and the land where their food is grown in many countries, North and South. A few decades of free trade have driven family-scale farms to the point of desperation. A long series of food scandals - illness from food-borne pathogens, milk and other products contaminated with GMOs and chemical pollutants - have led to a crisis of confidence in imported foods from industrial-scale farms. CSA offers a return to wholeness, health and economic viability”.\nWith the world in a state of on-going economic, financial, social and environmental crises, the relevance of local actions is greater than ever before. The importance of food sovereignty at local community level has taken on a new meaning. Not that Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a new phenomenon. The concept was first developed in Japan in the early 1970s, to try to guarantee healthy organic food at a time when mercury poisoning had led to Minemata disease, mother’s milk poisoned their children, and pollution was causing increasing environmental havoc.\n2. Modalities of realisation (how)\nAn exemplary case-study: Tamba city local authorities play their part. Japanese culture is largely based on the concept of harmony and peace, which is not an easy challenge in a country where 21 per cent of the population are over 65, agricultural land increasingly lying fallow, more food imported from abroad, young people moving from the rural to the urban lifestyle… Food also plays a very central role in Japanese lifestyles, and is traditionally one of the finest cuisines in the world.\nWe had the unique opportunity of a field trip to Tamba city before the Kobe conference took place, to visit a local initiative. Tamba city is the result of 6 different towns merging some years ago. It has a population of 71,000, and is situated in the Hyogo Prefecture, about an hour’s drive from Kobe. It is where Shinji Hashimoto, one of the members of the Urgenci International Committee lives and farms. The region is famous for both its beautiful scenery and its food. In order to develop the Teikei system, and address some of the challenges stated above, Shinji was largely instrumental in convincing the Local Authorities to financially support some 20 young people from various cities who wanted to become farmers to gain access to farmland. He helped to initiate an apprenticeship scheme so that the young people could learn their new profession, alternating between internship and working their own rented farms. The initiative has proven highly successful, with over 1,000 consumers benefiting from the box scheme and able to buy reasonably priced organic fruit and vegetables for ten months of the year.\nThe producers and consumers involved in the scheme prepared one of the finest banquets I have ever eaten for our group, all from local produce, all cooked by members of the Teikei scheme. The ceremonial speeches were moving, with the mayor and other local figures speaking and toasting the farmers and the group of foreign visitors. The farmers all introduced themselves to the group, and presented their individual projects. Most had left factory jobs in cities to take up a rural lifeand serve their community by producing healthy food.\nUsing and preserving nature\nThe search for harmony already mentioned above can best be illustrated by the approach to growing organic rice and preservation of the wetlands: the paddy fields are populated with ducks. They keep them clean, provide natural fertiliser, and good healthy meat. The Oriental Stork (konotori), is a bird that is very sensitive to pollution. It became extinct in Japan due to “modern” farming practices killing off its food supply of frogs, fish and other wetland animals. The last bird died near Kinosaki in 1971. Konotori no Sato Park was built to reintroduce the storks to Japan using birds obtained from Russia. The storks themselves are now designated a special protected animal by the government, and have become a symbol of the Tajima region around Kinosaki where I spent several days, where even the local airport is named after them (Konotori Tajima Airport). Located 10 km south of Kinosaki, the Konotori no Sato Park is part museum and part breeding habitat, where visitors can learn about the storks, the breeding program and conservation, as well as see the birds on the sanctuary grounds.\nThe aims of the program are being realized as local farmers are altering their farming practices to preserve the wetland habitat, and the storks are being successfully reintroduced into the wild. In May 2007, for the first time since 1964 a stork chick hatched in nature. Its parents were born at the sanctuary and released into the wild. The Teikei farmers of the region are very proud of their storks, and rightly so!\n3. With whom (in relation of cooperation with…) :\n· The immediate environment (name the main partners) : producers ; consumers ; local authorities ; woman · Networks and external partners (name the main partners): Seikatsu Club, URGENCI, Russia · Funders\n4. Present orientation\nOne major challenge facing all forms of alternative economic production in general, and food in particular, is that of standards and quality. In a world where the transnational agribusiness has imposed quality certification costs that are prohibitive for small-scale producers, there is an even greater risk of being excluded from the market. The participatory guarantee system (PGS), such as Nature et Progrès in France, does however provide a positive answer to this. A similar system operates in Japan.\nA far greater and more insidious threat is the industrial-scale production of organic food by transnational corporations, trying to cash in on the ‘niche market’ of the increasing number of people who have understood the dangers of GMOs and pesticides, but are unable to distinguish between industrial-organic and family-farm produce, and who see the organic food sold in supermarkets as an attractive option. It seems important to me to raise public awareness on this issue.\nDimension(s) of solidarity of the initiative according to the author of the form :\nLike so many of the case studies, the Teikei system and other CSA approaches (AMAP in France, GAS in Italy, farmers markets in the UK, Equiterre in Quebec, Vodelsteams in Belgium, Reciproco in Portugal…) are all based on a form of sustainable local development. Local food, local jobs, less fuel, fewer food miles… As Elizabeth Henderson states: “Each local food project takes its shape from the tastes, talents, needs and resources of its creators. The more we can learn from and support one another, the faster we will move toward sustainable and peaceful communities”. To achieve this, the Urgenci international network intends to continue disseminating the Local Solidarity Partnerships between Producers and Consumers (LSPPC) approach, and build alliances and partnerships with other networks to strengthen the ability of civil society to fight the multiple crises.\nTO GO DEEPER : IF YOU WISH\n1. What economy does or can the action generate ?\nIn both instances, the field trips allowed us to observe how rich and strong a more community-oriented economy can become, when it is anchored in the needs of the local population.\n2. What propositions of common right does it allow to elaborate ? The Urgenci International Network brings together the many different national networks of consumer-producer partnerships from different countries all over the world. Its key aims are to disseminate and promote the concept of Community Supported Agriculture, as well as other related issues, such as the preservation of biodiversity and access to land. It also includes other similar concepts, such as farmers’ markets. The current global situation is leading to a natural development of the phenomenon, and it is a vital part of building a new solidarity-based economy.\nInternational Newsletter of Sustainable Local Development n°67","- 日本の漆の歴史と伝統 -\nThe History and the Characteristics of\nUrushi Lacquerware 漆器\nDeep and shiny luster of black or red, sometimes adorned with a gold leaf or mother-of-pearl inlay, you may have encountered beautifully decorated urushi lacquered chests or boxes or tableware in museums or as in historical treasures from the East.\nJapanese lacquerware, referred to as \"japan\" in the old days, was introduced to the West in the16th century and widely spread in the 17th century by the Dutch East India Company, and immediately enthralled royalty and nobility.\nFor thousands of years, Japanese lacquer; urushi(漆), which is the sap extracted from urushi tree, has been used as a protective coating material or an adhesive to produce holy ceremonial ornaments, works of art, and utilitarian objects. In fact, the oldest urushi lacquered ornaments discovered in Japan (Kakinoshima B ruins in Hokkaido) dates back to 7000 BC, during the Jomon period, and they are the world’s oldest urushi lacquer objects that had been found until today.\nThe beauty and the luster are not the only appeals of urushi lacquer. Urushi is one of the most durable natural lacquers. It comes from the sap of the urushi tree (rhus verniciflua), which grows mainly in East Asia. The extraction of the sap uses and maximizes the natural vitality of the urushi tree. The urushi tree creates the sap to cure oneself when the tree is damaged. Therefore, it has many excellent characteristics, starting from its unique drying process caused by humidity, showing great adhesion strength onto many substances creating great hardness with durability if once dried. Urushi lacquer is resistant to water, acids, alkali, alcohol, and heat. It also has antibacterial effects and anti-insects effects and the people from ancient knew its characteristics.\nTherefore urushi lacquer had been applied to many important things from the past, such as religious and ceremonial ornaments, Buddha, armor goods, wooden structures and ceilings and floors of temples and shrines, tableware and furniture, and so on. We Japanese had been living in the world surrounded by the urushi lacquer. In this era, you still will be able to see the most traditional Japanese values in the traditional wedding ceremony.\nTraditional Japanese wedding ceremony,having sake before the god.\nphoto from 写真AC taken by yagitoki\nTraditionally urushi lacquerware sakazuki (sake cup) is used.\nphoto from 写真AC taken by kkphoto\nTo make lacquerware as tableware, urushi will be applied onto, most of the time, wood materials, and in some cases, some form of naturally based materials like cloth or paper formed into shapes using molds. With repeated multiprocess of urushi lacquer coating, drying, and polishing will create a durable and beautiful surface you see as Japanese lacquerware. For an example, Wajima lacquerware (Made in Wajima-City, Ishikawa Pref. ) goes through between 75 to 130 processes (by hand) before it is complete as one of the most durable lacquerwares in Japan.\n(You will find a comprehensive guide of Japanese lacquerware here;\nUsing urushi as an adhesive, decorating technique such as maki-e (sprinkled application of gold or silver powder/plate) or raden (mother-of-pearl inlay). Urushi decorating techniques reached the height of beauty and sophistication in the Edo period in the 18th century.\nToday, we can enjoy the fruit of superb craftsmanship cultivated through our long history of urushi in our daily lives. We hope you would enjoy the beauty, the sophistication behind the Japanese lacquerware and its tradition.\nWhat is Urushi? 漆\nUrushi is a natural sap from the urushi tree. There are no synthetic urushi in the world, or to say urushiol (main component or urushi) can not be made synthetically.\nBy material composition, in the case of Japanese raw urushi, it is composed of urushiol (60–65 wt%), water (25–30 wt%), plant gums (5–7 wt%), and enzymatic laccase(0.2 wt%). Urushiol is basically an organic oil. The composition differs from where the tree grew or when or how it is tapped. The more urushiol is contained the better it is as urushi lacquer.\nThe raw urushi is used, after filtering wood scraps and contaminations, to adhere and protect for instance wood. It is said that the protection employed by the urushi is at the maximum when used in a raw state. Fuki-urushi (applied and wiped urushi) uses this raw urushi.\nOn the other hand, refining raw urushi goes through two major processes, stirring (called Nayashi) and water content evaporation and concentration to about 3 wt% (called Kurome). This will make the urushi more transparent as lacquer and creates a higher gloss when applied. These are very important processes for an urushi to become a quality lacquer for lacquerware.\nIn order to further create aesthetical characteristics and apply urushi on various things to have desired effects as a lacquer, many natural substances are added to refined urushi. For example, diatomite for durability enhancements, rice or tofu (soybean protein) for further viscosity and adhesion, or iron hydroxide for black color, ferric oxide for red color, and many more.\nThe hardening process of urushi lacquer is unique due to its natural process. With the presence of high humidity (70-80% RH), and warm temperature (20-25 degC), oxidation of urushiol catalyzed by laccase causes urushiol to be polymerized, like plastic. Therefore the film formed is very hard and durable and resistant to water, acids, alkali, alcohol, and heat. Urushi itself also is a strong adhesive, providing strong adhesion strength to many different materials, such as wood, metal, ceramics, leather (dear skin), stone, etc. On top of it, urushi has a functional effect such as a strong antibacterial effect and the anti-insects effect that will last even after it is applied and dried.\nUrushi is not tolerant only to UV exposure. However, it is said that urushi lacquer is the best natural coating material ever.\nUrushi tree after urushi sap has been collected (Ibaragi, Japan)\nCut down urushi tree after urushi sap has been collected for the season of five months (Ibaragi, Japan)\nTraditional urushi refining process \"Kurome\" by hand under the sun.\nIt is to evaporate water content from about 30% to 3 wt%.\nNatural urushi lacquer for base coat use.\n(Courtesy of Wajimaya Zen-ni )\nThe intermediate polishing process of a rectangular plate\n(Courtesy of Wajimaya Zen-ni )\nThe middle coating process of a small bowl\n(Courtesy of Wajimaya Zen-ni )\nCultural Recognition of Lacquerwork In Japan\nLacquerwork as an Important\nIntangible Cultural Properties\nJapanese government recognizes and designates the most important Japanese cultural properties for those tangible, as “National Treasures” or “Important Cultural Properties” and those intangible, as “Important Intangible Cultural Properties”. They are the highest regarded historical assets that Japan possesses.\n(You will find a definitional overview of the Cultural Properties by the government here;http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/policy/cultural_properties/..)\nToiletry Case with Cart Wheels in Stream (片輪車蒔絵螺鈿手箱) 12th Century “National Treasure”\n(Tokyo National Museum)\nThere are many Japanese lacquerwares from our history that are designated as the National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties such as “Toiletry Case with Cart Wheels in Stream (Tokyo National Museum)” from the Heian period (12th century).\nThe techniques and the skills to make Japanese lacquerware that is inherited as lacquerwork is designated as Important Intangible Cultural Properties (IICP) of Craft Techniques category.\nCurrently, lacquerwork is one of the seven areas of the IICP Craft Techniques that holds its recognition. Those seven areas are Ceramics, Textile weaving, and dyeing, Metalwork, Woodwork and Bamboo work, Doll making, Papermaking, and Lacquerwork.\nWithin IICP Craft Techniques recognition, there are 16 “Collective” or ”Group” recognition and 59 “Individual” recognition (as of April 2019). Individual recognition is awarded to an actual master of skilled individuals so they are called “the Living National Treasure” in a common term.\nAmong the total of 59 individual Living National Treasures in the area of the Craft Techniques, 11 individuals are from the lacquerwork area. From this, you understand how lacquerwork possesses different highly skills with respect to the skills. Four out of 11 individual lacquerwork Living National Treasures have been working in Wajima or working for Wajima-nuri.\nTwo out of 16 Collective or Group IICP Craft Techniques recognition, are from the lacquerwork. The Wajima-nuri (lacquerwork) holds this Collective IICP recognition since 1977 and in 2017 the Tsugaru-nuri (lacquerwork) was added, and as a whole, these are the only two recognized areas of all the lacquerworks made in Japan (among more than 23 areas that produce lacquerware).\nFrom this fact, you could sense that the Wajima lacquerwork skill is considered as one of the highest and valuable lacquerwork skills thus achieving respect among all the lacquerworks in Japan.\nUrushi, A Valuable Asset 漆\nUrushi sap is a natural resin by its nature. The Urushi sap is a curing aid medium of the tree itself while the tree is harmed. Therefore, the Urushi sap has many outstanding characteristics for protections. Only about 200 ml (one cup) of the Urushi sap could be collected from an Urushi tree of 10 to 15years of age, and that's it. The tree will be mostly cut down after the sap is collected, for a new tree to be planted.\nUrushi sap collection in Japan\nAll the urushi production, which is to collect sap, is all made by specially trained skilled craftsmen. (This not only in Japan but also in China and Southeast Asia) There are no other ways to collect the urushi sap from each and every individually unique trees.\nHere the typical urushi sap collection in Japan is shown by Mr.Gaku Hirai, a trained urushi sap collector. He is collecting urushi from the urushi tree in Hitachi-Ohmiya City, Ibaragi-Pref.\nUrushi tree being groove cut using special urushi kanna (knife)\nThe season for urushi sap collection is from around the end of May to end of October or early November depending on the area. In the season, the sap is collected every 4 to 5 days so that the urushi tree can restore strength from the harm made by the groove cut and generate urushi sap again.\nUrushi tree being groove cut slightly slanted for efficient collection of urushi sap\nThe depth of the groove is the most important factor to produce quality urushi. Since if it is too shallow the sap would not come out and if it is too deep you will threaten the vitality of the urushi tree.\nUrushi sap will ooze out a couple of minutes after the cut\nUrushi sap collection using special urushi spatula\nEvery drop of urushi sap is collected swiftly into the urushi bucket\nUrushi is tapped by carving the bark of the urushi tree with horizontal long groove and let the tree yield clear to milky-white sap. It takes at least 10 years, preferably 15 years for an urushi tree to grow big enough to be tapped.\nA skilled urushi collector will tap the urushi trees from June to October and collect drops of the sap one by one. Normally each urushi tree being tapped will have three days before next taps are made during the season and normally the tree will be cut down after that one season harvest of the urushi sap. The urushi tree yields only about 100 to 200 grams of raw urushi sap in its whole lifetime, which makes it a very precious and expensive substance.\nThe urushi could only be collected by the hands of a skilled urushi collector. There is no machinery to collect the urushi sap. The required skill, knowledge, and decision making to collect fine urushi sap are very high and complex. Since each tree is different, you need to understand how the condition of each tree is.\nTo tap the urushi, you need to take many things into account; the angle of each trunk of the tree, the direction of the sun, the thickness of the bark on each position you tap, how vigor the tree is due to the recent damage you gave, recent weather and so on. If you groove too deep and too long, you will kill the tree and your yield will go down, if you groove too little, you may not kill the tree but the results are the same. If your tapping angle of the groove is not right, you lose the sap.\nFour days is the mimimum interval for tapping a tree. Urushi tree needs three days to produce the urushi. So the urushi collector will come to the tree every four days. The skilled collector may tap about 60 to 100 trees per day, depending on the places. So in theory, you need at least 60 x 4 = 240 new trees per season for a collector to efficiently collect the urushi sap in the season. The collector will collect in total 240(trees) x 150(grams/tree) = 36 (kgs) of raw urushi per season of five months full-time work without weekends. (tapping is not done on a rainy day) You need at least 10 years for an urushi tree before being tapped. Therefore, you constantly need at least 240 x 10 years = 2400 urushi trees for the urushi collector to sustain his work.\nTraditionally urushi trees have been cultivated in the steepest mountains where the farming cannot be made. (Recent urushi tree cultivation are made on moderate hills for preservation purpose) Urushi tree yields the best sap in the highest season in summer. Therefore Urushi collection had been one of the toughest occupations in Japan.\nFacts about the Urushi lacquer used in Japan\nThe production volume of the Japanese urushi lacquer in Japan, in the year 2013, was 1045 kgs in total. (from the government statistics) It was only a 2.6% share of the total natural urushi lacquer consumed in Japan. The rest 97% is natural urushi lacquer imported from China(89.2%),Thailand(5.7%) & Myanmar(2.5%). From our history, it is said that the import of raw urushi lacquer from China dates back to the Edo period (1603 - 1868).\nThe Chinese natural urushi lacquer has almost the same material composition as the Japanese natural urushi lacquer, but it is said that the Japanese urushi lacquer has higher gloss and luster with higher hardness when it is applied, dried and polished, compared to the Chinese urushi lacquer, therefore the aesthetical beauty will differ when used on surface. On the other hand, the cost of the Chinese natural urushi lacquer is one-tenth to one-fifth of that of the Japanese one. Therefore, even the highest quality Japanese lacquerware we provide uses the Japanese natural urushi lacquer on the top-coat of the product. The bottom-coat or the middle-coat uses the Chinese natural urushi lacquer, where the aesthetic quality of the lacquer will not be a problem.\nYou may have understood how valuable the urushi is and the efforts behind to create genuine lacquerware. We are certain that your interest in Japanese lacquerware will help preserve the urushi collection in Asia.\nAreas in Japan that Our Lacquerwares are Made\nOur Area Brands and Locations in Japan\n- Wajima-city Ishikawa\n- Kaga-city Ishikawa\n- Hida Shunkei\n- Takayama-city Gifu\n- Sabae-city Fukui\nCurrently, the products that we carry are from the Hokuriku (Central Northern Areas of Honshu Main Island)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:95042535-f830-401d-9482-3fab5d9a9ed9>","<urn:uuid:d68280c0-5b4e-481c-a38a-03c081557849>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does TypeScript handle bottom types, and what is their primary use case in exhaustive conditionals?","answer":"Bottom types in TypeScript are described using the 'never' keyword and represent types that can hold no possible value in the system. They are particularly useful in exhaustive conditionals, where they can be used to handle unreachable cases through an error subclass.","context":["Table of Contents\nCompiling a TypeScript ProgramMike walks through the structure of a TypeScript program, the TSC compiler CLI command, discusses how the compiler-emitted JS code changes depending on JS language level and module type, and demonstrates a program’s compiled output, including the type declaration file.

A student's question regarding type and test driven development is also covered in this segment.\nOptional PropertiesMike demonstrates how to state optional properties for objects using the ? operator and discusses the difference between optional properties and properties that have the option of being undefined. A demonstration of TypeScript throwing an excess property error, why the error exists, and how to handle the error is also provided in this segment.\nIndex Signatures & Object Q&AMike demonstrates how to represent a type for dictionaries to allow values of a consistent type to be retrievable by keys. Student questions regarding the excess property erroring case and why storing the object as a variable removes the error are also covered in this segment.\nStructural vs Nominal TypesMike discusses type checking as the attempt to evaluate the question of compatibility or type equivalence and the meaning of duck typing. The difference between static and dynamic type systems, nominal and structural type systems, and strong and weak types are also described in this segment.\nUnion TypesMike briefly discusses both union and intersection types which can conceptually be thought of as logical boolean operators (AND, OR) as they pertain to types. Union types in TypeScript can be described using the | (pipe) operator. How to narrow with type guards and a description of discriminated unions is also covered in this segment.\nIntersection TypesMike demonstrates intersection types in TypeScript which can be described using the & (ampersand) operator and walks through an example of adding extra data to a Date object. A student's question regarding clarification on the difference between union and intersection types is also covered in this segment.\nType AliasesMike provides a brief overview of the material covered Type Aliases and Interfaces segments, discusses what type aliases allow in TypeScript, and inheritance. Type aliases can define a more meaningful name for a type, declare the particulars of the type in a single place, and import and export this type from modules.\nInterfacesMike discusses interfaces which can only be used to define object types and the formalities in regards to inheritance including extends and implements. Open interfaces, how to choose which to use between type aliases and interfaces, and recursive types are also covered in this segment.\nJSON Types ExerciseMike walks through an exercise of defining correct types to describe given JSON values and suppress the thrown type check errors.\nFunctions & Function OverloadsMike discusses a brief overview of the functions section, the return type void, callable types, and construct signatures, which are interfaces or type aliases that describe something that can be invoked or instructed. Function overloads, where multiple function heads that serve as entry points to a single implementation are defined, are also demonstrated in this segment.\nthis Types & Best PracticesMike discusses how to handle and invoke a function that uses a this element, such as a click handler.

{"question":"What are the procedural requirements for serving legal documents in small claims cases versus LIP cases, and what are the consequences of improper service?","answer":"In small claims cases, there are specific requirements for serving documents: for Florida residents, service can be done through certified mail, while for non-Florida residents or Florida corporations, service must be done by either the county sheriff or an authorized private process server. For LIP cases, proper service of the Claim Form must occur within 4 months after issue, and it's important to verify the LIP's contact details to ensure receipt of all correspondence. In both scenarios, improper service can prevent the case from proceeding - in small claims cases, the process cannot continue without proper service, while in LIP cases, failing to serve within the required timeframe can lead to jurisdiction disputes when filing the Acknowledgment of Service form.","context":["The decline in public funding and the expense of CFAs may have contributed to what seems to be a steady increase in those choosing to represent themselves rather than instruct a solicitor. For any Defendant, the experience of dealing with a litigant in person (‘LIP’) with little or no grasp of the legal system is time consuming, expensive and often frustrating. Managing a LIP’s expectations can be tricky and at times may feel like a full-time job. The Courts are rightly concerned to ensure that LIPs have, and are seen to have, access to justice. As a result judges are generally sympathetic to LIPs and often view Defendant’s solicitors as having a role that can be difficult to reconcile with duties to the Defendant, ensuring the LIP understand the litigation process and are not prejudiced by lack of resources. This article provides some top tips on how to manage a claim with a LIP and takes a looks at the tactics you may employ against vexatious litigants.\nChecklist on receipt of Proceedings:\n- Always advise the LIP to obtain legal advice. Free legal advice is available from the Litigants in Person Service and Citizens Advise Bureau. Most Claimant lawyers provide a free session to assess whether a claim has merit and discuss funding options. This invitation may be taken as a slight by the LIP but it is something that the Court will expect to see, particularly if considering a strike-out or costs application.\n- Has the LIP made a claim before and are they potentially vexatious? While we look at handling vexatious litigants later on in this article, if the name on the Claim Form appears familiar check that they have not made a claim about the same issue previously. If they have, consider notifying the Court immediately and/or striking out the claim. The Courts keep a list of vexatious litigants or those subject to Civil Restraint Orders.\n- Check that the LIP’s contact details (including home address, email and telephone number) are correct to ensure all correspondence and documents you send are received. Remember that if documents need to be served by a deadline the luxury of service by fax (or email) may not be available and do not leave this until the last minute.\n- Was the Claim Form issued within the limitation period? Like anybody else, a LIP has 3 years from the date of injury to issue proceedings subject to any arguments about date of knowledge i.e. he did not become aware of the injury until a date later than the date of incident. Claims issued outside of the limitation period are statute barred.\n- Was the Claim Form served within 4 months after issue? If not, and the LIP cannot issue a further Claim Form because limitation has expired consider disputing the Court’s jurisdiction when you serve the Acknowledgment of Service form.\n- Has the LIP complied with the Civil Procedure Rules and served Particulars of Claim, a Schedule of Loss (both documents require a signed statement of truth) and a medical report substantiating the injuries claimed from the correct expert. If not, an application requiring him to comply with the Court rules (CPR PD16) by serving these documents may be necessary. In many cases this will produce further information, for instance that the LIP had previous solicitors with LSC funding until receipt of an unsupportive expert opinion.\nResolving the Claim\n- Treat the LIP with courtesy and sensitivity throughout the litigation process.\n- Take the claim seriously and investigate each allegation as you would with a represented party.\n- Take time to explain to the LIP each step of the litigation process. We send the LIP copy Orders in case the Court fails to serve them and frequently send copies of the relevant CPR sections they need to comply with in advance. The Court expects a represented party to assist a LIP. If the LIP understands the litigation process it will make your life easier or in difficult cases at least the LIP will not be able to rely on ignorance of the rules.\n- Restrict contact to one nominated person if telephone or written correspondence becomes aggressive or difficult. In some cases it will be necessary to insist on written communication only.\n- Obtain clinicians’ comments and expert evidence promptly. Consider early service of evidence; it may help the LIP understand the Defendant’s case and manage expectations.\n- Consider settlement as soon as possible if the claim is meritorious. You may have to encourage the LIP to take legal advice again at this stage.\n- Apply for Summary Judgement if you have evidence that the claim has no real prospect of success or apply to strike out the claim if it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process.\n- Be prepared to take technical points if there has been a procedural irregularity that is more than just a nuisance and ask for your costs to be summarily assessed. An unless order or an adverse costs order can be a useful tool to focus a LIP’s mind on the case.\n- Remember that a LIP may be entitled to recover costs for the work they have done in connection with the case, if successful.\n- Reserve the case to the same District Judge or Master. If a District Judge or Master has got to grips with the issue and dealt with the LIP robustly you can ask him or her to reserve it to the same District Judge or Master to avoid someone else having to start afresh at the next hearing.\n- Assume that the LIP does not know what he/she is talking about.\n- Presume that the claim has no merit even if you have had experience of the LIP before.\n- Get involved in lengthy discussions, correspondence or disputes. Correspond with the LIP in writing if telephone calls are difficult but keep to the point. This avoids misunderstandings and provides evidence to the Court that the Defendant is treating the Claimant fairly and with consideration from the outset. However, there are vexatious LIPs who will argue the same issue indefinitely and at length. If you have answered the point already, and are sure, say so politely and do not go back there each time.\n- Use legal jargon. Make sure the LIP is clear about what is required from them and use lay terms.\n- Forget that that extra time and money is often required to manage claims with LIPs. The litigation process may be drawn out and more expensive than one may anticipate.\n- Make threats. There can be a fine line between explaining that a course of conduct is likely to lead to a costs order and giving the appearance that you are trying to use the LIPs lack of legal or financial support unfairly.\nA vexatious litigant is defined as someone who ‘habitually and persistently and without reasonable grounds’ issues claims’. They can be tricky to manage, time consuming and expensive. If a Claimant has brought the same or similar claim before or has issued a number of claims which lack merit or sense what steps can you take?\n1. Strike out the claim\nIf there are no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim, it is an abuse of the Court’s process or if there has been a failure to comply with a rule, practice direction or court order you can apply to strike out the claim. This is often the quickest and cheapest way to deal with a vexatious claim. However, some LIPs just issue the same claim again in the same or a neighbouring Court and you cannot just repeat the exercise again and again.\n2. Civil Restraint Orders (CRO)\nFor the more persistent Claimants consider applying to the Court for one of three types of CRO:\n- A limited CRO. This prevents a Claimant from making an application without the permission of the Court where he or she has made two or more applications in the same case without merit.\n- An extended CRO. This prevents a Claimant from making an application for a specified period of time (up to two years) where he or she has continuously brought claims or made applications without merit.\n- A general CRO. This prevents a Claimant from bringing a claim or making an application without the permission of the Court for a specified period of time (up to two years) where there is already an extended civil restraint order and the Claimant continues to bring claims or make applications.\n3. Apply to the Attorney General declaring the Claimant vexatious.\nDenial of a Claimant’s access to justice is a serious step and not one the Court will agree to lightly. This is demonstrated by the fact that only 179 vexatious litigants have been declared by the High Court since 1955. (go to www.hmcourt-service.gov.uk/infoabout/vexatious_litigant to see the current list). An application pursuant to Section 42 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 by the Attorney General is required to declare a Claimant vexatious. The Attorney General can apply to the High Court to prevent a litigant instituting any proceedings without the leave of the High Court, either for a specified period or indefinitely under but such an application is only likely to be made in exceptional circumstances. It was for this reason that CROs were brought in and they are a far more flexible and accessible tool.\nIf you have any queries about how best to deal with a LIP or are struggling with a vexatious litigant please contact us and we can offer further advice and assistance.","Small Claims Court\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a small claims action?\nIt’s when there is a dispute between two parties, and the issue in controversy does not exceed $5,000. You should review Chapter 34 of the Florida Statutes for a description of which causes of action are covered under small claims in the county court. Also review the small claims rules of procedure located in section 7 of the Florida Rules of Court for more detailed information. The statutes and rules of procedure which apply will depend upon the type of case filed. It is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the laws that apply to your particular case by visiting your local law library.\nThe first step in filing a small claims action is obtaining and filling out the necessary forms usually consisting of a statement of claim and a notice or service of process which requires the parties to appear at a specified pre-trial conference. Small claims forms are available at your local Clerk of Court's Office.\nWhat happens after filing?\nOnce the statement of claim has been completed and filed with the clerk of court, the plaintiff must provide the defendant with the copies of the statement of claim and the service of process form. In a small claims case, there are two general ways to provide the defendant with these forms.\nIf the defendant lives in Florida, the statement of claim and services of process form can be sent by certified mail through the United States Postal Service. If the defendant refuses to accept the service of process through certified mail, or does not live in the Florida, or is a corporation within Florida, the statement of claim and service of process must be delivered to the defendant by the sheriff of the county where the defendant lives or is located. A private process server who is authorized to serve legal papers may also serve the defendant.\nOnce the defendant has been served, the process may continue. If service of process is done incorrectly or not done at all, the case may not proceed. Once the defendant has been served with the statement of claim and the service of process form, both parties must attend a pre-trial conference.\nWhat happens at the Pre-trial Conference?\nAt the Pre-trial Conference, the judge will review the pleadings and documents and may simplify the issues, refer the case to mediation, and take care of any other matters as needed. You may settle the case with the other party before or at the pre-trial conference by entering into and filing a stipulation agreement. This agreement can settle all or part of the case and becomes part of the court order.\nSometimes, the participation of a third, neutral party is helpful in aiding the litigants in reaching an agreement. This process is called mediation, and your case may be referred to it at the pre-trial conference.\nWhat if we are not able to reach an agreement through mediation?\nIf the parties are unable to reach an agreement through stipulation or mediation, they must appear for trial on the date and the time scheduled by the Clerk during the pre-trial conference. When the defendant fails to respond or show up to defend against the statement of claim, the Clerk or the judge may enter a default judgment. All parties are bound by the applicable law and the court cannot help you to present your case. The parties must make certain to bring all evidence and witnesses to the trial but keep in mind that letters, affidavits, and estimates may not be accepted as evidence.\nWhat is a judgment?\nA judgment is the written decision of the case and includes the amount of money to be paid by one party to another, acts which must be performed, or property which must be transferred. After the judgment is signed, it will be recorded in the county's public records and will be provided to the parties either at the conclusion of the trial or later by mail.\nIf the parties feel the judge has made an error, they have ten days from the date the judgment is entered by the court to file with the clerk for a rehearing.\nAfter the judgment is entered, the winning party may need to execute and enforce the terms of the judgment in order to collect money or property. If judgment monies are paid in full, the plaintiff must furnish the defendant with a completed satisfaction of judgment form which can be obtained from your local Clerk of Court.\nPlease note that the Court does not guarantee collection. It is important to realize that just because you have won a judgment does not mean collection of judgment monies is guaranteed. The Court cannot and does not guarantee collection of judgment monies.\nSmall Claims Resources"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:97bbd8b2-3f24-4b7c-83cd-32adf1ef7065>","<urn:uuid:4337f2ae-7896-4ff0-b43b-167d36451cf3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What makes phishing attacks particularly effective in social engineering, and what are the distinctions between general phishing and more targeted approaches?","answer":"Phishing attacks are effective because they use carefully crafted emails and text messages that appear legitimate and create urgency to get victims to reveal personal information or click malicious links. A key distinction exists between general phishing and spear-phishing attacks. While regular phishing involves broad attempts like fake company emails demanding immediate password changes, spear-phishing is more sophisticated and targeted, requiring more planning time but achieving better success rates. These attacks are particularly effective because they exploit the natural human tendency to trust, making them harder to detect than technical vulnerabilities. According to security experts, attackers prefer social engineering over targeting technical vulnerabilities since people are easier to manipulate than complex security algorithms.","context":["Common Social Engineering Attacks and How to Prevent Them\nOrganizations from all over the world are experiencing an increase in social engineering attacks, both in number and in sophistication. Hackers are devising more clever methods of fooling individuals or employees into giving up sensitive data that can be used to breach the company. As such, organizations need extra due diligence to counter these social engineering attacks.\nWhen it comes to social engineering attacks, they usually involve some type of psychological manipulation designed to fool the target into giving up sensitive data. It is typically done through email or similar forms of communication to invoke a feeling of urgency or fear. This leads the victim to take an action that the attacker wants, such as clicking a link or divulging information without thinking about it. Since this is designed to attack human emotions, it is sometimes difficult to detect and prevent these.\nThe best defense against social engineering attacks is to keep employees educated and mindful.\nHere are a few of the best ways to tackle social engineering attacks, coming from experts in the cybersecurity field.\nSocial Engineering Techniques\nA common technique for social engineering attacks is an email designed specifically for the target person. It tends to look professional and legitimate, seemingly coming from an organization associated with the user, such as a vendor company or maybe even a bank. Hackers can usually copy the actual styles of emails from such companies.\nThe content would be designed to create a sense of urgency, such as saying that their account is compromised and they need to change their passwords immediately by clicking on the link provided. This is where the main difference comes in. In actual emails, the link would direct to the actual, secure website of the sender. In social engineering attacks, however, it would lead to a malicious website, which would then steal the victim’s username and password once they enter it.\nThis can sometimes be done through other forms of communication as well, such as over the telephone. The attacker will say official-sounding statements to get the victim to trust them.\nSimply put, all social engineering attacks are based on establishing trust with the victim. This is done using information that the victim will think is official, but in reality, the attacker simply researched that information through the internet and social media accounts. By mentioning things like common names of friends, workmates, or colleagues, the victim is lulled into a false sense of security, which the attacker takes advantage of.\nAccording to the technical director of Symantec Security Response, most attackers do not target technical vulnerabilities in software and systems in order to penetrate an organization. They have found that social engineering attacks give them a better chance to achieve their goals, as people are easier to target than complex algorithms that can easily detect an attack.\nHow Social Engineering Attacks Can Harm an Organization\nCompanies and organizations run on data that they use for their business. This can include sensitive information from their customers, finances, and operations. When social engineering attacks target an employee, they are trying to get to the data within the organization. Once they have that, they can do several things.\nSell the Data\nThe attackers can sell the data they are able to steal from the organization. This is evident with the LinkedIn data breach of 2016, wherein a Russian hacker by the name of “Peace” stole approximately 117 million accounts and sold it on the dark web.\nNot only did this lead to the company losing face, they also lost money through lost revenue and lawsuits.\nIf a hacker gains access to a company’s system using social engineering attacks, they can install a ransomware, which is a malicious software designed to hold files, data, or even programs inaccessible until the attacker is paid a certain amount. Once this is paid, they will supposedly provide a key to open the locked files or data.\nThis can be inhibiting to a company or organization, as it can lead to either loss of money or resources due to the amount of time and effort needed to deal with the situation.\nDefending Against Social Engineering Attacks\nThere are many ways that a hacker can deal damage to a company when they get access to their networks through social engineering attacks. Money, resources, time, and reputation are all on the line. This is why it is important to defend yourself against these attacks. But how?\nThe best defense against social engineering attacks is education. Educate your employees about these types of attacks and what to look for in order to identify a potential threat. They should also be taught to report any suspicious communication they receive if they have any doubt about its authenticity.\nBy creating proper protocols and security policies, companies can significantly decrease the chances of social engineering attacks from succeeding.\nKevin Jones951 Posts\nKevin Jones, Ph.D., is a research associate and a Cyber Security Author with experience in Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Assessments, Monitoring solutions, Surveillance and Offensive technologies etc. Currently, he is a freelance writer on latest security news and other happenings.

This type of attack can be conducted in person, over the phone, via email, through social media, or even on the computer. Because it’s so difficult to determine who you are talking to and where they’re located, there are typically no warnings before the attack occurs. Once an attacker has access to your data, they can use it for personal gain or cause serious damage to your business by leaking sensitive information that you wouldn’t want public knowledge. In this article, we’ll define how social engineering works and how it affects us every day.\nSocial engineering can happen in person, over the phone, via email, through social media, or even on the computer. Because it’s so difficult to determine who you are talking to and where they’re located, there are typically no warnings before an attack occurs. Once an attacker has access to your data, they can use it for personal gain or cause serious damage to your business by leaking sensitive information that you wouldn’t want public knowledge.\nSocial engineering attacks happen in one or more steps. A perpetrator first gathers background information about the victim, such as points of entry and weak security protocols, which will help them execute their attack successfully. Then they move to gain trust from the victim and provide stimuli for subsequent actions that break security practices by revealing sensitive information or granting access to critical resources.\nThere are a few different types of attacks that social engineers use to perpetrate their schemes.\nPhishing scams are emails and text messages that try to get you to reveal personal information, click on links, or open attachments. An example is an email sent by a fake company requiring immediate action in order to change your password because of a policy violation. It includes a link that looks nearly identical but leads you straight into the trap where they collect all your login credentials while stealing them from the authentic website’s database.\nIn contrast to phishing, a spear-phishing attack is much more targeted. It’s also harder to detect and has better success rates when done skillfully. Spear phishing requires the perpetrator to spend more time planning in order to successfully target their victims and deceive them into changing their passwords or clicking on malicious links that capture information such as login credentials.\nBaiting schemes use a false promise to get users involved. They lure people with personal information or malware onto their system. The most hated form of baiting, known as physical media distribution, usually leaves malware on the user’s computer when they insert an infected flash drive into their workstation or home machine. This is made effective by having an attractive and authentic-looking bait that looks like it belongs in a place where the potential victim would expect something valuable, such as a payroll list, instead of harmful materials.\nUsers are given false alarms and fictitious threats such as infections of malware on their computer, prompting them to install software that has no real benefit (other than for the perpetrator) or is indeed a form of malware. Scareware is also referred to as deception software, rogue scanner technology, and fraudware.\nSocial engineering is a difficult phenomenon to detect and prevent because it happens in the moment. When you’re interacting with someone face-to-face, there’s a sense of trust that typically accompanies that interaction. This is one of the more common methods for social engineering attacks, but it’s not the only one.\nAs an example, let’s say you have a job interview for a sales position at your company. The interviewer asks you if your social media account is public or private. If you say public, then the interviewer can use information from your social media account to find out where you go to school and what social groups you like to attend so they can tailor their questions accordingly. If they know this information about you before going into the interview, it makes it easier for them to display empathy as they talk about why they think you would be perfect for their company. With this type of attack, there’s no warning before the damage has been done.\nAs mentioned, social engineering is hard to detect and even harder to prevent.

{"question":"What is the traditional role of Yama in Hindu mythology, and how does this connect to the ethical concept of yama in yogic practice?","answer":"In Hindu mythology, Yama is the lord of death and justice who judges the souls of the dead and rules the departed. He is depicted with green or red skin, wearing red clothes, and riding a buffalo. He has the power to pull souls from corpses using a rope. As a figure dedicated to maintaining order and harmony, he is sometimes called Dharma. In yogic practice, the term 'yama' refers to ethical restraints or rules for virtuous living. There are ten traditional yamas including ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truthfulness), and asteya (non-stealing). These yamas are not merely rules but are considered expressions of service, love and compassion that guide one's relationship with the world.","context":["Methods | Statistics | Clinical | Educational | Industrial | Professional items | World psychology |\nPhilosophy Index: Aesthetics · Epistemology · Ethics · Logic · Metaphysics · Consciousness · Philosophy of Language · Philosophy of Mind · Philosophy of Science · Social and Political philosophy · Philosophies · Philosophers · List of lists\nYama (Sanskrit: यम) is the Hindu lord of death, whose first recorded appearance is in the Vedas. He is one of the most ancient beings in the world and parallel forms of one sort or another have been found all over Eurasia. He is known as Yima by Zoroastrians, and is considered to be cognate with Ymir of Norse legend and has become known as Enma, or Emma-o (閻魔大王), in Japanese legend. Some even claim that he also shares the same mythological roots as Abel.\nThe spirits of the dead, on being judged by Yama, are supposed to either pass through a term of enjoyment in a region midway between the earth and the heaven of the gods, or to undergo their measure of punishment in Naraka (or Jigoku), the nether world, situated somewhere in the southern region. After this time they return to Earth to animate new bodies.\nIn Vedic tradition Yama was considered to have been the first mortal who died and espied the way to the celestial abodes, and in virtue of precedence he became the ruler of the departed. In some passages, however, he is already regarded as the god of death.\nCharacteristics of YamaEdit\nHe is a Lokapala and an Aditya. In art, he is depicted with green or red skin, red clothes, and riding a buffalo. He holds a loop of rope in his left hand with which he pulls the soul from the corpse. He is the son of Surya (Sun) and twin brother of Yami, or Yamuna, traditionally the first human pair in the Vedas. He was also worshiped as a son of Vivasvat and Saranya. He is one of the Ashta-Dikpalas and represents the south. He reports to Lord Shiva the Destroyer, an aspect of Trimurti (Hinduism's triune Godhead). Three hymns (10, 14, and 35) in the Rig Veda Book 10 are addressed to him.\nYama is also the lord of justice and is sometimes referred to as Dharma, in reference to his unswerving dedication to maintaining order and adherence to harmony. In this capacity, he is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap in Japanese art. It is said that he is also one of the wisest of the devas. In the Katha Upanishad, among the most famous Upanishads, Yama is portrayed as a teacher. He is the father of Yudhisthira, the oldest brother of the 5 Pandavas (Karna was born prior to Kunti's wedlock, so technically Karna is Yudhthira's older brother) and is said to have incarnated as Vidura by some accounts in the Mahabharata period.\nGaruda Purana mentions Yama often. His description is in 2.5.147-149: \"There very soon among Death, Time, etc. he sees Yama with red eyes, looking fierce and dark like a heap of collyrium, with fierce jaws and frowning fiercely, chosen as their lord by many ugly, fierce-faced hundreds of diseases, possessing an iron rod in his hand and also a noose. The creature goes either to good or to bad state as directed by him.\" In 2.8.28-29, \"...the seven names of Yama, viz Yama, Dharma-raja, Mrtyu, Antaka, Vaivasvata, Kala, Sarva-pranahara...\". His wife is Syamala (3.17.4-5, 3.29.16, 24-25).\nSubordination to Shiva and VishnuEdit\nAnother story, found in the Bhagavata Purana, shows Yama's subordinance to Vishnu. The man Ajamila had committed many evil acts during his life such as stealing, abandoning his wife and children, and marrying a prostitute. At the moment of his death he involuntarily chanted the name of Narayana (the Sanskrit name for Vishnu) and achieved moksha, becoming saved from the messengers of Yama. Although Ajamila had actually been thinking the name of his youngest son, Narayana's name has powerful effects, and thus Ajamila was released from his great sins. \nYamas as codes of conductEdit\nIn a related usage, a yama is a \"restraint\" or rule for living virtuously. Ten yamas are codified in numerous scriptures, including the Shandilya and Varaha Upanishads, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika by Gorakshanatha, and the Tirumantiram of Tirumular. Patanjali lists five yamas in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.\nThe ten traditional yamas are:\n- Ahimsa: abstinence from injury, harmlessness, the not causing of pain to any living creature in thought, word, or deed at any time. This is the \"main\" Yama. The other nine are there in support of its accomplishment.\n- Satya: truthfulness, word and thought in conformity with the facts.\n- Asteya: non-stealing, non-coveting, non-entering into debt.\n- Brahmacharya: divine conduct, continence, celibate when single, faithful when married.\n- Kshama: patience, releasing time, functioning in the now.\n- Dhriti: steadfastness, overcoming non-perseverance, fear, and indecision; seeing each task through to completion.\n- Daya: compassion; conquering callous, cruel and insensitive feelings toward all beings.\n- Arjava: honesty, straightforwardness, renouncing deception and wrongdoing.\n- Mitahara: moderate appetite, neither eating too much nor to little; nor consuming meat, fish, shellfish, fowl or eggs.\n- Shaucha: purity, avoidance of impurity in body, mind and speech.\n- Aparigraha: absence of avariciousness, non-appropriation of things not one's own.\nYama in popular cultureEdit\n- In the anime and manga Dragon Ball, Enma (The Japanese name for Yama) is portrayed as a harried bureaucrat with a short temper, attended to by an army of office-worker oni. Though the ruler of the afterlife, he is surpassed in power by both the four Kaiō and the one remaining Kaiōshin (higher gods in whose hands rest the stewardship of the entire universe).\n- He is depicted in a similar fashion in YuYu Hakusho, as the pen-pushing ruler of the spirit world and a shadowy figure known for his temper; however, he is also the father of Koenma (literally, \"Child-Enma\"), who often runs the underworld in his father's stead. He is known as \"Yemma\" (based on an older Japanese pronunciation) in the English-dubbed Dragon Ball Z anime, and Yama in the English version of YuYu Hakusho.\n- Yama is a major character in the science fiction novel Lord of Light by Roger Zelazny. In this novel certain colonists from Earth gain control of high technology on a faraway planet and rule it as Hindu gods. Yama is the genius behind most of the technology.\n- In the Spriggan manga, Yama was a virus programmed from ancient text that overran an ARCAM compound in the United States, brainwashing its occupants to kill intruder by flashing the words \"KILL THEM ALL!\"\nSee also Edit\n- Hindu mythology\n- Hindu deities\n- List of Hindu deities\n- List of Hinduism-related articles\n- History of India\n- Hindu scriptures\n- Dying, Yamaraja and Yamadutas\n- Painting of Yama\n- Yama's subordinance to Vishnu\n- Thangka Painting of Yama\n- Foundations of Yoga - Discussion of Yama and Niyama, by Swami Nirmalananda Giri\n- redirect Template:Hindu deities and texts\n|Yogas:||Agni Yoga - Anahata Yoga - Anusara Yoga - Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga - Bikram Yoga - Hatha yoga - Integral yoga - Iyengar Yoga - Kriya yoga - Kundalini yoga - Natya Yoga - Sahaj Marg - Sahaja Yoga - Satyananda Yoga - Sivananda Yoga - Six yogas of Naropa (Tummo) - Surat Shabd Yoga - Viniyoga - Yoga in Daily Life - Yoga Nidra|\n|Texts:||Bhagavad Gita - Yoga Sutras - Hatha Yoga Pradipika - Gheranda Samhita - Shiva Samhita|\n|Hinduism paths:||Bhakti yoga - Karma Yoga - Jnana Yoga - Raja Yoga|\n|Raja Yoga limbs:||Yama - Niyama - Asana - Pranayama - Pratyahara - Dharana - Dhyana - Samadhi|\n|Lists:||Yoga schools and their gurus - Hatha yoga postures|\n|Related topics:||Ayurveda - Chakra - Mantra - Tantra - Vedanta - Yoga (alternative medicine) - Yoga as exercise|\n|This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).|","The Yamas & Niyamas are ten practices for ethical living. They comprise the first two limbs of Patanjali’s eight-fold path of yoga. These ten jewels offer guidance for conscious living.\n“The yamas and niyamas are emphatic descriptions of what we are when we are connected to source. Rather than a list of dos and don’ts, they tell us that our fundamental nature is compassionate, generous, honest, and, peaceful.” – Donna Farhi.\nIn Sanskrit, the ancient language of yoga, yama means restraint and niyamas are observances. The yamas involve our relationship with the world, while the niyamas, our relationship with ourselves.\nYamas: Ahimsa (Nonviolence), Satya (Truthfulness), Asteya (Non-stealing), Brahmacharya (Non-excess), and Aparigraha (Non-posessiveness).\nNiyamas: Saucha (Purity), Santosha (Contentment), Tapas (Self-discipline/Practice), Svadhyaya (Self-Study) and Ishvara Pranidhana (Surrender Into Source).\nThe Yamas and Niyamas are not a set of rules of self-control but rather a passionate expressions of service, love and compassion. Each section below includes definitions, questions to support the process of inquiry and practices to help bring these ten precepts into daily life. Journaling is a wonderful way to explore the questions in the following sections. In the spirit of releasing all dogma, may we each find our own personal relationship to and expression of each yama and niyama.\nThe First Jewel – Ahimsa (Ah-Him-Sah) Nonviolence: is the practice of not harming ourselves or others on the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels. Kindness and compassion are also expressions of this yama. “Any thought, word, or action that prevents us (or someone else) from growing and living freely is one that is harmful.” – Donna Farhi\nDo you love, acceptance and forgive yourself? What are the roots of your anger and how do you react/respond to this emotion? Do you hold anger in (depression) or do you act it out (rage)? What about the many judgements you have about yourself and others?\nPractice: 1) Cultivate awareness around of the foods you eat and products you purchase. Most of us are totally unaware of animal treatment, use of pesticides and their impacts, how farm workers are treated, and the resources used to create and deliver the products we purchase. 2) Become aware of negative self talk. Set the intention to bring more love and compassion to your inner dialogue. 3) Explore anger and rage, it’s roots and how you express it.\nThe Second Jewel – Satya (Saht-yah) Truthfulness: Honesty with our selves and in our communication with others. The willingness to reveal ourselves as we are. With self-honesty, we acknowledge our shortcomings, mistakes, and areas which need re-alignment.\nDo you consider withholding information a form of dishonesty? Do you speak about other people unkindly (gossip)? Are there aspects of your past and present that you keep hidden from the people closest to you? Are you afraid that if you share your truth, you will be abandoned, rejected, or scorned? How do carrying these unshared burdens impact your relationships, happiness and well-being? Are you living your life true to your soul path or are you living the life others wish you to live?\nPractice: 1) Consider a person in your life that you deeply respect and love. Make a commitment to take only those actions (including thought and speech) that you’d feel comfortable sharing with this person. 2) Set the intention to share truth with people you love. Begin with less intense content, in time reveal truth of greater intensity. Witness how sharing truth with compassion allows your life to come into greater alignment.\nThe Third Jewel – Asteya (ah-Stay-uh) Non-stealing: To steal is to take what is not ours, which may include wastefulness or using more than we need. Abundance is the recognition that most of what we truly need is already present within us. Stealing can only occur when we feel a lack of abundance. Asteya does not just apply to stealing physical objects but also how we steal (take) love, attention, energy, time and power from others that is not freely given.\nDo you take credit for accomplishments not entirely yours? How do your lifestyle and habits impact mother earth and her resources? From the Native American perspective, how do your actions affect the next seven generations?\nPractice: 1) Buy only what is needed and look beneath each purchase for the hidden roots of grasping. 2) When contemplating the above questions, consider the underlying roots which may lead you to take what has not been freely given.\nThe Fourth Jewel – Brahmacharya (brah-muh-Char-yuh) Non-excess: Non-excess means to live with moderation. Celibacy, another aspect of brahmacharya, means to abstain from sexual activity but we can also examine how we use our life force or energy. For those choosing celibacy it is vital to incorporate yogic practices to channel sexual energy into spiritual energy, otherwise repression can result. Tantra is a whole field of yoga dedicated to the senses and using sexual energy as a means to connect more deeply with source. For many of us brahmacharya simply means living a life with balance and using the life that has been given to us with wisdom and intention.\nQuestions: Do you use more than you need? Where do your exhibit excess in your life? What are the negative impacts of your excess? Do you crave more than you need: food, water, sex, space, time, entertainment, and material items? Do you use sexuality to deepen your relationship to Self and other or to escape? Do you feel depleted or in balance with all that is?\nPractices: 1) Choose one area of life that feels excessive and consider how to create balance. Create action steps which includes evaluating the underlying emotions that may be perpetuating excess.\nThe Fifth Jewel – Aparigraha (ah-pah-ree-Grah-hah) Non-posessiveness: To possess is to covet. One of the main tenants of Buddhism is non-grasping. The Buddha taught that all material objects are temporal, they come and go. The great Indian saint Ramana Maharshi shared that if something changes, its not real. Even our very life in this body comes and goes. When we are living from true Self (being-awareness-bliss) there is no need to possess or grasp anything. When our cup is filled with love and light, we can’t help but share our time, space, and energy with others.\nWhat do you really own in this life, property, spouses, children or employees? Are you jealous in your relationships? Do you hoard or protect time, space and energy? Do you wish you were living or doing someone else?\nPractices: 1) Contemplate areas of possessiveness and determine underlying emotions and beliefs. We often grasp in order to feel safe: if we just had this or that or more, we would feel complete. However, we often find that getting what we want does nothing to change the underlying dynamics of grasping, so the search for something outside ourselves continues. 2) Meditation is a wonderful practice of Self-love/reliance/acceptance. Watch your sensations, emotions and thoughts in loving kindness, without grasping. 3) Practice sharing time, space, energy with others. Sharing is a very powerful ego-busting practice.\nThe Sixth Jewel – Saucha (Sow-chah) Purity: To be clean in body, heart, mind and spirit. To be in alignment with purpose. Sat-Chit-Ananda (being-awanress-bliss), the true nature of Self, is pure and infinite. However, the veils of senses, emotions and thoughts can distort perception and inhibit our connection. As we cleanse the body, mind and spirit we become a more affective channel for spirit to flow through us. If we truly desire to raise our consciousness, purification is essential.\nWhat do you carry that no longer serves and even blocks you from living your purpose? Do the foods you eat enhance your consciousness? Do you practice good hygiene? What is unresolved on the emotional level? What mental baggage do you carry: concepts, beliefs, judgments and strategies that create distortion in how we perceive life?\nPractices: 1) Meditation is one of the greatest forms of purification. As you sit in silence, with breath, watch the passage of sensation, emotion and thought. Bless everything, purify everything. Allow your awareness and breath to cleanse, heal, and dissolve all distortion and illusion. 2) The Native American Sweat Lodge is an ancient ceremony of purification where participants enter the womb of the earth mother. The elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether are used as doctors which bring forth medicine. Yes, the heat makes us sweat but our intention, willingness and commitment bring purification to all levels of being. 3) Practice impeccable hygiene – teeth, body, hair with the intention of honoring the body as a temple.\nThe Seventh Jewel – Santosha (san-Toe-shah) Contentment: is to be at peace with what is. When we live from ego (grasping and aversion) we suffer greatly. When we walk the path of healing, awakening, truth and love, we gradually become more content. We often seek love and acceptance from the outside but we realize we already are the love we have been searching for, we experience great peace.\nIn what areas of your life are you dis-satisfied? Where do you feel out of alignment? Do you know what your life purpose is? Why did you incarnate and what are your here to learn? How do you keep yourself from what you really want?\nPractices: 1) Choose an area of life where you feel dis-satisfaction and decide what changes are needed. For example, “I am too sedentary, I need more activity.” The questions above can be contemplated to discover the blocks to contentment. 2) Welcoming/Softening: while breathing in, silently say to yourself welcoming, while breathing out, silently say softening. 3) Emotional allowing: set the intention to welcome all that you feel. Use number 2 above with every emotion that arises throughout the day.\nThe Eight Jewel – Tapas (Tah-pahs) Self-Discipline/Practice: In Sanskrit tapas means fire. Other descriptors include: determination, sobriety, focus, mindfulness, commitment, follow-through and consciousness. Tapas is the commitment to our intention (sankalpa in Sanskrit). We can’t achieve what we truly desire in our heart of hearts if we don’t take daily action in support of our intentions. Self-discipline is the foundation supporting each of the other jewels. It is not a form of self control as much as determination to take action based upon what we truly want in this life.\nDo your actions hold true to your intentions? Do you walk your talk? If you are not able to hold fast to your intentions, then why? What is holding you back from living and being your prayer?\nPractices: 1) Make a commitment to spiritual practice every morning and regardless of how you feel, uphold this commitment until it becomes part of your daily life. This practice may include chant, breath work, exercise, yoga, meditation, journaling or prayer. It can take three months before a new practice becomes established.\nThe Ninth Jewel – Svadhyaya (svahd-Yah-yah) Self-Study: Turning awareness in, we explore our physical/sensory, energetic, psycho-emotional, mental/wisdom and spiritual/bliss bodies (the five Koshas from yoga philosophy). We cultivate the willingness to explore our strengths but also our weaknesses (the ways we stray from balance, alignment, connection and intention). Many of the great sages ask us to inquire, to question, to leave all dogma behind and directly experience the mirror of this life.\nQuestions: Why do you feel the way you feel? Why do you act the way you act? Why do you believe what you believe? Who are you beneath sensation, emotion and thought? Who is the watcher?\nPractices: 1) Journaling is a wonderful form of self-reflection, insight, and healing. Pose a question and let your deeper self respond. Keep the pen moving on paper and release all judgement. These pages are a sacred form of expression and listening. 2) Asana (posture) is but a thin slice of yoga. Even within asana, physical practice is but one of the five koshas (sheaths or bodies). Yoga is union with all that is, leave no stone within, unturned.\nThe Tenth Jewel – Ishvara Pranidhana (Ish-vah-ra-prah-nee-dahn-uh) Surrendering Into Source: To surrender is to move into flow with what is. Like the leaf that falls from the tree in autumn and lands upon the the flowing river of life. Surrendering to all that is, is an attitude of openness, softness, welcoming and letting go. The ego is about protection and separation. When the veils of the ego dissolve, we become aware of our connection to the sea of consciousness.\nWhen feeling emotional pain, do you blame, judge, control, tell stories and or go into planning mode? What are your default strategies that unconsciously run when you feel mental and emotional discomfort? What keeps you from feeling grounded to mother earth and open to father sky?\nPractices: 1) When emotional pain gets activated, sit or lie down and release all thought. Simply drop into the realm of energy within. Let yourself deeply experience the present moment, call in the support of spirit, light, and love and just be present – watching, listening, feeling, experiencing everything. Relax more fully with each breath. 2) Mindfulness is a wonderful practice of connection through being present with the world of sensation. We release the thinking mind and bring awareness to the task at hand: washing the dishes, standing in line, taking a shower, brushing our teeth or walking. For example, when washing the dishes, focus on sensation of the water, its temperature, texture, the feel of the soap, our feet on the ground, breath, and the use of our muscles. Let go of the commentary of mind.\nThe yamas and niyamas are not just practices for ethical living, they are natural expressions of our essential nature. At first, because the ego has strength, the yamas and niyamas may require great effort but in time they become effortless. Contemplate each jewel and create your own relationship and observance. Choose one yama or niyama to explore for a week or a month before moving on to the next. Let intention, willingness and commitment guide the way.\nWhen we remember who we truly are, the ten jewels become effortless. Until then, we must practice.\nEaden Shantay co-owns True Nature Healing Arts with his wife Deva Shantay.

{"question":"What innovative approach is the Columbia Lake Technology Centre planning to handle the heat generated by their data storage units?","answer":"Instead of releasing the heat into the air, the centre plans to harness the heat from the megapods by building greenhouses and creating a district cooling and heating loop. This system could potentially be used to heat other facilities in the future, such as the Canal Flats arena.","context":["Brought out by curiosity, career opportunities, or to catch up, hundreds of visitors streamed into the Columbia Lake Technology Centre (CLTC) last Friday, August 24th for an open house.\nThe old Canfor mill site has been repurposed as a digital technology centre under the gaze of Brian Fehr, the tycoon who bought the land last year. Mr. Fehr was pleased with the open house and says the team is feeling much more confident knowing public support is in their favour, and the support Council has given to the project, such as working to rezone the lands.\nThe plan at CLTC is to build massive digital data storage units. Work has already begun, with the log sorter building transformed into a conveyor belt-style shipping container rebuild operation: containers come in one end as empty shells and come out the other end (in under a month) as fully functional server storage units. A 10-ton crane lifts the containers in; a 20 ton crane will lift them out due to the weight of technology installed in each shipping container. The containers will be stacked into megapod units, each drawing three megawatts of power to run. By comparison, according to site manager Mike Kruc, the entire mill ran on seven megawatts of power. To bring enough energy onsite for the 10 initial megapods, they bought a second transformer, installed on the grounds and bringing in collectively 30 megawatts of power. They anticipate the first two megapods to be operational some time in the fall, likely November.\n“We’re really focusing on getting those two up and running perfectly,” says Lorri Fehr (Brian’s sister), the new Chief Executive Officer at the tech centre. “We want to set the standard for Canadian server farms and global server farms.”\nWhile data farms are nothing new, the way the pods are put together and operated is innovative according to industry insiders.\n“I think this is world-leading design,” says Brian Fry, co-founder of the technology centre.\nMegapods put off a massive amount of heat. Instead of sending it into the air, the plan is to harness the heat by building greenhouses, and creating a district cooling and heating loop, with potential for heating facilities in the future such as the Canal Flats arena.\nIn the 10-15 year outlook, Mr. Fehr is proposing building outward from the centre: hotels, a microbrewery, pub and retail space, a future farmer’s market, retail and office space, and mixed residential units. The 80 acres could accommodate an estimated 400 to 550 units, leading to a population boon of 700 to 1,000 additional residents at full build-out.\n“Brian (Fehr) doesn’t want to create a Whistler, where people that work in Canal Flats can’t live in Canal Flats,” explained planning consultant David Ford in his open house presentation showing a bird’s eye view of the property and the proposed uses for the space.\nThey also envision a technology training centre, ball diamond, and maybe even a couple man-made lakes with a canal running between the two for people-powered recreation like canoeing, kayaking, and Standup paddleboarding.\nAlready on site is a steel fabrication shop. There are approximately 20 employees creating components for BID Group-owned facilities, primarily in the southern United States. Manager Viorel Mazilescu praised his employees, who collectively ship about 65,000 pounds of fabricated steel out each week. He is optimistic they will have another 10 to 15 employees by next year at this time.\n“They’ve done a really excellent job,” said Mr. Mazilescu. He added the limitation for the shop is in finding quality employees, not in the volume of work available.\nFollowing the open house, Ms. Fehr says they heard positive reactions from attendees about the growth and development of the old mill site. She is excited to join the team, leaving her innovation and technology job in School District 8 at the end of August. Ms. Fehr is looking forward to helping make a bigger impact in rural B.C., and to make sure future generations have an opportunity to find work in rural B.C."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3c39de24-139d-41b3-a374-805f864433f7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How is art authentication conducted in museums, and what risks exist with art dealers and forgeries?","answer":"Art authentication in museums involves experts closely inspecting artworks, comparing details and styles with similar pieces to determine authenticity and fair market value. However, this system isn't foolproof - even prestigious institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago and the Van Gogh Museum have been fooled by sophisticated forgeries. The art world faces significant risks from both forgers and dishonest dealers. Some dealers engage in fraudulent practices, like Lawrence Salander who swindled clients out of over $120 million by selling artwork he didn't own and creating fake investment opportunities. These issues make the art world increasingly skeptical and highlight the importance of buying art for its inherent value rather than just signatures or provenance.","context":["The first time I came into contact with Shaun Greenhalgh I had no idea I was doing so. Unfortunately I was on national television at the time, talking about the French post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, blissfully unaware that I was making a fool of myself in front of a couple of million witnesses. And that somewhere in Bolton, in a pub, Britain’s greatest forger was watching me and thinking to himself: “What a plonker.”\nI am an admirer of Gauguin’s art and for the centenary of his death, in 2003, I persuaded the telly people to let me make a film about him. At the same time a big show opened in Amsterdam, in the prestigious Van Gogh Museum, telling the story of the wild weeks that Van Gogh and Gauguin spent together in the south of France before Van Gogh cut off his ear. The Amsterdam exhibition was brilliant: packed with important artworks borrowed from the finest museums in the world. I had to film it.\nSitting in a Perspex case at the start of the show was a sculpture by Gauguin that had been bought in the late 1990s by the Art Institute of Chicago. If you know your American museums, you will know that Chicago’s Art Institute is blue chip — one of the best collections in the world. It is where Seurat’s A Sunday on La Grande Jatte hangs, and a ton of Monets, Manets and Cézannes. The newly acquired Gauguin showed a faun, a mythological wood nymph that is half-man, half-goat, sitting impishly on a mound of clay.\nThe sculpture, which had not been shown before, was signed “PGo”, a cheeky shorthand signature that Gauguin sometimes used that was derived from the nautical slang for a penis. In his youth he had been a merchant seaman and had picked up various naughty nautical practices. I wanted to make a point about it, and the sculpture from the Art Institute seemed the perfect opportunity.\nYou can watch the encounter on YouTube. There I am, talking about the PGo signature, and speculating cleverly about the possible self-portraiture implied by the image of the naughty faun. Back in Bolton, meanwhile, Greenhalgh, who had made it a few years earlier and lost track of it, was interested to find out that it had now been acquired by the Chicago Art Institute and that the museum had paid $125,000 for it.\nIt was not until I opened a newspaper one morning in 2006 that I saw The Faun again. There it was, lined up in a long row of photographic evidence that had emerged in court about a forgery ring set up in Bolton by the least likely forging supremos of all time — the Greenhalgh family. According to the newspapers, Greenhalgh, his father and his mother, both of whom by then were in their eighties, ran their ring out of a shed in the garden of their council house. Shaun made the fakes; his dad and mum sold them. That is what the newspapers were reporting.\nApart from the sheer unlikeliness of this arrangement, the most surprising thing to emerge from the court proceedings was the range of fakes the Greenhalghs had supposedly produced. They had made Assyrian reliefs, LS Lowry paintings, Barbara Hepworth ceramics, English watercolours and post-impressionist sculptures. Was there anything the Bolton forgers could not fake?\nThe newspapers reported that the three Greenhalghs were in it together, which is why they were able to produce so much. In fact they were a one-man band. Shaun made everything himself. As he makes clear in the remarkable memoir he wrote in prison it was Shaun, and only Shaun, beavering away in his shed in Bolton, who was the forger. His poor mother and father were roped in to help him complete some sales. But that was only after three decades of relentless pastiching had been and gone.\nI got my hands on Shaun’s memoir by accident. In 2007, when the crown court in Bolton sentenced him to four years and eight months in prison, I fired off a quick letter to a couple of commissioning editors in television demanding to be allowed to make a film about him. This bastard had fooled me on British television, I complained. Too late, they replied. Someone else had got there before me.\nIn the end both Channel 4 and the BBC made separate programmes devoted to the “Artful Codgers”. Both were profoundly inaccurate. How inaccurate was brought home to me when I finally got round to reading the thick stack of typewritten pages that thudded onto my mat a couple of years later — A Forger’s Tale: the prison memoir of Shaun Greenhalgh.\nHe had been persuaded to write it by a researcher from another television company that also wanted to make a film about him — a biography. Nothing came of the project, except the memoir. Once he started, he could not stop. With nothing else to do in prison, it all came pouring out. How he made his first fakes when he was still in primary school. How Victorian pot lids were all the rage at the time and how, with the knowledge he had picked up in pottery classes, he was soon banging them out at a fiver a head. By the time he was in his teens he was earning more a month than most of his friends’ fathers.\nAt school in a Bolton comprehensive he gave up art classes after a couple of years and set about learning it all for himself. This was Bolton in the 1970s, where the dark satanic mills had turned into dark satanic ruins and where a precocious lover of art had little to encourage him. As the newspapers presented it, the Greenhalghs were a Bolton Cosa Nostra, a ruthless ring of Lancashire fakers who had set out to con the art world. But what they really were was a modest north of England family who had managed to spawn a boy wonder: a kid who could make anything.\nParadoxically, it was the Bolton Museum that saved Shaun by firing in him a fascination with all things Egyptian. He taught himself hieroglyphics. And stone carving. And the Egyptian system of proportions. Years later, when he got really good at carving, he sold an Egyptian sculpture of an alabaster princess to this same museum for £440,000.\nThis sculpture, the so-called Amarna Princess, had been pored over for months by all manner of experts in London and beyond. The damn thing fooled me as well — thanks again, Shaun — when it popped up alongside Velazquez’s Rokeby Venus in an exhibition at the Hayward Gallery celebrating 100 years of success by the then National Art Collections Fund. Now that I think about it, it did look a little clean.\nHow it was made is detailed in the memoir, including the startling information that Shaun dropped the piece of alabaster and had to glue it back together “with Araldite Rapid” when it cracked in two. The experts should surely have noticed that the Amarna Princess was carved out of a piece of stone that had been glued together. But they did not.\nThe Araldite Rapid came in useful as well for Gauguin’s faun, which was made in separate pieces and then stuck together in an entirely un-Gauguiny way. I did not see the glued-up bits either, but hey, it was in a Perspex case, and the lights were glary!\nNot long after leaving school Shaun made his first Degas drawing. And successfully sold it in a big auction in London. He made Egyptian heads. And sold those. And studio ceramics in the style of Hans Coper. And gothic crucifixes. And watercolours of birds in the manner of Archibald Thorburn. Lots and lots of Thorburns. Then there was the Lalique glass. The Chinese pots. The Venetian bronzes. Easily bored, he kept changing styles, forms, materials, epochs, always getting as good as he could at every different technique. Then he would drop it and move on to something else.\nIt was this appetite for variety that led me to him, and him to me. I was making a television series about the Dark Ages, that much-misunderstood epoch when the lights of civilisation were said to have been switched off across Europe, and I wanted someone to show me some sophisticated Dark Ages manufacturing skills so that I could make the point that the Dark Ages were not dark. In Shaun’s court case it had emerged that he had produced several Visigoth eagle brooches, as well as various Anglo-Saxon artefacts, so he clearly was just the man for the job.\nTracking him down was difficult. Shaun keeps himself to himself. Since his release he had been working in jobs organised by the prison service and was collecting wheelie bins when I met him. The police had taken everything away when they arrested him, including his first school sculptures that his mum and dad had kept, as you do with your children. The Yardies snaffled the lot. But they could not take away all that deep and intense knowledge built up from 40 years of making things.\nFor our film, he produced an Anglo-Saxon brooch, made of silver and rock crystal, the kind of thing a noble might pin to his cloak. I was only interested in seeing roughly how it was done. But Shaun went all the way. First, he made an ingot, produced from exactly the right quantities of silver and mixings that the Anglo-Saxons would have used. Then he spent days hammering it into the right Anglo-Saxon thickness. Then he cut it up, engraved it, made the enamel inlay, shaped the rock crystal, fashioned a copper pin mechanism, put it all together and set about making it look 1,000 years old.\nThe last part I had not asked for. Indeed, it was not what I wanted. But old habits die hard and having knocked a few chips off the rock crystal he began opening and closing the brooch a thousand times. That, he explained, was how often it might have been used before it was lost in a field. He also deliberately wore down one of the evangelist engravings on the front because that was the part that would have been grasped by the thumb every time the brooch was put on.\nI watched all this with pure fascination. I have met lots of impressive people in my life, but they have generally been impressive with their minds or their mouths, not with their hands. Shaun’s hands had magic in them. When he was making things, he became a different person. Gone was the shy and suspicious middle-aged van driver from Bolton, replaced by a technical wizard who darted this way and that, producing the bits for his brooch with myriad kinds of alchemy. In Anglo-Saxon times this would have been the work of 10 people. Now it was just him.\nI should add that all this was going on in a garage in Bolton borrowed from Shaun’s sister, and that the garage had a low retractable door at the front on which he kept banging his head. If anyone makes a film of his life — which they should — it would be a mix of Billy Elliot and an Ealing comedy. With some F for Fake thrown in. How could anyone get this good at meticulous international forgery while growing up in Bolton in the 1960s and 1970s?\nThe answer arrived on my mat a few months later. Written on A4 pads in prison, Shaun’s story starts out as an attempt to explain his actions and correct the various inaccuracies that had been peddled about him and his family. But pretty quickly it becomes a runaway train of information about the things he made and how he made them. The court case, it turns out, had only scratched the surface of his output.\nHaving made his pieces, much of his most inventive effort as a forger went into giving them provenances, or as he prefers to call them in the book, “stories”. Among all the dodgy art world practices described here, nothing is quite as troubling as the creation of provenances. Without a provenance nothing sells. So Shaun needed to be especially inventive in coming up with his own. For the Amarna Princess a brief line in an old catalogue bought by post from a book trader was all it took to persuade the experts that his newly made Egyptian alabaster had a rightful past. Too many “provs”, warns Shaun, are “hardly different from a myriad tales you hear on the Antiques Roadshow”.\nWhat, then, are we to make of his own contentious claims? The story of how he claims he made the drawing now known as La Bella Principessa, by Leonardo da Vinci, but which ought really to be called Sally from the Co-op, by Shaun Greenhalgh, is hilarious. Sally — whose real name was Alison — worked at the checkout in the Co-op where Shaun was also employed in the late 1970s. To draw her he says he bought an old land deed that had been written on vellum, and finding the “good” side to be too ink-stained to use, turned it over and drew on the rough side instead, as Leonardo would never have done.\nIt was never meant to be a da Vinci. But he did have some fun pretending he was left-handed. In a book about La Bella Principessa written by the distinguished Leonardo scholar Martin Kemp much is made of the left-handedness of the artist. But Shaun claims all he did was turn the drawing through 90 degrees when he did the hatching, and voilà. As for the wooden board to which the drawing is glued, that came from Bolton Tech. His dad worked there and when the college began throwing away unwanted desks he brought one home and Shaun reused the lid. To make it look older, he popped in some inconsequential butterfly joints, learnt in his woodwork classes at school.\nSome Renaissance experts will not need Shaun’s book to tell them La Bella Principessa is not by Leonardo. She has been triggering grumblings ever since she popped up in auction some years after Shaun made her. To me, she never looked right: whoever drew this was not a Renaissance genius. It is clear, too, that someone aside from Shaun has tinkered with her in the past in an effort to give her a credible provenance. But with sums of £100m being bandied about for a real Leonardo, the news that La Bella Principessa might be Sally from the Co-op is certainly startling.\nThe memoir is full of such claims and revelations. Poor old William Jefferson Clinton bought a bust of Thomas Jefferson in auction that was also by Shaun. Let us hope he does not send over the CIA to rub out its maker when he finds out who really made it. As Shaun puts it in the book: sorry, Bill. The royal family is also owed an apology for the medieval crucifix it acquired on the understanding that it came from the tomb of King John. It did not. It came from the garage in Bolton.\nWhile Shaun generally comes across as a lovable rogue, the book is also packed with genuine bad guys. Very bad guys. Shaun is hardly an angel — he knows it, we know it — but you cannot turn yourself from a comprehensive kid in Bolton into a master forger whose work is scattered around some of the world’s greatest museums without serious collusion from the crooks and mountebanks who inhabit the art world. I thought I knew that world well, having spent so many decades sampling its wares. But I knew nothing. After you read this book you will never — never — trust the art world again.\nThere is also lots of tiptoeing through the complex moral territory of forgery. The point Shaun keeps making — and it is a good point — is that you should buy things because you like them, not because of the signature in the corner. That way you cannot be disappointed.\nThe vast majority of the creations that get described in A Forger’s Tale in forensic detail were not sold under false signatures. They were sold as unknown quantities. It was the dealers and the mountebanks, pumped up with imagined self-knowledge, who added the signatures, the fake provenances, the fanciful stories of origin. Shaun was taking them for a ride, but crucially they thought it was the other way round.\nFrom the outside, the art world looks like a world of beauty, inspiration, civilisation and culture. It is not. It is a cesspit. And by making that crystal clear, this book is doing us all a big service.","Dealing art is a profession that demands intelligence, sensibility and honesty. As a person that buys and sells works of art, an art dealer must be well-versed in art history as well as finance. These people travel around the world to countless museums and galleries to familiarize themselves with the various artists that they represent. Then, they must build relationships with collectors and museums interested in buying and investing in the artists’ work. Many art dealers are artists themselves and are very much integrated into the art world.\nBut being an art dealer is not all about the artwork. These are business-people. They have to understand the economic side of the art world: what style is in demand, the fair market prices for objects, the market trends, etc. Determining an artwork’s value demands close inspection of the work, comparing its details and style with similar pieces in order to reach a price that investors consider fair. Just like any other market, the art world experiences economic upward and downward trends. Furthermore, just like any other worker in the economic market, the most trusted and successful art dealers are those that are economically conscious and smart, rather than risky with investors’ money.\nAside from understanding the business side of art trade, gaining the trust of one’s clients is vital for the success of an art dealer. That’s exactly where Lawrence Salander went wrong.\nLarry Salander, a sixty-year-old art dealer who worked at the Phoenix Gallery in New York seemed to be incredibly successful. He had been a prominent art collector and figure for the past 40 years in the New York art market. He had a 66-acre estate in Millbrook, New York, traveled the world by private jet, and recently finished building a small baseball stadium for his own enjoyment. But his prosperity was not a result of honest art dealings.\nSalander was sentenced on Tuesday August 3rd, 2010, to at least six years in prison. He hadbeen swindling his clients for the past 13 years amounting in over $120 million. He admitted to selling artwork that he did not own, keeping the proceeds from fake investment opportunities, and selling more than 100 percent interest on single works. He used the sale proceeds to pay off his own debts and to indulge. He pleaded guilty to grand larceny, giving this statement at the state supreme court: “You trusted me and I betrayed you and I am deeply sorry for the pain and loss my actions have caused you. I have lost my wife, my business, and my reputation. I am utterly and completely disgraced.”\nBut few feel any bit of remorse for Salander. Although Salander most likely will not be able to repay his clients due to his declaration of bankruptcy, the court judge has ordered him to pay it. Ellyn Shander, the daughter of art investor Alexander Pearlman, stated to the New York Times that Salander stole her father’s collection of works by masters Cezanne, Monet, and Picasso. She said that after her father’s death, Salander came to visit her in clear remorse and soon “walked out with a $2 million-plus art collection that he stole.”\nOther famous clients that Salander swindled include former tennis player, John McEnroe and artist Robert De Niro Sr. (the actor’s father). McEnroe lost $2 million by investing in 2 Arshile Gorky paintings that Salander lied about owning. Robert De Niro Sr. was an abstract expressionist artist. Salander got his hands on 12 De Niro paintings without Robert De Niro’s (the actor) approval. Furthermore, Renaissance Art Investors LLC lost $45 million to Salander. These few clients were just a few of the various people and museums involved in Salander’s sting.\nWatching the trial progress over the past few months since March has begged the question: why did he do it? Is the money worth betraying the relationships built on trust? And now that he has declared bankruptcy, what does he do once he gets out of jail? Cases like Salander make the world much more skeptical of art dealers. In a society that already encounters a fair amount of forgeries, Salander’s betrayal does not make it any easier. To read about forgeries in art see our previous blog post.\nThe New Britain Museum of American Art is approached by many art dealers looking to sell works for exhibitions or the permanent collection. We strive to be one of the nation’s most distinguished art museums by forming, conserving, and researching an encyclopedic collection of the best works in all media by American artists.

{"question":"How should forklift operators maintain safety standards while operating the vehicle?","answer":"Forklift operators must follow these safety standards: set all controls to neutral and lower forks completely when not in use, turn off engine and keep key when leaving the forklift, ensure load doesn't block driver's view (use load trailing if necessary), sound horn at intersecting walkways, never leave the forklift when a load is lifted, slow down before turns to prevent tipping, transport loads as low as possible to maintain low center of gravity, and always be aware of overhead clearance. Additionally, employees must never walk under raised forks or lifted loads.","context":["Safety on the Job: A Preventative Guide for a Safe Workplace\nWho needs workplace safety tips? If you are an employer or an employee the answer is - \"you do\"! Being safe in the workplace often only seems applicable to those with dangerous jobs. But on the contrary, workplace safety, when practiced and prioritized, can ensure that everyone remains accident free. Workplace safety can be as simple as proper body mechanics when lifting an object or as thorough as reviewing and practicing a proper fire drill routine. But all of the tips on our list will help you, and your working environment, achieve a much higher safety standard, while reducing the risk for accidents.\nOffice Safety Tips\nMost office workers do not think that \"on-the-job safety\" applies to them. It does. Injuries can go far beyond paper-cuts. And while it's a good idea to keep your tie away from the shredder, there are many, more realistic, preventative measures that need to be taken around the office. From preventing falls, to safe lifting practices, all methods need to be put into practice to ensure a safe office environment.\nMake sure all walking areas remain clear\nReport any loose carpeting or any areas of damaged floor\nClose all drawers when finished using them\nKeep loose electrical cords away from walkways\nReport or clean-up spills immediately\nAlways use a stepladder to reach high objects\nSafe Lifting Tips\nOne of the easiest ways for an employee to injure themselves in an office environment is to incorrectly lift and transport heavier objects. Office workers are especially susceptible to these types of injuries, because unlike manual laborers, they are not lifting objects daily. That means they often misjudge their abilities and body mechanics.\nBalanced stance: keep feet shoulder-width apart. Squat closest to object when lifting from the floor\nKeep your back straight\nUse a full-hand grip on the object; avoid using just your fingertips\nLift by straightening your legs while keeping your back straight\nWhen you need to turn with the object, make sure your entire body turns. Do not twist your body.\nUse the same mechanics to place the object down as you did to lift it.\nProper Material Storage Tips\nOffice equipment can become outdated fast. Or sometimes something breaks and needs to find a new home. Now that we know how to properly lift the object, there are a few rules we should follow to ensure the object(s) do not become a problem.\nKeep heavier objects on lower/lowest possible shelves\nDo not store any equipment in aisles or hallways\nStorage areas need to remain as storage areas\nMake heavier items easily accessible; no one should have to reach across something to get to a heavier item\nProper Fire Safety Tips for the Workplace\nOne topic of workplace safety that always needs to be perfected is fire safety. This includes, fire prevention, how to react to a fire, the employees role in fire containment, and evacuation procedures. Obviously, all workplace environments are different and will have slightly different protocol. For example, a kitchen can deal with small fires easily; sometimes dealing with them quite often. While other working environments can not deal with fire at all. Regardless of your work environment, these precautions and procedures can always help improve the workplace's readiness when it comes to dealing with fire.\nKeep all walkways clear, as mentioned above for general safety\nSweep up all paper scraps. (At the office, scraps can gather around shredder area)\nExtension cords need to be uncoiled completely. Never use as permanent wiring\nMake sure to check that your extension cord is rated for the amount of electricity it will be using\nEnsure that trash cans are emptied frequently. These are repositories for combustibles\nDo not use electrical equipment if vapors or odd smells are detected. Have the equipment checked thoroughly by a professional repair person before continuing use\nAll chemicals used on the job need to be properly stored, preferably in metal cabinets\nEmployees need to smoke in designated areas only. Management needs to ensure that smoking areas are properly situated on the property.\nNever block sprinklers or access to fire extinguishers\nMake sure all fire extinguishers are up to date and inspected regularly\nTrain all employees on using a fire extinguisher\nMake a plan, practice evacuations and alternate escape routes with employees\nMost people associate fire with death and personal injury. While those factors are a real outcome of fires, the most damage that is done in workplace fires is to the business itself. In most work-related fires, the damage is usually never repaired. Fires are a very real threat to shutting down a successful business. But if all employees are trained, and all of the tips adhered to, the risk of having a damaging workplace fire is greatly reduced.\nForklift Safety Tips\nFew things can be more dangerous than having a piece of heavy machinery driving around the work area. Forklifts can maintain a modest speed, turn on a dime, and are often carrying extremely heavy objects. Luckily, the operators are trained and certified professionals and have developed an extraordinary skill level with their forklift experience. However, there are still some rules and tips that need to be followed by everyone who operates a forklift, and for those working around forklifts.\nWhen not in use, forklift must have all controls set to neutral, forks (and attachments) need to be fully lowered and out of the walkways.\nIf the driver leaves the forklift, engine must be off and the driver must have possession of the key.\nLoad can never block the driver's view. If the load is too large, driver must have the load trailing.\nDriver must sound the horn at all intersecting walkways to alert pedestrians/workers of his whereabouts.\nEmployees must never walk under the raised forks or the lifted load.\nDriver must stay with the truck (forklift) whenever a load is lifted.\nDriver must slow down before making turns; forklifts can easily tip over.\nLoads should be transported/driven as low as possible to keep the center of gravity low.\nAlways be aware of overhead clearance\nWhether you work in an office, or a warehouse, there will always be measures that can be taken to create the safest possible environment. Since everyone relies on their employment to sustain their well-being, all of the tips suggested are first meant for the individual to adhere to, and then, become the ultimate responsibility of management to enforce. But starting with the employee, empowerment through education, is the most effective step towards creating the safest possible workplace environment.\ncomments powered by Disqus"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:725688b3-4340-4547-ae34-7f98fb77463b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which certification process is more complex in terms of steps and requirements - becoming a CPA or obtaining a WSET Level 3 certification?","answer":"Becoming a CPA has a more complex certification process. It requires six specific steps including eligibility verification, transcript submission to state boards, exam application with fees, obtaining Authorization to Test (ATT), receiving Notice to Schedule (NTS), and scheduling with Prometric. Additionally, it involves meeting strict educational requirements, state-specific criteria, and can only be taken during four specific testing windows per year. In contrast, WSET Level 3 certification has fewer formal steps - while it requires significant wine knowledge, there are no prerequisites for taking Level 1-3 classes, and students mainly need to complete the course and pass the exam. For online students, they just need to register, obtain materials, complete the course, and take the exam either in-person or online.","context":["To become a CPA, you have to follow a specific roadmap, and it starts well before you submit your CPA exam application.\nThe goal is to pass the first time you take the test.\nYour personal timeline for studying should be a key consideration. You’ll need to be well prepared by the time you actually take the test.\nHere are all of the important steps, timelines, documents, and details you need to know about when you apply to take the CPA exam.\nHow to schedule for the CPA exam\nThere are six important steps you need to take as you apply for the CPA exam.\nYour CPA exam application process must align with state and national requirements. You need to understand all of the essential documents, submissions and due dates before you begin.\nHere’s how to schedule the CPA exam so that everything goes smoothly.\nStep 1: Make sure you are eligible\nFirst, you have to be sure you have met all of the requirements for the CPA exam.\nYour eligibility is determined by education and state-specific CPA requirements. For example, in some states, there are age and residency requirements.\nIn almost all states, the educational institution you attend must be approved by the state board of accountancy. There are also strict requirements on the number of transcript hours you have in college and graduate courses as well as what those courses covered.\nIn the event that you have a unique circumstance or don’t have official university documents, you can use NASBA’s Education Verification Services. International students will find this especially helpful.\nStep 2: Send in all official transcripts to your state board\nOnce you have completed all of the education requirements, you will have your official school transcripts sent to your state board of accountancy.\nWhen you are determining where to send transcripts for the CPA exam, you should go to the NASBA website and select your state or jurisdiction.\nThe state board will provide clear instructions for how they will accept your transcripts and any additional steps to ensure they are reviewed and approved.\nStep 3: Submit CPA exam application and fees\nOnce your official transcripts are submitted and approved, you will be able to apply for the CPA exam.\nTo do this, you will submit an online application and pay the application fee — one of several CPA exam costs you will incur. The fee varies by state but is usually around $100 to $200. The fee only covers administrative costs to apply, and won’t apply to anything else.\nWhile you submit your transcripts to your state board of accountancy, the application stage of your process is done through the CPA Examination Services. That’s the organization you pay the fee to, and which receives your application.\nStep 4: Obtain your Authorization to Test (ATT)\nOnce your transcripts and application are received and approved, you will receive an Authorization to Test (ATT).\nThe ATT represents your eligibility, and allows you to register for the individual CPA exam sections. For most states, you’ll have 90 days to complete this process and pay.\nWhile the cost varies by state, the average you’ll pay for the four sections is $175-$250 each.\nStep 5: Obtain your Notice to Schedule (NTS)\nOnce you have paid, you can schedule your exam. The CPA exam NTS (Notice to Schedule) is an official document that authorizes you to take the exam in the U.S. at any of the testing locations.\nHow long does it take to get the NTS for the CPA exam? The timeline for this step varies.\nSome states are completely digital and get your NTS to you the same day. In other states, it could take as many as six weeks.\nStep 6: Schedule your exam with Prometric\nLast step: here’s how to schedule the CPA exam.\nThe CPA exam is only available to be taken at Prometric testing facilities.

These serve the function of licensing and regulating public accountants.\nState-run boards are appointed by the governor, but also have input from state senators. The governance structure varies.\nYour state’s board will evaluate your education to see if you qualify to take the CPA exam. Some state boards of accountancy also directly oversee a public accountant’s license renewal and continuing education requirements.\nNASBA maintains a directory of state boards with links to all of their websites.\nThe National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA)\nThe National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) is the way all individual state boards are connected.\nThis network provides guidance for CPA exam candidates. NASBA provides CPA exams, CPA licensure, ongoing CPA education and more.

{"question":"What are the technical properties and production methods of cannabis dabs, and what environmental considerations arise in their manufacturing process?","answer":"Cannabis dabs are highly concentrated forms of THC (up to 80% compared to 10-15% in flower) produced through various extraction methods. Common forms include shatter, budder, oil, live resin, and wax, typically made using butane or CO2 as solvents. The production process involves solvent extraction on marijuana plant matter, followed by careful heating and vacuum pressure to remove remaining solvents. However, this manufacturing process raises environmental concerns due to its reliance on petrochemicals. The extraction industry is addressing these impacts through reclamation technologies - particularly solvent recycling systems that can recapture up to 95% of used solvents like butane, ethanol, propane, and hexane, reducing both environmental impact and production costs. This recycling technology helps make the extraction process more sustainable while maintaining product quality.","context":["What Are Dabs and What Is Dabbing?\nWith the legalization of cannabis for medical and recreational use in many states, there are more ways to ingest greater amounts of THC than ever before. When marijuana is chemically concentrated into shatter, wax, hash oil, and similar other forms, these products are collectively called “dabs” and are consumed by “smoking dabs” or “dabbing.”\nThe use of marijuana concentrates may not be new, but dabs are currently exploding in popularity—especially among teens and young adults.¹ So, what are dabs, how are they used, and what are the dangers of producing and ingesting highly concentrated marijuana dabs?\nWhat Are Dabs Made Of?\nDabs come in many forms, but almost all are produced using butane oil to concentrate the active ingredients of the marijuana plant. This creates a product called butane hash oil or BHO. Dabs contain THC concentrations up to 80%, compared to an average of 10–15% in cannabis flower buds.1 This makes dab weed far more potent and potentially habit-forming than marijuana in its natural form.\nHow Are Dabs Related to Marijuana?\nAlthough dabs are produced from marijuana plant matter, dabs and weed are quite different. In addition to the fact that they look nothing alike—weed looks like plant material, dabs look like processed resins and oils—the concentrated result of extraction gives dabs a significantly higher THC content than that of weed.\nAs marijuana concentrates, dabs do have similar effects and risks to those of weed. For young users especially, marijuana and its derivatives can have lasting negative effects on their still-developing brains.2 However, due to the extremely high potency of the dab drug and the possibility of chemical contamination, smoking dabs may carry additional risks.\nTypes of Dabs\nDifferent processes can produce different types of marijuana dabs. Five of the most common forms are shatter, budder, oil, live resin, and wax. All these dabs have THC levels far greater than the plant material from which they are made.\nWhat it is: The oily base extract of marijuana—often referred to as Butane Hash Oil (BHO) or Honey Oil—is usually yellow/amber in color. Stored in vials or syringes without needles, it sometimes develops crystals for a chunky appearance.\nHow it’s usually made: Solvent extraction is performed by adding liquid butane gas as a solvent to dried or cured marijuana plant matter. Heat and vacuum pressure are then carefully applied to remove the remaining butane without changing the liquid consistency of the extract.\nWhat it is: A glassy, solid concentrate with an amber or honey color, as the name implies, it looks like amber glass, is brittle, and shatters easily.\nHow it’s usually made: Solvent extraction is performed on dried or cured marijuana, and the resulting oil is heated at temperatures around 90 to 100° F in a vacuum oven to purge excess butane.³ The temperature at which this purging occurs produces its glassy, solid appearance.\nWhat it is: A smooth, usually golden-colored substance with the consistency of very soft butter, it may be distributed in small jars or wax paper.\nHow it’s usually made: Solvent extraction is performed on dried or cured marijuana, and the resulting oil is whipped during heating to create the signature texture.\nWhat it is: A yellowish, semi-solid substance with the consistency of wax, some users consider this “real dabs” as the wax is “dabbed” onto the user’s equipment. Wax is usually stored in a shallow jar or a small container with a wide lid.\nHow it’s usually made: Solvent extraction is performed on dried or cured marijuana, and the resulting oil is purged of butane using a vacuum pump and little to no heat. Heat is kept low, and the product may be whipped to produce a thicker consistency without it turning into shatter or budder.\nWhat it is: This is a viscous, honey-colored substance that is considered to be more aromatic than other types of dabs.\nHow it’s usually made: Extraction is performed on fresh and frozen marijuana plant matter using either butane or carbon dioxide as a solvent. When made using carbon dioxide as the solvent, it is often called CO2 oil. The resulting extract is similar to BHO, but it is more sap-like and can be especially concentrated.\nWhat Is a Dabbing Rig?\nUnlike traditional means of smoking buds, marijuana dabs involve inhaling the vaporized product by heating the dab substance. This is generally done using a dab rig or vaporizer. These two pieces of equipment look very different.\nA rig is a specialized water pipe in which dabs are heated, producing a vapor that can be inhaled through a mouthpiece. An oil rig is a simple pipe that involves heating a nail—usually made from glass, titanium, or quartz—with a blowtorch, and then pressing it into the dab substance. More advanced rigs may use a battery-powered heating element for controlling the nail temperature.\nHand-held vape pens or “dab pens” are battery-powered products that contain an atomizing chamber in which the vapor is produced. Some vaporizers are limited to commercial vape oils, but others allow users to dab with any substance.\nIs Dabbing Dangerous?\nMany people do not consider marijuana a dangerous drug and may have used it in years past, making this assessment based on the milder effects of smoking marijuana. However, due to the highly concentrated THC levels and dangerous chemicals used in their production, dabs may carry increased health risks for individuals who use them.\nThe Side Effects of Dabbing\nBecause using dabs involves inhaling concentrated vapors with a rapid and intense effect, rather than the more gradual intoxication produced by smoking a joint, physical side effects like these may occur:2\n- Rapid heartbeat\n- Loss of consciousness or fainting\n- Blackouts or failing to remember periods of time after use\n- Crawling skin sensations\n- Hallucinations, anxiety, and paranoia\nSerious Health Risks of Dabs\nIf the butane is not purged sufficiently from the dab material during production, users are at risk of inhaling significant amounts of butane gas while dabbing, exposing them to additional health risks like irregular heartbeat, confusion, headaches, nausea, muscle weakness, and abdominal pain.3\nAny chemical used during processing could contaminate the final product and be directly inhaled. Research published in the Journal of Toxicological Science found that as many as 80% of cannabis concentrate samples showed contamination from remaining solvents or pesticides used in production.4 Studies have also shown that using high-temperature vaporization of naturally occurring substances called terpenes can also create toxic byproducts.2\nTolerance builds quickly with these concentrated substances, leading users to higher and more dangerous doses at a much faster rate than other types of cannabis use. The fast, powerful high of dabs can also lead highly intoxicated individuals to make life-threatening decisions or behave recklessly, especially if the drug has significantly affected their mental health.\nThe Dangers of Making Dabs\nOne of the greatest risks of dabbing lies in trying to make dabs at home. Many young people, especially, fail to realize how dangerous and highly flammable the process and materials are. If improperly handled, transported, or stored, liquid butane poses risks like an explosion, fire, severe burns, and asphyxiation. Errors in the chemistry of the process can also lead to unexpected reactions and injuries.\nThere have been numerous reported cases of people being seriously hurt during dab processing, including the following:\n- Creating hash oil and dabs is illegal. A 20-year-old man discovered this the hard way after his home-based lab exploded and caused second-degree burns to extensive parts of his body. Even though no one else was injured, he was arrested for manufacturing dabs as soon as he had recovered.5\n- In San Diego, another home lab explosion blew a garage door 20 feet off its hinges, melted the windshield of a car, and set a man on fire when dozens of stored butane cans exploded. Three other people suffered severe burns and had to be rushed to hospital, while the man responsible ran down the suburban street with his clothes and skin still on fire.6\nIs Dabbing Addictive?\nAny psychoactive substance can be habit-forming, and concentrated forms of the active ingredients of marijuana in dabs create the type of sudden and intense brain and body reaction that makes a drug addictive. The DSM5 recognizes cannabis as a drug that can be the cause of a substance use disorder and related withdrawal symptoms, along with caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, hypnotics, hallucinogens, and sedatives.7\nAbout Yellowstone Recovery – a Drug Rehab Center in Orange County, California\nMany people find that they need professional help to stop using dabs, and there are treatment programs available.

The sheer scale of today's cannabis sector has a growing problem with its environmental impact. Now, the cannabis sector is turning to reclamation technologies to turn this around.\nLarge-scale cannabis cultivation guzzles massive amounts of water, energy, and CO2, while post-harvest production relies on petrochemicals for extraction. As a result, reclamation technologies, commonly deployed in the mining sector among other industries, are finding a new home with cultivators, extractors, and other plant-touching entities.\nBut, as many cannabis companies are finding out, reclamation can also deliver returns for the bottom line.\nWater Reclamation for Cannabis\nWith many of the country's leading pro-cannabis states facing the worst drought on record, water reclamation technology for the cannabis sector will soon be a requirement of doing business.\nWater, essential for cultivation and sanitation, is one of the leading areas where operations of all sizes can save money and reduce their ecological footprint.\nGeoMat is one of the leading water reclamation companies serving the cannabis sector. It offers industrial-grade, closed-loop systems to capture, clean, and reuse water from irrigation and sanitation stations.\nOn the irrigation end, potted cannabis plants sit on an elevated, permeable mat, where all runoff seeps into a catchment and circulates back into the system for reuse. This captures what would have been wastewater, saving money on nutrients.\nOn the sanitation end, cleanup teams can work directly on the sizable, non-skid Geomat to sanitize equipment, including trays, pots, and more. Once again, the mat captures the excess water to get filtered and aerated within the closed-loop system.\nWhether deployed for sanitation or within an irrigation system, Geomat helps cultivators reduce wastewater production and conserve an increasingly finite resource, making facilities more efficient and economical.\nCO2 Reclamation from Breweries Helps Make Cannabis Greener\nCannabis' dirty little secret is its greenhouse gas emissions. According to one recent assessment, \"The resulting life cycle GHG emissions range, based on location, from 2,283 to 5,184 kg CO2-equivalent per kg of dried flower.\" In comparison, the average vehicle emits 2.3 kg of CO2 for every liter of gasoline.\nMuch of the CO2 produced by the cannabis industry comes from environmental controls used within indoor grows and greenhouses. Cultivators supplement the growing environment with additional CO2 to accelerate growth, usually by burning natural gas.\nTexas-based Earthly Labs provides small-scale carbon capture technologies to breweries and other greenhouse gas-emitting businesses. Captured and compressed, this CO2 becomes a profitable waste product suitable for use in greenhouses. As CNN reported in April 2020, \"Breweries are turning carbon dioxide into liquid gold.\"\nCO2 reclamation technology in cannabis is still a relatively new concept, but Earthly Labs is seeking to change that. In 2020, it finished a small pilot project with Denver Beer and The Clinic, a cultivator facility in Colorado. According to the results, Earthly Labs technology \"captured the equivalent of 93 trees worth of CO2 from hitting the atmosphere.\" What's more, The Clinic reduced the cost per pound by $0.20, or a total of 15 percent lower cost for the harvest.\nEarthly Labs is quickly expanding its CO2 reclamation technology to breweries across the country. If the results of this pilot project are any indication, cannabis cultivators from coast to coast will have a greener source of CO2.\nBeyond the cultivation room, there are other reclamation technologies applicable to the cannabis industry. In the extraction world, solvent reclamation is the most critical, already quite common across the sector.\nSolvents, like butane, ethanol, and CO2, are used to separate the valuable components from plant material. They also make up the brunt of the costs of the extraction process. Therefore, solvent recycling and reclamation is a critical component of the operation.\nMaratek Environmental manufactures solvent recycling equipment. It is a sister company to Maratek, which designs extraction equipment. Maratek offers solvent recycling services for a long list of industries. Still, when it comes to cannabis production, they can capture and reuse ethanol, butane, propane, hexane, and isopropyl alcohol.\nDesigned for large-scale producers, Maratek’s award-winning equipment is a significant upfront investment. However, through the recycling and reuse of reclaimed solvents, Maratek states that its customers end up recouping these costs within 18 months. It also offers equipment rental programs to help reduce capital expenses.\nMaratek's solvent recycling equipment can help cannabis extractors reclaim and reuse as much as 95 percent of their solvents. Not only is this good for the company's bottom line, but it also delivers immediate returns for the planet.\nReclamation Technology: Increasingly Necessary for the Cannabis Industry\nReclamation technologies are beneficial in two ways for the cannabis industry. First, as the sector becomes an industrial behemoth, it helps reduce the growing environmental impact.\nWater reclamation takes the pressure off local water resources, reclaimed CO2 reduces the plant's greenhouse gas emissions, and solvent recycling lowers the demand for petrochemicals.\nBut, reclamation tech also helps lower production costs. In an industry where every penny saved is an edge over the competition, this reason alone may convince many companies to invest in reclamation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4eead254-a468-49c2-9399-b903bb38758c>","<urn:uuid:653580a5-12ef-46a6-b186-2585c28bee7e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"CBT在成瘾治疗中的核心机制是什么? 主要帮助患者实现哪些改变？","answer":"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in addiction treatment works by helping individuals identify learned patterns that connect specific contexts, thoughts, and feelings to substance use behaviors. Through CBT, patients learn to 'unlearn' these patterns by developing better coping skills, such as avoiding high-risk triggers and improving their ability to manage cravings. The goal is to retrain maladaptive patterns of thoughts and behaviors into healthier, positive ones, helping patients better prepare for potential triggers they may encounter after treatment.","context":["Addiction Treatment Therapies\nThose who need treatment for substance use disorders may be unaware of what the whole rehabilitation process entails—including the full range of potential therapeutic offerings.\nSome people may equate rehab with some form of medical detox, but detox alone is not a substitute for more comprehensive, longer-term addiction treatment.1 Continued treatment can help prevent relapse and lower relapse-related risks, such as overdose.1,2 Ongoing addiction treatment is likely to consist of several therapeutic approaches combined with the intention of increasing treatment engagement, changing maladaptive behaviors, and ultimately helping people achieve long-term abstinence.1\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy\nWhile originally utilized to treat depression, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was later adapted to help prevent relapse in people with substance use disorders such as alcoholism and cocaine addiction.3,4 The treatment method, and its application in addiction medicine, is based on the theory that individuals can best modify their substance use behavior by identifying learned patterns linking specific contexts, thoughts, and feelings as they relate to maladaptive behaviors (in this case, drug and/or alcohol use).4\nIn recognizing these patterns, people may begin to “unlearn” them. They may work toward these ends through the development of better coping skills—such as by avoiding high-risk situations, places, people, or other triggers, as well as by improving their ability to manage cravings and more-positively react to negative thoughts/moods.3,4\nRecovering from addiction isn’t just about working on the issues that brought someone to treatment, but about managing ones yet to emerge in the future. Patients need to be prepared for what awaits them post-treatment, and CBT techniques can help with that. While it would be ideal to altogether avoid triggers and other stressors, it’s not always possible. Armed with a set of improved coping skills learned through cognitive-behavioral approaches, individuals leaving treatment may be better prepared, should they encounter a new trigger, to take a step back and think about how to proceed before they act. That’s really what CBT is all about—retraining a potentially maladaptive pattern of thoughts and behaviors to a more healthy, positive one.\nMotivational Interviewing (MI) approaches clients in a manner that allows them to come to terms with the reasons they are in treatment and what they need to address on their own to make progress in recovery. This guided process uses specific methods of questioning clients so they can come to terms with what has been stopping them from moving forward with the changes they desire to make.\nIn many cases, continuing to drink or use drugs and getting help for the underlying substance use disorder(s) represent opposing desires for individuals in treatment. Using motivational interviewing techniques, therapists work with their patients to help resolve this ambivalence in favor of reinforcing the resolve and recovery efforts made to quit.3 There are four core principles of motivational interviewing. They are:5\n- Express empathy—Rapport may be better developed with the patient in recovery by demonstrating empathy. Therapists repeat patients’ statements back to them through reflective listening in order to convey that they are present and understand how they feel in terms of ambivalence to treatment.\n- Develop discrepancy—Therapists subtly point out how current patient behaviors may interfere with the positive changes they want to see happen in their lives. The perception of this discrepancy can motivate change\n- Roll with resistance—Therapists use compassion and empathy in the face of resistance, rather than confrontation or demands.\n- Support self-efficacy—Therapists can boost self-esteem and self-confidence of the individual in treatment. Believing in one’s own ability to make healthy changes helps motivate them to realize their goals.\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a type of psychotherapy for people with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. Its therapeutic potential comes from its ability to reduce the emotional distress associated with certain traumatic memories.6 Such a therapeutic effect may also be helpful when applied to cases of co-occurring substance use disorder and trauma-related mental health conditions.\nThrough EMDR, patients in recovery work to replace negative emotional reactions to specific problematic memories with less-charged ones or, even, positive ones.6 The person in treatment will be asked to recall specific traumas while performing a pattern of repetitive eye movements (or, in some cases, sequences of finger tapping or musical tones), and this “dual stimulation” helps that individual to work against the negative feelings that the trauma evokes.6\nA positive, replacement thought becomes the focus while the client engages in the repeated behavior for 20-30 seconds or however long the therapist deems necessary. After this process is complete, the client discusses the experience with the therapist. The EMDR process is then repeated as long as negative feelings remain present in an effort to retrain the mind in how to respond to the initial traumatizing thoughts.\nDialectical Behavioral Therapy\nDialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral treatment approach initially developed to help decrease the self-harming and self-defeating behaviors commonly encountered in individuals with borderline personality disorder. This therapeutic approach has since been adapted to treat people with various other mental health issues, including substance use disorder.3,6 DBT combines the emotional regulation of CBT with the teaching of mindfulness skills, distress tolerance, and improved interpersonal effectiveness with the goal of decreasing continued substance use.3\nExpressive, Holistic and Complementary Therapies\nArt therapy and music therapy are both forms of expressive therapy used at some treatment centers to complement some of the more standard approaches to substance abuse rehabilitation. Neither require the client to be artistically inclined. Rather, individuals learn different art techniques through classroom sessions that focus on giving participants healthy and positive ways to relieve stress while doing something they enjoy.\nThese therapies are less about the end product—the musical performance or the finished artwork—and more about the creation process. Oftentimes, various feelings and issues may come up in the creation process that may be further explored in individual therapy.\nOther complementary approaches that may be encountered at certain treatment centers:\n12-Step Facilitation / Recovery Groups\nActive participation in peer support or self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, or other 12-Step program varieties is an important element of many long-term treatment strategies. 12-Step facilitation, as a therapeutic intervention, strives to motivate acceptance of the need for abstinence and foster a willingness to actively engage with 12-Step fellowship programs as a means of lasting recovery.3,7\n12-Step meeting attendance provides support for those in recovery from substance abuse and behavioral addictions. These and other mutual support groups (e.g., SMART Recovery) are common components of many individuals’ aftercare routine, following completion of formal, comprehensive rehabilitation.\nIndividual, Group and Family Therapy\nBehavioral therapies—a grouping that may encompass the modalities outlined on this page as well as additional ones not covered here—are the most commonly utilized forms of substance abuse treatment.8 While individual treatment program designs will vary, these types of therapies are likely to be administered in some combination of individual, group, and/or family counseling settings.\nIndividual therapy provides important one-on-one time with a therapist or counselor. Solo sessions with a therapist or counselor create a safe space to share personal issues, and can further serve as opportunities to more closely evaluate recovery progress and allow adjustments to be made to the treatment plan, when needed. In addition, coping skills that will help the client to avoid relapse beyond the treatment period can be honed during these sessions.\nGroup settings may constitute much of the total time spent in therapy while completing a rehab program. The group dynamic avails the wisdom gained by others on similar recovery journeys and can facilitate better interpersonal interaction as a recovering individual prepares to enter the “real world” at the completion of the treatment period.\nThere are many ways family members can give and receive support during their loved one’s treatment experience, and family therapy is one of them. Attending sessions together allows the family unit to begin healing broken relationships and build a solid foundation of trust once again.\nAddiction treatment pharmacotherapy—sometimes referred to as medication-assisted treatment (MAT)—constitutes the standard of care for certain types of substance use disorders, including opioid use disorder and alcohol use disorder. MAT combines FDA-approved pharmacotherapies (and, in some cases, off-label uses for other medications) with some combination of behavioral therapeutic interventions (such as the others mentioned throughout this article) to help people with long-term abstinence in recovery.\n- National Institute on Drug Abuse.

{"question":"How do the weather patterns and geographic features differ between northern and southern Alfred, Maine compared to the damage zones near the Gulf of Finland's coast?","answer":"In Alfred, Maine, the northern and southern regions show distinct geographic differences: the south is a flat plain with elevations 200-250 feet above sea level and predominantly sand and gravel deposits, while the north has elevations up to 1,020 feet with glacial till soils. The climate varies significantly between these areas, with inland areas sometimes warmer in summer and colder in winter than coastal areas. In contrast, near the Gulf of Finland, damage zones show a clear coastal influence, with the heaviest snow damage occurring 31-40 km from the coast and decreasing by 39% in the zone 61-70 km from the coast. No stands over 140 m above sea level escaped damage in this region.","context":["Current issue: 54(4)\nUnder compilation: 54(5)\nWithin the European Community snow damage affects an estimated 4 million m3 of timber every year, causing significant economic losses to forest owners. In Northern Europe, for example, the occurrence of snow damage has increased over the last few decades mainly due to the increase in total growing stock. The most common form of damage is stem breakage, but trees can also be bent or uprooted. Trees suffering snow damage are also more prone to consequential damage through insect or fungal attacks.\nSnow accumulation on trees is strongly dependent upon weather and climatological conditions. Temperature influences the moisture content of snow and therefore the degree to which it can accumulate on branches. Wind can cause snow to be shed, but can also lead to large accumulations of wet snow, rime or freezing rain. Wet snow is most likely in late autumn or early spring. Geographic location and topography influence the occurrence of damaging forms of snow, and coastal locations and moderate to high elevations experience large accumulations. Slope plays a less important role and the evidence on the role of aspect is contradictory. The occurrence of damaging events can vary from every winter to once every 10 years or so depending upon regional climatology. In the future, assuming global warming in northern latitudes, the risk of snow damage could increase, because the relative occurrence of snowfall near temperatures of zero could increase.\nThe severity of snow damage is related to tree characteristics. Stem taper and crown characteristics are the most important factors controlling the stability of trees. Slightly tapering stems, asymmetric crowns, and rigid horizontal branching are all associated with high risk. However, the evidence on species differences is less clear due to the interaction with location. Management of forests can alter risk through choice of regeneration, tending, thinning and rotation. However, quantification and comparison of the absolute effect of these measures is not yet possible. An integrated risk model is required to allow the various locational and silvicultural factors to be assessed. Plans are presented to construct such a model, and gaps in knowledge are highlighted.\nExceptionally widespread snow damages occurred in January 1959 in the southern coastal region of Finland. An inquiry showed that significant devastation had occurred over an area of 42,620 ha. The purpose of the present investigation was to study the susceptibility to snow damages of different stands in different locations. Only the stem breakage was recorded. 924 stands along 92 one-kilometre lines were studied in the western continuation of Salpausselkä ridge in the summer 1960. A supplementary study was carried out in 1961 in separate stands.\nMost heavily damaged stands were found in a damage zone closest (31–40 km) to the coast of Gulf of Finland. The damages were 39% fewer in the zone 61–70 km from the coast. No stands over 140 m above sea level escaped damage. Stands on the edge of an open area such as a field, lake etc. fared better than areas within the forest. Eastern slopes were more susceptible for snow damages in these weather conditions. Also, conifers were more frequently damaged than deciduous trees. Dense stands, and stands aged 61–100 years had most damages.\nThe PDF includes a summary in English.","ABOUT OUR TOWN\nFrom the time of incorporation (February 25, 1808) to the present, the town of Alfred has established some well-rooted historic and archeological significances. Evidence to that includes, but is not limited to, the listing of the Alfred Historic District in the National Register of Historic Places. The District is in the center of the village, located southwest to northeast on Route 202 and 4 (Oak Street) and along Kennebunk Road and Saco Road. The village and buildings within the district have changed little in the last one hundred years. The National Historic Register lists 48 homes in the district.\nBesides the Alfred Historic District, the Alfred Historical Committee has identified an additional 45 buildings outside the District as being of historical importance. Many, possibly all, of these buildings may be eligible for nomination to The National Register of Historic Places. Further study will be needed for sufficient documentation.\nAlfred was home for nearly a century and a half to the root community of Shakers in Maine. While Shakerism came to Alfred in the 1780's, a decade after it arrived in the United States, it was 1793 when the community here gathered under the Shaker covenant. When the Shakers left Alfred in 1931, they merged into the Shaker village at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, rejuvenating it and enabling it to survive as the last community of living Shakers in the world. The Shaker mark, legacy, influence, and memory in Alfred are strong and connect it to a significant national heritage which is celebrated at Alfred Shaker Museum in the Shaker Hill historic district.\nPhysical And Geographic Setting\nAlfred, Shiretown of York County, is located at the geographic center of the fastest growing county in Maine . The community is predominately rural; with a \"classic New England village\" that is both a historic and a contemporary town center.\nPorts, cities and seacoast resorts lie to the Atlantic side of Alfred. The beaches of York, Ogunquit, Wells and Old Orchard are only a half-hours drive, yet Alfred, located inland, is spared heavy summer traffic. To the south are Kittery and Portsmouth with long shipbuilding traditions. To the northeast, lies Portland , with its many employment opportunities, financial institutions, and cultural attractions. Bordering Alfred on the southwest is Sanford , a major employment and service center for Alfred residents. The town's other immediate neighbors are Shapleigh to the west, Waterboro to the north, and Lyman to the east. Kennebunk shares a small segment of Alfred's southern border.\nThe town's topography, major physical features and soils were largely shaped by glaciers that receded from the Alfred area some 14,000 years ago. They created the town's hills, valleys, flatlands and surface waters and helped to shape variations in soils types, vegetative cover, groundwater characteristics, and the general suitability of areas for development and other land uses.\nThe town's major lakes and ponds are Shaker Pond, Middle Branch Pond, Round Pond and Estes Lake. Major rivers and streams are the Middle Branch of the Mousam River , Littlefield River, Hay Brook and Trafton Brook, of which all drain to the south.\nThe town's 18,000 acres are divided almost equally into two distinct geographic areas. Southern Alfred is generally a flat plain that extends northward to the village, with elevations 200-250 feet above sea level. This plain is actually the inner margin of the continental shelf and is part of Maine 's coastal lowland area. The predominant soils type of this area is sand and gravel deposits.\nNorthern Alfred lies at the edge of Maine 's hilly inland belt. Elevations rise abruptly at Bracket Hill (480 feet) and Yeaton Hill (600 feet) and extend northward through the town. The highest elevation is 1,020 feet on Fort Ridge at the Shapleigh Town line. Soils in this area are predominately glacial tills.\nClimate actually varies significantly between these two areas of town, with the inland areas sometimes warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than areas closer to the coast. Depending on prevailing winds, the two areas periodically experience contrasts in the type of precipitation and visibility conditions.\nThe first humans to inhabit Alfred arrived about 12,000 years ago, remaining relatively undisturbed until the arrival of the first European settlers. Colonization of the Maine coast started in 1622, but conflict between the English, French and Indians hampered settlement of the interior.\nSimeon Coffin, from Newbury Massachusetts , was Alfred's first known settler. In 1764 he built a wigwam near the north side of Shaker Pond, which was then called Massabesic. Substantial home construction began soon after; Alfred's first two-story houses, the Daniel Gile homestead on Federal Street , still stands today. Within 20 years, the town had sawmills, gristmills, a brickyard, tanners and potters. The first school was started in 1770.\nA thriving lumber industry developed. Many areas of virgin pine were cut for the lucrative \"mast trade”. When the first growth was cut, prime land became available for crops and pasture, and an agricultural economy developed.\nThe area that is now Alfred was included in the town of Sanford , and was later known as the north parish of Sanford . Finally, the town separated from Sanford in 1794 and was named \"Alfred.\" At that time the town had a population of about 400, including 120 taxpayers.\nThe Shakers became an important part of the community and built a meetinghouse in 1794 on the considerable land they held between Shaker Pond and Bunganut Pond. At its zenith, the Shaker community had more than 50 buildings. Eventually the Shakers went into a decline and in 1931 the 21 remaining members left to join the Sabbathday community in New Gloucester. The property was sold to the Brothers of Christian Instruction, who own it today.\nNearly all the older principal buildings in Alfred village were built between 1800 and 1820. In 1806 Alfred became the Shiretown of York County, and the County Courthouse was constructed in the village. Professional men moved to town and built many of the substantial buildings that now comprise the Village historic district.\nAlfred flourished between 1830 and 1854,during an era historians call \"Maine's golden age\". Before and after the Civil War, Alfred suffered a moderate decline, due in part to western migration and a decline in the lumber industry. Alfred, however, did not suffer the kind of exodus experienced by other Maine towns. Its position as county seat helped it to retain a healthy population of professionals and the service businesses that supported them. The town remained a trade center with a relatively stable agricultural economy.\nBesides mills, industrial development never occurred in the town to any degree. By not being dependent on any one economic sector, the town has escaped the effects of sharp changes in the business cycle and, as discussed above, the population shifts that have marked the history of many Maine towns of similar size.\nThe railroad reached Alfred from Waterboro in 1864 and was completed to Rochester , New Hampshire in 1871. During the busiest years from 1910-20, more that 30 trains a day passed through Alfred. Passenger service ended in 1949, and the last train ran in 1961.\nIn 1947, when widespread forest fires burned throughout Western Maine , Alfred lost 4,500 acres of woodland and two residences. The burned areas were in North Alfred and a strip along the Lyman line in the southeast part of town.\nThe last 50 years have been a period of relative stability, as Maine witnessed a shift from rural to more suburban and urban development. The town's population began to increase rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Because of increasing growth, the town's first Comprehensive Plan was developed in 1973. During the 1970s, the town's population increased by 56%. From 1980 to 2000 Alfred didn’t grow at the projected rate of the plan.\nIn 1981, the town enacted a building moratorium while the Planning Board revised the existing plan and the zoning ordinance. In 2002, Building permits were limited to 40 by the passing of a growth ordinance at the town meeting.\nAlfred is fortunate to still have many links with its past that provide continuity and perspective. Perhaps the town's greatest inherited asset is an attractive village center that still serves as a focal point for town activities and commerce. Many Maine communities lost their village areas during the 20th century, and now are hoping to reestablish some sort of town center. Alfred village both helps to define the town and to provide a planning model on which to build for the future.\nAlfred's Town Meeting form of government is basically the same as it was two and half centuries ago. Three selectmen and volunteers who staff town programs direct municipal operations.\nMajor services provided by the town are education, road maintenance, fire and rescue services and solid waste disposal. The town also supports recreational programs, social services, and cultural activities such as summer band concerts.\nMajor facilities are the town offices, the Alfred Elementary School (owned by RSU # 57), Troup A State Police facility, the transfer station, the public library, the fire and rescue station, all of which are located in or near the center village. Major county facilities -- the courthouse, jail and shelter -- are also located in or near the village area, as is the Federal Post Office.\nThe Alfred Water Company became a quasi-municipal district in 2001 and supplies water to roughly 700 residents in the village area. The York County Sheriff’s Department and the State Police provide police protection.\nAlfred's character is that of a pleasant and attractive small town with a great deal of community spirit and pride. Properties in the village and throughout the rest of town are generally well maintained. Local organizations such as the American Legion and Lions Club are active in sponsoring community events and providing charitable services. There is an Alfred Summer Festival with a parade and a variety of activities. Most major holidays are commemorated with special events.\nWhile many organized activities focus on the village and contribute to its special character, natural resources, large tracts of open space and a variety of recreational opportunities largely shape the town’s rural character. The federally owned Massabesic Experimental Forest encompasses 1,754 acres, and most of it is available for hiking, hunting, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing. The town's numerous lakes, streams and wetlands support a variety of wildlife and provide recreational opportunities as well. There is ice-skating at the Brother's and on Shaker Pond and Estes Lake . Many owners of large landholdings permit public access for hunting, fishing and winter recreational activities.\nWith its appealing blend of village and rural living, it is no wonder that Alfred has attracted new residents. During the last 20 years, the population of Alfred has doubled. According to the 2010 Census, Alfred currently has a population of 3,019.\nRising real estate prices have placed home ownership out of the reach of many first-time homebuyers. The growing population requires added housing, education facilities, public safety and transportation facilities, and this, in turn, requires increased municipal revenues.\nAlthough Alfred can still be described \"rural\" it is increasingly taking on characteristics typical of suburban communities. A high percentage of residents commute elsewhere to work, making the town a bedroom community. Much of the development that has taken place during the last 20 years has not occurred within or near the village, but in rural areas. Many traditionally rural roads have acquired a very \"non-rural\" appearance of houses located every few hundred feet along most of their length. Traffic on major roads is increasingly congested with noticeable rush hour conditions.\nWhile forces of suburbanization will continue to affect Alfred in this decade and beyond, some of the negative impacts of these changes can be reduced if the town pursues policies aimed at managing growth. Change is inevitable -- as the history of Alfred shows. The overall goal of this plan is not to prevent change, but to provide a strategy for how change might be accommodated, while preserving the qualities that make Alfred an enjoyable and special place in which to live."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e294a481-6485-46fb-902c-267a845b7d4b>","<urn:uuid:bbc26663-f97b-4d15-a315-614834acd36e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"can u explain difference between cybersecurity learning and taijiquan training? both seem to need lot of basic stuff before advanced","answer":"Both fields require mastering fundamentals before advancing, but in different ways. In cybersecurity, beginners typically start with basic books on exploitation, malware analysis, and threat modeling - like 'Hacking: The Art of Exploitation' for understanding buffer overflows or 'Practical Malware Analysis' for analyzing malicious software. In Taijiquan, practitioners must first master the 'Thirteen Postures' which include eight basic movements (Peng, Lu, Ji, An, Cai, Lie, Zhou, Kou) and five basic stepping patterns. These thirteen fundamental postures then expand into 37 basic postures, which can generate over 250 martial applications. Additionally, before learning advanced techniques, Taijiquan requires mastering internal Qi cultivation and relaxation principles to allow proper energy circulation.","context":["Cybersecurity books recommended by top security researchers\nLooking for a career in security research? You’re not alone. According to job site Indeed, job searches for cybersecurity roles increased by 5.7 percent between March 2017 and March 2018. Happily, it's not just more people looking for those jobs—they're finding them: Security research jobs increased by 3.5 percent.\nWith the prevalence of data breaches, there’s still plenty of room for the industry to grow. Unlike other IT specialties, businesses often are open to hiring security professionals based on their knowledge rather than certifications. What better way to acquire that acumen than personally driven education?\nI asked several top security researchers which books helped them on their path. I also asked which books they’d recommend to people who want to follow in their footsteps. These are the titles they told me you should put on your Kindle or bedside table.\nNuts and bolts\nIf you want to level up, it’s always best to start with the basics.\nParisa Tabriz, engineering director at Google, recommends a classic: \"Hacking: The Art of Exploitation\" by Jon Erickson. The book was her introduction to buffer overflows and exploits. “It was not an easy read, but I still remember it, since I had to really work through it, sometimes putting it down and returning after I'd seek out supplemental resources on C or x86,” she says. Tabriz still has her coffee-stained copy of the first edition of the book, which she says remains relevant as a deep introduction to hacking. The second edition, which came out in 2008, is the most recent version.\nEva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, recommends \"Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software\" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig. This book teaches readers how to safely analyze, debug, and disassemble malware, and it offers hands-on labs to help readers practice their skills.\nGalperin further recommends \"Threat Modeling: Designing for Security\" by Adam Shostack. This book delves into building better security into system, software, or service designs, and how to test those designs. It explores different approaches for different types of threat models.\nWhite Ops chief scientist and founder Dan Kaminsky, a longtime security researcher best known for finding a critical flaw in the Internet’s DNS, recommends \"The Art of Software Security Assessment: Identifying and Preventing Software Vulnerabilities\" by Justin Schuh, John McDonald, and Mark Dowd. “[The book] is something of the bible of infosec,” Kaminsky says. It covers software vulnerabilities in Unix/Linux and Windows environments, delves into how to audit various apps, and teaches with examples of real code drawn from security flaws found in high-profile applications.\nReady for more reading? Join over a million subscribers to our weekly newsletter.\nKaminsky also appreciates any books written by Michal Zalewski, a vulnerability researcher from Poland, “less for the individual details and more for him capturing the playfulness that got me into security in the first place,” he says. Zalewski’s books include \"The Tangled Web: A Guide to Securing Modern Web Applications\" and \"Silence on the Wire: A Field Guide to Passive Reconnaissance and Indirect Attacks.\"\nCryptography and cryptocurrency\nThis past fall, I rounded up a dozen blockchain courses being offered in universities across the country. But you don’t have to go to school to brush up on all things crypto. You could just work through the textbooks.\nDan Boneh, professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford University and co-director of the Stanford Computer Security Lab, recommends \"Introduction to Modern Cryptography,\" by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell. The book is often used as a cryptography textbook in both undergraduate and graduate crypto courses, but it can also be used for self-study or as a reference guide, Boneh says.\nTo learn about blockchains, Boneh recommends \"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction\" by Arvind Narayanan, Joseph Bonneau, Edward Felten, Andrew Miller, and Steven Goldfeder. The book, which was a runner-up for the 2017 PROSE Award in Computing and Information Sciences from the Association of American Publishers, has been used in more than 50 courses across the world. The Coursera course \"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies\" complements the textbook with video lectures, programming assignments, and quizzes.\nAnd of course, there’s Boneh’s own book, \"A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography,\" cowritten with computer scientist and mathematician Victor Shoup. The text is available online for free download.\nWhen it comes to online security, humans are often the weakest link. It’s worth technologists’ time to explore the art of human exploitation with the same vigor one would use to analyze technical exploits.\nFor EFF’s Galperin, the books that really make her think generally are not technical books. “To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design by Henri Petroski is one that I've found both inspiring and useful,” she says. The book looks at the engineering failures behind great engineering successes.\nGalperin further recommends \"The Confidence Game: Why We Fall for It… Every Time by Maria Konnikova. The book examines how people’s instincts often lead them to being scammed. “I've found that a lot of the history of confidence games and psychology has applicable insights into social engineering,” she says.\nThe nonintuitive choices\nTechnologists sometimes have to communicate danger to users, just as health professionals, occupational safety specialists, and government regulators do. Adrienne Porter Felt, a senior engineering manager on the Google Chrome team, recommends \"Handbook of Warnings (Human Factors and Ergonomics)\" by Michael S. Wogalter. “The book talks about how humans react to security-related information across fields, ranging from chemical warnings to street signs,” she says. “The book contains lessons that are valuable for computer security professionals. If everyone read this book, I think we could avoid remaking mistakes that other fields have already made.”\nBoneh would also add \"The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires\" by Tim Wu to your book list. “It is a history book but predicts the future of the Internet,” Boneh says. The book, written by a Columbia Law School professor, looks at historical cycles where open information systems become closed off and are disrupted by innovation.\nTroy Hunt, Australian web security expert and creator of the data breach search website Have I Been Pwned, recommends a nontechnical book: \"We Are Anonymous: Inside the Hacker World of LulzSec, Anonymous, and the Global Cyber Insurgency by Parmy Olson. “I found this book fascinating because it dealt with the personalities behind a bunch of the hacktivist activity we saw around the LulzSec era,” Hunt says. “There’s been a lot written on the mechanics of many of their attacks, but this book focuses much more on the people: what motivated them, how they communicated, and eventually, what brought them undone. It was one of very few books I could actually really get into and look forward to picking up each time.”\nAre there books you’d press into the hands of a would-be computer security expert?

This was the beginning of internal cultivation in the martial arts. According to ancient records, it was only about 50 years later that internal martial art styles based on Da Mo’s internal Qi cultivation were created.\nSmall Nine Heaven and Post-Heaven Techniques\nTwo of the best known of these styles are “Small Nine Heaven” (Xiao Jiu Tian) and “Post-Heaven Techniques” (Hou Tian Fa). All of these early Chinese martial art styles were created based on the same Taiji (tai chi) theories and principles known today.\nThese theories and principles are:\n1 - Qi should be first cultivated and developed internally. This Qi is slowly manifested as power through the physical body and finally applied into techniques.\n2 - In order to allow the Qi to circulate smoothly and freely in the body, the physical body must first be relaxed, and the movements must be soft.\n3 - The Yin and Yang theory and concepts are the foundations and root of Qi development.\nThe roots of Taijiquan (tai chi chuan) have existed for at least 1400 years. During this time, thousands of techniques were discovered and hundreds of styles were created. The very theoretical underpinnings of Taijiquan have been studied and researched continuously. From the accumulation of thought, its theories have reached a very deep and profound level even as its contents have expanded into an ever wider range.\nDr. Yang practicing in the woods at his new YMAA Retreat Center in Humbolt County, CA.\nTaijiquan originally Changquan (Long Fist)\nThe implications of these two styles were probably the progenitors of Taijiquan. It is believed that Taijiquan was not actually named “Taijiquan” until the Chinese Song dynasty (circa A.D. 1101). Zhang, San-Feng is widely credited as the creator of Taijiquan.\nTaijiquan in ancient times was also called “Changquan” (Long Fist). It is said:\nWhat is Long Fist? (It is) like a long river and a large ocean, rolling ceaselessly.\nOriginally, the name “Changquan” came from the Shaolin Temple. “Changquan” means “Long Fist.” It can also be translated as “Long Range” or “Long Sequence.” Ancient documents suggest that the meaning of “Changquan” in Taijiquan means the “Long Sequence” like a long river that acts as a conduit to the open ocean. The Qi circulating in the body is rolling continuously, flowing, and ebbing in natural cycles.\nShaolin Temple to Chen Village\nFrom surviving fragments of documents, it can be surmised that the Shaolin temple was the major influence on the development of Qi cultivation in martial arts society. It is valid to infer that substantial Taijiquan theory originated at the temple. Looking at contemporary Chen Style Taijiquan, similarities emerge between it and certain external Shaolin styles. For example, both the first and second routines—“Changquan” and “Pao Chui” (Cannon Fist)—originated at the Shaolin temple, yet they also exist in Chen Style. Even the names were kept the same as those in the temple. Although the Shaolin Changquan and Pao Chui have been modified and revised in Chen Style Taijiquan, it can still be traced back to the root and origin of every movement in today’s Chen Style Taijiquan. This holds true for many of the Taijiquan weapons routines.\nYang Style roots\nIt is well known that Yang Style originated from Chen Style and that they still share the same Taiji root and essence. Wu and Sun Styles originated from Yang Styles. Taijiquan and Shaolin martial arts also share the same root. It is no wonder that many Taijiquan masters who have also learned Shaolin martial arts are more expert and proficient in the martial roots and applications of Taijiquan. The reason for this is simply because the “Dao” of Chinese martial arts remains the same in all Chinese styles. Different styles are only different variations and derivations like branches and flowers coming from the same root. When you learn different styles, you will have different angles from which to view the same “Dao.” Naturally, your mind will be clearer and your understanding will be will be more profound.\nTaijiquan means Grand Ultimate Fist\nAs written down in the past, “Taijiquan” originally was written as “Taiji”. It is said:\n“What is Taiji? It is generated from Wuji. It is the mother of Yin and Yang. When it moves, it divides. At rest it reunites.”\nTaiji can be translated as “Grand Ultimate” or “Grand Extremity,” which refers to the most essential movements, or the very origin of motivation or force. Wuji means “No Extremity,” and means “No Dividing” or “No Discrimination.” Wuji is a state of formlessness, of staying in the center: calm, quiet, and peaceful. Once you have generated a mind, or have formed the mental shape with which you will influence physical reality, the motivation of dividing or discriminating starts. When this dividing happens, Wuji will be derived into Yin and Yang. From this, you learn what Taiji is—it is the motivation of distinguishment. When you have this motivation, the Qi will then be led, and Yin and Yang can be distinguished.\nOnce this motivation (i.e., Taiji) stops, the motivator of division stops, and the Yin and Yang will once again reunite and return back to Wuji. Taiji is actually the motive force generated from the mind (Yi). From this force, the Qi is led and circulates throughout the body. Summing up, Taijiquan is the martial style which trains the practitioner to use the mind to lead the Qi, circulating it in the body, and generating the Yin and Yang states, either for health, fighting, or otherwise.\nThirteen Jin Patterns and Strategies\nTaijiquan is also called “Shi San Shi” (Thirteen Postures). It is said:\nWhat are the Thirteen Postures\n- Peng, Lu, Ji, An, Cai, Lie, Zhou, Kou; these are the eight trigrams.\n- Jin Bu, Tui Bu, Zuo Gu, You Pan, Zhong Ding; these are the five elements.\n- Peng, Lu, Ji, An are Qian (heaven), Kun (earth), Kan (water), Li (fire); the four main sides.\n- Cai, Lie, Zhou, Kou are Xun (wind), Zhen (thunder), Dui (lake), and Gen (mountain); the four diagonal corners.\n- Jin Bu, Tui Bu, Zuo Gu, You Pan, and Zhong Ding are Jin (metal) Mu (wood), Shui (water), Fo (fire), and Tu (earth).\nAll together they are the Thirteen Postures.\nTaijiquan includes eight basic moving or Jin (martial power) patterns which are considered the eight corners of the Eight Trigrams. Peng, Lu, Ji, and An are considered the four sides of the Eight Trigrams, while Cai, Lie, Zhou, and Kao are regarded as the four diagonal corners. Taijiquan also contains five basic strategic movements or steppings: Jin Bu (forward), Tui Bu (backward), Zuo Gu (see the left), You Pan (look to the right), and Zhong Ding (firm the center).\nThe Thirteen Postures is a foundation of Taijiquan where hundreds of techniques and strategic movements can be generated. For example, a waltz has only three steps in the basic movement, but the variations can number in the hundreds. In order to understand the Qin Na (chin na) applications of Taijiquan, you must first become familiar with the Qin Na hidden in the Thirteen Postures and know that Qin Na can be used against these Thirteen Postures.\n37 Postures to Hundreds of Applications\nTaijiquan has also been called San Shi Qi Shi, which means “Thirty-Seven Postures.” If you count the technique movements or postures of Yang Style Taijiquan, you will find that they number only thirty-seven. It is from these thirty-seven postures that more than 250 martial applications are derived. These thirty-seven postures are also built upon the foundation of the “Thirteen Postures” or “Thirteen Jin Patterns and Strategies.” Many of these thirty-seven postures are constructed from two or more of the original thirteen Jin patterns. For example, “Wave Hands in the Clouds” and “Grasp the Sparrow’s Tail” are the combinations of “Peng Jin” and “Lie Jin.” The original thirteen patterns first derive into thirty-seven basic postures or movements and these thirty-seven basic postures can be derived into hundreds of techniques and variations.\nThe topic on Jin (jing) is discussed in more detail in this article: http://www.fightingarts.com/reading/article.php?id=556\nThe topic of martial Taijiquan is discussed in more detail in Dr. Yang's Taiji Chin Na in Depth 2-DVD set and Taiji 37-Postures Martial Applications DVD.\nAbout The Author:\nDr. Yang, Jwing-Ming started his Gongfu (Kung Fu) training at the age of fifteen under the Shaolin White Crane (Bai He) Master Cheng, Gin Gsao. In thirteen years of study (1961-1974) under Master Cheng, Dr. Yang became an expert in the White Crane style of Chinese martial arts, which includes both the use of bare hands and of various weapons such as saber, staff, spear, trident, two short rods, and many others. With the same master he also studied White Crane Chin Na, Tui Na and Dian Xue massages, and herbal treatment.\nAt the age of sixteen, Dr. Yang began the study of Taijiquan (Yang Style) under Master Gao, Tao. After learning from Master Gao, Dr. Yang continued his study and research of Taijiquan with several masters and senior practitioners such as Master Li, Mao-Ching and Mr. Wilson Chen in Taipei. Master Li learned his Taijiquan from the well-known Master Han, Ching-Tang, and Mr. Chen learned his Taijiquan from Master Chang, Xiang-San. Dr. Yang has mastered the Taiji barehand sequence, pushing hands, the two-man fighting sequence, Taiji sword, Taiji saber, and Taiji Qigong.\nAt 18, he entered Tamkang College in Taipei Xian to study Physics and also began the study of traditional Shaolin Long Fist (Changquan) with Master Li, Mao-Ching at the Tamkang College Guoshu Club (1964-1968). He eventually became an assistant instructor under Master Li. In 1971 he completed his M.S. degree in Physics at the National Taiwan University and then served in the Chinese Air Force from 1971 to 1972. In the service, Dr. Yang taught Physics at the Junior Academy of the Chinese Air Force while also teaching Wushu. After being honorably discharged in 1972, he returned to Tamkang College to teach Physics and resumed study under Master Li, Mao-Ching. From Master Li, Dr. Yang learned Northern style Gongfu, which includes both barehand techniques, especially kicking, and numerous weapons.\nIn 1974, Dr. Yang came to the United States to study Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. At the request of a few students, Dr. Yang began to teach, which resulted in the foundation of the Purdue University Chinese Kung Fu Research Club in the spring of 1975. While at Purdue, Dr. Yang also taught college-credited courses in Taijiquan. In May, 1978 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering by Purdue.\nYang's Martial Arts Association was established in Boston, MA in 1982. Currently, YMAA is an international organization, including 56 schools in Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Holland, Hungary, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 1984, Dr. Yang retired from his engineering career, to focus his energy on teaching and researching the Chinese arts, and introducing them to the West through many books, videos and DVDs. Visit http://www.ymaa.com for current information.\nDr. Yang has nearly 40 years of instructional experience: seven years in Taiwan, five years at Purdue University, two years in Houston, TX, and 25 years in Boston, MA. On November 29, 2005, Dr. Yang conferred the title of Taiji Master to one of his senior students, which by definition bestows the honorable title of Grandmaster upon Dr. Yang.\nDr. Yang is also the founder of the YMAA Retreat Center in Humbolt County, CA, where he will spend ten years training a select group of students, starting in August 2008. http://www.ymaa-retreatcenter.org"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:66cb2d28-dd4d-4a47-8927-c7d3c2a5a107>","<urn:uuid:153e31a2-4a7c-4282-a6c6-56b957f4b56b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do rammed earth walls and AAC blocks compare in terms of their thermal insulation properties and energy efficiency?","answer":"Rammed earth walls and AAC blocks have different thermal properties. Rammed earth has high thermal mass but limited thermal insulating qualities, similar to an uninsulated fiber cement wall. It can delay heat flow through the building envelope by 10-12 hours and works best when day-night temperature difference is at least 6°C. However, a 300mm rammed earth wall typically won't meet Building Code of Australia insulation requirements without additional insulation. AAC, on the other hand, has excellent thermal insulation properties due to its cellular structure with entrained air, which contributes significantly to energy savings in heating and air conditioning. The thermal conductivity (K Value) of AAC is 0.162 W/mK on average, making it an energy-efficient building material.","context":["Rammed earth walls are constructed by ramming a mixture of selected aggregates, including gravel, sand, silt and a small amount of clay, into place between flat panels called formwork. Here is a Performance Summary to help you decide if you want Rammed Earth in your next project.\nThe colour of rammed earth walls is determined by the earth and aggregate used. The ramming process proceeds layer by layer and can introduce the appearance of horizontal stratification to the walls, which can enhance the overall appearance. It can be controlled as a feature or eliminated.\nAggregates can be exposed and special effects created by the addition of different coloured material in some layers, and elements such as feature stones or objects, alcoves or relief mouldings can be incorporated into rammed earth walls, at a price. Unusual finishes can be achieved by including shapes in the formwork that can be released after the wall has been rammed.\nRammed earth is very strong in compression and can be used for multi-storey loadbearing construction. Research in New Zealand indicates that monolithic earth walls perform better under earthquake conditions than walls made of separate bricks or blocks. A five storey hotel in Queensland is built of stabilised rammed earth. Rammed earth can be engineered to achieve reasonably high strengths and be reinforced in a similar manner to concrete, although horizontal reinforcement is not recommended and excessive vertical reinforcement can cause cracking problems.\nInteresting structural features, including leaning walls, have been constructed in rammed earth. Any difficulties associated with placing and ramming around reinforcement can be eased by careful management of the construction process and need not add significantly to the cost.\nRammed earth behaves as heavyweight masonry with a high thermal mass. Thermal mass absorbs or ‘slows down’ the passage of heat through a material and then releases that heat when the surrounding ambient temperature goes down. All other things being equal, a high mass building such as rammed earth remains close to the 24 hour average for the time of year: in many climates this may be too cold or warm for comfort. If heating or cooling is required, the walls need to be insulated to limit energy consumption.\nUsed correctly, and in the right climate, the thermal mass of rammed earth can delay heat flow through the building envelope by as much as 10 to 12 hours and can even out daily temperature variations.\nRammed earth walls become effective when the difference between day and night outdoor temperatures is at least 6°C. Where the diurnal range is greater than 10°C, appropriate design can exploit the high thermal mass of rammed earth to very good effect (see Thermal mass).\nIn cool or cold climates well-located rammed earth walls (e.g. feature walls within a well-insulated envelope) can supply a battery of useful thermal storage. Rammed earth is not recommended for tropical climates where high mass construction can cause a house to hold too much heat and cause thermal discomfort (see Thermal mass).\nBuilding energy efficiency rating tools such as AccuRate include the capability to simulate the combined effects of wall mass and insulation, and also allow comfort in extreme weather conditions to be reviewed, so the building’s performance can be optimised.\nInsulation is about stopping heat passing through a material rather than slowly absorbing or releasing it. As a corollary to its high thermal mass, rammed earth has limited thermal insulating qualities — similar to an uninsulated fibre cement wall.\nInsulation can be added to rammed earth walls with linings but, as a general rule, a 300mm rammed earth wall will not meet Building Code of Australia (BCA) requirements for external wall insulation. Hybrid buildings that use insulated framed external walls with rammed earth internal walls and feature elements can achieve high insulation and high mass.\nUnder certain design criteria (i.e. simple rectangle with north-facing glass) and in moderate (not temperate) climates, it was just possible to meet the NatHERS overall five star performance standard; however, six stars are now the mandatory minimum under the BCA (see Insulation).\nInsulation can also be added within the thickness of a rammed earth wall but this adds to its cost and changes the structural properties of the wall. However, it does provide the benefits of both excellent thermal mass and good thermal insulation in the one wall while retaining the desirable look, texture, feel, acoustics and low maintenance properties of the facing of rammed earth on each side.\nThe best location for insulation when used in conjunction with rammed earth is on the outside face of the wall, so that the thermal mass is within a contained and controllable external envelope (see Passive solar heating; Passive cooling).\nOne of the best ways to insulate against sound is have monolithic mass, which rammed earth provides very well. It has excellent sound reverberation characteristics and does not generate the harsh echoes characteristic of many conventional wall materials (see Noise control).\nFire and vermin resistance\nThere are no flammable components in a rammed earth wall and its fire resistance is thus very good. In tests by the CSIRO a 150mm thick Cinva-rammed earth block wall (similar to rammed earth) achieved a near four hour fire-resistance rating. There is no cavity to harbour vermin and nothing in the material to attract or support them so its resistance to vermin attack is very high.\nDurability and moisture resistance\nThe basic technology has been around for thousands of years and there are many rammed earth buildings still standing that are centuries old. Rammed earth does possess a generally high durability but all types of rammed earth walls are porous by nature and need protection from driving rain and long term exposure to moisture.\nMaintain water protection to the tops and bottoms of walls. Continued exposure to moisture may degrade the internal structure of the earth by reversing the cement stabilisation and allowing the clays to expand. In general, rammed earth does have moderate to good moisture resistance and most modern Australian rammed earth walls do not require additional waterproofing. New water repellent additives that waterproof the walls right through may make rammed earth suitable for very exposed conditions, including retaining walls, but may inhibit the breathability of the material.\nBreathability and toxicity\nProvided it is not sealed with material that is impermeable to air molecules, rammed earth maintains its breathability. Finished walls are inert but take care in the choice of waterproofing or anti-dust finishes to avoid adding toxicity to the surfaces.\nRammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impacts, depending on cement content and degree of local material sourcing. Most rammed earth in Australia uses quarried aggregates, rather than the ‘earth’ it is popularly thought to be made from. On-site materials can often be used but materials need to be tested for their suitability.\nThe embodied energy of rammed earth is low to moderate. Composed of selected aggregates bound with cementitious material, rammed earth can be thought of as a kind of ‘weak concrete’. It may help to understand cement and earth products as being at different points on an energy continuum, with earth at the low end and high strength concrete at the high end. Its cement and aggregate content can be varied to suit engineering and strength requirements.\nAlthough in principle it is a low greenhouse gas emission product, transport and cement manufacture can add significantly to the overall emissions associated with typical modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more highly engineered and processed variants may be responsible for significant emissions in their manufacture. For example, a 300mm rammed earth wall with 5% cement content has the equivalent of 15mm thickness of cement, equivalent to over 100mm of concrete (which mainly comprises sand and aggregate).\nBuildability, availability and cost\nRammed earth is an in site construction method. Although its buildability is good, formwork for rammed earth demands good site and logistics planning to ensure that other trades are not adversely affected in the building program. Services should be well planned in advance to minimise difficulties. After walls have been rammed in place, conduits for pipes and wires can be provided much as in other masonry construction, but may impact on surface finishes.\nBasic materials for rammed earth making are readily available across Australia, but cement and formwork may have to be transported long distances, increasing environmental and economic costs. Testing of local aggregates and potential mixes is essential if not using a proprietary system.\nProprietary approaches to rammed earth help guarantee consistency and predictable performance but come at a cost. The cost of a professional rammed earth building is comparable to other more conventional good quality masonry construction, but it can be more than twice as expensive as a rendered 200mm wide AAC block wall (see Autoclaved aerated concrete).\nRammed earth is particularly well established in Western Australia and is thus an economical option in that state. Most states have experienced builders who understand its potential and limitations but because it is not a common construction material outside of WA its relative rarity and specialist nature tends to be reflected in its relatively high cost. It typically requires high levels of control over material sourcing and batching, and expensive formwork. A key element in controlling costs is to design walls as simple panels and to avoid unnecessary complexity. Traditional rammed earth using human power for ramming and simple wooden formwork can be low cost (and low energy) but this is rarely a realistic option.\nThere are good networks in Australia including a broad based national organisation, the Earth Building Association of Australia (EBAA), which is a not for profit organisation ‘formed to promote the use of Unfired Earth as a building medium throughout Australia’.",": Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Introducing a Building System Slide 2: Avantha Group is one of India’s leading business conglomerates.

WHAT IS AUTOCLAVED AERATED CONCRETE : WHAT IS AUTOCLAVED AERATED CONCRETE Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) is formed by a chemical reaction between finely divided calcareous and siliceous material.\nAAC has been around for over 80 years. The first documented attempt at autoclaving aerated concrete was in 1923 in Sweden by an architectural science lecturer, Dr Johan Axel Eriksson. Since then, AAC has been used extensively in Europe, Asia & USA.\nMore AAC is produced worldwide than any other building material with the exception of regular concrete.

AUTOCLAVED AERATED CONCRETE IN INDIA : Hindustan Prefab Limited (HPL), the Government owned company is known to be the first Organisation in India to produce AAC and subsequently HPL has stopped the AAC operation in 1972 . In past few years BBEL along with two more companies Siporex India Ltd. & HIL was catering to the material requirements of Northern, Western and Southern Market respectively. Until recently looking at the demand of alternate walling materials, 6-7 companies has also started manufacturing AAC mostly in western part of India.

These characteristics contribute significantly to the energy saving performance of the building . Fire resistance : Fire resistance AAC is non-combustible. It has one of the highest hourly fire resistance ratings per millimetre of any building material. This makes it an ideal choice for fire protection around steel columns and steel beams, and in the construction of shaft walls, stairwells, corridors and firewalls. A 100mm and a 200 mm non-load bearing wall shall have fir resistance of 2 hours and 6 hours respectively . Earthquake resistance : Earthquake resistance AAC has been used for many years in areas subject to seismic action. Building which consist fully or partly of AAC have in general terms shown good resistance to earthquake forces in practice. The light weight of AAC reduces the seismic forces in common with some other materials. The non combustible and fire resistance nature of the AAC material is an advantage against fires commonly associated with earthquakes.\nThe low weight of AAC in relation to its strength is an intrinsic advantage for earthquake design. AAC permits the designer to reduce the mass of the structure, limiting the impact of accelerations introduced in seismic situation. AAC IS 100% RECYCLABLE : AAC IS 100% RECYCLABLE The waste factor in its construction can be reduced to less than 1% with good construction management.\nNearly every piece of the material can be used in the construction of an AAC building.\nAll waste, however, is easily recycled.

{"question":"Which type of dashboard would be more suitable for importing Excel data: operational or analytical dashboards?","answer":"Analytical dashboards would be more suitable for importing Excel data since they offer a high-level view of data that is less time-sensitive and are geared toward helping users understand vast amounts of data. This aligns well with Excel data import capabilities, where data can be transferred from Excel to Google Sheets and then to Google Data Studio for visualization. In contrast, operational dashboards are designed for time-sensitive tasks and current status updates, making them less appropriate for static Excel data imports.","context":["Design and Technology Guides\nA Guide to Dashboard Design\nWhat is a Dashboard?\nAt its most basic, a dashboard is a screen that displays information your user might (should!) find helpful before they engage with other parts of your site or app. This screen usually offers a high-level overview of data and functions they engage with, and provides access to the most helpful information they’ll need to succeed.\nA good dashboard is more than just an assembly of graphic elements. It’s your user’s first interaction with you each time they log on and their launch point for the rest of your services. The best dashboard design conveys your user’s most important information as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nThe Role of UX in Dashboard Design\nCustomer research is central to creating a successful dashboard. Nothing is more detrimental to a dashboard experience than showing the customer something they don’t value or need—or something they don’t understand. Conducting user research and understanding your dashboard UX is critical to creating a dashboard that is useful and engaging and draws users to perform the actions you want them to take.\nWe recommend that designers conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) with users and stakeholders to decide about essential info or tasks. Our team usually asks questions like:\n- Does a user need to complete tasks at the start of their day? What are those tasks, and how would you rank the importance of each one? Is there a sequence that the user typically follows?\n- Are the users experts in a particular field and can ingest precise data? Or is the user group broader, needing easily consumable data that leads to more detailed information accessed through additional actions?\n- Are users more right or left-brained? Will words resonate with them, or are they more motivated by numbers and images? Is your data more consumable in an infographic or a paragraph of text?\n- What kind of device might users be consuming information from? On the fly from their phones? Sitting at a desktop workstation as part of their job?\nIn addition to IDIs, designers should also consider accessibility and inclusion standards. Could part of your user base be color blind? (We can answer this one for you: yes. 8% of men and 0.5% of women are colorblind.) Does your design consider people for whom English is not their native language and who might have difficulty reading large blocks of text in English?\nA comparative and competitive analysis can be a great tool even if you can’t perform user research. Or you can audit an application or a site to find components that are working, and use these findings to inform possibilities for your current design.\nTypes of Dashboards\nThere are many different types of dashboards, and each dashboard layout design serves a specific purpose. The key is to choose the kind of digital dashboards that suits your particular user and product best.\nAnalytical dashboards offer a high-level view of the data your user needs for analysis and making decisions. This data is usually less time-sensitive and is geared toward helping your user understand vast swaths of data, and is shared to invite the user into a deeper understanding of the information.\nStrategic dashboards emphasize the data about performance against a set of key performance indicators (KPIs). All of the information featured is directly related to how the user is performing in the context of their goals.\nOperational dashboards are the most immediately functional style of digital dashboards. This type of dashboard is geared toward users who have a time-sensitive task to complete and offers information about current resources and status updates. An operational dashboard is a kind of “control panel” that empowers users to take quick action and be efficient.\nKey Components of a Dashboard\nIt’s essential to start by saying that it’s crucial not to overload your dashboard. You want your user to have enough data to be informed but not be so overloaded that they are paralyzed and don’t take the action(s) you’re trying to drive.\nBeyond that, a dashboard’s key components vary depending on the type of dashboard you’re building. An analytical dashboard may have more glanceable charts. A strategic dashboard could show big numbers and trends of those numbers. An operational dashboard might have the most minimal infographics of all three because of the time sensitivity. Selecting components and their hierarchy always comes back to research findings or understanding the tasks a user needs to complete.\n- Big numbers are good. They help draw your user’s eye directly to the metric.\n- Use size to denote hierarchy. Big content draws the eye and can help you guide your users to what they need first.\n- Coordinating colors with trends uses your user’s physiological response to color to reinforce the data. Using color too liberally can dilute this effect.\n- Charts should be easy to glance at and understand. No squinting. You want to provide data that’s easily digestible.\n- Modular design is dynamic design. Creating modules you can add, reconfigure, edit, and subtract over time means that your dashboard stays relevant to your users’ adapting needs.\nWhy we love it:\nFirst off, this dashboard’s layout is very responsive and design-friendly. The cards can be reorganized without drastically changing the structure of what the user is seeing. The natural language is welcoming, and the questions featured directly impact the corresponding card below. Instead of the user guessing the importance of the card itself, the question frames its importance.\nLarge numbers make it easy to see and comprehend the data, and the graphs are concise, making it easy to view trends. When a user hovers over a chart, simple data points appear so that a user can quickly summarize what they’re seeing.\nTrends are shown with both color and icons, ensuring greater accessibility. Links to more details in the cards lead the user to more in-depth data if they need it.\nWhy we love it:\nThe large numbers are easy to read and make it simple for the user to understand essential data quickly. Apple also uses color to string together a story on how components relate to one another. Energy topics are orange, exercise minutes are green and correspond to the green slice of the pie chart, etc.\nThese charts are very streamlined (not many labels or text) but allow users to discover more when they hover over the graphic. The use of filters also helps Apple separate the data they show users. Each day has its own dashboard broken down by the dates at the top, allowing the user to drill down into data for that day.

{"question":"Between Man o' War and Storm Cat, which had a more impressive record in Grade 1/top-level races during their racing careers?","answer":"Man o' War had the more impressive top-level racing record, winning 20 out of 21 career starts and setting multiple American records, including in prestigious races like the Belmont Stakes and Lawrence Realization. Storm Cat, while talented enough to win the Grade 1 Young America Stakes and place second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, had a much briefer racing career of just eight starts, winning four races and earning $570,610 before retiring to stud.","context":["Renowned bloodstock writer Tony Morris with the sixth in his series of articles celebrating 100 horses instrumental in shaping the modern Thoroughbred.\nMan o’ War, ch, 1917, Fair Play – Mahubah, by Rock Sand\nWho was the best horse ever to race in America? Until 1920 that was a moot point, with a case to be reasonably made for several outstanding performers who had dominated their rivals in years gone by.\nBut the emergence of Man o’ War ended all debate. His almost flawless record and the manner of his accomplishments clearly marked him as the champion of champions. Nearly a century later there remains a body of opinion that still ranks him as best of the bests.\nThe creator of this paragon was August Belmont II, a fabulously wealthy New York financier who occupied a prominent – if not quite entirely dominant – position in racing and breeding circles over many years. He bred and raced both Fair Play, second-best in Colin’s generation, and Mahubah, just a maiden winner from five starts; he had imported Fair Play’s dam, Fairy Gold, and Mahubah’s dam, Merry Token, from England; and Mahubah was by England’s 1903 Triple Crown winner, Rock Sand, bought by Belmont for £25,000 to stand at his Nursery Stud in Kentucky.\nPick of the group from day one\nIn the normal course of events, the chestnut son of Fair Play and Mahubah who was born on 29 March 1917 would have raced in the colours of his breeder, but Belmont had a role to play for his nation after America’s entry into the Great War. He resolved to sell all his yearlings of 1918, albeit with some misgivings over the colt who had impressed as the pick of the group from day one. It would have looked bad to hold one back. The gangly youngster, who had already been named Man o’ War by Mrs Eleanor Belmont, would have to go to Saratoga with the others.\nThere were 21 in the Nursery Stud consignment, which sold for a highly satisfactory average of $2,450, more than double that for the sale as a whole. Although others were preferred by the market, Man o’ War made just over double the average for Belmont’s draft, knocked down for $5,000 to Ed Buhler, acting on behalf of (then) small-time operator Sam Riddle, who had hitherto been more conspicuous in the world of hunting and showing, but who had lately decided he wanted to establish a major flat racing stable.\nRiddle headed for Saratoga, aiming to collect up to a dozen yearlings, and he fancied himself as something of a judge. As it turned out, he did buy 11, and ten of them proved to be duds. He bid unsuccessfully well into five figures for two of the Nursery Stud lots, yet the acquisition who would ensure his life would never be the same again came at a significant discount.\nThere seems no doubt that Riddle bought Man o’ War at the insistence of noted horseman Louis Feustel, who had trained Mahubah and was currently training her Fair Play daughter Masda. Feustel accentuated all the positives he could summon to persuade Riddle to make the purchase. He was determined to add that tall, ungainly red chestnut colt to his string.\nMan o’ War wintered in Maryland before switching to New York in the spring of 1919. Feustel was in no hurry to introduce him to competition, but he soon recognised that there was something special about the long-striding colt.\nHe was not the only one to notice, and when Fair Play’s son went to post for his debut at Belmont on June 6, he was an odds-on chance against six rivals for a five-furlong maiden. Although jockey Johnny Loftus was easing him down towards the finish, the winning margin was six lengths. And Man o’ War would never start at odds against.\nAn opportunity to buy money\nBefore June was out, he was a four-time winner with three stakes victories to his name. The Keene Memorial (5½ furlongs, Belmont), the Youthful (5½ furlongs, Jamaica) and the Hudson (5 furlongs, Aqueduct) were collected with the minimum of fuss. In the last-named contest, he gave 21lb to his runner-up.\nMan o’ War remained at Aqueduct for a single start in July, when only two opposed him in the six-furlong Tremont Stakes. If concessions of 15lb to one and 18lb to the other were supposed to even things up a bit, the bettors did not take that view, sending him off at odds of 1-10, and he duly won with any amount in hand.\nFive easy wins from as many starts could hardly be faulted, but all New York recognised that Man o’ War had yet to contend with a worthy rival. The first serious tests would come in August at Saratoga, starting with the U S Hotel Stakes (six furlongs) on the second of the month.\nA field of ten went to post, the conditions stipulating that Man o’ War again had to give weight all round, and such was the apparent strength of the opposition that he started at 9-10, just a shade of odds-on. It proved an excellent opportunity to buy money, as the favourite held sway throughout and Loftus could afford to take things easily in the last half-furlong. Whisk Broom’s son, Upset, could make no impression as modest second-best, despite his 15lb weight concession.\nThe Thoroughbred Record’s reporter, while acknowledging that other promising youngsters may yet come along, was already prepared to award Man o’ War the 2-year-old title. He delivered a eulogy that acclaimed the colt’s superiority in pedigree, speed, stamina, size and class. There was none, he opined, who could threaten his dominance.\nHow many would have regarded such enthusiasm as a temptation to providence? Not many at Saratoga 11 days later, when Man o’ War went off at odds of 11-20 for the Sanford Memorial Stakes, in which he met Upset on the same terms and at the same distance as before.\nMan o’ War did not win the Sanford Memorial. He found himself hemmed in on the rail and got out just too late. His strong late charge testified to his gameness, but the aptly named Upset kept going stoutly to score by half a length. A crowd estimated at 20,000 saw it happen, but few accepted the result as a true representation of the principals’ merits. The Thoroughbred Record had little to say about Upset’s qualities; it referred to the runner-up as a ‘truly great racer’.\nOf course, no 2-year-old can ever be truly described as ‘great’, but Man o’ War would earn that designation in 1920, when he was required to prove that he was more than just a precocious sprinter, and he did so in a campaign of unparallelled brilliance.\nMeanwhile, he confirmed his dominance of the 1919 juvenile ranks, collecting easy victories in two more Saratoga stakes, the Grand Union Hotel and the Hopeful, and another back at Belmont in the Futurity. Upset was a well-beaten rival on all three occasions.\n‘No’ to the Kentucky Derby\nAlthough no official classification of 2-year-old performance would be published until 1933, a Daily Racing Form handicapper ranked Man o’ War an unprecedented 16 pounds above the best of his contemporaries.\nSam Riddle never doubted Man o’ War’s stamina, but he felt that early May was too soon for any 3-year-old to go a mile and a quarter, so he instructed Feustel not to aim his champion at the Kentucky Derby. Paul Jones beat Upset by a head in the Run for the Roses while Man o’ War waited for the Preakness, contested ten days later over nine furlongs.\nA 4-5 shot at Pimlico, with a new rider in Clarence Kummer, ‘Big Red’ won as he liked, conceding four pounds to Upset and defeating him by a length and a half, with Wildair (who received 12lb) a well-beaten third.\nBack at Belmont 11 days later for the Withers, Wildair faced a daunting task at level weights with Man o’ War, who trounced him by two lengths while setting an American record for the mile.\nThe 11 furlongs of the Belmont Stakes represented a new test for Man o’ War, but he had only one obviously inferior opponent and duly notched his second American record in a 20-length romp. It was all too easy again in the Stuyvesant Handicap at Jamaica, in which solitary rival Yellow Hand had the advantage of a 32-pound pull in the weights; Man o’ War toyed with the challenger, romping home by eight lengths at odds of 100-1 on.\nMan o’ War had his first serious test as a 3-year-old in the Dwyer Stakes at Aqueduct, for while he once more had only a single rival, that was a proper racehorse in the accomplished John P. Grier, whose trainer Jim Rowe held him in high esteem. His colt was to receive 18lb, which surely gave him a sporting chance.\nJohn P. Grier delivered an outstanding performance, matching Man o’ War stride for stride for more than a mile, even claiming a narrow lead at one point, but the last of the nine furlongs found him out, and he was a length and a half down at the finish. His gallant attempt forced the champion to set another American record in order to prevail.\nMan o’ War had two engagements at Saratoga, the first resulting in a facile triumph over Donnaconna in the Miller Stakes, when he was ridden by Earl Sande, replacing the injured Kummer. But, in the Travers, the colt needed another change of jockey, as Kummer remained out of action and Sande was unavailable, and both Upset (receiving six pounds) and John P. Grier (getting 14) could be considered worthy rivals. Jim Rowe, who handled both challengers, was bullish again.\nRowe soon realised that his optimism was misplaced. Man o’ War was away in a flash, remained on top throughout, and Andy Schuttinger, enjoying the luckiest spare ride of his career, was pulling him up as he passed the post in track record-equalling time.\nDerby hero no match\nNew York fans had only two more opportunities to see Man o’ War in action, and both produced bloodless victories. He started at 100-1 on in both the Lawrence Realization (13 furlongs) and the Jockey Club Stakes (12 furlongs), setting American records at both distances. His winning margins were recorded as 100 lengths and 15 lengths respectively.\nMan o’ War’s first serious training had been at Havre de Grace in Maryland, and it was there that he had his penultimate start in the Potomac Handicap over eight and a half furlongs. Hefty weight concessions to three rivals, including 24lb to Kentucky Derby hero Paul Jones, proved insufficient to create a meaningful race. The champion won in track record time.\nWhat was left for Man o’ War to prove? The one glaring omission from his record was a test against an older horse, and for some time Riddle had been under pressure to commit him to a match race against 4-year-old Sir Barton, the winner in 1919 of all the races that would later become bracketed together as the Triple Crown. Kenilworth Park, in Windsor, Canada, secured the honour of staging the event, putting up $75,000 and a $5,000 Gold Cup as prize for the winner.\nIt was a strange match with the favourite at 20-1 on, and it duly turned out to be an uncompetitive affair. Man o’ War soon bounded clear, always had matters all his own way, and won by seven lengths, knocking more than six seconds off the ten-furlong track record.\nMan o’ War remained sound and could have raced on at four, but he would have been assigned enormous weights in handicaps, so he retired as winner of 20 out of 21 starts, universally accepted as the greatest equine athlete in American history.\nWhat could he now contribute to the American thoroughbred through his genes?\nMan o’ War had 22 seasons at stud, all but the first two at Faraway Farm, near Lexington, and never covered a book greater than 25. He headed the North American sire list in 1926, when his oldest crop were only 4-year-olds, allowing the hope that there would be many more titles to come, but that proved to be his only season at the top. However, he ranked second three times and figured in the top ten on five other occasions.\nThat record might seem disappointing, but a tally of 17 per cent stakes-winners to foals – unheard of in the 21st century – tells a different story.\nMates of modest distinction\nIn truth, Man o’ War was a remarkably successful sire, particularly as the quality of his mates generally left a lot to to be desired. Riddle, friends and family did not own outstanding broodmare bands, but they routinely featured prominently among breeders with access to the horse. Commercial breeders who managed to buy nominations did rather well with the yearlings they marketed in the early years, but that did not last for obvious reasons. Between 1924 and 1943 a total of 45 yearlings went to auction, and only three contrived to win at stakes level.\nAs with Secretariat half a century later, too much was expected of Man o’ War at the outset of his stud career. It is widely recognised now that no truly exceptional racehorse can get a runner as good as himself, a fact explained by regression to the mean. Mates of modest distinction do not help.\nThere were winners of the Belmont Stakes in American Flag and Crusader from each of Man o’ War’s first two crops, but the sons who ultimately mattered most were products of his 13th and 17th crops – War Admiral and War Relic.\nWar Admiral famously won the 1937 Triple Crown and ingloriously turned in a feeble effort in his 1938 match against Seabiscuit, who was on all known form clearly his inferior.\nIn our book A Century of Champions, John Randall and I rated War Admiral only 5lb lower than his sire. He became an accomplished sire as well, and earned further celebrity as maternal grandsire of Buckpasser.\nWas he America’s greatest runner?\nWar Relic, the best of three stakes-winning full siblings, scored his biggest victory in the Massachusetts Handicap as a 3-year-old. His stud career proved inconsistent, but there were notable highlights in such as Battlefield, Intent and Relic, the last-named an important stud influence on both sides of the Atlantic.\nMan o’ War covered his last mares in 1942 and afterwards was a much-visited pensioner at Faraway Farm, where he died on 1 November 1947.\nSuch was Man o’ War’s enduring reputation that in 1999 a panel of authorities brought together by The Blood-Horse added to his legend by honouring him as America’s all-time best runner.\nJohn Randall and I took a different view. While recognising him as a performer who had plainly surpassed the achievements of all his predecessors, we believed that the American Thoroughbred had made significant progress since the 1920s, and in our book Secretariat ranked clear best.\nAlso in this series","- DRF Bets\n- Handicapping & PPsThoroughbred Past Performances\nReportsPremium NewsDigital PapersHorsemen's Products\n- DRF Classic PDF PPs\n- DRF Formulator PPs\n- DRF EasyForm PPs\n- Daily Racing Program PPs\n- Equibase PPs\n- TrackMaster PPs\n- NewsCategoriesTrack Notes\n- DRF TV\n- StorePast Performances\n- Compare all DRF PPs\n- DRF Formulator PPs\n- DRF Classic PPs\n- DRF EasyForm PPs\n- Daily Racing Program PPs\n- Expanded Closer Looks\n- Equibase & Trackmaster PPs - Thoroughbred\nUpdated on 05/13/2013 2:24PM\nLegendary Overbrook Farm stallion Storm Cat dies at 30\nStorm Cat, the prominent American stallion who sired champions on both sides of the Atlantic and inspired multi-million-dollar bidding wars for his foals, died Wednesday at age 30.\nOverbrook Farm, Storm Cat’s home for his entire stud career and after his 2008 pensioning, announced the Storm Bird horse’s death late Wednesday morning. Storm Cat’s longtime veterinarian, Dr. Robert Copelan, euthanized him due to the infirmities of old age, and the great horse died at just after 10 a.m. Storm Cat was buried at Overbrook in Lexington, Ky., which has leased its land to a number of operations since the death of its founder, W. T. Young, in 2004.\n“Storm Cat was a once-in-a-lifetime horse and the key to the success that Overbrook Farm enjoyed,” said Young’s son and the current Overbrook owner, William T. Young, Jr. “My father often said that Storm Cat made him look like a genius.”\n“He was a top stallion who deserves mention in the same breath as all the top stallions of the last half-century,” said longtime Overbrook advisor Ric Waldman, who was present at Storm Cat’s death. “When I think of Storm Cat and the prototypical Storm Cat offspring, I think of the heart and courage and energy and drive that Storm Cat gave so many of his successful runners.”\nStorm Cat led the general sire list twice (in 1999 and 2000), the broodmare sire list in 2012, and the juvenile sire list a record seven times (1992-’93, 1995, 1998-’99, 2002, and 2004). Several of his sons have followed his rise: Giant’s Causeway, Hennessy, Tale of the Cat, and Stormy Atlantic are among those who also have led the juvenile sire rankings by progeny earnings, and Giant’s Causeway led the general sire list in 2009, 2010, and 2012. Storm Cat also has proven to be a breed-shaping stallion thanks to his daughters; to date, their ranks include Contrive, the dam of 2005 champion juvenile filly Folklore, and Silken Cat, who produced 2004 sprint champion Speightstown, himself a successful sire.\nStorm Cat’s runners collectively earned more than $128 million and included 180 stakes winners, among them classic winners Tabasco Cat (1994 Preakness and Belmont) and Sardula (1994 Kentucky Oaks). He sired five Breeders’ Cup winners, including the 1999 Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Cat Thief for Overbrook, and is that event’s leading sire by starters and money won, with 44 Breeders’ Cup starters having earned $8,866,300. In addition to Cat Thief, he also sired 1995 Sprint winner Desert Stormer; 2002 Juvenile Fillies winner and eventual juvenile filly champion Storm Flag Flying; 2004 Juvenile Fillies winner Sweet Catomine, also a juvenile filly champion that year; and 2009 Ladies’ Classic winner Life is Sweet.\nHis other Grade or Group 1 winners featured such names as Sharp Cat, Storm Beauty, Bluegrass Cat, Raging Fever, High Yield, and many others.\nStorm Cat also sired such champions as 2000 European Horse of the Year Giant’s Causeway, now a much sought-after and influential sire in his own right for Coolmore’s Ashford Stud; Canada’s 2005 turf mare champion Ambitious Cat and 1995 champion juvenile filly Silken Cat; and European champion juveniles Aljabr (1998), Hold That Tiger (2002), and One Cool Cat (2003). Storm Cat’s British and European highweighted runners also include such horses as England’s two-time highweight Catrail (1993-’94); Ireland’s 3-year-olds Black Minnaloushe (2001) and Dark Cheetah (2005) and juvenile filly Heart Shaped (2008); France’s juvenile filly Denebola (2003); and Italy’s older male Mistle Cat (1996), among others.\nStorm Cat’s stud fee, which had started at $30,000, peaked at $500,000, and he drove buyers—especially John Magnier’s Coolmore Stud partnership and its great rival, Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum’s Darley Stud—to excessive bidding duels that largely defined the bloodstock business from the mid-1990s until the market crash of 2008. Storm Cat became synonymous with the kinds of precocious and classy horses that dominated yearling buyers’ lists at a time when the market also was flush with money, particularly among racing’s wealthiest buyers. His highest-priced yearling was Jalil, who fetched $9.7 million at the 2005 Keeneland September yearling sale in 2005, but he also sired the $8 million Mr. Sekiguchi, $6.8 million Tasmanian Tiger, $6.4 million Van Nistelrooy, and $6.3 million Objectivity, to name just a few highlights from an astonishingly long list of $1 million-plus auction horses.\nIn his auction success, Storm Cat carried on the tradition of his grandsire, Northern Dancer. That sire inspired the original record-setting battles between Coolmore and the Maktoum family in the 1980s, before a sharp market correction by the early 1990s. It was fitting, then, that the market revival should come with Storm Cat.\nW. T. Young bred Storm Cat from his four-time graded stakes winner Terlingua, by Secretariat, and watched him carry the Overbrook silks to a Grade 1 victory. But even Young could not have expected the colt to mature into such a dominant and influential sire. Trained by Jonathan Sheppard, Storm Cat won the Grade 1 Young America Stakes at 2 and finished second in the 1985 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile, so short a nose behind Tasso that Young went down to the winner’s circle and only discovered there—to his lifelong chagrin—that Storm Cat had lost the photo finish.\nStorm Cat’s race record, which also included a second at 2 in a division of the World Appeal Stakes and a 3 1/2-length allowance victory in just two starts at 3, was a good one in a brief career of eight starts, and he had earned $570,610 by the time he shipped to Overbrook as one of the new farm’s first stallions.\nIt was a difficult beginning. Breeders were wary of Storm Cat’s offset knees, which many believed contributed to the brevity of his racing career and felt would compromise his foals’ chances at the yearling auctions.\n“His conformation didn’t leave the most favorable impression,” Overbrook advisor Waldman later recalled in the book The Home Run Horse. “Now, we’re more forgiving of that, because we know that those conformation traits we were so critical of have gone on to get good racehorses. No one knew then that they were looking at the prototype that would end up with those runners.”\nOfficially, Storm Cat’s initial stud fee was $30,000, but, Waldman said, “we did everything short of begging” to get mares to Storm Cat that year. But when his first crop of foals went to the races in 1991, they roared. From just 39 juvenile runners that year, Storm Cat sired two Grade 1 winners—Harlan and November Snow—and one of American breeding’s greatest careers was launched.\n“Maybe he’s given the public more acceptance of offset knees or maybe forced the public to analyze those offset knees a little bit more carefully and not write them off,” Waldman said. “Because here he was, a highly successful commercial stallion who wasn’t very tall, had a short neck, and had offset knees. And yet he was a top commercial stallion. Naturally, that won’t be the only consideration of Storm Cat, but people will think of how successful he was commercially and with runners in spite of those flaws.”\nFor those who knew the stallion best, Storm Cat’s death also represented a personal loss, and a group of them gathered to be with the old horse when he died Wednesday morning. Among that group were the stallion’s devoted longtime groom Armando Reyes; Overbrook’s former stallion manager Eduardo Terrazas, who has continued to keep an eye on Storm Cat throughout the horse’s retirement; W. T. Young’s grandson Chris Young; and Young’s son-in-law William Hamilton, husband of Young’s daughter Lucy.\n“I never looked at him as the famous horse he was,” said Terrazas, who joined Overbrook when Storm Cat’s first foals were yearlings. After Young’s death, when the farm dispersed its bloodstock, Terrazas began leasing some of the property for his own operation. “It was like when you know a person before they are famous. We always got along and had respect for each other, in our way. After I came back here to Overbrook, one of the first times I had a chance to sneak out and take a look at him, he surprised me because all I had to do was whistle and he came running back to the fence. That made me think he recognized my whistle.”\nTerrazas and Reyes continued to care for Storm Cat throughout his life as a pensioner, and Terrazas reported that Storm Cat retained much of his character, strong-willed and happy, into old age.\n“They are horses you don’t fight,” Terrazas said of Storm Cat and his progeny. “If you fight them, they’re going to fight back, so you have to find a medium ground where you get along. But I never saw him savage anybody. He was the kind of horse that, when you’d go to bring him in, he’d go prancing and dancing all the way to the barn, and when you turned him out he was the same way.”\nTerrazas and Reyes turned Storm Cat out for the last time at about 7 a.m. Wednesday morning and let him graze for about an hour and a half.\n“He wanted to go out, so we let him go out before we made the decision,” Terrazas said. The horse had lost weight and those around him knew that now was the time to let him go. “I’d been thinking about it for about a week, and I was just glad we got it done, because the waiting is the most difficult thing for everybody—knowing you have to do it and waiting for the right moment. We just wanted to do the right thing for the horse, and nobody even thought about anything else. It had to be what was best for him.”\nStorm Cat now lies in a grave headed by a life-sized bronze statue of himself and prepared by Overbrook’s Terry Judd and John Young. His legacy, of course, lives on in the breed and its records, and his memory will not soon fade.\n“Coincidentally, after Copelan gave the injection, we heard a lot of thunder,” Terrazas said with a sigh. “It was a storm moving in. It started raining about 10 minutes after he passed.

{"question":"How do sustainable waste management strategies at music festivals align with the nutritional planning required for a healthy plant-based diet?","answer":"Both domains require careful planning and consideration of resources. Music festivals are implementing comprehensive waste management strategies including skip bin solutions, strategic bin placement, recycling programs, and encouraging reusable materials like water bottles and cups. Similarly, plant-based diets require thorough planning to ensure adequate nutrition, particularly for key nutrients like Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, calcium, iron, and zinc. Both areas emphasize the importance of variety and proper resource management - festivals need diverse waste collection methods and education programs, while plant-based diets need diverse food sources to meet nutritional needs. Success in both cases depends on careful organization and awareness of specific requirements.","context":["Summer just wouldn’t be the same without festivals. The music, the food, the people, the party—memories that last a lifetime, but fewer people remember the mess left behind after music festival. Once the party is over, not many people pay attention to the amount of rubbish left behind. All that trash just sits around until waste contractors collect it up and dump everything in a landfill.\nThe culture of music festivals is important to Australia, but so is the environmental impact of these festivals. As this music festival waste problem worsens, questions concerning the sustainability of it all and solutions for the waste have arisen.\nAre Music Festivals Environmental Disasters?\nMusic festivals are a lot of fun. Their curators are continuously expanding to meet the demands of festival-goers, but they don’t always make an effort to set up an eco-friendly festival. It’s estimated that 80% of trash from summer music festivals is generated and left behind by campers themselves, even including items like tents, sleeping bags, camp chairs, gazebos, clothes, rubber boots, and of course, leftover alcohol and food. Many of these items are used for a weekend and then dumped. Attendees are ruining the grounds they’re camping out on.Many sites don’t have enough trash cans, don’t have cleaning crews coming through, and have nowhere to throw their trash. Festival rubbish removal can be costly though, which can add to the ticket price and make the overall cost of the festival even more than it already is.\nEven if there are a few programs in place to attempt to handle this trash problem, there have still been issues with excess trash left behind as a result of the “drop everything” mentality some festival-goers have. Thankfully, there have also been increasing efforts on the festival scene to go green and improve sustainability.\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Live Music\nWith the Australian festival culture making it somewhat challenging to keep festival grounds clean, people wonder if it’s possible to practice environmental sustainability while still having a great time on the campgrounds. If you’ve ever lingered after a festival and watched the clean-up effort stepping around the abandoned food and items on the ground as you walk around, you might have pondered the possibility of sustainable waste management for festivals too.\nFestivals can produce the equivalent of over 6 pounds of waste per person per day, which is much more than you would typically produce at home or work. Six litres of diesel are used too just to power everything, generating tons of carbon emissions per year. For all the waste that’s produced though, only around 32% is recycled. On top of that, think of the damage all the foot traffic does to the environment itself, and the emissions that come from the vehicles people use to drive to the festival grounds.\nReducing Waste and Environmental Impact\nSo what kind of sustainable efforts have people been considering to reduce the environmental impact by festival rubbish? Many festival organisers are aware that they need to do something in order to limit the environmental impact, but in order for anything to change, festival-goers themselves have to be willing to participate.\nRecently, there have been programs set up to reduce the emissions from transport to the festivals, which make up a total of 80% of the overall emissions. Organisers have begun to reward people for using a lower-emission route, offering shuttle services, and providing rewards for people riding in cars with more than four people. There are even areas with bike parking lots to encourage people living close enough to leave their car at home and dedicated buses for people to shuttle over to festivals in mass.\nFestival organisers themselves have been working to increase their own sustainability by treating water on site and reducing waste with renewable fuels and new recycling efforts. They’ve even taken initiatives to provide locally-sourced organic food to reduce the carbon footprint of food provision as well and have made it easier to restore the environment after the festival ends too.\nEco-Friendly Festival Behaviour\nYou’ve seen how your organisers are trying to prevent the environmental disaster of festivals, but what can you do to reduce your footprint while you’re there? Instead of relying on greasy food stands set around or beverages in plastic bottles, you can buy some fresh fruit or organic meals set out right on the festival grounds. With green reusable cups, you can drink everything without leaving behind all the plastic trash festival goers have gotten far too used to seeing.\nThe waste produced at festivals has increasingly highlighted the negative impact of the festival industry prompting more eco-friendly behaviour from people who attend. More and more people are using low-emission transportation instead of travelling alone in their cars and choosing sustainable food options while at the festival grounds. All the food is sourced locally with a wide range of sustainable meals and reliable and natural origins to reduce the environmental damage.\nPlastic Recycling and Collection Can Help\nIn terms of plastic, reusable cups are being used to replace the plastic of the past, with some companies providing free water for those cups to reduce the plastic consumption overall. As for what you can do, consider bringing your own reusable materials too, like a water bottle, coffee cup, or plates. You can also try borrowing your camping gear instead of buying something cheap and leaving it behind. Event rubbish removal involves just taking all that left behind gear and throwing it away, so instead, borrow gear that’s likely higher quality than you would otherwise have, and save money while being environmentally conscious as well.\nMost importantly, remember to clean up after yourself. Many people just leave their trash around for others to clean up. It’s easy to bring your own garbage bag to set up with you. Try bringing eco glitter as well if you’re the glitter type. This glitter won’t harm nature when you use it or eventually end up hurting animals through the water, and you can still have a good time with it. The same goes for your clothing: don’t wear something you’ll have once and then throw it away. It’s all about sustainability.\nSkip Bin Solutions for Your Events\nIf you’ve ever been to a music festival, you may remember the overfull bins with trash piled on top of them and all around them when they get too full. People just leave the trash there, and even with increased festival rubbish recycling projects, there ends up being too much trash to handle at times. Instead of using classic bins though, consider using skin bin solutions for your events.\nEvent skip bin hire uses what’s known as a skin bin: a trapezoid shaped container for waste. You can find these bins in a range of sizes. They are able to hold a large amount of waste. Skip bins will keep all the trash in one place instead of you having to spread bins around. There will, of course, still be a large amount of waste, but your efforts at managing the water and handling the clean-up afterwards will be that much easier.\nHiring a Skip Bin to manage Music Festival Waste\nIf you chose to hire a skip bin, the first step is to decide how many of bins you’ll need and plan out where you want them to be placed so that people will use them instead of just throwing trash on the ground. Strategically place your bins, put up banners to direct people to them, and make sure people know exactly how to dispose of their waste. Come up with a plan to separate recyclable and non-recyclable materials, and place smaller bins near the exits to catch festival goers on their way out. Your skip bin hire provider can help with suggestions for this layout, and some placements may be limited by vehicle access, but bins can’t do all the work either.\nMake sure to keep an eye on how full your bins are too. If your bin is under-sized and becomes full, people may just begin leaving trash on the ground around it. This is an area where ensuring you’ve hired a good skip bin company matters. You want a provider with timely pickup schedules that applies good disposal practices. Most skip bin companies deliver all your music festival waste to a licensed sorting facility to figure out how to separate your trash for you.\nZero Waste Festivals\nIf you’re hosting an event or festival but want to do right by the environment in the process, consider hiring skip bins to remove waste. Eco-friendly festival rubbish solutions have been on everyone’s minds as of late. People want to make sure that while they’re having a good time at a music festival, they’re not destroying the environment in the process. Organisers have started sustainability efforts, and festival goers have become more committed to keeping the grounds clean themselves. Before you go to your next festival, think about what you might be able to do before you even arrive to keep everything looking great after the fun is over, and everyone needs to head on home.","More people are choosing to eat a plant-based diet, whether it be a strictly vegetarian or vegan diet; a pescetarian diet (includes fish), or a more flexible diet that includes a mix of plant-based meals and those that include meat and poultry (the “flexitarian” diet, or other options like Mark Bittman’s “vegan before 6”). People are including more plant-based meals in their diet for many reasons including health, environmental, religious, personal, economic, and compassion for animals. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has affirmed that a vegetarian diet can meet all known needs for nutrients. In fact, vegetarians generally have fewer occurrences of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer.\nA Healthful Plant-Based Diet\nSimply eating removing meat from your diet does not ensure that you are living a healthier lifestyle. The key to a healthy plant-based diet, as with any other diet, is to eat a wide variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, whole grain products, nuts, seeds, and legumes (peas, lentils, and beans).\n- Move your dial: Whether you eat meat daily, are a strict vegetarian, or fall somewhere in between, most people can benefit from adding more plants to your diet. Aim to make one additional meal per week a plant-based one – both health and environmental benefits are seen with small changes.\n- Include a wide variety of whole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruits: Don’t get in a rut with the same foods day after day. This will not only lead to boredom but may cause you to miss some important vitamins and minerals.\n- Beware of higher calorie and lower nutrient vegetarian selections: Even vegetarian diets can be high calorie and low nutrient if it is filled with processed foods, sweets, and too many servings of high-fat dairy products. As with any diet, eating mostly whole foods from a variety of plant sources is the foundation of a healthy plan.\n- Be relaxed about protein: As long as calories are sufficient and the diet is varied including plant-based proteins such as beans, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products, most vegetarians easily meet protein needs. Don’t rely too heavily on cheeses as a primary protein source.\nNECESSARY NUTRIENTS IN A PLANT-BASED DIET\nWhether you occasionally include animal products in your diet or follow a strict vegan diet, planning meals is essential to ensure you are eating adequate amounts of the following nutrients:\n- Vitamin B12—sources include fortified soy beverages, cereals, and nutritional yeast. There are no plant sources of B12 unless fortified.\n- Vitamin D—sources include fortified soy, nut, or rice beverages, some margarine, and as always a bit of sunshine.\n- Calcium—sources include tofu processed with calcium, broccoli, seeds, nuts, kale, bok choy, legumes, greens, lime-processed tortillas, soy beverages, grain products, and beverages such as orange juice and nut milks enriched with calcium.\n- Iron—sources include legumes, tofu, green leafy vegetables, dried fruit, whole grains, and iron-fortified cereals and breads, especially whole-wheat. Absorption is improved by vitamin C, found in citrus fruits and juices, tomatoes, strawberries, broccoli, peppers, dark-green leafy vegetables, and potatoes with skins\n- Zinc—sources include whole grains (especially the germ and bran), whole-wheat bread, legumes, nuts, and tofu\nPlant-based diets can be simple and nutritious as long as you keep in mind the basics of balance and variety. Look for items in the café that are marked with the vegetarian or vegan icon and don’t be shy to ask questions about ingredients in specific dishes.

{"question":"How does habitat affect eastern and western golden eagles, and what conservation measures protect them?","answer":"Eastern and Western golden eagles show distinct habitat preferences - Eastern populations are found in densely forested areas, while in other parts of the world, these eagles primarily inhabit open country. This habitat difference has led to speculation about genetic distinctions between Eastern and Western populations. For protection, these birds are covered under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and as of 2011, wind farms must obtain permits if they expect eagle fatalities. Additionally, 'bird-smart' wind power principles require careful siting, monitoring, and habitat compensation to protect eagles and other birds from wind development impacts.","context":["By Molly Moore\nWith their deep brown bodies and gold-tinged feathery manes, golden eagles are icons of ferocity.\nWhen Americans imagine a golden eagle diving through the air with talons outstretched, they typically pair the image with a Western backdrop. But as Appalachian researchers are quick to point out, the notion of golden eagles as strictly creatures of the West simply isn’t true.\n“It turns out that there’s a small but substantial population of golden eagles in eastern North America,” says Todd Katzner, research assistant professor at West Virginia University. Katzner is a member of the Eastern Golden Eagle Working Group, an international partnership founded in 2010 to study the mighty raptor’s distribution and ecology.\nKatzner’s preliminary research suggests that West Virginia and Virginia are the eagles’ main winter stomping grounds, though golden eagles have been spotted wintering as far north as upstate New York and as far south as Florida. Eastern golden eagles breed in northeastern Canada. When they migrate south, they primarily winter in the central and southern Appalachian Mountains.\n“We don’t know if there is a really strict habitat requirement, but we do know that the areas of West Virginia and Virginia where the birds are found are primarily the Monongohela National Forest and the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests,” Katzner says. “Those are some of the more densely forested areas that we have in this region.”\nIn other parts of the world, golden eagles are found primarily over open country. This habitat difference has fueled speculation that Eastern golden eagles could be genetically distinct from their Western counterparts.\nMaria Wheeler, a doctoral student at Duquesene University in Pittsburgh, Pa. co-supervised by Katzner, is researching the level of genetic distinction present in Eastern golden eagles. Not only is Wheeler studying how separate the Eastern birds are from Western North American populations and those around the world, she’s delving into the golden eagles’ genetic past. In a well-intentioned attempt to bolster the golden eagle population of the Southern Appalachians, Western golden eagles were introduced between 15 and 35 years ago, and these introductions may have changed the biology of Eastern goldens already living in the area.\nTo determine whether the genetic code of Eastern golden eagles’ has actually changed, Wheeler is collecting tissue samples from museum specimens of Eastern goldens collected before the introduction of the Western birds. She then compares the Eastern eagles’ historic genotypes with modern genotypes.\nWheeler’s genetic study is just one topic being probed by the Eastern Golden Eagle Working Group and their collaborators. To understand the birds’ behavior in their Appalachian winter homes, researchers have placed over 80 motion-sensitive cameras at select sites between New York and North Carolina. These cameras are rigged in small, remote clearings that are baited with roadkill deer.\nOver the past five years, thousands of images have been recorded at these sites. The high numbers affirm the raptor’s winter appetite for carrion.\nLess certain is whether Eastern golden eagles dine on other birds during the summer, as some suggest. Katzner’s team has placed telemetry tracking devices on about 50 birds, which record location every fifteen minutes throughout the year. Research partners in Quebec have provided some summertime assistance, but often these goldens soar into the roadless territory of Canada’s far north.\nGolden eagle researchers, including Katzner, hope that learning the raptor’s migratory flight patterns will help avoid conflicts between future wind energy development projects in Appalachia and the mighty birds. In the most famous conflict between the energy and avian worlds, at California’s Altamount Pass Wind Farm the failure to study bird movement patterns — as well as flawed turbine design — tragically led to high raptor death tolls from turbines.\nBy analyzing the risk golden eagles face from wind development, researchers could protect a range of other slopesoaring birds of prey, such as redtail hawks, broadwing hawks, bald eagles and osprey.\n“In the East we know of no turbines that have killed golden eagles,” he says. “What we don’t understand is why some turbines are dangerous and some are not. The goal of our research is to figure that out.”\nGolden eagles are monogamous, and their partnerships can last from several years to life. Females lay one to four eggs per year, which both parents incubate. Typically, one or two survive to fledgling age. The ladies are typically larger, but both sexes sport the species’ trademark plumage — a pattern of brown, gold, grey and sometimes even white feathers.\nGolden eagles are used by Mongolian and Kazakh falconers to hunt wolves in Central Asia’s wild steppes. With a wingspan that averages from six to nearly eight feet, it’s no wonder that the only natural predators golden eagles face are brown bears and wolverines. There’s even one confirmed report of a golden eagle preying on a brown bear cub.","Wind Energy Frequently Asked Questions |\nWhat Is American Bird Conservancy’s (ABC) policy regarding wind energy?\nWind power can be an important part of the solution to global warming, but wind farms can also kill birds—including eagles, songbirds, and endangered species—through collisions with turbines, and also harm them through loss of habitat. By 2030, there will likely be more than 100,000 wind turbines in the U.S., and these are expected to kill at least one million birds each year—probably significantly more. Wind farms are also expected to impact almost 20,000 square miles of terrestrial habitat, and over 4,000 square miles of marine habitat by 2030, some of it critical to threatened species.\nTo be a truly green source of energy, wind power needs to be Bird-smart and that means wind power employs careful siting, operation and construction mitigation, monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress any unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss from wind energy development. These are issues that should be included in mandatory federal wind standards. All wind farms should employ bird-smart principles and comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws.\nWhat is bird-smart wind energy?\nBird-smart wind power implements careful siting considerations, operation and construction mitigation, bird monitoring, and compensation to reduce and redress unavoidable bird mortality and habitat loss. These are issues that the federal government should include in mandatory wind standards. For terrestrial wind farms, bird-smart wind should address:\n- Siting: Bird-smart wind power (including wind farms and associated infrastructure) is sited to prevent harm to birds, ideally in already altered habitats such as farmland, and avoids sensitive areas. Examples of such areas may include migratory bottlenecks, wetlands, raptor concentration and key nesting areas, the edges of ridges used by migrants, key habitat or flight paths for endangered or declining species, breeding concentrations of species that avoid tall structures (such as some grouse species), and in or adjacent to Important Bird Areas. Maps with detailed data on wildlife are currently being developed by conservation groups for use by the wind industry. Pre-construction assessments should always be conducted to confirm whether a particular site presents an especially high risk to birds. Some areas are not going to be suitable for wind development.\n- Operation and Construction Mitigation: Bird-smart wind power uses the best technology and management practices to avoid and minimize harm to birds, such as by burying transmission lines in high risk areas, following Avian Power Line Interaction Committee standards for above-ground transmission lines, using lighting that minimizes nighttime migratory bird collision mortality (such as strobe lights), using unguyed rather than guyed meteorological towers, and restoring habitat disturbed by construction, e.g., re-compacting soils disturbed by construction and replanting native vegetation (or restoring the site if the wind farm is decommissioned).\n- Monitoring: Bird-smart wind power conducts effective, federally reviewed and approved, site-specific, pre- and post-construction studies/assessments to assist with improved siting and operation, and to properly quantify impacts. Pre-construction assessments must provide sufficient data to assist with micro-siting (e.g., by use of radar to detect local bird movements), create an annual baseline against which post-construction studies can be evaluated, use all existing available bird study data, and be conducted during months when bird use can be expected to be at its peak at the selected site. Post-construction studies must employ mathematical models that best account for variations in local conditions and the relative difficulty of locating bird carcasses in different habitats, as well as any scavenging by predators that may reduce the number of carcasses found, and run for at least two years (and long enough to determine the efficacy of, and make needed revisions to, operational mitigation measures).\n- Compensation: Bird-smart wind power redresses the loss of any birds or habitat unavoidably harmed by construction and operation to a net benefit standard. This includes bird deaths caused by collisions with turbines and their associated power lines, and lost or degraded habitat (e.g., areas of abandoned habitat) Such compensation could include acquiring additional land for the National Wildlife Refuge system or other off-site habitat conservation projects.\nAlthough offshore wind power is not yet operational in the U.S., an analogous set of siting, operating, and compensatory measures need to be developed to make it bird-smart.\nAll wind farms should have an Avian Protection Plan which includes American Bird Conservancy’s bird-smart principles, and a means of implementing them and tracking and reporting on this implementation. Wind farms should also comply with relevant state and federal wildlife protection laws such as the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.\nHow would you know if a potential wind farm site will have large or small impacts to birds?\nSee section above on pre-construction monitoring and post-construction monitoring.\nIsn’t the Federal Government developing wind energy regulations?\nNo, the Federal Government has released draft, voluntary wind-energy guidelines that were produced from recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior by a Federal Advisory Committee. During the public comment period on those proposed voluntary guidelines, ABC will urge that that the Department of the Interior enact mandatory standards that the industry must follow. We do not believe that energy industries should be able to choose whether or not to consider bird impacts.\nA recent lawsuit regarding the Altamont Pass Wind Farm in California illustrates that getting the right thing done voluntarily is anything but a sure thing. Recent studies say that approximately 7,600-9,300 birds were killed there each year, including 55-94 Golden Eagles, 475-477 American Kestrels, 253-433 Red-tailed Hawks, and 714-718 Burrowing Owls. After seven years of being challenged by various conservation groups, it finally took a lawsuit to get changes made at Altamont Pass. NextEra Energy Resources has only recently agreed to replace 2,400 of its old wind turbines at Altamont Pass with fewer, larger models that produce the same amount of total power. They also agreed to place the new turbines in “more environmentally friendly” locations, and to pay $2.5 million for research and raptor habitat improvement.\nWhat kinds of birds are impacted by wind farms?\nPotentially all night-migrating songbirds are at risk of colliding with wind turbines, as are raptors and other birds when wind farms are sited in areas they frequent. Habitat loss is also an issue as wind farms can degrade bird habitat or cause birds to abandon habitat.\nGolden Eagles will be especially impacted because much of the additional wind build-out planned for the western U.S. is expected to occur in areas they inhabit. The endangered Whooping Crane will be exposed to additional risk from collision with new power lines erected to service wind farms along their migratory pathways.\nTo a Greater Sage-Grouse and some other birds, any tall structure such as a wind turbine is a threat because it is a potential perch for a predatory bird. A wind turbine standing a considerable distance away has much the same effect as a small tree at a few hundred yards, causing sage-grouse to abandon traditional lekking grounds up to three miles away from a wind farm. Unfortunately for the Sage-Grouse, Wyoming, one of this bird’s last remaining strongholds, is slated for significant wind farm build-out. It is very important for the future of the Greater Sage-Grouse that this development is appropriately sited\nHow many birds are killed by wind farms each year?\nNo one knows for sure. Recent estimates of the number of birds killed by wind turbines ranges from a low of 100,000 birds/year to 440,000 birds/year (calculated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). If 20% of the nation’s electricity comes from wind power by 2030, ABC estimates that at least one million birds per year will be killed by wind turbines, probably significantly more.\nAren’t there laws that protect birds from being killed by wind farms?\nWhooping Cranes and some other birds are protected under the Endangered Species Act. Golden Eagles are protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BAGEPA), and most migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). Unfortunately, both the BAGEPA and MBTA are not currently sufficiently enforced to prevent predicted mortality resulting from wind development. However, in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to begin issuing permits for wind farms that expect to kill Golden Eagles, contingent on the wind farms taking tangible steps to protect eagles.

SNAP benefits can be used at authorized retailers like Trader Joe's for eligible food items. Additionally, many farmers markets are now equipped with technology to accept SNAP benefits through Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT). This helps address food access issues, as food accessibility is influenced by factors like affordability, travel time to shopping, and food prices, which can be barriers for low-income families. The system authorizes transfer of government SNAP benefits to pay for fresh food at both conventional retailers and local food venues.","context":["BMAC = Blue Mountain Action Council. A private, nonprofit, multipurpose agency that includes our local Food Bank. Partner on the LFPP grant.\nLFPP = Local Food Promotion Program – a grant program offered through the USDA. We were awarded this grant on October 1, 2018.\nWWVFSC = Walla Walla Valley Food System Coalition\nDirect Marketing: Sales from a farm/producer direct to the consumer. Farmers sell direct to consumers at the Farmers Market, food stands, U-Pick operations, through CSA’s and online markets. Farmers also sell direct to restaurants and coops/grocery stores. These are often called semi-direct because it is still one layer away from the consumer.\nCSA: Community Supported Agriculture is when customers pay farmers up front for a share of the harvest. They then receive a box or bag of produce and other farm products on a weekly basis throughout the growing season. CSAs vary on number of weeks, price, variety of products and delivery method. Some include work on the farm in exchange for food.\nWholesale: Lower prices are offered through a distributor for potentially larger quantities or on an ongoing basis, such as for restaurants, institutions or stores before products reach the end-user.\nValue-Added: An agricultural commodity or product whose value has been increased by undergoing a change in physical state (ie turning fruit into jam or grain into bread).\nCertified Naturally Grown: Certified Naturally Grown (CNG) products are certified by an independent non-profit organization through peer-to-peer inspection networks. GNG standars approximate national organic standards, yet require less paperwork and have lower certification fees than the USDA’s National Organic Program.\nCertified Organic: All products sold as organic must meet the USDA National Organic Program production and handling standards. Certification is mandatory for farmers selling more than $5,000 of organic products per year and includes annual submission of an organic system plan and inspection of farm fields and/or processing facilities to verify that organic practices and record-keeping are being followed.\nConventional: Refers to standard farming practices in the agricultural industry can (but does not necessarily) include use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers antibiotics hormones and other chemical approaches\nGenetically Modified Organisms (GMOs): GMOs are plants or animals whose genetic makeup has been altered by the addition of genes from other organism. The process is done to promote more desirable traits, like longer shelf-life or resistance to certain pests. Genes can be transferred between similar organisms (plant to plant) or between different types of organisms. An example is the gene from a bacteria (Bt) that was transferred into crop plants.\nHeirloom: Heirloom crop varieties, also called traditional varieties, have been developed by farmers through years of cultivation, selection, and Seed saving, and passed down through generations. Generally speaking, heirlooms are varieties that have been in existence for a minimum of 50 years.\nLocally-Grown: Food and other agricultural products that are produced, processed, and sold within a certain region, whether defined by distance, state border, or regional boundaries. The US Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 says the total distance that a product can be transported and still be considered a “locally or regionally produced agricultural food product” is less than 400 miles from its origin, or within the state in which it was produced. However it is not regulated and each farmers market or retail outlet can define and regulate the term based on their own mission and circumstances.\nNo Spray/Pesticide-Free: While a farm may not be organic, “no spray” or “pesticide-free” indicates that no pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides have been applied to the crop at any point in its production.\nNo-Till: A method of reducing soil erosion by planting crops without tilling the soil. This is beneficial to soil organic matter levels, requires less passes over the field and doesn’t disturb deeply buried weed seeds. However, it will usually result in increased need for weed management of existing weeds.\nSmall Farm: In 1997, the National Commission on Small Farms defined small farms as those with less than $250,000 in gross receipts annually on which day-to-day labor and management are provided by the farmer and/or the farm family that owns the production, or owns or leases the productive assets. Based on the 2012 Census of Agriculture by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), there are 37,249 farms in Washington State. Of these farms, 89% or 33,228 have sales less than $250,000 per year. 45% or 16,900 farms in Washington reported annual sales below $2,500 and can be classified as “non-commercial” operations, leaving 80% still classified as “small”. Looking at small by acreage is less meaningful as it would depend on the agricultural product; 150 acres under vegetable production would seem a large farm where it might not be large for raising animals or grains.\nSustainable Agriculture: Farming that is socially just, humane, economically viable and environmentally sound. Practices that promote diversity, build healthy soils, protect riparian waterways, recycle on farm inputs and bring farmers the opportunity to set their own prices promote sustainability.\nTERMS SPECIFIC TO LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION\nFree-Range/Pastured: Free-range, free-roaming, and pastured imply that a product comes from an animal that was raised unconfined and free to roam. “Free-range” claims on beef and eggs are unregulated, but USDA requires that poultry have access to the outdoors for an undetermined period each day.\nGrass-Fed: The diet of grass-fed animals consists of freshly grazed pasture during the growing season and stored grasses (hay or grass silage) during the winter months or drought conditions. Grass feeding is used with cattle, sheep, goats, and bison.\nHeritage-Breed: A term applied to breeds of livestock that were bred over time to be well-adapted to local environmental conditions, withstand disease, and survive in harsh environmental conditions. Heritage breeds generally have slow growth rates and long productive life spans outdoors, making them well-suited for grazing and pasturing.\nHumane: If an animal is labeled “humane”, it implies that the animals were treated with compassion. “Certified Humane” means that the animals were allowed to engage in their natural behaviors; raised with sufficient space where they were able to lie down, shelter and handled gently to limit stress; and given ample full fresh water and a healthy diet without added antibiotics or hormones. Not all “Humane” claims are regulated.\nNaturally-Grown/All-Natural: USDA guidelines state that all “natural” meat and poultry products can only undergo minimum processing and cannot contain artificial colors, artificial flavors, preservatives, or other artificial ingredients. The claim “natural” is otherwise unregulated.\nNo Added Hormones: the Food and Drug Administration’s regulations prohibit any use of hormones in pork and poultry. Therefore, all pork and poultry is eligible to be labeled with “Raised without Hormones”. However, if they use that label they must also have a statement that no hormones are used in the production of ANY pork or poultry as well. The USDA allows some meat products (including beef) to be labeled as “Raised without Hormones”, meaning that there were no extra hormones given. These animals come from process verified programs that are monitored by USDA so they allow that claim.\nRaised Without Antibiotics: Some 80 percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. are given to animals, to promote growth and/or prevent disease. “Raised Without Antibiotics” means no antibiotics of any kind were used in the raising of that animal. Producers send documentation to the USDA to support their claim, but there are no inspections. However, if the package also sports a USDA Process Verified seal, it means that USDA inspectors have made a visit to the farm to confirm that antibiotics were not used.\nIn conventional production, if an animal is given an antibiotic, farmers and processers must allow a specific amount of time to pass before that animal is legal to slaughter. This “withdrawal period” allows time for the animal’s body to metabolize the antibiotic and the residues to exit the animal’s system before it is harvested. USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) randomly samples animals and tissues at the time of slaughter to test for residues, to ensure a safe food supply.\nOTHER FOOD TERMS\nFood Access: consumer choices are likely to e influenced by the accessibility and affordability of food retailers, travel time to shopping, availability of healthy foods, and food prices. Price of food can be a barrier for low-income families.\nFood Aggregation/Distribution: The process of gathering local/regional food from farmers at a specific site and then trucking the food to buyers such as restaurants, grocery outlets, institutions, etc. See Food Hub.\nFood Hub: A centrally located facility with a business management structure facilitating the aggregation, storage, processing, distribution and/or marketing of locally/regionally produced food products. An also be coordinated through the internet.\nFood Security: USDA’s definition of food security is “access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.” Food security components, several different components, including food access, distribution of food, the stability of the food supply and the use of food. May be discussed in number of days of food supply.\nSNAP: Food stamps were renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP in 2008. A growing number of farmers markets are equipped with the technology to accept SNAP benefits through Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT). The EBT system authorizes the transfer of government SNAP benefits from a federal account to a retailer account to pay for fresh food.\nWIC FMNP: The Women, Infants and Children Farmers Market Nutrition Program provides coupons to eligible low-income women who are pregnant, breastfeeding and/or caring for children up to five years old who are found to be at nutritional risk. Coupons are used to buy fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs at farmers markets. Funding for the WIC FMNP is provided by the USDA Food and Nutritional Service to states, U.S. Territories and federally-recognized Indian Tribal governments.","Applying for food stamps can feel complicated enough. This is especially true when you don’t know exactly how it works. For instance, where can you use your food stamps?\nDoes Trader Joe’s accept EBT?\nKeep reading to find out!\nTrader Joe’s is named after its founder, Joe Coulombe. He developed the idea while on vacation in the Caribbean. He noticed that Americans were traveling more and were acquiring tastes that American supermarkets at the time could not do justice. Coulombe wanted to provide a unique experience and have different offerings compared to the local supermarket. Ever since 1967, Trader Joe’s has done exactly that.\nTheir buyers quite literally travel the world searching for products they believe will serve their customers sufficiently enough. Every product is submitted to a tasting panel process, in which every aspect of quality is investigated. If a product is assessed as an outstanding value, it becomes an item you will find at Trader Joe’s.\nAlongside finding items that won’t be at your typical supermarket, you will find prices that don’t either! Trader Joe’s believes every customer should have access to the best prices on the best products. They keep costs low by buying direct from their suppliers when possible, buy in volume, and more. But do they accept EBT as a form of payment? First, let’s go over exactly what EBT is.\nHow Do You Apply For EBT?\nSNAP is the short term for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This is the program in which EBT is a part of.\nTo get SNAP benefits, you must apply in the state in which you currently reside in. There are certain requirements that must be met, including resource and income limits which are updated annually.\nOnce you submit your application for benefits, your state agency or local SNAP office will send you a notice stating if you are or are not eligible for benefits. This usually takes place within 30 days.\nDuring the 30 days, you must complete an interview along with providing proof (verification) of the information in which you have given. The interview is usually held over the telephone but can be in-person. If you are eligible, you will receive benefits!\nYour funds will be dealt with on your issued EBT card. Benefits are automatically loaded into the account each month.\nEBT is short for Electronic Benefit Transfer. This form of assistance places your funds on a card similar to a debit or credit card. This card has a magnetic strip and this is how your funds are accessed. These transactions are processed in a way that is similar to Personal Identification Number debit card transactions. This is because you will also have to have a PIN that you enter when prompted. At establishments in which you can use your EBT card, you will simply swipe it at checkout.\nThis form of payment for welfare recipients has replaced the Food Stamp Program. You may be familiar with food stamps. This program issued paper coupons to welfare recipients. EBT made the process of using government assistance easier and more discreet for users.\nThere are certain items that can be purchased with your EBT and other items that cannot be. Similarly, there are certain establishments in which you can use your EBT and others that do not accept EBT.\nAll eligible items will be taken care of and the amount of money spent will be removed from your funds. If you are purchasing any noneligible items, you will have to pay the remaining balance separately.\nIt is important to be aware of the items you can and cannot purchase. EBT is meant strictly for food. In specific, food that is considered to be “Staple Food” meaning, you can use it to make a meal at home.\nSome eligible items are as follows:\n- Canned Goods\nThose are just a few examples of eligible items.\nSome noneligible items are as follows:\n- Beer, wine, liquor, or tobacco products\n- Vitamins, medicines, and supplements\n- Foods that are hot or previously prepared\n- Hygiene products\nThose are just a few examples of non-eligible items.\nWho Accepts EBT?\nGrocery stores are not required to accept EBT! In order for a store to accept benefits, the store must be approved. They must be authorized by the USDA to accept government assistance funds.\nThe store must meet certain criteria in order to get authorized. Specifically, they have to meet two. To qualify for the program, the store must offer products in at least two of the following categories: Meat, fish and poultry, dairy products, cereals, bread and grains, or fruits and vegetables. These are considered to be staple foods. Foods in which you can use to create a meal at home. For example, hot or previously prepared food does not count.\nA different criteria you could meet would be to receive 50% or more of your revenue from food sales. If you meet the specific criteria, you will receive a license in order to accept EBT. The license must be renewed every 5 years.\nOnce a store has been authorized, all employees of the grocery store must be trained within 30 days, on how benefits work. All employees at Trader Joe’s must be trained to process EBT payments because they happily accept it!\nYou can find a list of other establishments on the USDA Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nWho Doesn’t Accepts EBT?\nNot all establishments accept EBT. In order for a company to accept EBT, they must meet the criteria previously mentioned. Stores that do not accept this form of payment usually do so because they are unable to qualify. They do not meet any of the criteria and therefore cannot receive a license.\nFor instance, sometimes you will see a gas station that has a sign stating they can accept EBT. This is typically due to the fact that their sales percentage of staple foods is 50% of their revenue. It is important to remember though that you can only purchase food with your EBT card. The funds on your card will not cover the cost of your gas, only eligible food items.\nIn 1967 Joe Coulombe wanted to provide a unique experience and have different offerings compared to the local supermarket. Ever since the first store opened, Trader Joe’s has done exactly that.\nTrader Joe’s will happily accept EBT on all eligible items. You will be responsible for covering any remaining balance at checkout."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6fd05f23-0fff-426e-be67-956a10b00ab7>","<urn:uuid:4e5fb7b6-06b6-460b-87ce-011fa17485c7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the connection between quality assurance and production workflows in Business Central - how do test automation and manufacturing processes work together?","answer":"Business Central integrates testing and manufacturing through several key features. For quality assurance, it uses automated AL tests with Assert codeunit to validate functionality, ensuring code works correctly after any changes. These tests can verify specific parts of the manufacturing process. On the manufacturing side, the system provides production management tools including Bill of Materials (BOM) version management, capacity planning, and machine center monitoring that tracks productivity and scrap percentages. The system allows for both testing of manufacturing functionality and actual production management through features like production orders and material requirements planning.","context":["Like any other code, AL code can be flawed and break during refactoring. To prevent manual testing, each time you make the smallest change in code, it is necessary to write Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests. Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests are pivotal to ensure that your code works correctly after refactoring or addition of new functionality.\nIn this article, we are going to talk more about how you should structure your Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests instead of the code logic itself.\nIf you are using Docker as a platform where to hold databases meant for development, you will first need to import Testing toolkit. This is necessary so that you would have access to Assert codeunit. Assert codeunit is used to set conditions that check whether your code works as intended or not.\nFollow these steps to import Testing Toolkit to your container:\n- Open PowerShell.\n- Enter command “Import-TestToolkitToNavContainer <container name>”.\n- Restart container or generate symbols any other way.\n- Download new symbols to your AL solution.\nStart writing Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests\nNow you need to write all Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests in separate codeunit, and to be able to do that, you need to set codeunit’s subtype to Test.\nEach separate test needs to have an indication that it is a test. You can indicate that by adding [Test] attribute on top of procedure.\nThe rest of the codeunit follows the same structure as regular codeunit, except for Assert before the end of the procedure.\nNow you can declare Assert codeunit as a local or global variable.\nThis code, inside procedure, is used to set up the test itself. What goes into it depends on what exactly you are testing. In this example, the code check’s whether autofill code works correctly. It does that by initiating new entry, entering a value to “CodeField” field and activating OnValidate trigger. Then Assert checks if the field is not empty. The text “Field is empty” shows only if the test fails. This is the code bit that this test is testing:\nYou can also create procedures that are not tests in tests codeunit. Just simply don’t indicate that it is a test, therefore, I recommend to leave tests codeunits only for tests.\nRun Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests\nIn order to run Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests that you have written, you have to publish your application, then go to “Test Tool” page, upload all “Test” codeunits and run them from there. The easiest way to access this page is to configure your launch.json so that startup page would be 130401.\nWhen publishing your extension, you will be directed straight to the testing page, where you will need to upload all test codeunits. Complete this action by pressing Get test codeunits button:\nWhen uploading all codeunits, you can either run only selected ones or all of them at once.\nAs you can see, next to failed test there is text, which you write in Assert. Additionally, all the changes made to the database, for example, new entries created, are deleted after all tests are done.\nHow you should write Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests\nLet’s start with codeunits themselves. A good practice is to dedicate the whole codeunit to one part of your solution. You can split Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests to different codeunits by code functionality, making tests library easier understandable and maintainable.\nSo, let’s say your solution creates new entries and post’s reports, then you create two different codeunits, one to test the functionality of entries creation and second to test posting functionality.\nInside these codeunits, you create tests themselves. Each test name should have an informative name, meaning, it should talk for itself. For example, if this test checks if a solution actually creates a new empty entry, then the name of this test should look something like this CreateNewEmptyEntry_Test. Some names can get really long, but don’t worry about that, it’s better to have longer, more precise names rather than short ones.\nYour Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests have to be specific, it should only be testing a certain part of your code and nothing else. Also, it is important to mention that it is always better to test each part of the functionality. For example, let’s say we have a table with three fields and a function in codeunit, which creates a new entry and fills the fields with random data.\nWe need to make a test to check this functionality so we have to create a codeunit for this whole functionality. The first test is to check if entry is created at all.\nThen we need a test to check whether a value was added for the first field.\nFinally, it is important to write a test to check if values were filled in the other two fields.\nDivide your test solution to the smallest possible parts, it has to cover as much code as possible. It is recommended to write more than one unit test for each part of the code covering as many scenarios as possible. That way you not just stop possible bugs appearing after refactoring, but you may find bugs that you did not expect.\nYour Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests should be independent of any exterior programs or files. If it is not possible to avoid using an external file, try to find a way to create a dummy file inside the test and feed it as a real file to your solution. If your solution need’s to call for exterior services, create dummy services inside your test.\nIf you want your Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests to have the maximum efficiency, it’s a good idea to make many “hooks” to which your test could attach to. That way you could test a tiny part of a code, instead of running the whole program, just to test, whether or not a value was added to the field.\nHooks can be described as procedures that are global and can be called from a test itself. Another definition of hooks is extra procedures that call a procedure which you want to test.\nLet’s repeat the most vital steps for writing an efficient test:\n- Create codeunit for each functionality.\n- Name your unit tests meaningfully.\n- Divide your code functionality to smaller parts and test each part individually.\n- Make your solution code easily accessible for tests.\nAll in all, sticking to the steps mentioned above will help you to write codeunits with Dynamics 365 Business Central AL automated tests, that will last a lifetime for your solution. How can you tell that your test is good enough? If your test doesn’t need fixing each time you make a change and break when you make a mistake, you can tap yourself on a shoulder! Don’t forget, practice makes perfect, and if you don’t have time to practice enough, leave it to professionals. We are always ready to help with any type of Microsoft Dynamics NAV Upgrade / 365 Business Central Upgrade!","Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central offers a full set of business management capabilities. These include a wide range of features for manufacturing management. Manufacturers are increasingly finding the Dynamics cloud ERP solution to be an effective way to operate a manufacturing business while cutting the costs of running ERP on-premises.\nManufacturing Management at the Sales Stage\nSome of the most important work in managing a manufacturing operation occurs before any actual manufacturing takes place. Accurate sales forecasting leads to effective capacity planning, staffing, inventory ordering and more. Dynamics 365 Business Central’s Demand Forecasting allows manufacturing managers to predict manufacturing volumes based on sales forecasts from sales management functions in the broader system.\nA Sales and Inventory Forecast extension offers insights into potential sales as well as expectations of stock-outs. The toolset can look at historical sales data to offer stock recommendations and suggestions for replenishment. These features connect directly to purchase order generation and materials requirement planning in the solution.\nThe Bill of Materials and Production Orders\nDynamics 365 Business Central offers extensive features for creating a Production Bill of Materials (BOM). The BOM lists all the materials and other inputs needed to manufacture a product. The tool also provides for version management. This is useful because manufacturers often have multiple versions of BOMs in use. Managers can use the tool to generate Production Orders. These include instructions for manufacturing a particular order or batch. An Order Planning window gives managers visibility and the tools they need to plan for demand from sales forecasts.\nThe term “agile manufacturing” refers to tools, processes and training that enable a manufacturing organization to respond rapidly to market shifts and customer needs—while still maintaining quality and controlling costs. This is largely a matter of software. Dynamics 365 includes an Agile Manufacturing module that enables agile manufacturing by means of dynamic supply and capacity planning.\nSupply planning makes it possible to map out requirements for materials based on demand, working in tandem with master production scheduling. Dynamics allows for automatic production order and purchase order creation as well as messaging and other tools for balancing supply and demand. This includes reordering processes for internal and third-party materials orders.\nCapacity planning and finite loading round out the agile manufacturing capabilities of Dynamics 365 Business Central. Manufacturing managers can use the software to add work centers to the manufacturing operation. This feature also includes setting up routing for production orders and material requirements planning (MRP). The application provides visualizations of loads the tasks. Finite loading involves tracking capacity constraints on work centers to avoid overloading capacity.\nA Machine Center is a locus of manufacturing operations built around related pieces of equipment. Dynamics 365 enables managers to establish machine centers as part of the manufacturing capacity planning and production management processes. The tool lets managers see the functioning of machine centers at the individual level and with a consolidated view. With machine centers, it is possible to monitor manufacturing activity, collect information on productivity as well as scrap percentages, and so forth.\nManufacturing management can be challenging, especially as product development and marketing cycles accelerate. The right manufacturing management software can make a difference in terms of productivity and profitability of a manufacturing operation. Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central offers a comprehensive feature set for effective manufacturing management. For businesses exploring the potential of technology to improve manufacturing management, this software is worthy of strong consideration."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ce2775a9-32a6-41e6-8951-c79183f7a2ac>","<urn:uuid:6f4b76db-279d-453a-9aac-bb7b0b488ffe>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Please compare the historic role of MiG-29 and T-38 aircraft in relation to Cold War era military training - how were they different in their purpose?","answer":"The MiG-29 and T-38 served very different purposes during the Cold War era. The MiG-29 Fulcrum was developed as a frontline fighter aircraft in response to American fighters like the F-15 and F-16, serving with Soviet and Warsaw Pact air forces as a highly maneuverable dogfighter. In contrast, the T-38 Talon was primarily a training aircraft for the USAF, designed to give new pilots experience with supersonic flight after transitioning from the T-37. Interestingly, the T-38 was later used as a MiG-21 simulator in aggressor/adversary training until more capable F-5 airframes became available.","context":["Great Wall Hobbies 1/48 MiG-29 9-12 Fulcrum A (Late) Kit First Look\n|Date of Review||November 2012||Manufacturer||Great Wall Hobby|\n|Subject||MiG-29 9-12 Fulcrum A (Late)||Scale||1/48|\n|Kit Number||4811||Primary Media||Styrene/Photo-Etch|\n|Pros||Beautifully done model of this distinctive aircraft||Cons||Nothing noted|\n|Skill Level||Experienced||MSRP (USD)||$95.00|\nIn the late 1960s, the USAF started to develop a requirement for an advanced air superiority fighter based upon the lessons being learned in combat over Vietnam plus the growing threats posed by the MiG-23 and MiG-25. This program led to the F-15 Eagle followed closely by lightweight fighter program creating the F-16 Fighting Falcon.\nSoviet planners viewed these new fighter developments with concern and started the process for a counter-development leading to the Su-27 Flanker and its lightweight counterpart, the MiG-29 Fulcrum. Entering service in the mid-1980s, the MiG-29 is a highly maneuverable dogfighter with an impressive mix of air-to-air weapons.\nThe MiG-29 was in service with the Soviet Air Force, numerous Warsaw Pact air forces, and export versions were provided to a number of Soviet client nations around the world. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent dissolution of the former Warsaw Pact nations in 1991, many MiG-29s would become the frontline fighter of the new fledgling former Soviet states like the Ukraine. With the merger of East and West Germany, EGAF MiG-29s were suddenly a core part of the Luftwaffe. Some of these Luftwaffe MiG-29s have since taken part in Red Flag exercises at Nellis AFB and missile evaluation flights at Eglin AFB. While the MiG OKB has presented a variety of newer MiG-29 variants, many of these early MiG-29s remain on active duty around the world.\nGreat Wall Hobby is a kit manufacturer from China that has been producing a number of great subjects overlooked by other manufacturers. This latest release has been produced by several companies previously and until now, the best option for the MiG-29 was Eduard's boxing of the Academy kit bundled with a number of their aftermarket details. Despite the number of attempts at the MiG-29 from a number of companies, nobody has really captured the details of the aircraft - until now.\nThis kit represents an Izdelie (Article) 9-12 design which was the first production version of the aircraft and was probably produced in the greatest numbers. Identified by NATO as 'Fulcrum A', the 9-12 is in service with numerous air forces around the world. Izdelie 9-13 is distinguished by its humped dorsal spine and is identified by NATO as 'Fulcrum C'. The commonly seen two-seater is Izdelie 9-51 also known as the MiG-29UB and designated by NATO as Fulcrum 'B'. You've no-doubt seen Trumpeter's 1/32 MiG-29M (Izdelie 9-15) and MiG-29K (Izdelie 9-31).\nThis kit is molded in light gray gray and presented on 18 parts trees and represents some of the most advanced injection-molding I've seen to date. More on this shortly. Among the features and options in this kit:\n- Nicely detailed cockpit\n- Instrument panel populated with individual instrument face decals (NICE!)\n- Nice K-36DM ejection seat with photo-etch harness\n- Positionable canopy\n- Choice of open or closed auxiliary inlets\n- Choice of open or closed FOD cover intakes\n- Nice dorsal chaff/flare launchers\n- Two detailed RD-33 engines\n- Optional engine stand to display engine separately\n- Positionable speed brakes\n- Correct and positionable enlarged rudders\n- Positionable stabilators\n- Positionable ailerons\n- Positionable leading and trailing edge flaps\n- Positionable landing gear\nExternal stores include:\n- 2 x R-27R (AA-10 Alamo A)\n- 4 x R-73 (AA-11 Archer)\n- 2 x external underwing tanks\n- 1 x centerline fuel tank\nThe inboard pylons are plumbed for external tanks and are the only stations that are rated for the R-27, so you'll have to choose between fuel or missiles for your inboards.\nThis is the first kit that has captured the centerline tank correctly. On the full-scale aircraft, the only place that the MiG engineers could put an Auxiliary Power Unit was between the engines exhausting downward. The problem with this was that it would exhaust directly onto the external tank. The simple solution was to build an exhaust duct right through the middle of the tank and route the hot gasses out below the external tank and that is captured here. Verlinden was the first aftermarket company to fix this WAY back for the venerable Monogram 1/48 MiG-29 kit.\nOh yes, as for the most advanced molding I've seen, take a look at the weapons images that are in the black background above. Somehow Great Wall has managed to mold these missiles with all of the fins in place and even the bow-tie fins of the AA-10s! These look outstanding and thank you for not having to glue up all of those fins!\nA note on the antenna fit, the antennas provided in the kit represent the Soviet era avionics fit and lack the updated IFF antennas fitted before the end of the Soviet Union nor the updated antennas carried to operate in NATO airspace. These are easy enough to fabricate but check your references.\nMarkings are provided for three examples:\n- MiG-29, Bort 44, 1 AS/404 IAP/20 IAD, Orlovska AB, Far East Miltary District, Russian AF\n- MiG-29, Bort 91, 119 MIAD, Black Sea Fleet, Soviet Navy\n- MiG-29, Syrian AF\nPainting instructions are provided in the new Gunze Creos color standard. A nice set of airframe and weapons stencils are also provided.\nThis is clearly the nicest MiG-29 kit produced in any scale to date and I sincerely hope they'll do Izdelie 9-13 and other variants in our future.\nMy sincere thanks to Great Wall Hobbies for this review sample!","Sword 1/48 T-38A Talon Kit First Look\n|Date of Review||May 2008||Manufacturer||Sword|\n|Subject||Northrop T-38A Talon||Scale||1/48|\n|Kit Number||48004||Primary Media||Styrene/Resin|\n|Pros||First and only styrene kit of this subject in 1/48 scale||Cons||Challenging to assemble|\n|Skill Level||Experienced||MSRP (USD)||$OOP|\nThe T-38 Talon was a trainer variant of Northrop's project N-156 that developed a lightweight, low-cost, single-seat, supersonic interceptor. While the USAF was not very interested in the single-seat aircraft, they lacked a supersonic trainer in the 1950s. The venerable T-33 Shooting Star was the best jet trainer in the inventory and the Air Force recognized that they needed a trainer to bring pilots into the supersonic age.\nThe T-38 first flew in 1959 and would enter service in 1961. Production would run through 1972 with over 1,100 aircraft built. The T-38 was initially used primarily as a training aircraft, taking new pilots out of the T-37 and giving them experience with higher performance aircraft. The aircraft continues in this role today, with a number of them being updated to the T-38C configuration to provide pilots with the look and feel of contemporary service aircraft.\nThe T-38 would soon see another dimension in its capabilities, that of an aggressor/adversary aircraft. The Air Force and Navy used the T-38 as a MiG-21 simulator until more capable F-5 airframes could be obtained. Even after the T-38 completed its aggressor mission, a number of the aircraft were modified into the AT-38B configuration to provide 'fighter lead-in' training to teach new fighter pilots the essential skills of the mission at a significantly lower cost per hour than training on their assigned aircraft.\nAlmost 50 years after the T-38's first flight, the aircraft remains in service with the USAF with no replacements on the horizon. The T-38 also serves with NASA as a proficiency trainer and has provided flight training in a number of international air forces including Germany, Portugal, Taiwan, and Turkey.\nA number of years ago, Fujimi produced the T-38 Talon in '1/48 scale' but the kit actually scales out to 1/50. In addition, the airframe was really an F-5B, so until Sword released this kit, there has not been a styrene rendition of the Northrop workhorse in 1/48th.\nThe kit is molded in dark gray styrene and presented on two parts trees (actually 1 1/4 parts trees) plus a single tree of clear parts. A nice array of resin details accompany this kit which, on opening the box, makes this kit look really nice!\nUnfortunately, the reality of this kit is that it will require some good building skills as some of the parts, like the intakes, do not fit well onto the fuselage halves and will take some skill and bodywork to get everything just right.\nTake a look at those resin parts. If they look familiar, they should, many of them are out of the same patterns used in the Classic Airframes 1/48 F-5 series including the F-5B (review here). That is because same folks that produced this kit also produced the Classic Airframes F-5s (which also share some of the same fit challenges).\nMarkings are provided for two examples:\n- T-38A, 61-3263, Air Training Command\n- T-38A, 61-0836, TAC, Holloman AFB, NM\nThis kit is recommended to experienced builders who can work with resin and limited run styrene-based kits."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d67299c8-c6fe-4461-8a5d-3e3f674fb231>","<urn:uuid:8d1e6d2c-f096-4046-ac4c-05679f4cd2e0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What maintenance and protection requirements exist for both the drain field and leach trench components of septic systems? Please outline the key considerations for preserving their functionality.","answer":"For drain fields, the area must be kept free of structures, trees, shrubs, and swimming pools. Additionally, parking or driving over the drain field area must be avoided as this can cause irreversible damage requiring costly repairs. For leach trenches, they must maintain specific setbacks from property lines, buildings, pools, walls, wells, and easements. When multiple leach trenches are installed, they must be separated by a distance of at least two times the effective depth of the trench. Both systems require proper soil conditions for effective operation - the leach trench needs suitable soil for absorption and treatment, while the drain field relies on proper soil conditions for effluent filtration through gravel into the water table.","context":["What is a Trench Leach Field Septic System?\nSeptic leach trenches for disposal of septic tank effluent are one to three feet wide trenches that have up to four feet of aggregate rock with a perforated pipe installed down the middle of the trench on the top of the rock. The pipe is connected to the distribution box and the septic tank outlet pipe. Typically the aggregate rock filling the trench has a diameter of ¾ to 2-inches and has been washed to remove fines. The water leaving the septic tank drains to the perforated pipe in the trench where it leaks out the holes. It then is absorbed in the soil at the bottom and on the sides of the leach trench. Treatment of the septic tank effluent water also occurs in the soil as microbes grow and use the organics and nutrients. Physical filtering of the water also occurs in the soil.\nWhere can they be used?\nIn Arizona the state rules allow a leach trench system to be used after a septic tank when the site and soil do not have any limiting conditions. There must be at least four feet of suitable soil below the bottom of the leach trench.\nThis photo shows a narrow trench installed with observation pipes and filter fabric over the leach rock.\nSoil Testing and Site Investigation\nTo design a leach trench system, the first step is to have a soil and site investigation completed. The state rules require that the testing be conducted by a trained and certified inspector. Some counties require the investigator to be a registered professional engineer, geologist, or sanitarian. The testing including excavating three holes to a depth of 12 feet or to refusal if there is rock or cemented soil. The investigator will log the soil profile noting the structure, texture, and consistence of the soil. In some cases, such as an area with significant rock fragments, a percolation test with water will be conducted. They will use the data to determine the percolation rate and soil absorption rate or SAR. The percolation rate or soil characteristics are used to determine the Soil Absorption Rate or SAR using a table in the state rules. This is the volume of water that will soak into the soil each day in one square foot of sidewall of the leach trench.\nIf the SAR is faster than 1 inch in 1 minute as expected in an area with coarse sand, or gravel and cobbles, then it is too fast for a leach trench. Additional treatment of the waste water is required to clean the water to prevent it from contaminating groundwater . If the rate is slower than 1 inch in 60 minutes in clay soil, treatment will also be required.\nDesign and Sizing\nThe SAR is used by the designer to determine how much sidewall area is needed to absorb the effluent water that will drain from the new building. A trench is sized based on the effective depth and width. The effective depth is the depth from the bottom of the leach pipe to the bottom of the trench. The maximum effective depth allowed by the state rules is 4 feet. The area per foot is calculated by adding each sidewall plus the bottom. The design flow from the building is divided by the SAR to determine the area of soil disposal required. The area is divided by the area per foot of trench to calculate how long the leach trench will need to be for the volume of water. If the length required is more than 100 feet, two or more leach trenches will be required.\nTrenches must meet the normal setbacks from the property line, building, pool, wall, well, or easement. If there is more than one trench, they must be separated by a distance that is at least two times the effective depth of the trench.\nCase Study Example\nWe recently designed a trench septic system for a new house in Rio Verde, Arizona. The house will have three bedrooms and a design flow of 450 gallons per day based on the number of plumbing fixtures. The soil and site evaluation showed sandy loam soil below 14 inches which gives a SAR of 0.6 gallons per day per square foot. The trench will have a 4 foot effective depth and 2 foot width. This gives 10 square feet per foot of trench:\nArea of Trench = 2 (effective depth of 4 ft) + 2 ft wide = 10 ft per square foot\nThe area required for 450 gallons is 750 square feet:\nArea Required = 450 gallons/0.6 gal/day/sq ft = 750 sq ft\nThe required length of the trench is 75 feet:\nTrench Length Required = 750 sq ft/10 sq ft/ft = 75 ft\nWe designed the septic system to have two trenches, each 37.5 feet long, to fit the space available. The overall depth of the trenches will be 7 feet to allow for the depth of the plumbing under the house, the slope of the sewer pipe, and drop through the septic tank.","Important Septic Tank Pumping Information Homeowners Need to Know\nRoutine maintenance is essential to your septic system. A well maintained system will provide a safe and lawful means of waste disposal for your home’s plumbing system. Proper maintenance will also ensure a healthy and operational system for many years. The more informed you are as a septic system owner and the more familiar you are with the function of your septic system, the better you will be able to care for it.\nThe most common system in our area is a gravity fed conventional septic system. This system consists of three main parts:\nYour Septic Tank\nThis is where all liquid waste travels when it leaves your home via your plumbing system, which is the piping routed throughout your home’s walls and crawl space. These pipes tie into your main sewer line, which leads directly into your septic tank.\nSeptic tanks come in numerous sizes. The size of yours will depend upon the size of your home, i.e. the number of bedrooms in your home. Law requires proper tank sizes, check the VA state regulations if you have questions.\nAs the waste in your tank accumulates, it will begin to separate into three layers. The first or top layer is aptly named the scum layer or can also be known as the cake. This thick hardened layer consists of human waste, toilet tissue and other solid materials disposed of from your home. This scum, or cake floats on the middle layer, which is simply waste water known as the effluent. As the bacteria in your septic tank feed off the organic matter in the scum layer, the residual settles to the bottom of the tank, this creating the last layer, known as sludge.\nOver time the scum layer grows thicker and the sludge layer deepens. As this occurs the quantity of effluent lessons and becomes more contaminated with suspended solids. This is why septic tank pumping & cleaning on a regular and consistent basis is so important. If you are unsure of how long it has been since your last service, or whether you are do for service, please contact us for a septic tank inspection so we can inform you of your tank’s condition.\nYour Distribution Box\nWhen the effluent leaves your septic tank, it travels via gravity through a pipe and into your distribution box. This box is buried downhill from your septic tank. Your distribution box has several holes in it, where your drain field pipes are attached. The box evenly distributes the effluent to these pipes.\nYour Drain Field\nYour drain field is a maze of underground, perforated pipes, which are lying on gravel. The effluent travels through these pipes; escaping through the perforations and seeping down through the gravel, into the soil and eventually back into the water table. Your drain field is an intricate part of your septic system. Please note you must keep your drain field area free of structures, trees, shrubs, swimming pools etc. Also remember not to park on or drive over your drain field area, as this can cause irreversible damage, resulting in costly septic system repairs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e0087ca8-756e-4ca4-b20b-81f44c8f9d34>","<urn:uuid:c16e1c55-a9ab-41bf-904b-e8321de2cd7c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can someone explain how nitrous oxide works in dentistry and its role in environmental nitrogen cycling?","answer":"In dentistry, nitrous oxide works as a mild sedative that targets the nervous system, creating a calm, floaty feeling without fully putting patients to sleep. It's administered as a mix with oxygen through a nose mask, taking effect within minutes and allowing patients to remain conscious but relaxed during procedures. In terms of environmental nitrogen cycling, nitrous oxide is part of the process where atmospheric nitrogen is converted to different forms. When there's increased nitrogen deposition in ecosystems, particularly in semi-arid environments, soil microbes produce more nitrous oxide. Research has shown that nitrogen-amended soils, especially in interspace areas, show significantly higher nitrous oxide production compared to non-amended soils, even under various rainfall conditions.","context":["Are you dreading your visit to the dentist? That’s okay. Dental check-ups can be scary, even for adults. Maybe dentists’ offices make you nervous, or maybe you are just scared about the upcoming procedure, but no matter the problem, some nitrous oxide should fix your problem. And with how common the use of nitrous oxide in dentistry is, you can easily find a dentist to administer this sedative.\nNitrous oxide sedation in dentistry is a common practice. So, what is the difference between sedation and the use of nitrous oxide? To answer your question, the distinction here is in degree, not kind. Nitrous oxide is a sedative substance, differing from other anesthesia only in its mildness.\nFrom helping contain patient anxiety to reducing untoward movement during dental procedures, nitrous oxide is an invaluable sedative in the dental world. Its effective analgesic and anxiolytic properties are a mainstay in dentistry practices today. An American Dental Association survey reveals that 70% of dental practices that use sedation choose nitrous oxide sedation.\nWhat is nitrous oxide?\nNitrous oxide (N₂O) is simply the scientific name of the substance commonly known as laughing gas. Despite its name, this gas does not make you laugh. Instead, it works as a mild sedative by helping slow the body’s reactions- a necessity for anxious patients.\nThe result is a calm, floaty feeling, followed by either a tingling sensation or a heaviness in the limbs.\nSince N₂O affects the nervous system, it may even cause mild hallucinations. This effect, combined with the overall light-headedness, may make things seem “funnier” than they are, hence the name “laughing gas.”\nHow does nitrous oxide sedation work?\nMedical professionals use nitrous oxide as a mild anesthetic. It is particularly common in dentistry practices because it is not a strong sedative and thus does not fully put you to sleep. The purpose of this anesthetic is not to lull you to sleep but to make you relaxed enough to undergo a successful operation. This gas you breathe is a mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen. Before undergoing any procedures, your doctor will administer the gas through a mask placed over your nose. The effects of the sedative start to kick in after a few minutes.\nSince this substance targets the nervous system, you will suddenly feel euphoric and relaxed. During this period, you will not be asleep; rather, you will experience slowed reactions in your movement and speech. The gas helps you eliminate your nervousness and fear by making you less inhibited. You will be conscious enough to hear and obey all the instructions that the dentist gives you throughout the procedure.\nNausea is a common side effect of using nitrous oxide, and it may kick in as soon as the effects of the substance begin to fade. To avoid this, dentists administer pure oxygen to patients immediately upon removing the mask. Five minutes is the recommended time for the oxygen to clear the nitrous oxide from the lungs successfully.\nUse of nitrous oxide in dentistry\nAdopting appropriate work practices is important in using nitrous oxide in dentistry. Under the recommendation of the Council on Scientific Affairs and Council on Dental Practice, the following conditions are to be diligently maintained.\n- Administer 100% oxygen to the patient after using the substance as it helps wear off the dental nitrous oxide sedation and return alertness to the body.\n- Conduct semi-annual tests on staff to check exposure levels.\n- Advice patients to limit intake during administration by avoiding breathing through the mouth if possible.\n- Ensure the flow rate is correct and the mask gets properly fitted to the patient.\n- Inspect all components, including reservoir bags, tubes, masks, and connectors, for defects before the day begins.\n- In addition to this, the use of nitrous oxide in dentistry also includes the following.\n- People with low pain thresholds may obsessively worry about the pain even with minor oral procedures. In such cases, the doctor may administer nitrous oxide as anesthesia to help relax your nerves.\n- Since nitrous oxide is a conscious sedative, it is particularly well suited for long procedures. This gas helps keep the patients calm and sedated for long periods while still conscious enough to follow instructions and answer important questions.\n- People with a bad gag reflex and sensitive teeth will also benefit from this substance as it will keep them relaxed enough not to be nervous in the dentist’s chair.\nPros and cons of nitrous oxide sedation\nAs with most things, the advantages and disadvantages of nitrous oxide go hand in hand. On the one hand, this substance is a low-risk alternative to heavier sedatives for people with high blood pressure. But at the same time, it also has the potential to be a recreational drug among preteens. Proper usage can help relieve stress while misusing it can lead to a coma.\nIn light of these contrasts, here are the pros and cons of nitrous oxide sedation:\n- Nitrous oxide is a very mild anesthetic that even people with high BP or asthma can take.\n- The gas relaxes you by targeting the nervous system. This method suits patients who are nervous or uncooperative about their dental check-ups.\n- Nitrous oxide helps relieve pain and dulls the body’s reactions instead of putting you to sleep. This way, you remain conscious and aware during the procedure to interact with the medical professional.\n- Dental nitrous oxide sedation is useful in treating patients whose gag reflexes make dental work difficult.\n- Administering nitrous oxide to children may cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, irritation, and headaches.\n- Overexposure to laughing gas can cause anemia or a Vitamin B-12 deficiency.\n- This mode of sedation is not suited for people with mental health disorders or a history of substance abuse as it may exacerbate latent symptoms.\n- Patients with respiratory diseases should always check in with medical professionals before using nitrous oxide to avoid possible breathing difficulties.\nIs Nitrous Oxide Safe?\nUnlike many other anesthetics and sedatives, the effects of nitrous oxide are very short-lasting. Typically, the tingly, euphoric feeling lasts only as long as the substance continues to get supplied to the patient. Once the doctor removes the mask supplying the gas, the effects also soon fade away.\nSome patients may feel the lingering effects of the gas longer than most, but even these usually disappear quickly. This short-effect time of nitrous oxide is one of the reasons why it is usually safe to use. You have even less to worry about when a certified medical practitioner is in charge of the administration.\nHowever, as uncommon as it is, nitrous oxide can be dangerous in two main situations. The first case occurs when you have an unknown allergic reaction to the gas. In such scenarios, you should seek medical assistance immediately after experiencing symptoms like irritation in the eye, nose, and throat area.\nNitrous oxide can also pose a threat to your health when misused. To overdose on this substance, you need large amounts of gas; thus, this scenario is typically not possible in a routine medical check-up. Instead, overdosing occurs when people with access to large quantities of the substance decide to abuse it or use it recreationally.\nReliable Dental Nitrous Oxide Sedation\nFor all its benefits, the main concern when using nitrous oxide is responsibility. The substance is most effective when you find a medical professional to administer it with care. With the right team, you can even weather getting new dental crowns with minimum anxiety.\nIf you think laughing gas could be a good alternative to acupressure or stronger sedatives, you might benefit from contacting us for your next dental check-up.","Presentation on theme: \"Effects of variable rainfall and increased nitrogen deposition on nitrous oxide production in a semi-arid grassland ecosystem A forethought of global change.\"— Presentation transcript:\nEffects of variable rainfall and increased nitrogen deposition on nitrous oxide production in a semi-arid grassland ecosystem A forethought of global change\nGlobal Change … What is global climate change? “Global climate change can be defined as a considerable change from one climatic state to another, such as an increase in the Earth's temperature. An increase in the Earth's temperature may lead to changes in rainfall patterns, a rise in sea level, and a wide range of impacts on plants, wildlife, and humans.”\nVariable rainfall: Effects on Precipitation in the Southwestern United States El Nino: Wetter years are associated with El Nino (warm cycle) whereas drought is associated with La Nina (cold cycle) Heating of the atmosphere by global warming could increase the frequency and intensity of El Niño events, bringing more precipitation to the Southwest during winter months Summer Monsoon: Effects of climate change on the North American monsoon are poorly understood Likely to become more variable\nThe Importance of Nitrogen Earth’s atmosphere is ~78% N 2 Essential to many living organisms to produce amino acids, proteins and nucleic acids Necessary for photosynthesis and plant growth\nNitrogen Fixation and Cycling Atmospheric N enters ecosystems in 4 main ways: Biological fixation (free-living or symbiotic bacteria) Lightning Industrial fixation (fertilizers) Combustion of fossil fuels\nThe Nitrogen Cycle Process by which atmospheric N 2 is converted to ammonium (NH 4 ) or nitrates (NO 3 ) and ultimately back to N 2 gas and returned to the atmosphere.\nConsequences of Anthropogenic N Addition Ecosystems: N addition to soil can lead to changes that favor weeds over native plants, reducing species diversity Additional N in rivers, lakes and coastal systems stimulate blooms of algae that deplete O 2, killing fish and other organisms resulting in Eutrophication (Gulf of Mexico) “Elevated N deposition onto arid soils could return relatively more nitrogen to the atmosphere in the form of N 2 O- a contributor to atmospheric warming and ozone depletion”\nQuestion How do global change factors such as variable rainfall and increased nitrogen deposition affect ecosystem function in a semi-arid environment?\nHypothesis: Precipitation If rainfall events occur less frequently, there will be an initial rise in microbial activity followed by a rapid decrease because soils are water limited. If rainfall events occur more often, there will be an initial rise in soil microbial activity which will be sustained for a longer period of time due to higher water availability.\nHypothesis: Increased Nitrogen Semi arid ecosystems are also N limited… So if there is an increase in N deposition, there will be an increase in nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production and community respiration (CO 2 ) due to higher nutrient availability.\nExperimental Design Collection of top ~5 cm of soil from interspace (cyanobacterial crust) soil and from under canopy (rhizosphere) soils Removal of organic matter Incubation of 100 g of each soil type in 125 mL serum vials for 14 days\n3 Factoral Design: 12 treatment combinations Soil type: Canopy or Interspace Rainfall Variability: 1 x 180 mm 3 x 60 mm 6 x 30 mm Nitrogen addition: 2 g/m 2 ammonium-nitrate addition\nMethods Gas samples taken weekly with a gas-tight syringe and transferred to a pre- evacuated 5 ml vacutainer Samples were analyzed within one week of sampling to measure N 2 O and CO 2 on gas chromatographs\nResults!

{"question":"How do the tree species composition differ between the western Cascade Mountains and El Yunque National Forest?","answer":"The western Cascade Mountains are dominated by Douglas-fir, with understory species including western hemlock, bigleaf maple, and true firs. In contrast, El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico contains 225 native tree species, with 23 of these being endemic (found nowhere else in the world). While the Cascade forests are temperate, El Yunque is a tropical rainforest that maintains a constant temperature of 21 degrees Celsius year-round.","context":["You are here:\nMonitoring tree mortality in mature Douglas-fir forests: size and species matter\nCline, S., EHenry Lee, P. Beedlow, AND Ron Waschmann. Monitoring tree mortality in mature Douglas-fir forests: size and species matter. Ecological Society of America, Portland, OR, August 06 - 11, 2017.\nIn the Pacific Northwest (PNW), forested watersheds cover about 47% of the land area and are the source of over 80% of Oregon’s water. Recent evidence indicates that forests throughout the west are sensitive to temperature and drought stress, making them more vulnerable to disturbance, widespread accelerated tree mortality, and subsequent impacts on ecosystem services, including water quality and carbon sequestration. As part of an effort to evaluate biotic and abiotic factors influencing forest health and identify indicators of climate change in forested watersheds, tree mortality rate was measured on long-term monitoring plots established in the mid-1990s in mature (~100-400 years) Douglas-fir-dominated forests in the western Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. We address key information gaps and scientific uncertainties regarding the ability to predict tree growth and mortality in response to climate change and climate-mediated forest disturbances. This work is intended to improve forest resource management decisions. This work contributes to a deliverable under ACE/CIVA 2.4.\nBackground/Question/MethodsA regional increase in tree mortality rates associated with climate change will influence forest health and ecosystem services, including water quality and quantity. In recent decades, accelerated tree mortality has occurred in some, but not all, forest types of the western USA. At four long-term study sites, trees > 5 cm dbh were mapped and measured within < 1 ha plots located in mature (~100-400 years) Douglas-fir dominated forests along an elevation gradient in the western Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA: Falls Creek (530 m), Moose Mt. (658 m), Soapgrass (1190 m), and Toad Creek (1198 m). We report results from multiple forest health and mortality surveys conducted since the mid-1990s as part of an effort to evaluate biotic and abiotic factors influencing forest health and subsequent impacts on ecosystem services.Results/ConclusionOverall average annual mortality rates were < 1% (0.47-0.72), and were dominated by small understory tree death. Occasional dominant over-story tree death occurred through bole breakage or uprooting; predisposing factors were root, butt, or heart rot. At Moose Mt. tree mortality involved mostly bigleaf maple and at Falls Creek mostly seedlings and a few sapling western hemlock. At these two lower elevation sites, even though mortality rates of dominant Douglas-firs remained low, growth rates from tree-ring analyses showed a steady decline since ~1990, synchronous with increasing air temperatures measured locally. In the open understory at the mesic high-elevation site, Soapgrass, deaths of hemlock and silver fir saplings were infrequent, but included some larger silver firs. At the xeric high-elevation site, Toad Creek, mortality was higher than at other sites, but numerically deaths were still largely sapling true firs and hemlock while over-story tree fall from root rot opened some large canopy gaps. Thus, while we have not detected an overall increase in tree mortality rates at any site, we did find a differential mortality rate between Douglas-fir and late successional species: unlike Douglas-fir, the overall annual average mortality of smaller, shade-tolerant, understory trees exceeded 1% at all sites, and often included periodic rates of 2-3%. Nevertheless, Douglas-fir susceptibility to tree mortality at lower elevations is likely increasing as indicated by the multi-decadal declining growth rate trends in combination with rising regional temperature.","From Puerto Rico to Alaska, there are a number of rainforests located within the United States.

(© Ray Bulson/Alamy)\nWhen most people think of rainforests, they think of lush, tropical rainforests in places such as the Amazon or the Congo.\nBut did you know the United States has rainforests, too?\nRainforests are defined as areas with more than 200 centimeters of rainfall per year. While they only make up 6 percent of land around the world, they are teeming with life and home to more than half of the world’s plant and animal species.\nIn the United States, several regions experience this level of rainfall and have tropical or temperate rainforests because of it. Find out about four of these rainforests here.\nLocated in south-central Alaska, Chugach National Forest (above) surrounds a temperate rainforest running between the ocean and the glacial alpine zone.\nThe Chugach rainforest houses Sitka spruce and mountain and western hemlock trees, as well as moose, bears and bald eagles. More bald eagles live within Chugach National Forest than in the contiguous United States combined.\nThe Chugach National Forest also has glaciers, rivers and watersheds. Although it is roughly the size of the state of New Hampshire, only 145 kilometers of Forest Service roads run through it, making Chugach among the nation’s best protected forests.\nA bridge spans a stream at the edge of a pool on the Baño de Oro trail in El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico in March 2020.

El Yunque is home to 225 native tree species—23 of which are found nowhere else in the world—and 164 documented vertebrate species, such as the endangered Puerto Rican parrot.\nParts of El Yunque National Forest receive up to 6 meters of rainfall annually and stay at a balmy 21 degrees Celsius all year.\nMoss-covered cedar, hemlock, spruce and bigleaf maple trees are pictured in the Hoh Rain Forest September 15, 2021, near Forks, Washington.

{"question":"How did the architectural innovations of F.R. Khan compare to the 'form follows function' principle being challenged at the University of Chicago workshop?","answer":"The comparison reveals two contrasting approaches to architectural design. The University of Chicago workshop explored how new fabrication techniques and jamming systems might make form secondary, allowing materials to change shape and adapt without fixed forms. In contrast, F.R. Khan's innovations, while revolutionary, worked within the traditional relationship between form and function - he developed the 'bundled tube' system and other structural innovations that created efficient and beautiful forms specifically to serve the function of tall buildings. Khan believed in finding beauty in structural forms that were natural from an engineering perspective, letting the structural necessities guide the architectural expression, rather than pursuing completely formless or adaptive architecture.","context":["“Form follows function” is a catchphrase of architects and designers, but a workshop at the University of Chicago will evaluate whether new fabrication techniques and constructions of randomly aggregated particles may already be chipping away at the foundations of that stalwart concept.\nThe workshop, titled “Fluidity, Adaptability, Rigidity: Frontiers in Pure and Applied Jamming,” will meet Friday, Oct. 26 through Sunday, Oct. 28. Eighty participating architects, engineers, material scientists and physicists will meet for the workshop each day in a different, architecturally relevant building on the campuses of UChicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology: the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts (designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, 2012), 915 E. 60th St.; the Kersten Physics Teaching Center (Holabird & Root, 1985), 5720 S. Ellis Ave.; and the McCormick Tribune Student Center (REM Koolhaas/OMA, 2003), 3201 S. State St.\n“This is the wilder side of jamming that we are exploring,” said workshop co-organizer Heinrich Jaeger, the William J. Friedman & Alicia Townsend Professor in Physics at UChicago. \"Jamming\" refers to a field of study that deals with aggregates of randomly placed particles, including spheres or more complicated shapes, or even molecules.\nRegular window glass is an example of a jammed aggregate of molecules. Because of the geometric proximity of the molecules to one another, they are unable to move. “Even though the system might want to flow and change, it just can’t, like a traffic jam,” Jaeger said. Like window glass, jammed systems behave like solids, “but they are structurally more akin to a liquid, so they live some sort of schizophrenic life that way.”\nThe workshop grew out of shared interests in jamming among the co-organizers, including Sidney Nagel, the Stein-Freiler Distinguished Service Professor in Physics at UChicago, and Sean Keller, assistant professor of architecture at IIT. Their goal is to bring together their colleagues to discuss the properties of jammed systems and to assess their potential for designed applications, including formless ones.\nWhat constituted form originally sprang from the materials that would give the form its shape. But now three-dimensional printers — including one in Jaeger’s laboratory — can directly connect material with function. They can produce new types of materials that can take any form, or that can even change form.\n“In some sense we can make a connection between function and material now, and we don’t need the intermediary of form any more,” Jaeger said. “Form may become a secondary consideration in the end, because what looks like one thing now looks like another thing five minutes later.”\nJulian Rose and Garrett Ricciardi of formlessfinder, who have posted a manifesto about formless architecture on their website, will be among those discussing such ideas at the workshop in a session titled “Use/Less In/Efficiencies.”\nBut formlessness also has found a soft robotics application. This again relates to the “adaptability” reference in the workshop title, to the development of forms that adapt and change shape. A fingerless but dexterous robotic hand that Jaeger has developed in collaboration with Cornell University’s Hod Lipson and John Amend, and iRobot’s Erik Steltz and Annan Mozeika, does just that. Their concept was simple: make a robotic hand by inflating and deflating a latex balloon filled with coffee grounds.\nThe first version of the robot gripper could pick up a variety of multi-sized objects, pour a glass of water or write with a pen. The improved Universal Gripper could shoot miniature hoops, throw darks and bowl.\nLipson, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, will elaborate on this concept with his presentation on “Jamming Hands: From Grasping to Manipulation.” iRobot’s Erik Steltz will give a related talk on “Jamming-Enabled Soft Robotics.”\nPacking is another aspect of jammed systems that workshop participants will consider, one that is still poorly understood. It took mathematicians four centuries to figure out how to prove the maximum density of a regular, crystalline packing of spheres. For randomly packed spheres only computer estimates exist, and the general packing behavior of irregularly shaped objects remains an unsolved problem. “We don’t have any design criteria or process, really, where if we say we want a certain outcome, then we better start with a certain shape,” Jaeger said.\nThe workshop will conclude with a panel discussion of prominent architects. Panelists will include Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang Architects, whose work includes Chicago’s 82-story Aqua Tower; and James Carpenter of James Carpenter Design Associates Inc., whose work includes New York City’s 7 World Trade Center. Steve Wiesenthal, associate vice president of Facilities Services and University architect, will moderate the discussion.\nFor the full list of speakers and program details, see http://jamming.uchicago.edu/program_new.html.\nThe workshop is sponsored by the Institute for Molecular Engineering, Computation Institute, Arts | Science Initiative, Arete, the Office of the VP for Research and National Laboratories, and the Chicago Materials Research Center, all at UChicago.

It is painfully true in case of Dr. Fazlur Rahman Khan, the legendary Bangladesh-born structural engineer. His achievements are hailed by men of science all over the world, obituary references to him were made even in leading magazines like Time and Newsweek (perhaps the only Bangladeshi non-political personality to be so honoured), he was acclaimed the 'Construction Man of the Year' and accorded Alfred E. Lindau Award (considered to be the most precious award in the world of architecture), he headed the prestigious Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat for years (till the end of his days), and yet very few in our country are aware of his monumental contribution, world-wide fame and recognition. No organisation worth its name in Bangladesh even bother to pay tribute to this great son of the soil even on his birth or death anniversary. It very cruelly reminds us of Allama Iqbal's memorable utterance : Izzat use mili jo watanse nikal gaya,\nWoh ful dalimey chara jo chaman se nikal gaya\nFortune smiles on him who leaves the motherland, The flower that leaves the garden glimmers in the garland.\nF.R. Khan was an outstanding civil engineer who was hailed all over the globe for innovations in high-rise building construction, especially tubular design. He earned international fame for inventing the \"bundled tube\" system, a structural network consisting of narrow cylinders clustered together to form a thick tower, which minimised the amount of structural steel needed for high towers and eliminated the need for internal wind bracing (since the perimeter columns carry wind loadings). He was born in Dhaka on April 3, 1929 and obtained his Bachelor of Engineering degree from Shibpur Engineering College, University of Calcutta in 1950 at the top of his class. He worked as assistant engineer for the India Highway Department, and then taught at the University of Dhaka. Qualifying for a Fulbright scholarship in 1952, he enrolled at the University of Illinois in Urbana, where he completed enough credits for two Master of Science degrees, one in applied mechanics and the other in structural engineering. He obtained a doctorate in the latter and accepted an engineering position in Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, a leading and world-renowned architectural firm in Chicago.\nHe returned briefly to his native country (then East Pakistan) and won an important position as Executive Engineer of the Karachi Development Authority. After serving Karachi Development Authority for more than three years (between 1957 and 1960), he came to the painful realisation that the environment in the then Pakistan was in no way congenial to the blossoming of a budding creative genius like him. Although he loved the motherland with all his heart, he was pained to find that the administrative demands in the Karachi Development Authority kept him from design works. He found no way out but to return to the United States where his talent and creativity would have ample opportunities to blossom in their full majesty and splendour. In 1960, he joined Skidmore, Owings and Merrill once again and remained associated with it till his last breath. He shuffled off the mortal coil while on a job-site visit to Jeddah on March 27, 1982.\nIt was during the early 1960s that he laid the groundwork for his later successes in the field of high-rise buildings. This was a time when intense urbanisation was bringing in its wake a new wave of high-rise buildings. His 1964 ASCE paper on shear-wall-frame interaction was a milestone in the development of economical high-rise buildings in both concrete and steel. With the methodology developed in this paper, the stiffness of frame buildings could be increased several times, without an increase in cost.\nIn the same period, Dr. Khan also initiated the tubular design concept, with its first application in the 43-storey reinforced concrete Chestnut-Dewitt apartment building in Chicago in 1963.\nThe next innovation, pushing still further the economically feasible height of multistorey buildings, was the application of shear-wall-frame inter-action principles to tubular structures, creating the tube-in-concept (a pharase coined by Khan), applied first to the Brunswick Building in Chicago. This concept was soon applied to many other structures, including the 52-storey One Shell Plaza, in Houston, which was the tallest reinforced concrete building in the world at the time of its completion.\nAlso in the 60s, came Khan's first steel version of the tubular structure : the diagonally braced, 100-storey John Hancock Building in Chicago. It became another milestone, particularly due to the strong expression of its dominant structural feature in the architectural facade of the building.\nThen came the Sears Roebuck Tower in Chicago in 1974, using a further innovation -- bundling nine tubes into a single structural system -- with 110 stories and 1450ft. height. It was the world's tallest building in the 1980s. Like the John Hancock, it used about half the steel needed for a conventional tubular design.\nMore innovations followed under his direction, including composite buildings, combining the advantages of the rigidity of a concrete tubular structure and the speed of erection of steel slab systems and interior columns.\nA principal feature of Khan's work was to make highly efficient exterior tubular configurations to carry the lateral loads imposed on multistory buildings, rather than assigning this role to less efficient interior frames which clutter the rentable space, as had been common. The innovations introduced by Khan not only improved the rigidity of tall buildings, resulting in their superior performance, but also resulted in substantial economies over the cost of buildings designed, using traditional schemes.\nDr. Khan's startling innovations did not, however, go unchallenged. Skeptics and high-brows in many a circle criticised his innovative theories and questioned their feasibility. But the economy and effectiveness of his massive structures (among the world's tallest) silenced the critics once and for all. As a result, most of the ultra-high buildings today are built on principles introduced by him.\nF.R. Khan became the master builder of tall structure of the 60s and 70s. His buildings provided an economic answer to the needs of the day, utilising not only advanced technology but the art of engineering as well. Dr. Khan indeed was an architect with a difference. He believed that there is beauty and simplicity in the structural form of a building that is natural to it from an engineering point of view. Instead of going for a preconceived architectural expression, he let the natural structural form be the architectural representation of a building. He was encouraged and supported in this bold effort by Bruce Graham, a dominant architectural figure at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Khan and Graham jointly shaped the new skyline of many of the world's larger cities.\nKhan's influence on the architecture of high-rise buildings was acknowledged by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill with his admission, in the late 1960s, as a general partner in a firm that had heretofore only architect partners. Fazlur was later instrumental in the elevation of other structural and mechanical engineers to the status of partner.\nIn the non-high-rise category as well, a number of very remarkable projects were designed by Dr. Khan. Of these mention may be made of the suspension roof of the Baxter Laboratories buildings near Deerfield, Illinois, the Hajj Terminal of the King Abdul Aziz Airport (fabric suspension roof) in Jeddah, which covers an area of 105 acres; the fabric suspension roof of the Humphrey Memorial in Minneapolis; the University in Makkah; the US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs; and the engineering designs for the solar telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona.\nThe honours received by Fazlur Rahman Khan during his chequered life are too numerous to be mentioned here. In 1972, he was proclaimed \"Construction's Man of the Year\" by the Engineering News Record for his many accomplishments in the field of ultra high-rise buildings. In 1973, he was the recipient of the Alfred E Lindau Award for his \"outstanding contributions in advancing the art of reinforced concrete construction in high buildings\". He also received the Wason Medal for Most Meritorious Paper in 1971 for his publication, co-authored with Mark Fintel, on \"Shock-absorbing Soft Storey Concept for Multistorey Earthquake Structures.\" He was honoured with the coveted and prestigious post of the Chairman of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat right from its inception until his death. He was also a member of Committees 118, Use of Computers, and 442, Response of Concrete Buildings to Lateral Forces.\nF R Khan had always been both human and humane. Unlike the average run of engineers, he never found himself confined to the dull and stereotyped environment of cut and dried formulae and techniques. He began his professional career as a structural engineer and gradually developed into an engineer architect with a keen perception of aesthetics. Furthermore, his appreciation of the mechanical and electrical aspects of building design gave him an overview of the entire construction process. Even beyond his intimate understanding of the non-structural disciplines and aesthetics and his exceptional intuitive understanding of structural behaviour. Khan had a remarkable perception of the social needs of the millions who live and work in the cities. Engineering and architecture were the media through which he sought to fulfil the needs. In a way, he was a philosopher who defined the role of the architect engineer in society. In the ultimate analysis, it was the urge to respond to human needs and aspirations that enabled Dr. Khan to make the outstanding structures and innovations that brought him recognition and honour by society and profession.\nF R Khan was also an exceptional communicator very much at ease with all groups as well as large audiences. He had the remarkable ability to articulate complex concepts in simple, understandable language. In spite of the intense demand of his busy professional life, he found time to regularly teach courses at the Illinois Institute of Technology and supervise graduate students. With his untiring activities, remarkable achievements and pleasant but commanding personality he inspired countless young engineers and set a standard for them to measure up against.\nIn 1971, when the merciless military junta launched the most heinous atrocity on the innocent unarmed civilian population in Bangladesh, Dr. Khan, in spite of his heavy commitments and preoccupations, found enough time to organise the Bangalees and their friends in the United States into a Defence League which raised enormous funds for relief works. He also organised a strong lobby in Washington for months to urge the US authority to stop shipment of arms to the junta. No wonder, he was the founder-president of both the Bangladesh Foundation, which helped the grassroots non-government development projects, and the Bangladesh Association in the United States.\nThe enormous professional success did never affect the behaviour or the way of life of this great man. He remained humble, always accessible to his associates and friends, and continued his modest way of life. Never did he change his philosophy that people are the focal point of life. \"In social contacts,\" says his friend Mark-Fintel of Portland Cement Association, \"he was interesting, entertaining, and deeply and sincerely concerned with his friends, their families, their lives, joys, and sorrows. To him, friendship meant giving of himself, and that is why he had so many friends, and no enemies.\" This philosophy always remained the strongest motivation behind his actions, whether in professional or in personal life.\nSyed Asraf Ali is former D G of Islamic Foundation Bangladesh.\nSears Tower, Chicago; inset:F R Khan"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0555bc22-2239-4ef2-9a1c-86972ba35cbf>","<urn:uuid:790dfb3e-2b90-4c9c-89d9-4e1d7fbca707>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do fishermen prepare and maintain their fishing nets in Urur/Olcott Kuppam?","answer":"The fishing nets require a specific preparation process before use. First, rope is stitched on all sides of the nets. Then, thermacoal and pieces of copper are stitched alternately onto the ropes at specific gaps. After each day's fishing, the nets must be dried to prevent tearing. Daily maintenance is also required - when fish are removed along with shells and crabs, small tears can occur in the nets. These tears are repaired every day to ensure the nets are ready for the next day's fishing.","context":["Once we collected the data that the fishermen had created using the paper google images, which pertained to how they used their space in terms of their livelihood, socio-cultural activities as well as the lack in infrastructure in the Kuppam, we went back to our office and created rough maps (http://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/chennai/2011/07/13/community-mapping-at-ururolcott-kuppam-step-1%E2%80%A6-in-pictures/).\nThese rough maps were then taken back to the Kuppam and presented at a public meeting to see whether the community was happy with how it looked and whether they wanted it to be changed in any way (extend something here, shorten something there…etc).

Our ancestors are amongst the first residents of this area and fishing is our main occupation.\nRole of the Panchayat:\nThe symbol of our self-governance is our Panchayat and there are many roles that it plays. For example:\n- It is responsible for intervening and resolving family disputes\n- It is responsible for the health and well being of our community\n- It is responsible for maintaining our temple property\n- It is responsible for the inclusion of new fishermen into the fishermen cooperative\n- It is responsible for making sure that government measures and benefits reach the people efficiently.\nThe Urur Kuppam Panchayat has around 255 members while the Olcott Kuppam Panchayat is around 210 members strong.\nInfrastructure and Gaps Map- map 2\nThis map explains the existing infrastructure in our kuppam and highlights major problems that our community faces due to the lack of some basic and essential facilities. Following are the major infrastructure gaps in our community.\nThere is no playground in the Kuppam neighbourhood. The nearest playground is too far away, which is the corporation playground seen on the map. Because of this a lot of the times our children resort to playing in front of the local temple.\nThere is a functioning School, the Olcott school, run by the corporation. This School offers courses upto the 8th Std. However, from this year onwards, courses will be offered only upto the 5th std.\nThere is no bus stop near the Kuppam. The nearest stop is the Olcott Memorial School Bus Stop, which is on 3rd avenue. We feel this is quite far away.\nThere is no Community Hall/Self Help Group (SHG) Building. We want a space for community activities behind the Building reserved for the Anganwadi Mid-day meal scheme.\nThere are 3 public toilet facilities. However, only 2 of these are currently functioning. The toilet in front of the temple is non-functional.\nPDS Office (Ration shop):\nThere is no PDS shop in the Kuppam area. The nearest shop is in Besant Nagar.\nThere is a Government Hospital near the Besant Nagar Bus Depot. Doctors are available 6 days a week from 9 am to 2 pm. However, we also have to visit private hospitals like Santhosh Hospital and VHS Ho because the government hospital has inadequate services and closes early.\nWhile we have a fish auction area, we want a larger space to sell our daily catch. The current space reserved for the fish market is too small.\nFor a number of residents on the eastern side of the Kuppam (see map) the corporation has failed to provide a functional sewage connection. Becasue of this sewage from our homes collects on the beach and adversely affects our groundwater. It also is responsible for spreading disease.\nThere are not enough garbage dumpsters at the kuppam, which results in trash accumulating on the beach. Furthermore the Corporation of Chennai hardly comes to our area to collect this waste, which affects the cleanliness of the area. In 2010 after fighting with the Corporation they promised to provide waste disposal services more regularly. However, it did not last long and currently the corporation’s garbage trucks do not come into the Kuppam regularly to remove waste.\nSocio cultural Map- map 3\nThis map shows the socio-cultural activities of the residents of the Kuppam. It highlights the importance of the coastline for our community because it is this space that is mainly used for our recreation and cultural activities.\nWe have two main clubs at the Kuppam through which are responsible for organizing sporting tournaments. They are the Tiger Guys and Alexander.\nThere are two main festivals that we celebrate. They are-\nSri Elliaman Koil Festival:\nWe celebrate this festival during Adi Masam (July- August). It takes place on the 9th week of this season from Friday to Wednesday. Every evening during these 6 days we have different functions. Sunday is the day we carry our idol around the village. It is a festival that is comomn to both Kuppams and is our most important festival.\nDuring this festival we celebrate by conducting many activities for the children in our community such as Kolam competitions, running races and so on.\nLivelihood map- map 4\nWe are people who belong to the neithal (seashore) land. The sea and the regions around the sea form the basis of our life. This is why fishing forms only a part of why the coastline is important to us.\nThis map highlights the different uses, and areas of the of the coastline that is important in our day-to-day lives.\nArea used for Periya Vaalai (Shore Seine):\nIt is a really old tradition in our community. It involves not less than 30 fishermen at a time. It encourages the concept of collective fishing and is one of the main reasons for unity in our community. We use it only during the months of January to March. It is used to catch all kinds of fish.\nBajji Kadai (Vendor Stalls) Area:\nIt is one of our most important livelihoods. Our shops operate between 5 PM and 10 PM.\nShore and Estuarine Fishing Area (1):\nIt is a type of net used for shore fishing. We go from the shore to a particular distance into the sea with the net. We then cast it and come back to the shore and walk along the coast, dragging the net in the water to catch the fish.\nWe use baited hooks placed on a rope are cast from the sea shore and river banks to catch fish.\nNet Preparing & Drying Area:\nThough the nets are bought It needs to go through a process before it can be used in the sea. We first stitch rope on all sides of the nets. Then on the ropes in specific gaps we stitch thermacoal and pieces of copper alternately.\nAfter every days work we dry the nets to keep it safe. Because we use the nets everyday in the sea we cant leave it wet because it may tear.\nWhite Crab Catching Area:\nWe catch white crabs in this area.We use it to bring small worms and insects out from the shore which we catch and use as bait to catch bigger fish in the sea. The white crabs can also be sold or cooked and eaten by us.\nMadava Fish Catching Area:\nMadava fish is caught in the river banks and sea and is abundant throughout the year. It is caught mostly on the banks of the river but during the rainy season we catch it on the shore. However, because the river is polluted it is now available only at the estuary.\nPrawn Catching Area:\nWe catch prawns at the estuary, which we store in a box. This is then taken to the deep sea and used as bait to catch fish like Vanjuvam, Seela, Paavai, Vaval and Suuvai.\nKatamaram (Catamaran), Fibre Boat and Net Storing Area:\nCatamaran boats are our traditional boats. However they are difficult to operate in the deep sea. Some people still use them to fish. Fibre boats are the easiest way to fish and is fast and effecient.\nKattamaram (Catamaran) Fibre Boat and Net Repairing Area:\nWhen these boats need to get repaired, we build small a small hut and do our work. Also, everyday after fishing we need to tend the nets. This is because when the fish is taken out, along with the shells and crabs the nets tear. We repair these small tears everyday so that we can go for fishing the next day.\nShore and Estuarine Fishing Area (2):\nWe cast this kind of net from the shore when the tides are high in the river and sea. It is also used on a regular basis.\nThis is mainly used where the river meets the sea. It takes 4-5 people to work this net. One person watches for fish and when spotted the net is raised. It is used to catch prawns and crabs. It is also used all along the coastline\nFish Drying Area:\nFish like Kavali, Vali, Mathi and Sena Kenu are found in large quantities in the sea which we catch. The excess fish is dried so that it can be sold or used by us during the rainy season."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:38c8059e-a6c4-431a-8d79-eac35475c679>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cómo se refleja la influencia de Wirkkala en el vidrio italiano de los 50s, y qué impacto tuvo esto en el mercado americano de la época?","answer":"Wirkkala worked with the Italian glass manufacturer Venini from 1965-79, producing sought-after designs like the Bolle (Bubbles) bottles, which featured contrasting colors and became quite valuable (ranging from £300-1,200). During the 1950s, Italian glass became extremely popular in American homes, with vibrant colored decorative items becoming emblematic of the period's design aesthetic. This glass was among the most widely distributed examples of 1950s design in America, found in many homes in forms like candy dishes and decorative pieces. The bold colors and free-form shapes characteristic of both Wirkkala's work and Italian glass of the period represented a departure from the colorless geometry of the 1930s.","context":["Portrait of Tapio Wirkkala, Photograph Maaria Wirkkala, copyright Iittala\nMidCentury asks BBC 20th Century Expert Mark Hill for an insider view on Tapio Wirkkala from the auction salesroom.\nTapio Wirkkala: his design ethos and influence\nOne of the great Scandinavian Modernist designers, Tapio Wirkkala’s influence was felt far afield, and he worked in nearly every medium from glass to wood, and metal to paper. He was driven by a deep love for Finnish flora and fauna, and the natural landscape that contains it. The sub-zero temperatures, snow, ice and unforgiving winds shape the landscape and selected the species that would survive. For much of the year, Tapio Wirkkala would immerse himself in the isolated surroundings of his northern Lapland home. Tapio Wirkkala explained the design process as follows: “An idea is often generated by chance and the impulse proceeds from something quite different than the original purpose.”\nTapio Wirkkala worked as one of Iittala’s key glass designers from 1946-85. Winning three Grand Prix at the Milan Triennale in 1951 and again in 1954, his name became increasingly revered abroad, and as a result he was employed by foreign companies such as Rosenthal (1956-85) in Germany and Venini (1965-79) in Italy.\nTapio Wirkkala: value at auction today\nIittala footed dish engraved with fine vertical lines, 1960s-70s. All images courtesy of Miller’s, Quittenbaum, Dorotheum and Woolley & Wallis.\nTapio Wirkkala: early glassware\nTapio Wirkkala is best known globally for his glass designs, which were mainly produced by Finnish manufacturer Iittala. His early curving forms were often inspired by fungus and buds. The most famous of these, Kantarelli, have finely engraved vertical lines and were designed in 1946, winning a Grand Prix at the Milan Triennale in 1951. Made commercially from 1948-57, examples can fetch anything from £100-2,500 depending on size and shape. But if it’s one of the 100 ‘original’ examples from 1946-47, the price can rise to ten times that.\nOther designs, such as the mushroom-like Tatti can be found for as little as £80-1,000, depending on size. Value is also determined by how long a design was produced for and how many were made. For instance, Tatti was produced in large quantities from 1953-59, and the lichen-inspired Jäkalä, with its matt translucent surface, was sold in greater quantities from 1951-64.\nIittala Pinus (Pine) mould-blownvase with bark and ice type textures, 1973-99.\nTapio Wirkkala: textured glass\nAlong with fellow designer Timo Sarpaneva, Tapio Wirkkala was partly responsible for introducing the trend that went global in the late 1960s. Bark and ice were perhaps unsurprisingly the most typical and influential natural textures. In general, values tend to be lower, ranging from around £50-300 for Isbit (Ice) or Isberget (Iceberg) vases, or the bark-like Inari vase. The form number, typically engraved on the base with, ideally, the factory name and/or the designer’s full name or initials help with identification.\nPieces from Tapio Wirkkala’s most commercially successful design, the Ultima Thule tableware range, designed in 1968, can be had from around £20 upwards each brand new, depending on shape. Vintage pieces are better value – a table setting for 12, comprising bowls, plates, a carafe and the hallmark knobbly-bottomed glasses, fetched just over £340 in a Bukowski’s auction recently.\nVenini Bolle bottle, 1966\nTapio Wirkkala: geometric glassware\nAlthough less typical, Tapio Wirkkala produced clean-lined, almost geometric designs in vibrant colours by Iittala. Many go unrecognised and, as a result, fetch from £40-300, despite their wide visual appeal. Italian glass manufacturer Venini, for whom Tapio Wirkkala worked from 1965-79, produced some of his more sought-after designs, such as his Bolle (Bubbles) bottles. These come in red, purple or yellow contrasted against colourless, purple or blue glass. Produced from 1966 onwards, prices range from £300-1,200.\nAsko Oy veneered birch and lacquered steel coffee table, 1958\nTapio Wirkkala: furniture designs\nAlthough Tapio Wirkkala is best known for glass, his designs in other media often fetch higher sums of money at auction. During the late 1950s, he produced a number of functional furniture designs for Asko. A very scarce set of eight nickel chairs, that recall Jacobsen’s famed ‘Series 7’, fetched over £40,000 in 2012. Tables with basic geometric metal frames and rectangular wooden tops are more typical. These are either inset with curving, stylised leaf shapes in contrasting woods, or are cut from a wood with a heavy and accentuated linear grain. Although these could fetch a couple of hundred pounds a decade ago, their minimalist form and scarcity has made them desirable, and nowadays they fetch anything from £2,000-8,000 depending on size and the woods used.\nSoinne & Kni laminated birch plywood ‘Leaf Dish’, 1951\nTapio Wirkkala: wooden dishes\nIn a similar vein are a series of elegant laminated wooden dishes, produced during the 1950s by Soinne & Kni of Helsinki. Of asymmetric leaf-like form, they curve beautifully in three dimensions and, as such, are typical of the Scandinavian Modern aesthetic of the 1950s. They had fetched low to mid-thousands of pounds for many years, but a large 56cm long birch example designed in 1951 fetched a staggering €31,000 euro hammer price at Quittenbaum in 2012. This exceptional price was reached because the dish had been bought in Milan in 1954, the year in which the design won a major award at the Triennale. It seems to have been a unique peak, as sale results for similar pieces at Phillips in late 2012 ranged from £3,000-8,000.\nKultakeskus Oy silver pitcher with textured surface, late 1960s\nTapio Wirkkala: designs in silver\nThe value of the raw material undoubtedly has a major part to play in the desirability of Tapio Wirkkala’s silver works. These tend to take the form of stylised and simplified buds or flowers, frozen in time as they stretch upwards to open. Others have the texture more commonly seen on his glass designs, and those would become influential to many post-war British metal designers working at the Royal College of Art under Robert Goodden. Prices generally range from the low hundreds into the thousands, but small representative examples can still be found away from the major auction houses for under £500 – a bargain considering his name and the value of silver today.\nRosenthal Studio Line white porcelain large ‘Pollo’ vase, 1970\nTapio Wirkkala: ceramic designs\nTapio Wirkkala designed ceramics for Rosenthal almost as long as he designed glassware for Iittala, but in general his ceramics are deemed less desirable. It may be that the overtly functional nature and often palid appearance puts today’s buyers off, but in my opinion they may yet see rises. His charming Pollo (chicken) vase can be found for as little as £20 – mainly as they are still available new – and range up to £250 depending on size. Other vases and tableware, typically white bodies with textured surfaces, tend to fetch under £300 unless, as the rule goes, they were produced in tiny quantities or are unique.\nTapio Wirkkala: A common thread\nLooking across Tapio Wirkkala’s enormously varied body of work, there is one common thread: his feeling for a curving line. The curve may mark out the form of a silver candleholder or earring, it may be the laminated layers of a wooden dish, or the grain on a table, or it may be the cut lines on a glass vase. But it’s there, and always gently curving. As we know, Tapio Wirkkala was hugely inspired by nature – and at its root, there are no straight lines.\nTo buy a licensed piece of contemporary Tapio Wirkkala glassware, visit Iittala\nKeep an eye on dealers listed in our Directory – we’ve spotted Tapio Wirkkala pieces here before!","In the 1950s, the American home came alive with vibrant colored decorative items, abstract art, and “futuristic” designed furniture. The colorless geometry of the 1930s was out.\nOver the last decade, mid-century design has once again gained favor with interior decorators, magazines, shows, and stores dedicated solely to this period. The bold colors and free form shapes of mid century modern Italian glass are emblematic of 1950s design. This distinctive glass has become a sought after collectible.\nPrices realized at auction for 1950s glass have seen a resurgence. However, there are still many items available that are readily available and not always at a premium.\nItalian glass can be found in many American homes. In fact, it is likely that some of the familiar glass items you grew up with were produced in Italy. The candy dish on the coffee table with the bright colors, the ashtray with the gold flecks inside. Modern glass objects from Italy were among the most widely distributed examples of 1950s design. You might also have seen the glass clowns, birds and fish from Italy, popular souvenirs a few decades back.\nAs with any decorative art form, there are varying levels of achievement in the design and execution of glass from this period. Some pieces are clumsy and uninspired, some average, some good and some exceptional. While you should always buy what you love, as there is never a guarantee return on investment, buying the best representation of an item is wise. In considering modern Italian glass, several points make one piece stand above another.\nItaly has a centuries-old tradition of glassmaking, an industry whose center is the group of islands known as Murano, in the lagoon of Venice. The most recognized and desirable Italian glass comes from three companies: Seguso, Venini and Barovier & Toso.\nItaly offers a vast array of talented glass artists. In today’s market, top end collectors seem to favor Carlo Scarpa from Venini, Napoleone Martinuzzi (who worked at Venini from 1925-1932), and Dino Martens of Aureliano Toso. You can expect to pay several thousands of dollars for a fine piece by one of these artists.\nFor slimmer collecting budgets, good quality examples by other artists are available and more affordable. Alfredo Barbini and Fulvio Biaconi (for Venini) are two of them. While some of their work does command top dollar, many of their pieces are priced for the novice collector.\nA few mid-century designs can still be found that should prove to be “sleepers” in the near future. Look for Inciso vases by Venini, Aborigeni pieces by Barovier & Toso, and Soffiati examples by Giacomo Cappellin. Each of these designs are totally different from the other, yet all are reasonable in price on today’s market.\nCollectors should be aware that the most popular glass form is the vase, with glass sculpture following next in line. Popular sculptural forms include male or female nude figurals and pasta glass animals by Fulvio Biaconi.\nReproductions of the most famous forms of Italian glass are rampant. Some are marketed as such, while others are made to fool unsuspecting buyers. Also, and perhaps more confusing, many Italian glass designs are being produced to this day. The most common example of this is the Handkerchief vase. Originally produced by Piero Chiesa in 1937 for Fontana Arte, it was called the Paper Bag vase due to its crumpled shape. In the 1950s, Bianconi designed his own version for Venini. Since that time, generic manufacturers throughout Murano have produced countless unsigned imitations for the tourist trade. Almost all Venini handkerchief vases were signed, except for a few very valuable examples by Dino Martens.\nWhether from the original manufacturer or another firm, Murano glass now being reproduced includes Sommerso designs, Barbini glass aquariums and bowls along with Oriente designs. Venini lamps have also been reproduced. No doubt, there will be more reproductions to come.\nMurano Museum of Glass – Museo Vetrario\nMore from Antique Trader\nMORE RESOURCES FOR ANTIQUE COLLECTORS and DEALERS"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cc8382de-cbf9-4343-b9f9-e2bd0ce2dbf9>","<urn:uuid:88354cb4-81b9-4abd-a685-124d89c8f103>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were the primary model scales used in toy trains during the early 20th century, and how did King Kong's miniature models compare in terms of scale and construction techniques?","answer":"Early 20th century toy trains commonly used Standard Gauge (introduced by Lionel in 1906), as well as O scale, S scale and HO scale for model railways. For King Kong's creation, the models were built at much smaller scales - the main Kong puppets were 18-inch aluminum models covered with foam rubber, latex and rabbit fur, with a special 24-inch version for New York scenes. The film also used a 'life-sized' partial Kong consisting of just the head, neck and upper chest made of wood, cloth, rubber and bearskin, featuring 10-inch fangs and 12-inch eyeballs. The model required three men to operate its facial expressions and had to be moved between sets on a flatcar.","context":["74 relations: A. C.

Unemployment stood at 25%. More than 5,000 banks had failed. It was the year the Dust Bowl began, the times of “The Grapes of Wrath”. An estimated two million people were homeless… migrating across the United States in search of a way to sustain themselves. Soup lines stretched around the blocks.\nContrary to the popular myth, the movies were not ‘Depression-Proof’. They suffered a steep decline along with the rest of the economy. Ticket sales had soared after the 1927 introduction of “talkies” but peaked at 90 million tickets a week in 1930. By 1933, that number had declined by more than a third, to 50 million. Combined with the rollback in ticket prices, 1933 still marks the lowest year at the box office post 1929.\nBut that year, the country (and the world) would be given something to get excited over at the cinema. Something the likes of which audiences had never seen.\n“King Kong” co-directors Ernest B. Schoedsack (left) and Merian C. Cooper (right).\n“King Kong” was the brainchild of director/producer Merian C. Cooper. As a child, he received a book about Africa, and it filled his imagination with wonder about the fearsome creature called the Gorilla. It made him want to be an explorer when he grew up.\nHe got his wish when he and his partner Ernest B. Schoedsack traveled to Africa to shoot footage for their 1929 picture, “The Four Feathers”. It was there, while observing baboons in the wild that Cooper conceived of creating a movie about a gigantic primate squaring off against modern technology, with a “Beauty and the Beast” theme running through it. Cooper had a friend who worked for the Museum of Modern History in New York City, and who had brought two Komodo dragons to the zoo (unsuccessfully). Cooper began to imagine a giant ape being taken captive and brought to the city to be displayed…\nWith the story forming, Cooper pitched the idea to legendary film producer David O. Selznick. Selznick, who was at Paramount at the time, wasn’t interested. The depression was already underway, and the potential cost of location shoots were prohibitive. “Kong”, for the moment, was dead in the water.\nHowever, in 1931, when Selznick became the head of RKO pictures, he brought Cooper with him as his executive assistant. As part of the deal, Cooper had the freedom to make his own films. He began with “The Most Dangerous Game”, which required a giant jungle set being built. It also starred future Kong stars Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray. His friend and film partner (and future “Kong” co-director) Ernest Schoedsack was directing.\nAs part of his duties at RKO, Cooper was asked to evaluate a project whose budget had spun out of control, a film called “Creation”. “Creation” was the story of a group of shipwrecked people who discover dinosaurs on the island that they’re marooned on. Cooper had to recommend the production be scrapped (it was), but while he was analyzing the project, he watched several scenes of dinosaurs they had created using stop motion animation. “Kong”, which had initially been envisioned using footage of real animals, suddenly seemed a possibility again.\nStop motion wasn’t a new technology, “King Kong” was not the first to employ it.\nThe animation lead on “Creation” was Willis O’Brien… one of the pioneers of stop motion. By the time he worked on “Kong”, he had extensive stop motion experience.\nPrior to doing stop motion animation, O’Brien worked as both a sculptor and a cartoonist. He began experimenting with stop motion as a way of bringing sculptures to life. Thomas Edison (who was involved in film production and distribution in the early years of cinema) bought a film from him in 1917 entitled “The Dinosaur and the Missing Link” and also ordered a series of stop motion comedy shorts. In 1925 O’Brien and his crew did the dinosaur filled film “The Lost World”, based on the novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\nIt’s a technique that was widely used throughout the rest of the century, and is still occasionally used today (“Frankenweenie”, “ParaNorman”, 2012).\nNow that he had the method for creating his ape, and the jungle set from “The Most Dangerous Game”, Cooper realized he could make “Kong” much more affordably than when he first pitched it. He proposed creating two test scenes for the film to his RKO superiors. If successful, he’d roll them right into the movie to avoid wasting money. The RKO board approved going ahead with the test reels after seeing some production sketches.\nAfter the RKO board approved the production of a test reel, four Kong models were built. Two were jointed 18-inch aluminum covered with foam rubber, latex, and rabbit fur. One was a 24-inch model for the New York scenes, and a small model to take the fall off of the model of the Empire-State-Building. Kong’s facial features were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his expressions were controlled by wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During production the rubber skin would dry out quickly under the lights, making it necessary to replace it frequently and rebuild his facial features. This contributed to inconsistencies in Kong’s look throughout the film.\nThe dinosaurs were made in the same fashion as Kong. Several of the models were originally built for “Creation”.\nA “life-sized” bust of Kong’s head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin. It had 10-inch fangs and 12-inch eyeballs. In order to the control the mouth and facial expressions, it was filled with metal levers, hinges, and an air compressor. Three men were required to operate it. It needed bust to be moved from set to set on a flatcar. Two oversized hands were also made, and one giant foot.\nTwo scenes were shot. Kong shaking the sailors off the log and fighting the Allosaurus in the cave.\nThe RKO board was impressed. “Kong” was a go.\nRKO screenwriter and best-selling British mystery/adventure writer Edgar Wallace was hired to do the script, but died shortly after submitting the first draft. James A. Creelman, who worked for them on “The Most Dangerous Game” was brought in to complete the job, but his work was dissatisfactory. Eventually, Schoedsack’s wife Ruth Rose was called in to finish the script. She and Schoedsack had actually fallen in love on board a boat on an expedition, just like Darrow and Driscoll. She tightened things up and added some biographical touches to appeal to the directors, and the script was ready to go.\nFor the cast, Cooper and Schoedsack had a couple of their stars in-house already. Fay Wray was at the top of her game. In fact, she starred in 11 movies that year. Her love interest in the film, John Driscoll, was played by Bruce Cabot, an unknown at the time who started in pictures just a few years prior. Robert Armstrong (Denham) was an RKO contract player, and, like Wray, had starred for Cooper and Schoedsack in “The Most Dangerous Game”.\nBut in order to film the effects needed, “Kong” needed to utilize every effect in the book and invent some new ones.\nThe camera would be set up with a matte painting of jungle trees and vines, etc on glass in foreground. Then the miniature set, with layers of model trees and vines, where they miniatures would be posed, and finally, another matte at the back. In took an enormous commitment with the miniatures in order to get the film made. A single minute of film contains 1,440 frames of film. It’s estimated they could do 10 frames an hour, which would work out to just under 150 hours of work just to get 1 minute of film.\nBreakthroughs in composite photography were required, including an optical printer where they could stack different layers of filmed scenes. They also utilized rear screen projection… which wasn’t a new technology. In rear screen projection, a film is projected on a screen behind the actors, as the scene is shot, enabling a merging of special effects and live action elements. They also invented a front projection technology that could project a miniature film, one frame at a time, onto the miniature set as the stop motion work was being done, syncing the filmed elements to the stop motion puppetry.\nWillis O’Brien actually patented the devices he invented for King Kong under the name of “Apparatus for Producing Motion Pictures”.\nIn the story, an ambitious film producer, Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) brings an expedition crew and an unknown actress (Ann Darrow, played by Fay Wray) to an uncharted island in hopes of filming a native legend, the mysterious Kong. When they arrive at Skull Island, the natives are in the midst of a sacrificial ceremony, where they give one of their women over to be a bride for Kong. Spotting Ann, however, they wish to offer her (and her blonde hair and fair skin) to Kong instead. The crew refuses of course, but the islanders sneak out to the boat and kidnap her.\nShe then finds herself bound to stakes as an offering to the gigantic ape, Kong. Kong takes her into the woods, pursued by the crew of the boat, who have now discovered Ann missing. Kong protects Ann from several different prehistoric beasts, most famously from a T-Rex. Throughout that process, he develops an affection for her.\nAnd so, when captured and brought back to New York, the giant ape’s motivation is to capture Darrow and keep her safe. He breaks free from his bonds and follows her through the city, eventually grabbing her and leading her to the highest point he can find: The Empire State Building. It’s there that he’s attacked by bi-planes in a scene that has now become movie legend. Shot and bleeding, the giant beast eventually slumps and loses his grip, plummeting to his death on the city streets below.\nThe story of the modern watch of Kong isn’t how much the effects have aged, but in how well they’ve held up. The film was made 80 years ago, but the modern viewer can still watch, suspend their disbelief, and lose themselves in the movie.\nThe acting and the script don’t fare quite as well, admittedly. The misogynistic captain Driscoll chides Ann Darrow just for being a woman, then suddenly has a change of heart for no apparent reason and confesses his love for her. Denham is acted with the subtlety of a carnival barker, regardless of what the scene is. Kong gets a little rapey with Ann at one point. In fact, there are a number of moments that may surprise the modern, politically correct viewer.\nBut it’s still an incredible piece of movie history. A fascinating watch. It’s a fantastic adventure story, with the timeless beauty and the beast element running through it and an overarching theme of the modern society exploiting the natural world and primitive culture. And if nothing else, when you watch Kong and realize that he’s the great, great grandfather of all special effects, it’s impossible not to be impressed.\nThe studio closely guarded the special effects secrets. They even went so far as to disseminate misinformation, including the fact that Kong was actually a man in a suit. They didn’t want the fact that the towering Kong was in fact a puppet less than two feet tall.\nThey needn’t have worried. During its initial run, “King Kong” made an estimated $2 million, an enormous success, especially considering that the tickets were less than 50 cents and there was a depression on. The film turned a profit of $645,000. RKO turned a profit for the first time in its then 5 year history. Reviews were overwhelmingly positive, as well.\nIt didn’t receive a single Oscar nomination, though in fairness there wasn’t a visual effects category until 1938. However, time has remembered it fondly. “Kong” has become a film legend, and is cited today as one of the most classic films of all time.\nWhen AFI released their list of the top 100 American films of all time, “King Kong” placed at #43. Ten years later it stayed strong at #41 on the tenth anniversary edition. In 1991, the film was deemed “culturally, historically and aesthetically significant” by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n“King Kong” is one of the high water marks in early cinema, and has proved its endurance by still holding a place in pop culture 80 years after its release. It’s an important film to see in order to solidify ones knowledge of film history and pop culture, and still a very entertaining movie even after all this time.\nIt’s definitely a “Movie That Everyone Should See“."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d8e08d46-752d-444b-9a23-904b6506509d>","<urn:uuid:f2710449-e9b0-412c-bee6-ff47722829d6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the focus speeds of Contrast AF and Phase Detection AF systems compare, and what factors contribute to their performance differences?","answer":"Phase Detection AF (PDAF) is significantly faster than Contrast AF (CAF) due to their fundamental operational differences. PDAF uses a rangefinder-like system that measures distance directly and requires only one small lens adjustment to achieve focus. In contrast, CAF must sweep through the entire focal range to find maximum contrast, making multiple lens movements before achieving focus. PDAF is also better at tracking moving objects since it can identify the subject and predict its location. However, both systems have limitations in low-light conditions, though PDAF generally performs better overall due to its more sophisticated distance measurement capabilities.","context":["Tech Update: Evolution And Revolution In Focus Control: Accuracy, Speed And Spontaneity\nGiven that the physical and perceptual experience of making a photograph is shaped by technology, and that technology is also embedded in the resulting images, one of the chief and perhaps most profound changes in how we make an image has been the changes in focusing—and recently autofocusing—technology. There’s a reason that the documentary photojournalism of Lewis W. Hine (shot with a ponderous 5x7 view camera or a 4x5 Graflex SLR) has a qualitatively different feel from that of Alfred Eisenstaedt or Henri Cartier-Bresson (shot with pocket-sized 35mm rangefinder cameras). It’s not only framing—it’s responsiveness, spontaneity, and, perhaps, repose, that underlies what these image-makers showed us.\nUntil the dawn of the digital era, the evolution of focusing systems in cameras was a running dialogue between two fundamental camera types—the view camera, which presents the image formed by the lens on a ground-glass screen used for viewing, composing, and focusing, and the viewfinder camera, which employs a separate, direct vision optical or wire frame finder for viewing the subject and composing the image, and uses a separate system, a rangefinder or manual focusing scale, for focusing the lens.\nOver the course of time, the view camera evolved into the eye-level SLR that presents the laterally and vertically correct viewing image projected by the lens onto a textured viewing screen to the photographer’s eye. The viewfinder camera evolved along a parallel track, from the humble tiny reflex finders and wire frame aiming devices affixed to countless box and folding cameras to the glorious coupled range/viewfinder with projected, parallax-compensating viewfinder frame lines epitomized by the Leica M3 and its successors. Some cameras (e.g., the Speed Graphic and some Alpa 35mm SLRs) were hybrids that provided both these viewing and focusing options.\n“Before 1995, most digital cameras did not have Live View, and although this feature was rapidly adopted in point-and-shoot cameras, it was more than a decade before Live View appeared in higher-end D-SLRs…”\nEnter The AF Era\nThe first successful AF system in the world for cameras was the Leitz (Leica) Correfot shown at photokina in 1976. It was basically a “proof of concept” design that used a delicate “vibrating frame” to enhance focusing precision, had the camera connected by cable to a bulky computer to avoid the considerable expense of developing a dedicated IC chip to process the AF signals, and read out the correct focus point via LEDs rather than physically focusing the lens. Although it was never fully developed into a production camera, the Correfot pioneered many of the features built into the Phase-Detection Autofocus (PDAF) systems found in today’s D-SLRs. These include a sub-mirror that directs part of the incoming light to a PDAF line sensor (CCD) in the bottom of the camera, and a beam splitter that divides the incoming light into a pair of images and compares their light intensity patterns (peaks and valleys) electronically.\nThe PDAF systems built into the world’s first AF still camera, the Konica C35AF of 1977, and the first fully integrated AF SLR, the Minolta Maxxum 7000 of 1985, rely on the same basic concept. Essentially, it’s a simple electronic rangefinder with a base length determined by the diameter of the lens. By calculating the “separation error” between the two images on the line sensor, the system can immediately determine whether the object is in front of or beyond the point of optimum focus, and move the lens in the proper direction until the two images are “in phase,” at which point proper focus is achieved.\nThe important thing to bear in mind is that traditional PDAF in film SLRs and D-SLRs uses a system that is separate from the viewing image or the image captured by the sensor to determine the distance to the subject. The fact that PDAF identifies the subject as part of the AF process is why it is inherently faster than Contrast AF (CAF) systems that focus the camera by maximizing the contrast of the on-sensor image. It’s also why all focus-tracking systems in use rely on PDAF rather than CAF.\nWith steady advances in design, such as multiple cross-pattern AF sensors providing multiple AF points that are sensitive to subjects with horizontal, vertical, or oblique line patterns, vastly improved performance (especially in low light and with low-contrast subjects) due to wider area coverage, impressive increases in the sensitivity of today’s AF sensors, and amazing upgrades in the speed, torque, responsiveness, and quietness of AF motors, the PDAF systems in D-SLRs have elevated the picture-taking experience for millions of photographers worldwide.\nBy automating one of the key picture-taking parameters, it has had the effect of prioritizing timing and composition, and enhancing overall speed, responsiveness, and precision, giving shooters a better shot at capturing decisive moments. Even at its present advanced state, however, AF is not a panacea, which is why all D-SLRs and Compact System Cameras offer Manual Focus (MF) mode. It’s still not perfect, but autofocus, particularly PDAF, has certainly transformed the experience of making pictures.\nLive View And Contrast-Detection AF (CAF)\nOne of the most important turns in the autofocusing road occurred in 1995 with the advent of Live View (a.k.a. Live Preview) in the Casio QV-10 and Ricoh RDC-1. The concept, derived from TV video cameras, is essentially to take a continuous live feed directly off the camera’s image sensor and display the image directly, either on the camera’s Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and/or in its Electronic Viewfinder (EVF). Since the Live View image is formed by the camera lens, defined (“framed”) by the sensor’s dimensions, and completely free of parallax error, it is the functional equivalent of the image you see when you look through the viewfinder of an SLR.\nHowever, it took camera designers quite a while to realize the full potential of this similarity. Before 1995, most digital cameras did not have Live View, and although this feature was rapidly adopted in point-and-shoot cameras, it was more than a decade before Live View appeared in higher-end D-SLRs (as an alternative mirror-up option to the OVF), and even longer before it became the technological centerpiece of a new generation of mirrorless Compact System Cameras (CSC) with interchangeable lenses, vastly upgraded EVFs, and OLED monitors.\nIndeed, most early Live View systems had serious limitations, and the first general-use D-SLRs to provide Live View for both exposure simulated preview and framing preview were the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III and the EOS 40D of 2007. The most sophisticated type of Live View displays the exact look of the exposure electronically and allows the photographer to alter the exposure in real time by adjusting the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO before the photograph is taken.\nLive View And CAF\nLive View is practically synonymous with Contrast Detection (CAF). It’s the AF system used in all true D-SLRs when shooting video, and the one used in most CSCs. CAF is achieved by measuring the contrast within the Live View image projected by the lens onto the image sensor in real time. The intensity difference between adjacent pixels in the area being focused on increases as the lens approaches the correct focus point, and when maximum contrast is detected, the optimum focus is achieved. Note that this AF system, while commendably precise, does not have any independent method of calculating the subject distance or identifying the subject, because it does not use a separate sensor like PDAF. However, CAF, which is based on software implementation, can be more flexible and potentially more accurate than PDAF. However, it is inherently slower, and it cannot identify a subject and predict where it will be when the shutter fires, so Predictive AF and Focus Tracking options are off the table.\n“Live View is practically synonymous with Contrast Detection (CAF). It’s the AF system used in all true D-SLRs when shooting video, and the one used in most CSCs.”\nEmerging AF Tech\nThe hottest new trend in AF is hybrid CAF/PDAF systems that incorporate dual-purpose phase-detection/image capture pixels in the CMOS image sensor itself. This emerging technology promises not only faster, more decisive autofocusing in mirrorless Compact System Cameras, but also the ability to provide Continuous AF and Focus Tracking before and during the exposure with D-SLRs, which is crucial when shooting at high burst rates or capturing HD video. While today’s best Contrast AF systems have been tweaked to provide much improved speed and performance, on-sensor PDAF looks to be the next really big thing in the inexorable advance of autofocus technology.","Autofocus: Contrast, Phase or Laser\nMobile devices use three main types of autofocus (AF): contrast detect autofocus (CDAF), phase detect autofocus (PDAF), and laser autofocus. Contrast detection is the most common method employed due to its lower cost. Like its name implies, this AF method measures the difference in light intensity or contrast between adjacent pixels. The image is in focus when the contrast is maximized. Because this method has no way of measuring the distance between the camera and subject, the lens needs to sweep through the entire focal range to find the point with maximum contrast and then move back to that position. This motion is obvious when looking at the preview screen and watching the image move from blurry to sharp to blurry and back to sharp. All of this excess lens motion makes contrast AF rather slow. It also does not work well in low-light conditions.\nPhase detect AF is widely used in expensive hand-held cameras, and it’s now making its way to mobile devices as well. PDAF is a passive system like CDAF, but it’s capable of actually measuring distance. It works in a manner similar to an optical rangefinder. Incoming light is refracted by microlenses and the resulting images are superimposed on the AF sensor. If the object is too close or too far, the light rays will be out of phase. By measuring the distance between light intensity peaks, along with the known geometry of the camera, the image signal processor (ISP) determines the precise location of the lens to bring the image into focus. Because the lens only makes one small adjustment, rather than sweeping through the full focal range, PDAF is significantly faster than the contrast method and is better suited for tracking moving objects. The downside is PDAF costs more to implement and still has difficulty in low-light conditions.\n[CREDIT: Cmglee (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) Modified by Tom’s Hardware]\nLaser AF, used in LG’s G3 and G4 smartphones, is an active time-of-flight system where an infrared laser beam is projected from the phone, reflects off an object, and is captured by the phone’s sensor. Since the speed of light is known, the distance is calculated based on the time between when the beam is emitted and detected. The speed and accuracy of this method is comparable to PDAF, with the additional benefit of working well in low-light situations. Laser AF has its own pitfalls, however. It cannot see through glass, it gets confused by absorbent or reflective surfaces, and it has trouble outdoors where long distances and high levels of background IR nullify the laser. In these cases, the camera falls back to the contrast AF method.\nHybrid AF systems are also possible, combining two or more different methods to deliver quick and accurate performance in all conditions. Combining a Laser AF system with PDAF is an obvious choice which would deliver quick performance in all lighting conditions, indoors or out. The only limitations on hybrid AF systems are cost and ISP performance.\nHDR: High Dynamic Range\nThe human eye perceives brightness in a nonlinear way according to a gamma or power function; we are more sensitive to changes in dark tones than light ones. This gives our visual system a higher dynamic range and helps keep us from being blinded by bright sunlight outdoors. A CMOS camera sensor, however, records light linearly (one incident photon produces one electron in the well), restricting its total dynamic range (the difference between the darkest and brightest luminance values that produce a change in voltage in the pixel) to the pixel’s full-well capacity. The shutter speed used by the camera also impacts the captured image’s dynamic range. A slow shutter speed allows more light to enter the lens, brightening up dark areas but overexposing lighter areas like a brightly lit sky. Conversely, a fast shutter might get the exposure correct for the sky, but leave the areas in shadow far too dark.\nThere are several ways to extend a CMOS sensor’s dynamic range, including larger full-well capacities (larger pixels) and decreasing the noise floor. Neither of these solutions are practical, however, since the industry is moving to ever smaller pixels. Instead, cameras are using multiple exposures and post-processing to generate high dynamic range (HDR) images. The simplest approach is exposure bracketing, where two or more separate images are captured, one underexposed to capture the detail of the brighter regions and another overexposed to capture the detail in the shadowed regions. These images are then combined and filtered with software algorithms to create the final HDR image. If the exposure time for each pixel can be controlled individually, then the camera does not need to capture multiple full-frame exposures. This technique increases the speed of HDR capture by monitoring each individual pixel, performing a conditional reset if the pixel is close to saturation. This does increase cost, however, because additional local memory is required to store the exposure time for each pixel.\nThe benefit of using the exposure bracketing technique is that all of the magic happens in software and does not require any modification at the pixel level, unlike solutions that use a lateral overflow integration capacitor and multiple photodiodes with different sensitivities. One drawback, however, is the need to read and process several exposures quickly, requiring high bandwidth from the image sensor and more processing power from the ISP/DSP. If the HDR process is too slow, image capture time increases which the user perceives as camera lag. Also, motion—either from camera movement or from movement of objects within the scene—can create ghosting artifacts if the time between frame captures is too long.\nCombining multiple images in post-processing can lead to additional artifacts. To better match the dynamic range of the HDR image to the contrast ratio of common displays, a tone-mapping algorithm is used. A linear transformation algorithm reduces the contrast of the image everywhere without regard for objects or already low contrast zones within the scene, resulting in a washed-out image. This technique is commonly used in less expensive devices because of its simplicity and lower processing requirement.\nMore sophisticated techniques analyze the content of the image and adapt the tone mapping algorithm to better preserve local details. One method uses a low-pass Gaussian filter to blur the image, subtract the result from the original image, and then recombine this with a globally tone mapped version. While this method produces a more natural looking image, it can cause halos or purple fringes to appear along edges in high contrast zones (dark object against a bright background or vice versa). Avoiding edge artifacts requires additional edge detection algorithms to break the scene into different zones to be filtered independently, which requires additional computing power.\nEIS & OIS: Image Stabilization\nThe goal of both electronic image stabilization (EIS) and optical image stabilization (OIS) is to improve the sharpness of an image by reducing blur caused by the motion of the camera. EIS is a software post-processing technique applied to video which shifts individual frames, using the extra pixels beyond the visible border of the video (most image sensors contain more pixels than necessary to record 1080p or 4K video). There are also post-processing techniques, separate from EIS, for reducing blur caused by moving objects (not the camera) which work with both still images and video.\nWhere EIS is entirely software based, OIS is a hardware feature. Using gyroscopes, the camera senses its movement and uses an actuator in the camera module to adjust either the lens stack or the camera sensor to compensate and keep the light path steady. OIS can be used for video, but its best application is for shooting still images in low light, where longer exposures increase motion blur.\nAWB: Automatic White Balance\nOne of the interesting features of the human visual system, dubbed color constancy, allows the color of objects to remain relatively constant, even when viewed under different light sources. Unfortunately, a camera’s image sensor does not have this ability. In order for the sensor to capture color accurately, the camera needs to adjust its white balance to account for the color temperature of light within a scene. Put another way, the camera needs to know what a white object looks like under a particular light source. For example, a white sheet of paper lit by an incandescent bulb with a color temperature of 2700 K will appear a yellowish orange. The same sheet of white paper lit by an LED bulb will take on a bluish tint. Since color temperatures below 6500 K, the color temperature of sunlight on an overcast day, tend to have more red content, we describe them as being “warm.” Color temperatures above 6500 K skew towards blue, so we describe them as being “cool.” If the camera sets white balance incorrectly, images will have an unnatural color tint which skews the hues of other colors in the image.\nMost cameras will have white balance presets, usually labeled with pictograms of a fluorescent light, incandescent light, sun, clouds, etc., which roughly correspond to the color temperature of light under those conditions. Some cameras may allow you to set the white balance manually, providing greater flexibility. Since most of us do not want or need to be bothered by this, cameras also come with an automatic white balance (AWB) adjustment feature.\nThere are several different AWB algorithms but most fall into two categories: global and local. Global algorithms, such as the gray world and white patch methods, use all of an image’s pixels for color temperature estimation. Local algorithms use only a subset of pixels based on predefined selection rules (like a human face) for this task. Hybrid methods are also used, either selecting the best algorithm based on image content or using one or more methods simultaneously.\nWe have yet to find an algorithm that works as well as our visual system, however. Global AWB algorithms have trouble with images showing little color variation, a picture of a blue ocean with a blue sky, for example. Local AWB algorithms break down if the image does not contain any objects that meet its selection criteria or that contain a lot of noise. Regardless of which method is employed, having a white or neutral colored object in the scene will help the camera’s AWB select the appropriate value. If all else fails, you can usually correct the white balance with image editing software, especially when using the RAW image format."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:71e4c200-1da8-468c-a361-0e5911084c8d>","<urn:uuid:456db79e-8da4-4400-b347-6cd4402b0628>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Comparing Lance Armstrong's and Ken Caminiti's personal struggles, how did their battles with health issues affect their legacies in their respective sports?","answer":"Both athletes faced severe health challenges but with different outcomes. Armstrong survived stage four testicular cancer with a 40% survival rate and remarkably returned to win the Tour de France, initially becoming an inspirational figure. Caminiti, however, struggled with ongoing substance abuse and inner trauma, which ultimately contributed to his death from an overdose in October 2004. While Armstrong's legacy was later tarnished by doping revelations, Caminiti's honesty about steroid use in baseball, despite his personal demons, helped bring about important changes in the sport.","context":["Playing Through the Pain\nKen Caminiti and the Steroids Confession That Changed Baseball Forever\nAlso available from:\n- Additional formats:\n- Publication Date: May 31, 2022\n- Imprint: Abrams Press\n- Trim Size: 6 x 9\n- ISBN: 9781419753633\n- Page Count: 384\n- Rights: World/All\nThe powerful story of Ken Caminiti, who changed baseball forever as the first player to confess to having used performance-enhancing steroids\nIn Playing Through the Pain: Ken Caminiti and the Steroids Confession That Changed Baseball Forever, writer Dan Good seeks to make sense of MLB MVP Ken Caminiti’s fascinating, troubled life. Good began researching Caminiti in 2012 and conducted his first interviews for his biography in 2013. Since then he’s interviewed nearly 400 people, providing him with an exclusive and exhaustive view into Caminiti’s addictions, use of steroids, baseball successes, and inner turmoil.\nDecades later, the full truth about Major League Baseball’s steroids era remains elusive, and the story of Caminiti, the player who opened the lid on performance-enhancing drugs in baseball has never been properly told. A gritty third baseman known for his diving stops, cannon arm, and switch-hit power, Caminiti voluntarily admitted in a 2002 Sports Illustrated cover story that he used steroids during his career, including his 1996 MVP season, and guessed that half of the players were using performance-enhancing drugs. “I’ve made a ton of mistakes,” he said. “I don’t think using steroids is one of them.”\nGood’s on-the-record sources include Caminiti’s steroids supplier, who has never come forward, discussing in detail his efforts to set up drug programs for Caminiti and dozens of other MLB players during the late 1990s; people who attended rehab with Caminiti and revealed the secret inner trauma that fueled his addictions; hundreds of Caminiti’s baseball teammates and coaches, from Little League to the major leagues, who adored and respected him while struggling to understand how to help him amid a culture that cultivated substance abuse; childhood friends who were drawn to his daring personality, warmth, and athleticism; and the teenager at the center of Caminiti’s October 2004 trip to New York City during which he overdosed and died.\n“Drawing from almost a decade of interviews with Caminiti’s teammates and coaches, Good’s narrative is decidedly unsparing, but it offers crucial context to the ‘steroids era’ … This is a must-read for baseball fans.”Publishers Weekly, starred review —\n“This is an incredibly interesting book about a flawed star and his impact on the game. I couldn’t put it down.”Peter Golenbock, author of The Bronx Zoo, Bums, Wrigleyville, and Valentine’s Way —\n“Like Ken Caminiti so many times with the San Diego Padres, Dan Good has gone deep with this exhaustive biography of the 1990s slugger. Playing Through the Pain builds anticipation well in detailing Caminiti’s rise and tragic fall, threading in four hundred interviews with everyone from childhood friends to steroid dealers. Caminiti’s story is one of the secrets—childhood sexual abuse, drug abuse—that undid a generous spirit and preternaturally talented ballplayer. Good ends up with an effective portrayal of a man whose courageous willingness to blow the whistle on steroids helped clean up the game.”Brad Balukjian, author of The Wax Pack —\n“As compelling as it is heartbreaking, Dan Good’s Playing Through the Pain provides an in-depth look into Ken Caminiti’s life, both on and off the field. As his teammate during his 1996 MVP season, I witnessed Cammy’s toughness and talent firsthand. It wasn’t until I read this book that I really got to know Ken and his battles.”Bob Tewksbury, All-Star pitcher, mental skills coach, and author of Ninety Percent Mental —\nAbout the author\nDan Good is a seasoned book writer, ghostwriter, journalist, and editor.

In a narrative full of fabulous characters and brilliant excursions into the unexpected, Michael Lewis follows the low-budget Oakland A's, visionary general manager Billy Beane, and the strange brotherhood of amateur baseball theorists. They are all in search of new baseball knowledge—insights that will give the little guy who is willing to discard old wisdom the edge over big money.\nNotes: Published in 2003, this book is about the Oakland Athletics baseball team and its general manager Billy Beane. It was later adapted into a major feature film.\nby H.G. Bissinger\nAbout the book: In the state of Texas American football is a religion. And nowhere is more fanatical about its football than the small town of Odessa. There, every Friday night from September to November, a bunch of seventeen-year-old kids play their hearts out for the honour of their high school. In front of 20,000 people. In 1988 H.G. Bissinger spent a season in Odessa discovering just what makes a town pin its hopes on eleven boys on a football field. He lived with the students, coaches and townspeople who dedicate their lives to their team, sharing their joys and triumphs, their pains, injuries and bitter disappointments. He returned with a compassionate but hard-eyed story of a town riven by money, race and class, where a high school can spend more on medical supplies for its athletic program than on its English department. Friday Night Lights is one of the best books about sport ever written. It is the story of how dreams and reality collide, at once glorious and immensely sad. Because for the 30-odd boys of the Permian Panthers, these days will have been the best of their lives.\nby Lance Armstrong,Sally Jenkins\nAbout the book: \"I want to die at a hundred years old after screaming down an Alpine descent on a bicycle at 75 miles per hour. I don't do anything slow, not even breathe. I do everything at a fast cadence: eat fast, sleep fast.\" At twenty four, Lance Armstrong was already well on his way to becoming a sporting legend. Then, in October 1996, he was diagnosed with stage four testicular cancer. When lesions appeared on his brain and in his lungs, doctors gave him a 40% chance of survival. On that day Armstrong's life changed forever and in typical fashion he met the challenge head on - this was one fight he was determined not to lose. As he battled against the cancer invading his body and the chemotherapy that threatened to sap his soul, a tremendous sense of commitment emerged, to his training and to the people around him who never gave up on him. Just sixteen months after he was discharged from hospital, Armstrong entered the Tour de France, a race famed for its gruelling intensity, and won, in the fastest ever time. Just a few months after that, he became a father. It's Not About the Bike is the story of one man's inspirational battle against the odds, charting his progress through triumph, tragedy and transformation. This is an awe-inspiring tale of immense courage and will.\nby David Remnick\nAbout the book: Explores the transformation of a young boxer into an internationally renowned athlete, mythic hero, American icon, and central figure in the twentieth century's social, cultural, and racial conflicts\nby Mike Brearley\nAbout the book: Mike Brearley is one of the most successful cricket captains of all time, and, in 1981, he captained the England team to the momentous Ashes series victory against Australia. In The Art of Captaincy, his treatise on leadership and motivation, he draws directly on his experience of man-managing a team, which included a pugnacious Ian Botham and Geoffrey Boycott, to explain what it takes to be a leader on and off the field. Giving an insight into both his tactical understanding of the game, as well as how to get a group of individuals playing as a team in order to get the best out of them, The Art of Captaincy is a classic handbook on how to generate, nurture and inspire success. With a new introduction by former England player and BBC commentator Ed Smith, to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of its first publication, The Art of Captaincy remains urgently relevant for cricket fans and business leaders alike. Covering the ability to use intuition, resourcefulness, clear-headedness and the importance of empathy as a means of achieving shared goals, Brearley's seminal account of captaincy is both the ultimate blueprint for creating a winning mind set, but also shows how the lessons in the sporting arena can be applied to any walk of personal and professional life.\nby Tyler Hamilton,Daniel Coyle\nAbout the book: “The holy grail for disillusioned cycling fans . . .

It’s the game ender.”—Outside NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • WINNER OF THE WILLIAM HILL SPORTS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD The Secret Race is the book that rocked the world of professional cycling—and exposed, at long last, the doping culture surrounding the sport and its most iconic rider, Lance Armstrong. Former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton was once one of the world’s top-ranked cyclists—and a member of Lance Armstrong’s inner circle. Over the course of two years, New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke with numerous teammates, rivals, and friends. The result is an explosive page-turner of a book that takes us deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to win that they would do almost anything to gain an edge. For the first time, Hamilton recounts his own battle with depression and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong. This edition features a new Afterword, in which the authors reflect on the developments within the sport, and involving Armstrong, over the past year.

{"question":"Does the concept of transformation in Pure Land Buddhism reflect the same gender bias seen in Longnü's story?","answer":"No, the transformations described in these traditions differ significantly in their treatment of gender. While the Lotus Sutra's story of Longnü demonstrates historical Buddhist sexism by requiring her transformation from female to male to achieve enlightenment, Pure Land Buddhism's transformative rebirth through lotus flowers is completely gender-neutral. Amitabha Buddha's vows promise that all beings, regardless of gender, can achieve rebirth in the Pure Land through the practice of name recitation, where they will be born transformationally from lotuses and can realize Buddhahood.","context":["Longnü is a character that makes three notable appearances in Buddhism; the first is in a defining Buddhist text, the Lotus Sutra, while the other two come from Chinese folklore, as told in the Complete Tale of Avalokiteśvara and the Southern Seas, and the Precious Scroll of Sudhana and Longnü. Before we start, here are a few pointers:\nAvalokteshvara is the Bodhisattva of Compassion. In Buddhism, a Bodhisattva is an enlightened being who has taken an oath to help all other sentient beings reach freedom from suffering, which is the fundamental point of Buddhism in general.\nAvalokateshvara’s name means (He) Who Looks Down (Sanskrit); the implication being that Avalokateshvara looks down compassionately on all suffering beings.\nWhen Buddhism moved to China, and eventually the rest of East Asia, Avalokateshvara underwent a gender swap; in China She is known as Guanyin; Her name has been transposed into a multitude of Asian languages; here’s a partial list:\n- In Vietnam, She’s called Quan Am\n- In Tibet, He/She is Chenrézik\n- In Japan, She is Kannon\nThe list goes on. The point is, in all cases, He/She looks down compassionately on the cries of the world.\nThe Lotus Sutra:\nFor over fourteen hundred years, the Lotus Sutra has impacted Asian art, folklore and poetry.\nHow much influence? Here’s an example: in the Kanwa taisho myoho renge-kyo, a collection of poetry from the Heian period (794-1185, Japan) there are roughly 1360 poems with references to the Lotus Sutra just in their titles.\nYes, it was popular.\nSexism in Buddhism:\nTo modern readers, the first story, the one contained in the Lotus Sutra, will appear sexist.\nTo be fair, it took Buddhism a while to grow out of its chauvinistic roots.\nHowever, let’s not forget that Avalokateshvara did become a woman over the course of His/Her sojourns.\nLikewise, by the time Buddhism had migrated to Tibet, it had shed many of its andro-centric tendencies, though if the Dalai Lama does decide to reincarnate, I hope he comes back as a woman*.\n*[off topic, but given China’s continued destruction of all things Tibetan, and given their abduction and replacement of the Panchen Lama (who is supposed to identify the next incarnation of the Dalai Lama), His Holiness has stated his intent to not reincarnate. This is part of a practice known as Chod, which incidentally, was pioneered by a woman, Machig Labdrön].\nLongnü’s 1st Appearance: the Lotus Sutra, Chapter 12\nHer tale starts with the Bodhisattva Manjusri praising the 8 year old daughter of the Dragon King (Naga-raja, Sanskrit) to the Buddha:\nThere is the daughter of the nāga king Sāgara who is only eight years old. She is wise; her faculties are sharp; and she also well knows all the faculties and deeds of sentient beings. She has attained the power of recollection. She preserves all the profound secret treasures of the Buddhas, enters deep in meditation, and is well capable of discerning all dharmas. She instantly produced the thought of enlightenment and has attained the stage of nonretrogression. She has unhindered eloquence and thinks of sentient beings with as much compassion as if they were her own children. Her virtues are perfect. Her thoughts and explanations are subtle and extensive, merciful, and compassionate. She has a harmonious mind and has attained enlightenment.\nNow, what follows represents a very old schism at the very heart of Buddhism: those who practiced the path of the Arahant, and those who sought to achieve the state of a Bodhisattva. The later group called themselves Mahayanists, which means the greater vehicle, and denigrated the former (and historically older) group as Hinayana, meaning the lesser vehicle.\nIn this context, Manjusri represents a Bodhisattva, while Sariputra, a disciple of the Buddha, represents the older, more orthodox, Hinayana tradition (technically, Sravaka).\nSariputra essentially discounts Majnusri’s praise of Longnü, essentially stating that…\nWell, stating that no woman could possible become enlightened.\nNow, if I’d written the punchline to this awful joke, it would have ended in a punch.\nBut, instead, Longnü offers the Buddha a pearl.\nA pearl of great wisdom.\nAnd before I proceed, please realize the time and place this was written.\nFor the Cha’an Buddhists, who would form the basis for Zen Buddhism, the point of this story wasn’t the inherent sexism; it was about the ability to receive spontaneous enlightenment.\nUnfortunately, that point may have been lost on Saviputra.\nSo what happened when the Buddha gratefully received Longnü’s precious pearl?\nWell, he transformed her…\nAfter receiving the pearl, the Buddha changed Longnü.\nFrom a woman,\nInto a perfect, male, Bodhisattva…\nWe have two more tales to go through involving Longnü, and luckily, while transformation does occur, it isn’t sexist.\nOne involves a carp, the other involves a snake.\nSo check in next time, when we continue our journey with Longnü, and see how she and the Bodhisattva of infinite compassion, Avalokateshvara came into direct contact…","THE SAGELY CITY OF TEN THOUSAND BUDDHAS\nLectures by Venerable Master Hua\nMindfulness of the Buddha\nAmitabha Buddha: The Great King of Dharma\nWhy do we recite \"Namo Amitabha Buddha?\" It is because Amitabha Buddha has a great affinity with living beings in the ten directions. Before Amitabha Buddha realized Buddhahood, during his cultivation on the \"cause ground,\" he was a Bhikshu named Dharma Treasury who made forty-eight vows. Among those vows was one that said, \"I vow that after I realize Buddhahood, any living beings throughout the ten directions who recite my name will certainly realize Buddhahood. If they will not be able to realize Buddhahood, then I will not realize Buddhahood.\"\nThe power of Amitabha Buddha's vows is like a magnet; living beings of the ten directions are like iron filings. That is how he draws beings of the ten directions to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. What if they aren't attracted? Amitabha Buddha vowed that he himself wouldn't realize Buddhahood if they couldn't be! Therefore, all who recite the name of Amitabha Buddha have the opportunity to realize Buddhahood.\nGathering All Beings into the Western Land\nThe Amitabha Sutra belongs to the category of Sutras that the Buddha \"spoke without request.\" Why was that Sutra spoken without request? No one understood this Dharma-door, and so no one could request the Buddha to speak it. Although the greatly wise Shariputra was an interlocutor in the assembly, even he didn't know how to ask about this Dharma-door. Probably the Buddha couldn't hold back any longer, so he told everyone about this most convenient, most direct, most satisfying, easiest, and most inexpensive Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name. If a person can recite Amitabha Buddha's name \"whether for one day, two days, three, four, five days, six days, as long as seven days, with one mind unconfused, when this person approaches the end of life, before him will appear Amitabha Buddha and all the assembly of holy ones\" to guide him. Although most people find it hard to believe this Dharma-door, it is the most direct and certain practice.\nThe Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name is appropriate for those of all three faculties and beneficial for both the intelligent and the stupid. Whether you are stupid or wise, you can realize Buddhahood. When one is born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, where beings \"endure none of the sufferings, but enjoy every bliss,\" one will be born transformationally from a lotus. We will not pass through the womb as in the human realm, but will enter a lotus flower, live in it for a while, and then realize Buddhahood.\nDay and Night Hold the Name with Concentrated, Sincere Mindfulness\nThe King of All Dharmas is the one word \"Amitabha.\"\nThe five periods and the eight teachings are all contained within it.\nOne who single-mindedly remembers and recites his name\nIn samadhi will enter the Thus Come Ones' place of quiescence.\nThe King of All Dharmas is the one word \"Amitabha.\"/ The five periods and the eight teachings are all contained within it. The teachings are arranged in eight categories, four according to the nature of the teaching: the storehouse teaching, the connecting teaching, the special teaching, and the perfect teaching; and four according to the methods of teaching: sudden, gradual, secret, and unfixed. The five periods are: The Avatamsaka, Agama, Vaipulya, Prajna, and Lotus-Nirvana. These eight teachings and five periods are all included in the one word \"Amitabha.\"\nOne who single-mindedly remembers and recites his name / In samadhi will enter the Thus Come One's place of quiescence. Such a one will definitely go to the Pure Land of Eternal Stillness and Light, the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Living beings in the Dharma-ending Age will be saved by reciting the Buddha's name. And so whoever hopes to be saved should be mindful of the Buddha.\nSpeak one sentence less;\nRecite the Buddha's name one time more.\nBeat your thoughts to death,\nAnd let your Dharma-body come alive.\nDon't look lightly on the Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name.\nContemplate at All Times and Reflect Well.\nThere are four types of mindfulness of the Buddha:\n1. Mindfulness of the Buddha through holding the name. This involves reciting \"Namo Amitabha Buddha\" over and over.\n2. Mindfulness of the Buddha through contemplative reflection. This means contemplating that Amitabha's body is the color of gold.\nThe splendor of his hallmarks has no peer.\nThe light of his brow shines 'round five Mount Sumerus.\nWide as the seas are his eyes, pure and clear.\nShining in his brilliance by transformation\nAre countless Bodhisattvas and infinite Buddhas.\nHis forty-eight vows will be our liberation.\nHe enables all those in the nine lotus-stages to reach the farthest shore.\nThis is mindfulness of the Buddha through contemplative reflection.\n3. Mindfulness of the Buddha through contemplative visualization. This means reciting \"Namo Amitabha Buddha\" while facing an image of that Buddha. One should recite the phrase very clearly, hear it very clearly, and keep it very clearly in mind.\n4. Mindfulness of the Buddha's Real Appearance. This is just Chan meditation. When we meditate, we investigate the question, \"Who is reciting the Buddha's name?\" We recite \"Namo Amitabha Buddha\" for two weeks, and then we try to find out who is reciting the Buddha's name. We have to find out \"who\" and not lose the \"who.\" If we lose it, then we won't be able to get home. If we can't get home, we won't see Amitabha Buddha.\nOne with Proper Faith, Proper Vows, and Proper Practice\nFaith, vows, and practice are the three prerequisites of the Pure Land Dharma-door. One who goes on a journey takes along some food and a little money. One who wishes to go to the Land of Ultimate Bliss needs faith, vows, and the practice of holding the Buddha's name.\nFaith is the first prerequisite, for without it one will not have an affinity with Amitabha Buddha in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. You must have faith in yourself, faith in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, as well as in cause and effect, noumenon and phenomenon.\nWhat does it mean to believe in oneself? It is to believe that you certainly have the qualifications necessary to be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. You should not take yourself lightly and say, \"I have committed so many offenses, I can't be born there.\" Suppose you have created karma involving heavy offenses, well, now you have a good opportunity: you can \"take your karma with you into rebirth.\" That means that regardless of the offenses you have committed in the past, you can still be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, and that karma goes along with you. However, you need to know that the karma you can take is karma you have already created, not karma that you continue to create. Karma you have already created is the karma from previous lives. Karma you continue to create will ripen in the future. What you can carry is offenses that come from karma created in the past; what you cannot carry is offenses from karma you create now that will ripen in the future. No matter what you have ever done, not withstanding any kind of offenses, you can now change your faults and reform your conduct, stopping evil and becoming wholesome. Then you can take those previously-created offenses with you to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. But continuing to create karma will keep you from being able to go.\nSecondly, you must have faith in the Western Land of Ultimate Bliss which is hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands from here. Before he realized Buddhahood, Amitabha Buddha, as the Bhikshu Dharma Treasury, vowed to create the Land of Ultimate Bliss where living beings of the ten directions who vowed to be born there could gain rebirth by reciting his name. There is no need to do anything else; it is easy, simple, convenient, and interpenetrating--yet it doesn't cost a thing and doesn't waste energy. This Dharma-door can be considered the highest and most supreme, for if you just recite, \"Namo Amitabha Buddha,\" you will be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss.\nIt is also necessary to believe in cause and effect. Believing in cause is to believe that in the past you have planted good roots that now enable you to believe in this Dharma-door. Without good roots, no one can encounter this Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name, or any other Dharma-door, for that matter. Because of the good roots you planted in the past, you can now encounter the Pure Land Dharma-door of faith, vows, and holding the name. But if you don't continue to nourish the good roots you planted, then you won't be able to reap the fruition of Bodhi in the future. That is why you must believe in cause and effect; believe that in the past you already planted causes for Bodhi and so in the future you will certainly reap the fruition of Bodhi. The principle is the same as planting a field: the seeds must be watered and nourished before they can grow.\nFinally, one must have faith in phenomenon and noumenon. The specific phenomenon is this: Amitabha Buddha has a great affinity with us and will certainly guide us to Buddhahood. The noumenal principle is this: We know the great affinity exists because without it we would not have met the Pure Land Dharma-door. Amitabha Buddha is all living beings and all living beings are Amitabha Buddha. Amitabha Buddha became Amitabha Buddha by reciting the Buddha's name, and if we recite the Buddha's name, we, too, can become Amitabha Buddha.\nWe should cultivate according to the phenomena and the noumenal principle. The Avatamsaka Sutra speaks of four Dharma Realms:\n1. The Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Phenomena\n2. The Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Noumena\n3. The Dharma Realm of Noumena and Phenomena\n4. The Dharma Realm of All Phenomena Unobstructed\nConsidering the four Dharma Realms, and speaking from the standpoint of our self-nature, we and Amitabha Buddha are united in one, and therefore we have the qualifications to realize Buddhahood.\nAmitabha Buddha is the Amitabha Buddha within the minds of all living beings, and living beings are the living beings within the mind of Amitabha Buddha. Due to this interconnection, there are phenomena and the noumenon. However, you must believe in this principle and energetically practice it by reciting the Buddha's name; you cannot get lazy. Your recitation of the Buddha's name should increase day by day, not decrease.\nHaving discussed faith, we will now discuss vows. What is a vow? When you want something, when your thoughts tend toward a certain thing, your mind has a wish, then you make a vow. In Buddhism there are four vast vows:\nI vow to save the limitless living beings.\nI vow to cut off the inexhaustible afflictions.\nI vow to study the immeasurable Dharma-doors.\nI vow to realize the supreme Buddha Way.\nAll Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the past, present, and future practiced the Bodhisattva conduct and attained Buddhahood by relying on these four great vows.\nBut in order to make vows you must have faith. First, believe there is a Land of Ultimate Bliss; secondly, have faith in Amitabha Buddha; thirdly, believe that you and Amitabha Buddha have a great affinity, and that you can certainly be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. With faith in these three things, you may then make the vow, \"I desire to be born in Amitabha's country.\" There is a saying,\n\"I want to be born in the Western Pure Land.\"\n\"I want to be born there. Nobody's forcing me to go; nobody's dragging me there. Although Amitabha Buddha has come to guide me, I'm going as a volunteer because I want to be close to him. I want to be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss and to see Amitabha Buddha when my lotus flower opens. I want to meet the Buddha and hear the Dharma.\" These are the vows you need.\nThen you must practice. How? Recite the Buddha's name, saying \"Namo Amitabha Buddha, Namo Amitabha Buddha...\" as if you were trying to save your head from the executioner, running ahead to keep your head.\nFaith, vows, and practice are the travel expenses for rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. They are your ticket."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1a46045f-d5ad-421f-938d-e3b290a69638>","<urn:uuid:5adb7671-287f-404c-9893-069673dfc251>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Yo doc, need 2 know asap - wat kinda behavioral probs show up in extremely preterm kids who got sleep issues? Break it down by sleep problem type plz","answer":"Different types of sleep problems were associated with distinct behavioral issues. Children with difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings showed higher scores in emotional problems, hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems, and peer problems. Those who snored had more emotional and conduct problems. Children with daytime sleepiness exhibited more emotional problems, hyperactivity/inattention issues, and peer problems. Finally, children who slept less than the recommended 9 hours had higher overall behavioral problem scores.","context":["Objective To explore whether children born extremely preterm (EPT) with different types of sleep problems had more behavioural and respiratory health problems than EPT children without sleep problems.\nDesign Prospective, nationwide, questionnaire-based study. At 11 years of age, parents reported on four current sleep problems: difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings, snoring, daytime sleepiness and not recommended sleep duration (<9 hours). Behavioural problems were assessed by parents and teachers with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parents assessed respiratory symptoms with the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire and described use of asthma medication.\nPatients EPT children.\nMain outcome measures Specified sleep problems, behavioural problems and respiratory health.\nResults Data were obtained from 216 of 372 (58 %) of eligible children. All four specified sleep problems were associated with significantly higher parent-reported SDQ total-score (OR 1.1 for all), and except for not recommended sleep duration, also with higher teacher-reported SDQ total-score (OR 1.1 for all). Daytime sleepiness was strongly associated with wheezing last 12 months (OR 3.4), disturbed sleep due to wheezing (OR 3.9), wheeze during or after exercise (OR 2.9), use of inhaled corticosteroids or oral leukotriene modifiers (OR 3.4) and use of bronchodilators (OR 3.9).

EPT was defined as gestational age (GA) <28 completed weeks or birth weight (BW) <1000 g. The children were prospectively followed from birth and assessed at 2, 5 and 11 years of age. Method for determination of GA and overall outcome in terms of mortality and morbidities until 11 years have been published previously.9 13–16 At 11 years, we obtained information on the families’ sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyles, and the children’s health, including sleep characteristics, behavioural issues and respiratory health, from postal questionnaires completed by the parents (for behaviour also the children’s teacher). EPT children with severe disability were included. (The degree of neurodevelopmental disability was assessed by clinical examination when the children were 5 years old.10)\nThe parents assessed the sleep problems in terms of whether their child had difficulty falling asleep or had frequent awakenings, snored or had daytime sleepiness. The response options to these questions were ‘Not true’, ‘Partly true’ and ‘Absolutely true’. In our analyses, the responses ‘Partly true’ and ‘Absolutely true’ were merged and defined as a sleep problem. Sleep duration was assessed by the following items: at what time their child went to bed and got up on weekdays, how long time it took from going to bed until falling asleep (sleep onset latency) and how long the child was awake during the night after sleep onset. We calculated total sleep duration as the time in bed minus sleep onset latency and time awake after sleep onset. In accordance with recently published guidelines, recommended sleep duration at 11 years was defined as 9–11 hours.17 The same sleep variables have been used in a previous paper.18\nParents and teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). SDQ is a general behavioural screening questionnaire for 4–17-year-old children and has good psychometric properties also for children born preterm.19 20 It contains five items in each of four subscales: emotional problems, hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems and peer problems. Each item is scored on a three-point scale; ‘Not true’ (0), ‘Somewhat true’1 and ‘Certainly true’.2 The total subscale score ranges from 0 to 10 and the total score from 0 to 40.\nThe parents completed the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire21 which contains the following questions on respiratory symptoms during the last 12 months: did your child experience wheezing or whistling in the chest and, if so, how many attacks; how often was the child’s sleep disturbed due to wheezing; was wheezing ever so severe that the child had trouble saying more than one or two words at a time between breaths; did the child’s chest sounded wheezy during or after exercise; and did the child have a dry cough at night, apart from cough associated with a cold or chest infection.\nWe also asked for current use of asthma medications, including inhaled corticosteroids, short or long acting β2-agonists and oral leukotriene modifiers, and whether the child had ever been diagnosed with asthma. Current asthma was defined as yes to ‘ever asthma’ combined with either respiratory symptoms or use of asthma medication during the previous 12 months, or asthma medication and symptoms during the past 12 months regardless of reporting asthma.\nFor each specific dichotomised sleep outcome variable, the groups were compared according to the results on the SDQ, ISAAC, current asthma versus no asthma, use versus no use of inhaled corticosteroids or oral leukotriene modifiers, and use versus no use of inhaled bronchodilators.\nGroup comparisons were performed using Student’s t-tests, χ2 tests or Fisher’s exact tests. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated after adjusting for sex, single parenthood and maternal education (dichotomised as a 3-year college education or not) in logistic regression analyses. Significance level was set at α-level 0.05. We also performed subanalyses where we included small for gestational age (SGA) as a covariate. This was done for the SDQ and for the questions about respiratory health. SGA was defined as a BW below the 10th percentile.22 For the questions about respiratory health, subanalyses were also made in which information about current smoking among parents (mother or father) was included as a covariate\nPatient and public involvement\nPatient representatives were involved in this national follow-up study.\nSleep and ISAAC data were obtained for 216/372 (58%) children. SDQ was completed by the parents for 215 and by the teachers for 184 of them. Difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings was reported for 27.3%, snoring for 28.0%, daytime sleepiness for 17.1% and sleep duration less than the recommended 9 hours for 24.1% of the children. None of the children slept more than recommended. There were no significant sex differences regarding the prevalence of the specified sleep problems. The average total SDQ score was 8.8 and the prevalence of current asthma was 18%. Of the 216 participating children, six had severe disability at age 5 years. Parent and child characteristics are described in table 1. Participants and non-participants did not differ regarding GA or the ratio of SGA, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or retinopathy of prematurity, but there was a tendency for less severe disability among the participants (3.3% (n=6) vs 9.8% (n=12)).\nSleep problems and behavioural problems\nThe children who had difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings had a higher parent-reported SDQ total-score, and they had higher scores on all four subscales compared with the children who did not have this sleep problem. They also had a higher teacher-reported SDQ total-score and a higher teacher-reported emotional problems score (table 2). The children who snored had a higher parent-reported and teacher-reported SDQ total-score and a higher score on conduct problems than the children who did not snore. The children who snored had also more emotional problems (see table 2 for details).\nThe children with daytime sleepiness had a higher parent-reported and teacher-reported SDQ total-score and a higher score on emotional problems than children without daytime sleepiness. The parents also reported that these children also had more hyperactivity/inattention problems and peer problems. The children who had a sleep duration of less than the recommended 9 hours, had a higher parent-reported SDQ total-score than the children who slept longer (table 2). The association between the specified sleep problems and the respective SDQ scores remained unchanged after including SGA (n=60) as a covariate in the adjusted analysis, except for the association between snoring and teacher-reported conduct problems which became non-significant (data not shown).\nSleep problems and respiratory health\nThe children who had difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings more often had wheezing during the last 12 months, but the association did not remain significant after adjustment (table 3). Only two children had problems with speaking due to wheezing. This question was therefore not included in the further analyses.\nSnoring was associated with wheezing during or after exercise, current asthma and use of bronchodilators (table 3). Daytime sleepiness was associated with wheezing during the last 12 months, disturbed sleep due to wheezing, wheeze during or after exercise, use of inhaled corticosteroids or oral leukotriene modifiers and use of bronchodilators (table 3). Sleep duration less than recommended was associated with disturbed sleep due to wheezing and use of inhaled corticosteroids or oral leukotriene modifiers (table 3). The association between these specified sleep problems and the respiratory health problems remained unchanged after including SGA and the parents’ current smoking habits (mother or father smoking) as covariates in the adjusted analysis (data not shown).\nIn this nationwide cohort of EPT children, sleep problems were significantly associated with behavioural and respiratory health problems. Difficulty falling asleep or frequent awakenings, snoring and daytime sleepiness were associated with more parent-reported and teacher-reported behavioural problems, whereas sleeping less than recommended was associated with more parent-reported behavioural problems. The sleep problems, and especially daytime sleepiness, were strongly associated with respiratory symptoms, asthma and use of asthma medication.\nThe average total SDQ scores in our study were higher (total score 8.8) than previously found in unselected Norwegian children (total score 5.4).11 The prevalence of current asthma (18%) was higher than the prevalence of 11% in an unselected Norwegian cohort of 10-year-old children.23 Thus, this EPT cohort had more respiratory,24 behavioural11 and sleep problems10 in mid-childhood than Norwegian children who were not prematurely born, underscoring the overall vulnerability in these children. To what extent such difficulties are interrelated in children born preterm have not been extensively explored.\nIn a small study of children born at GA less than 32 weeks, Perkinson-Gloor et al found that less restorative sleep was associated with more behavioural problems as reflected in higher SDQ-scores.25 However, they did not find more nocturnal awakenings or shorter sleep duration compared with their control group, nor did they find that total sleep time or nocturnal awakenings were associated with SDQ total-scores. Caravale et al studied 2-year-old preterm children (mean GA 31 weeks), and found that they had more frequent sleep difficulties during the night, and that these difficulties were related to problems with emotions and attention,26 which is in agreement with our findings. It is worth noting that Perkinson-Gloor et al excluded children with severe developmental delay25 and that Caravale et al included only children with normal cognitive, language, and motor development26 as opposed to no selections in our study.\nOur finding that sleep problems and behavioural problems were associated is in agreement with what has been reported for young children who were not born preterm,27 suggesting that studies on sleep and behavioural problems among children in general may be applicable also for children born EPT. Insomnia and restless sleep have been linked to emotional problems, hyperactivity/inattention problems, conduct problems and peer problems as assessed by SDQ.28 Moreover, daytime sleepiness was associated with emotional problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention problems in term born children measured by SDQ of Hestetun et al.29 These are findings that are in line with our observations in EPT-born children, strengthening the notion that sleep problems are likely to be similarly involved in mental health issues in preterm as well as term-born children.\nSnoring in term-born children has also been associated with emotional problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention problems as assessed by SDQ.30 Correspondingly, we found more emotional and conduct problems, but not more hyperactivity/inattention problems among our snoring EPT children. Snoring is a common symptom of sleep disordered breathing (SDB), and previous studies have shown that children born prematurely have an increased risk of SDB.31–35 The prevalence SDB during childhood in children born EPT is unknown. In general, SDB in childhood is a risk factor for behavioural problems, externalising symptoms and inattention. More studies are needed to map the association between SDB and behavioural problems in children born EPT.\nOur finding that insufficient sleep duration was associated with higher SDQ total-scores is in agreement with findings of an association between short sleep duration and emotional problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention problems in an unselected cohort of Norwegian children of similar age.36\nWe are unaware of other studies that have addressed relationships between respiratory symptoms and sleep in children born EPT, but our finding that several sleep problems were associated with wheezing and asthma is in agreement with similar findings in children born at term.37–39 Although respiratory symptoms in EPT-born children resemble asthma, the pathophysiology of lung disease after preterm birth is different which, for instance, is reflected in that the disease is unresponsive to inhaled corticosteroids.12 40–42 Their burden of respiratory symptoms may therefore be substantially higher, and more chronic16 and therefore more easily overlooked. For example, it is conceivable that poor sleep due to respiratory problems may cause daytime sleepiness and contribute to inattention and learning difficulties which are major challenges for children born EPT.43 44 Previous studies on term-born children have shown that nocturnal awakening due to asthma is a risk factor for poor school functioning.45\nThe strengths of the present study were the national population-based sample of EPT children, the prospective design, the assessment of behavioural problems by both parents and teachers, and the use of validated instruments for assessing both behavioural problems and respiratory symptoms. The limited response rate at follow-up was a weakness. However, we found that for most variables the assessed children were representative of all survivors at the age of 11 years. We adjusted for single parenthood, maternal education and sex in our analyses, and in subanalyses we also adjusted for SGA and current smoking among parents. We cannot, however, exclude residual confounding. We did not correct for multiple testing, and therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution. Other limitations were lack of detailed information about socioeconomic status, the child’s sleep environment, what season the parents answered the questionnaires, and whether the children had been treated for snoring or for sleep problems.\nIn the present study, behavioural problems and respiratory symptoms were strongly associated with sleep disturbances in 11-year-old children born EPT. The associations were similar to what has been found in unselected groups of children. Given the high prevalence of behavioural problems and respiratory symptoms after preterm birth, the study suggests that sleep disturbances may be an overlooked area of concern in preterm born children, and that questions mapping sleep should be included when seeing these children in clinics.\nContributors KMS has conceptualised and designed the study, analysed and interpreted the data, drafted and revised the manuscript critically for important intellectual content and has approved that this version of the manuscript was published.

These substrates are being investigated for their potential to support the emergence of developmental and learning capabilities in artificial systems.","context":["Workshop on Novel Substrates and Models for the Emergence of Developmental, Learning and Cognitive Capabilities.\nIn order for sensing, reasoning, development and learning to take place in artificial systems/beings, computing substrates and models that support the emergence of such properties are required.\nThis workshop encompasses the understanding, analysis, modeling and development of novel substrates that show development and learning abilities, such as (but not limited to):\n- Cellular automata and random boolean networks,\n- Reservoir computing,\n- Novel nanoscale materials (e.g. carbon nanotubes),\n- Biological materials and systems (e.g. neuronal cultures),\n- Evolvable hardware and neuromorphic computing systems,\n- Novel neural models and models of biological neuron,\n- Evolution-in-materio systems,\n- Computational matter,\n- Slime mould computing,\n- Micro- and nano-scale electronic chemistry,\n- Substrates that exhibit self-reconfiguration, fault tolerance, self-repair, and adaptation capabilities,\n- Artificial generative and developmental systems,\n- Computational intelligence techniques for novel developmental and learning substrates\n- Learning through self-organization and emergence\nThis full-day workshop will investigate the sensorimotor and affective mechanisms that underlie human-robot interaction. Non-verbal and affective cues and expressions used to foster cooperation, mutual understanding and signal trustworthiness are manifested by humans all the time. If these cues are not appropriately reciprocated, however, the interaction can be negatively impacted. Moreover, inappropriate reciprocation, or lack thereof, may be the result of misperception and or non-timely reactions. Failure to adequately account for biologically plausible perceptual and temporal facets of interactions may detract from the quality of human-robot interaction and hinder progress in the field of social robotics more generally.\nIncorporation of naturalistic and adaptive forms of sensorimotor and affective human-robot non-verbal communication is challenging because such interaction is highly dependent on the context and the relationship between the observer and the expresser. Biological species based interaction often requires explicit forms of social signalling such as nodding, nonverbal gestures, emotional expressions, etc., the interpretation of all of which may be highly context-sensitive. Furthermore, naturalistic social signalling may involve a certain degree of mimicry of autonomic responses such as pupil dilation, blinking, blushing, etc. which, in human-robot interaction requires the implementation of time-sensitive perceptual mechanisms currently underused in both commercial and research robotics platforms.\nIn this workshop, we will investigate and discuss to what extent the aforementioned naturalistic social signalling capabilities needs to be accounted for in human-robot interaction and what modalities are more relevant, and in what contexts. The workshop will focus strongly on research motivated by naturalistic empirical data. We hope to provide a discussion friendly environment to connect with research covering complementary interests in the areas of: robotics, computer science, psychology, neuroscience, affective computing and animal learning research.\nThe primary list of topics covers the following (but not limited to):\n– Emotion recognition\n– Gesture recognition\n– Social gaze recognition\n– The development of expression and recognition capabilties\n– Joint visual attention and activity\n– Alignment in social interactions\n– Non-verbal cues in human-robot interaction\nOur bodies constitute the interface between our mind and the surrounding world. To interact effectively with the world, babies and robots need to discover the different parts of their bodies, and their physical and mechanical properties. They need to know where their limbs are in space, how far they can extend, how they work, and what range of actions they can achieve with them. Such body representations are essential for developing a sense of the self and for defining the limits of the peripersonal space. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in the fields of developmental psychology, developmental robotics, embodied cognition, body mapping, and computational modeling to create a productive, collaborative, and multidisciplinary forum from which different facets of these fundamental processes linked to body mapping and mapping the self will be explored. The workshop will be organized around three general themes with specific speakers and experts in each area:\n- Body mapping: This theme will group developmental and learning studies in infants, adults, and robots on self-touch, self-exploration of the body, self-localization, and haptic perception to understand how the mapping of the self forms.\n- Defining the peripersonal space: This theme will examine the range and conditions through which our peripersonal space develops, is being perceived, and being modulated through interactions with objects, people, and events in our daily surroundings. This theme will contrast infant, children, and adult studies as well as computational models.\n- Sense of self and body ownership: This third theme will explore how our brain builds a map and sense of ownership of objects as extensions of our own body. Studies and models on tool use learning, prostheses mastery, including studies on the rubber hand illusion will provide a framework to understand how perception and action of inanimate objects can be experienced as functional extensions of our body and self.\nHere, we offer an overview of developmental psychology theories and research methods. We will provide this through presentations, interactive break-out discussions and poster sessions. Our aim is to find a common language and groundwork to continue and foster collaborations in the interdisciplinary field of developmental robotics. We will provide a space in which no question would seem too basic, in order to help progress mutual understanding. The workshop is open for poster submissions by email to Thusha Rajendran: email@example.com. See the workshop webpage for more information.\nICDL-EpiRob 2019 Workshop on Personal Robotics and Secure Human-Robot Collaboration (Joint APRIL and SECURE ITN Symposium)\nThis workshop will focus on learning and interaction-based approaches to safe human-robot collaboration and their application to personal robotics. The workshop will include research topics like: developmental approaches to robot learning, safe interaction in uncertain environments, affect and emotion modelling for safe human-robot interaction, language and non-verbal communication etc.\n3rd Workshop on Language Learning at ICDL-EPIROB 2019\nChildren acquire language in interactions with caregivers and peers in a socio-cultural environment. When children start to talk, their visual perception, body movement, navigation, object manipulation is already reaching some level of competence. Together with developing auditory control, initial schemas for social interactions (games), communication arises gradually and embedded into the social-interactionist environment. Even though there are various efforts in developmental robotics to model communication, the emergence of symbolic communication is still an unsolved problem. We are lacking convincing theories and implementations that show how cooperation and interaction knowledge could emerge in long-term experiments with populations of robotic agents.\nThe workshop will address the following issues\n• role of context in language acquisition (cultural, social, interactional)\n• role of every day interactions in language acquisition\n• empirical paradigms for studying language acquisition and emergence\n• longitudinal studies of language acquisition\n• language grounding / embodiment / enaction\n• modeling acquisition of syntax and/or semantics\n• models of sentence and interaction processing\n• modeling with artificial neural networks\n• human robot interaction (especially linked with grounding, …)\n• models of language emergence using Reinforcement Learning\n• robot language acquisition"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:646718af-b8ff-4644-af86-2383a2425c7a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you please explain the importance of pain control in both Qin Na and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu's submission techniques?","answer":"In Qin Na, pain is explicitly used as a control mechanism through techniques like Fen Jin (separating muscles), Cuo Cu (manipulating joints against their natural range of motion), and attacking vital points. The effectiveness comes from causing severe pain while maintaining control without seriously incapacitating the opponent. For example, separating forearm muscles or manipulating joints against their natural motion causes pain that can be regulated by adjusting pressure. In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu's submission techniques, while pain can be present, the focus is more on mechanical control and physiological effects - such as restricting blood flow in the rear naked choke and triangle choke, or preventing breathing in the guillotine choke. The emphasis is on using leverage and technique rather than explicitly causing pain to achieve submission.","context":["Qin Na (Chin Na)\nThe Art of Seizing and Controlling\nQin Na is primarily known as the Chinese art of joint locking. Qin means to seize or catch and Na means to hold or control; so Qin Na is the art of seizing and controlling an opponent.\nAlthough Qin Na techniques can be found in most Chinese martial arts systems, one style above all others is renowned for its highly specialized application of Qin Na. This is Ying Zhao Fan Zi, better known in the West as Eagle Claw Kung Fu.\nA unique characteristic that renders added efficiency to the application of Qin Na techniques in Ying Zhao Fan Zi is the utilization of the hand formation for which the style is famous. This is the \"eagle claw\" (see picture). This anatomical hand shape represents the powerful talons of the king of birds and is ideal for applying the four major categories of Qin Na techniques.\n- Fen Jin: Separate the muscles\n- Cuo Cu: Misplace the bones\n- Bi Qi: Stop the breath\n- Dian Xue: Attack the vital points\nThe techniques in the Fen Jin category deal with separating the muscles. Throughout the body, muscles adjoin, meet and overlap. It is at these points that the eagle claw can be applied to separate the muscles by applying pressing and pulling pressure.\nFor example: The anterior forearm contains several adjoining muscles that are commonly attacked with Fen Jin techniques. Consider the Pronator Teres and the Flexor Carpi Radialis muscles; applying the eagle claw to separate these two muscles will cause severe pain (see picture).\nThe great body of techniques applied in Qin Na deal with those in the Cuo Cu category. These techniques are usually applied at the joints of the human body also known as articulations.\n- A joint is a place where two bones come together\n- A joint is classified based on the amount of movement it allows\n- The human body contains 360 joints\nThese joints are divided into six categories. The joints that can be most effectively attacked with Qin Na techniques are concentrated in the upper limbs: the wrist, the elbow and the shoulder. The lower limbs, thorax and throat also contain joints that are vulnerable to Qin Na techniques.\nWhen attacking a joint by manipulating it against its natural range of motion, the tendons that attach the muscle to the bone are also affected. This unnatural bending or twisting of the joint, combined with overstretched tendons, will cause pain. This pain can be controlled by maintaining or increasing the pressure that is applied against the joint.\nFor example: The elbow joint is known as a “hinge joint,” which only permits flexion and extension and then only to a certain degree. When pressure is applied against the opponent’s normal elbow function, pain is administered and control is quickly gained. (see picture)\nThe techniques of Bi Qi (stop or seal the breath) form a minor category in Qin Na. These are specialized techniques that attack the breathing passages, namely, the pharynx (the throat) and the trachea (the windpipe or \"Adam’s Apple”). The application of these techniques often also damages the larynx (voice box).\nWhile some Bi Qi techniques involve arm chokes, Ying Zhao Fan Zi specializes in the use of the eagle claw to attack the throat and crush the windpipe. The claw is usually combined with a joint lock to give added control and leverage.\nFor example: The windpipe is attacked and crushed with an eagle claw to seal the airway while an elbow immobilization lock is simultaneously applied. The lock renders futile any resistance while the claw attack to the windpipe quickly restricts the airflow. (see picture)\nThe ability to attack the vital points is the acme of Dian Xue. This is considered the most advanced and secretive aspect of Qin Na.\nMany teachers are hesitant to teach these techniques and many masters take their secrets with them to the grave rather than risk passing on the knowledge to unscrupulous students.\nGrand Master Leung Shum taught the techniques only once, during the occasion of his 30th anniversary celebration, over an intensive training session for his most advanced students.\nThe categories of Qin Na techniques described above are drilled and refined through the practice of \"Yi Bai Ling Ba Qin Na,\" the famous 108 Locking Hands of Ying Zhao Fan Zi (Eagle Claw Kung Fu).\nQin Na is considered one of the four traditional fighting aspects of Chinese martial arts, which are Ti, Da, Shuai, and Na.\n- Ti (Kick)\n- Da (Strike)\n- Shuai (Throw)\n- Na (Seize)\nSince fighting occurs at long, medium, close and grappling range, a fighter needs to be well versed in all these aspects so as to not have any loopholes an opponent can take advantage of. Qin Na techniques are excellent for close in and grappling range and will round out your fighting skills.\nThe effective application of Qin Na techniques requires repeated practice with different partners and a thorough knowledge of the human muscular, skeletal and nervous systems. It is this knowledge that allows for the efficient application of techniques without relying on brute force.\nThe effective application of Qin Na techniques causes severe pain, and pain is a great lever for controlling an adversary. Qin Na is considered a high level martial art since one is able to bring the opponent under control without seriously incapacitating him.","How to Perform Three Basic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Chokes\nBrazilian Jiu Jitsu is a style of submission grappling that employs leverage and technique to defeat opponents. Its modern incarnation was largely developed by the Gracie family of Brazil; they founded the Ultimate Fighting Championship, or UFC, to demonstrate the effectiveness of Jiu Jitsu against other styles of martial arts. The basic chokeholds used by Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners can be very useful for other styles of grapplers as well, such as catch wrestlers or Sambo specialists. All submission grapplers should practice the rear naked choke, the guillotine choke and the triangle choke until performing them becomes second nature.\nThe rear naked choke, or RNC, is one of the most well-known and effective chokes in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Also known as the \"mata leão,\" or \"lion-killer,\" it is performed while you have control of your opponent's back. Your first priority should be to maintain your dominant position on your opponent's back. Keep your feet hooked inside your opponent's hips, but do not cross them; this common mistake can leave you caught in a painful ankle lock.\nTo set up the rear naked choke, slide your right hand under your opponent's chin and around his neck until his chin is in the crook of your elbow. Next, grasp your left bicep with your right hand; keep your thumb snug against your fingers. Now slide your left hand and forearm behind your opponent's head; if possible, hook your left hand over your own right shoulder or tricep.\nOnce you have locked in the rear naked choke, smoothly tighten your grip and pull your shoulders back in a rowing motion. At the same time, arch your entire body, pressing your hips forward and your legs back to stretch your opponent out and increase the pressure on his neck. If you set up the choke properly, it will cut off the blood flowing to his brain through the carotid arteries on either side of his neck, forcing him to tap out or be rendered unconscious.\nThe guillotine is another very common Brazilian Jiu Jitsu chokehold; unlike the rear naked choke, it is performed from in front of your opponent. Although the specific scenarios in which you would use it can vary widely, one of the most common is as a counter to your opponent's takedown attempt. In that case, drop your hips back as your opponent shoots in on you, pressing your chest into the back of his head. At the same time, slide your right hand under your opponent's chin as if you were attempting to grab him in a headlock. Face the palm of your right hand away from your opponent, then secure the blade of your right hand with your left hand. The palm of your left hand should be against the back of your right hand, and the base of your right thumb should be just past your opponent's windpipe. To finish securing the grip, press your right shoulder forward against the back of your opponent's head, preventing his head from slipping out of the hold.\nTo actually apply the choke, roll to your back and lock your legs around your opponent, closing your guard. Position your legs as high on your opponent's torso as possible to increase the pressure on his neck. Pinch your knees together, pull down with your legs, arch your body backwards and pull your shoulders back to drive the edge of your right forearm into your opponent's throat. Unlike the rear naked choke, which cuts off blood flow to the brain, this version of the guillotine choke is a wind choke, also known as an air choke. It prevents your opponent from breathing, and is extremely painful. There are many variations and other versions of the guillotine choke as well, some of which work in somewhat different ways; however, this is one of the simplest.\nYou will be able to catch the triangle choke most often while fighting off your back with your opponent controlled in your guard. Your goal, if you wish to lock in a triangle choke, is to catch your opponent with one arm inside your guard -- between your legs -- and one arm outside your guard. Many grapplers accidentally put themselves in this position while attempting to pass the guard, a mistake that you may be able to exploit. When you notice your opponent's arms in the proper position for the triangle choke, you must move quickly to lock it in before he escapes.\nIf your opponent left his right arm inside your guard, extend your hips up as high as you can, extending your right leg straight up in the air. Next, chop your right leg down across the back of your opponent's neck and shoulder, breaking his posture. Throw your left leg over the top of your right ankle; your right foot should be locked behind your left knee. Pass your opponent's right arm across his neck; this should form a triangle shape between your opponent's arm and your two legs, giving the choke its name. To finish the choke, pinch your knees together, pull down on the back of your opponent's head and extend your hips. Like the rear naked choke, the triangle choke works by cutting off the blood flowing to your opponent's brain.\nArmy Study Guide: \"Rear Naked Choke\"\nLockFlow: \"Rear Naked Choke\"\nArmy Study Guide: \"Front Guillotine Choke\"\nMMALinker: \"Guillotine Choke\"\nArmy Study Guide: \"Triangle Choke\"\nAustin Jiu-Jitsu: \"Triangle Choke\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4622fe80-5948-4b7f-ba28-706d5f8f8f66>","<urn:uuid:baa0b57e-9b89-4ac2-b248-c5a481d45cc7>"],"error":null}
