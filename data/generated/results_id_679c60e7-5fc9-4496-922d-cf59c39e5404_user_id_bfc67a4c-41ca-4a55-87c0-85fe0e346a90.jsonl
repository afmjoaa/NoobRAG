{"question":"As a professional photographer and aspiring painter, I'm curious - what similarities exist between establishing tonal values in black & white portrait photography techniques versus oil painting monochromatic underpainting? Por favor, explain the process in both mediums.","answer":"Both mediums prioritize establishing a clear tonal range and shadows first. In photography, proper exposure settings are crucial - photographers must carefully manage highlights and shadows, often shooting in early morning or late evening to avoid harsh direct sunlight that creates awkward shadows. In oil painting's initial stages, artists work with just raw umber (no white) to establish the darkest shadows where no direct light hits the subject. Both disciplines emphasize the importance of squinting to simplify and check tonal values. Photographers use camera settings like aperture and shutter speed to control light, while painters create a mid-tone colored ground and carefully build up from dark to light values. Both require understanding where the light source is coming from and how it affects the subject's form.","context":["So you want to be a photographer? It is a field with many techniques to learn, from how to use your camera to styling a shot. Since photography can be personal, you may not know what can work for you. The tips below can help give you some suggestions.\nLife is in constant motion, so when it comes to snapping photos, don’t hesitate. If you hesitate, you may miss the moment you are trying to capture because of your subject moving. The more rapidly you can photograph your subject, the more likely you are to get your desired shot.\nGet in close to get the most impressive shot. Getting close allows you to avoid distracting backgrounds, and nicely frame your subject. It also has added benefit of capturing facial expressions which can add a whole new element to the picture. Those small, yet important details are often lost when you’re standing too far away.\nTry different digital techniques to come up with wonderful photographs that look like watercolors, oil paintings, and graphic pencil sketches. There are several options when it comes to photo software editing, however, Adobe Photoshop is usually considered the best. After choosing the medium you desire and hitting the filter button, you can instantly turn photographs into wonderful pieces of art.\nDon’t go overboard with complex camera settings. You should try to become knowledgeable about one part of a control, such as shutter speed or aperture, prior to moving on to the next one. You will be able to pivot your effort around the subject you are photographing. This avoids the common time-wasting confusion that ensnares many amateur photographers.\nBe mindful of which and how many objects appear in your photos. High quality pictures will highlight a particular feature of the subject in your photo. You should avoid showing too much when taking a photograph. Instead of taking on single picture, take many pictures of a subject.\nA dSLR is an essential tool if you seek to take more professional photographs or to seriously embrace photography itself. These professional quality cameras allow you to view your photograph as you take the shot. The larger the camera’s frame, the better it is for budding photographers. Try a full-frame camera so that you can get the exact images you want.\nHere is a handy photo tip! When you know how the shutter speed affects your photographs, you can manipulate them to add interest to your pictures. Your camera actually has A,M,S and P settings. The ‘P’ button will take you to the program mode. This “P” setting automatically controls shutter and aperture when you shoot. If you have no clue about what subject you’re photographing, the “P” setting is helpful.\nWhen shooting landscapes, it is important for you to create depth within the image. Have a person or other object put into the foreground in order to gauge the overall scale of the image. Changing the setting for your aperture can give your picture the appearance of high resolution.\nTo enhance your skills, consider reaching out to other photographers and perhaps joining a club. You can pick up certain techniques from others, but you do need to strike out and develop your own style. Compare your pictures with others and see how photos of the same subject can appear different when taken by two different photographers.\nA lot of people consider gorgeous days of abundant sunshine to be ideal for snapping good photos, but direct sunlight is actually a good way to mess up a good picture. It can cast awkward shadows, glare, uneven highlights, and cause your subject to squint when looking at your camera. The best time to capture outdoor shots is either early in the morning or late in the evening.\nBecoming an excellent photographer is a matter of talent, practice and skill, nothing more. Experiment with the settings on your camera to see how they affect the photographs. With digital technology, you can fire away and not feel pressured to retain images that you do not like. Your proficiency will improve as you analyze your shots to see what you could have done differently if you could take the picture again.\nBegin taking pictures upon leaving for a vacation or traveling opportunity. The destination itself should provide plenty of picture-taking opportunities, but if you treat every part of the trip as a photo opportunity, you might get some really interesting shots. Write things down in a journal and you can get ideas at the airport.\nIf you like the creative feeling an old camera gives you, consider buying some vintage gear in a second hand shop. For an even more dramatic effect, ISO rated 200 black and white film offers a great nostalgic quality. By getting your single prints on multiple types of paper, you can view the differences and decide which you prefer.\nMake sure to jot a few notes down with your pictures. When you are looking at your pictures later on, it will be nice to see where the picture was taken, and how you felt when you took it. Carry a notepad with you and take notes about the location and how you felt about it.\nA principle of good composition you should learn is to limit the subject matter in a picture. Why would you want to clutter your shots? There is something special about keeping your photographs simple.\nIf you don’t know a model, try to make them feel as comfortable with you as possible. Many individuals can be suspicious of a photographer’s motives. Make conversation and ask them if you can take their photo. The simple act of conversation can change the perception of the camera from an invasion of privacy to an expression of art.\nIn life, people are trained to always create things that are almost perfectly even. While symmetry and perfection are things people look for, try and take pictures of your subject off center. To create asymmetry, you may need to disable your camera’s auto-focus feature, because it always uses the lens’ center as focal point. Focus manually and lock it up before taking the picture.\nWhen you are capturing the precious moments of a wedding on camera, try taking some of the many unexpected shots to warm up: a makeup bag, the shoes that the bride will wear or the glass of champagne the bride is sipping. You might get some great photos when you are doing this.\nPlay with the notion of scale, perspectives and expressions. If a mundane subject is situated to make it appear out of place or out of proportion with its surroundings, the resulting picture will be especially intriguing. Develop your compositions in order to create a unique outlook on a common object.\nCarefully read the entire manual that came with your camera. The reason is because manuals are very thick and inconvenient to carry around. In most homes, they will be tossed in a junk drawer or even thrown in the garbage. Instead of letting it gather dust, crack it open and give it a look. It can really help you take better pictures and prevent you from making stupid mistakes.\nMake sure your photographs possess three very vital attributes. These three components should be a foreground, mid-ground, and background. These same principles apply to landscape painting.\nMost of the time, when you’re thinking about photographing some item, you have to think about whether you’re going to show more of the shadows or the highlights of it. Although, if you take a picture with each setting, you can use photography software to blend the two together.\nThere are many brands of equipment currently available; however, you should purchase the one that is right for your budget. You do not always need to purchase a top name brand; find the brand that works best for your type of photographs.\nFeel free to try them out, without being too worried about them being perfect, so you do not miss out on a great shot. For the best photographs, don’t use the camera’s presets since this removes your options of making adjustments. Explore your options and use a setting that allows you to change the elements you want to be in control of.\nRed-eye, while seemingly a tiny flaw, can make a photo appear un-frame worthy. To prevent red eye, do not use the flash unless you have to, and have your subject focus his or her gaze somewhere besides the lens. There are cameras available on the market that come with a red eye feature.\nMake sure you are aware of where sharpness appears in the picture and how it works. In general, sharpness will manifest itself mostly towards the center of the lens, as well as center of the image. Sharpness degrades towards the outer edges of your camera frame.\nTake plenty of practice shots when you are adjusting to new subjects or backdrops. No two environments are exactly the same, so practice shots can help you to adjust. You have very little control over your surroundings, so realize that changes in weather or scenery can provide different types of lighting. Make sure to snap plenty of practice shots to make sure you’re getting the right shot.\nTake your time and pose your subject. If you think that your pictures are not as good as they could be, it might be because your photos are too candid. Doing so helps to give you a perfect picture.\nTry different angles to make your photographs more unique. Taking a straight, head-on photo of a subject can be effective, but the alternatives available are nearly endless. Attempt to gain different perspectives by getting over or below your subject. An interesting technique involves framing your shots in a quick, diagonal motion; thus making it appear to have an almost unnatural composition.\nGet closer. When framing your shot, zoom in or move closer to the subject of your shot. Your subject should fill most of the frame of the picture. Despite how scenic the background may be, if there’s too much of it, it can detract focus. If you keep your subject close, its intricacies and specifics can be seen more easily.\nYou can add different filters onto the end of your camera’s lens. You attach filters directly to your lenses and you can use them for many different purposes. The UV filter is the most common one. This type of filter can protect the camera lens from the effects of direct sunlight. It is also intended to protect the lens from being damaged if the camera is dropped.\nA crucial tip when photographing is you need to be sure you hold the camera properly. If you hold the camera improperly, you may get a blurry picture. While resting your arms against your body, grasp the lens using your non-dominant hand.\nLook for landscape objects to place in the front of your frame to make your landscape photos more interesting. Put something easy, like a leaf of a rock in the picture, it will add an interesting element. Your audience will have the impression of looking at the actual landscape, rather than a flat representation of it.\nThis means that you will want to focus on anything that involves exposure, like aperture, film speed, and shutter speed. Your photography will generally improve if you understand the importance of proper exposure.\nTo become a better photo taker, there’s lots of methods you can use. The field of expertise surrounding photography offers ideas for all, but what another shutterhound found useful might not work so well for you. The information above should help you take the first steps on your photography journey.\nA photographer has to get their proper meanings across as an artist. Photographers must shoot the perfect composition, as composition means everything when taking photographs. Through the use of good composition, a photographer can instantly convey their message to anyone viewing their artwork.","How to paint a black & white portrait in Oils\nHave you been practising your portrait drawing for years yet making the jump to oil portrait painting always seems to end in an underwhelming finish?\nOr do you walk around portrait galleries in awe with the question, ‘How do they do that?’\nMaybe you’re frustrated by your process and don’t know how to change it.\nBut you don’t want to draw anymore, you want to paint.\nSo where do you begin?\nA Step by Step approach\nWhy oil portraits?\nThey dry slowly, and for portraits time is essential.\nLet us start at the beginning.\nI’m going to keep things simple.\n- 3 easy techniques to learn.\n- 3 basic paints to use.\nOil paint – for this series of demonstrations I will be using Artist quality oil paints.\n- Raw umber\n- Ivory black\n- Flake white (or Titanium White)\nOil paints are made by mixing ground pigment (the colour) with a drying oil. Most artist quality paints are mixed with cold pressed linseed oil. Whites often are mixed with a different oil, walnut or poppy oil, as they are less yellowing than the linseed oil.\nI’m using Artist quality paints which have a higher pigment quality than student grade paints, you can read about the differences (see the 8 key differences between artist & student grade paint)\nI am using a mixture of brands including Michael Harding, Old Holland & Winsor and Newton.\nSupport – ( what you paint onto)\nFor oil painting, you need to use a support or surface that has been correctly sized or primed. If you are using raw canvas you will need to apply a coat of size. (this protects the canvas fibres from the corrosive nature of the oil) you can also work on board.\nA 5 or 6mm thick piece of MDF can be a great starting point. Prepare the surface with an acrylic gesso, sanding in-between coats, see here how to apply gesso.\nPro tip: Make sure to give all sides of the MDF board a coat of size, especially the edges which can be very absorbent to moisture.\nMany portrait artists prefer to work on linen rather than cotton as you can get a finer weave but for this demonstration, I am using a pre-primed canvas. The actual canvas is a Belle Arti Cotton Canvas.\nBrushes – For this demonstration I’ll be using:\n- Rosemary & co Ivory Filbert – size 4, 2 & 10 (size 6 & 8 are also very handy to have)\n- Rosemary & co Kolinsky Sable series 33 Round – size 3\n- Rosemary & co Kolinsky Sable series 66 Filbert – size 8\nTo learn more about brushes see a quick way to understand brushes\nOil paints increase in transparency with age, even thick opaque colours. To test for yourself, make a few pencil or pen marks on a piece of scrap canvas or board, paint over them opaquely and then take a photograph to see the coverage, check back the next day and then the next week to see if the opacity has changed.\nFor a tonal study, a coloured ground is a must, it helps you to establish the extremes of the painting, the darkest darks and the lightest lights. It also makes it easier for your to judge tones and is a lot more forgiving than a white canvas.\nPro tip: you can of course experiment with a pure white ground for creating an underlying glow to the skin. The Pre-Raphalite painters were fond of this method. Traditionally, the white ground has been used to illuminate the transparent layers of oil colour.\nAcrylic or oil for the ground?\nI have used acrylics in this example. It is a mixture of raw umber and titanium white, notice how it has been applied quite thinly, with some of the white gesso showing through. This is for 2 reasons:\n- I don’t want to loose the ‘tooth’ of the canvas. The tooth is the grain, and texture of the canvas and helps to pull the paint off the brush. If you paint on a smooth prepared board you will notice the difference with the paint feeling like it is ‘sitting on top’ on the surface.\n- You don’t want to create a seal with thick acrylic, you still need the oil to be able to adhere to the surface underneath, so always add water to your acrylic mixture.\nYou could also use quick drying oil paints which are sometimes called Alkyds.\nOr establish a tone just with raw umber and turpentine (or odourless mineral spirits) or standard raw umber and quick drying white.\nWhite pigments dry more slowly than the raw umber which is an earth colour and dries fairly quickly (which is why I recommend a quick drying white above).\nIf you have an underpainting that has too much oil in it, you will be breaking the number 1 rule of oil painting – fat over lean\nWhat is fat over lean?\nA new Paleo diet plan?\nNo, fat over lean is the expression painters use to make sure you prevent your oil painting from cracking.\nIt basically means that each succeeding layer of paint should have more ‘fat – oil’ than the preceding layer.\nIt’s all to do with how oil paints dry.\n- Turpentine or odourless mineral spirit (OMS) dries by evaporation.\n- Oil dries by oxidation – it absorbs oxygen\nFor this first stage, we will be using OMS or Turpentine mixed with the oil paint so it has a ‘lean’ underpainting which will dry quickly.\nWhen we get the next stages of the portrait painting we will be mixing linseed oil with our oil paint and these layers will be more oil-rich, hence ‘fatter’ and will take longer to dry.\nPalette layout and tone\nFor this first ‘blocking in’ of the painting, we will be painting with raw umber only.\nFor further paintings and for a darker finish, a mix between raw umber and ivory black will be used, however, a great deal can be learned by just using raw umber and white.\nThe choice of palette colour can be a deciding factor in your success.\nThe image below shows the different optical effects that happen to the colours depending on the colour or tone of the palette they are placed on. If you were working on a very dark painting – a black palette would be very useful as beginners have the tendency to never go dark enough when they first start painting.\nAnd when you see the raw umber on the white palette you can soon see why, the raw umber looks black.\nFor this painting tutorial, I will be using the mid tone option. A sheet of perspex (3mm thick) that I have just laid on-top of the coloured ground canvas (raw umber & white).\nPlease note: Even though there is white on my palette this is just to illustrate the differences in using a tonal palette. I don’t use white at all in the first section of the painting.\nPro tip: When painting in the studio I have a larger sheet of glass that I can adjust the tones underneath depending in the subject matter. The tones could be a sheet of grey paper, a piece of black card or a section of canvas painted to a mid tone.\nI have chosen a self-portrait, as when you’re first starting you’re more forgiving of any mistakes on yourself.\nThe key points to notice are:\n- a wide tonal range from the bright white of the t-shirt to the dark black of the hair.\n- a single light source so you get a strong cast shadow this can help to create the illusion of depth and interest in your painting.\n- a dark background so the lights on the face will stand out\nDrawing out portraits\nAccurately representing the human face has been an obsession with artists for years and there is still something amazingly compelling about portraiture.\nFor this series, I will be concentrating more on the technical approach using Classical Painting techniques rather than using this as a series on a Portrait Drawing course.\nUsually, the initial issues stem from a lack of knowledge of drawing.\nIf you have studied drawing, or are aware of the powerful tricks your brain can play with you when trying to record something accurately then you are at an advantage for the initial drawing out stage – however, if are more interested in learning the painting techniques then just take your time and sketch as accurately as you can.\nI’ve drawn out the basics of the portrait painting onto the canvas with a 2B pencil and notice how I also draw in the shadow line.\nThe shadow line is where no direct light hits the subject, so the darkest darks. It should be a simple line drawing.\nI gently rubbed over the initial pencil marks with a putty eraser just to leave the faintest of lines. The less graphite you have to mix into the paint the better. Some artists prefer to draw in charcoal, or if you are working on a very photorealist finish a permanent marker with a fine tip can be used. Try to find a brown pen rather than black, as it is more forgiving.\nThe first mix is raw umber diluted with the odourless mineral spirits – OMS. Pure gum turpentine is traditionally used and ‘cuts’ through the oil easier, but if you are working in a confined space with poor ventilation then odourless mineral spirits are a great option. ‘Zest it’ is also nice to use and has a citrus scent.\nFor this example, the reference photo is the same size at the painted image.\nThis approach and technique is associated with the sight-size method and can be very effective when you are first starting portraiture.\nYou don’t have to set up a cast or model from life, just print out your reference image the same size as your canvas and practice working 1: 1. This way you can quickly and easily judge the tones and shapes in your painting, by flicking your eyes between the two images.\nStep 1 – Block in the background\nWorking between a number 2 and number 4 (Filbert Ivory brush) I begin to block in the background. The paint mixture is thin, yet opaque. I dip my brush into the OMS, when I say dip, I mean 2 mm. Just a really tiny amount. I then squeeze the brush tip in some kitchen roll so the brush is damp but not wet.\nI apply the paint with a scrubbing motion, working between the smaller brush for the details, then swapping to the larger brush for the larger areas.\nThe initial ‘scrub in’ is quite loose, just to get a feel for the tone on the canvas. I then work over it with a larger brush to smooth out the tone. We are trying to keep the tones flat and simple so I work over any thicker areas of paint so the surface is more like a stain, rather than thick paint.\nStep 2 – Block in the darkest darks\nI now establish the darkest area in the painting, still just using the raw umber. As I know some of these areas are even darker than the raw umber I can feel the confidence to work with slightly thick paint. Again, not using too much of the OMS, it should feel like a dry brush effect and the more you ‘scrub’ the further the paint will go.\nAreas, where the tones are very close, are kept as one single mass tone. The tendency will be to want to go in and add all the little subtleties and details you are beginning to see.\nLike chocolate on a diet, we have to learn to resist!\nStep 3 – Dry brush in the shadow line\nNotice how when I am applying the paint to the inner parts of the portrait I’m keeping the edges very soft. This is key when building up a portrait with this method. Hard, sharp edges are tough to cover over when you are working with thin layers of oil paint so try and keep your edges soft in these early stages.\nThe tendency now will be to try and grab some white and ‘get painting’ but again this is unwise- remember- start slow, so you can finish quickly.\nCheck the drawing on your painting and check your tones are going along the right lines. You can squint your eyes at the subject which is a very effective method of simplifying tonal values.\nNow have a look at the edges between the background and the edge of the head, notice how the hair and the ear are blurred. The photograph as been taken to mimic how the human eye sees, so soften the edges.\nIf we look at Velasquez’s self-portrait notice how soft and blurred the edge of the hair next to the face is. They blend into each other so your gaze is focused on his gaze.\nStep 4 – Soften the edges\nTo blend an edge take a dry brush (or a brush with a very little OMS if the paint is beginning to dry and you still need to blend it) and gently brush over the line. I often use sables for this, as the softer hairs enable a smoother blend. The Ivory filberts are slightly softer than a pure hog brush so are still very useful when blending, you just need to use a lighter touch.\nI sometimes also use a piece of kitchen roll (ideally lint free) or a cotton rag to take the edge off. And sometimes only a finger will do just to get that subtle blend (If you like the effect of using your finger for blending then make sure you apply barrier cream before you start your painting session. Be aware to wash your hands. I know I sound like your mum, but the lead used in some of the paints can be dangerous if persistently having skin contact.\nStep 5 – Add more shadow detail\nI now put some more of the shadows into the portrait using the smaller round sable, at this stage I’m concentrating on the areas that would receive no direct light.\nIt is important to identify what falls into dark shadows and mid tones and it is not as easy as it sounds. Really study your reference image and say to yourself:\n‘If I could only paint in pure black and pure white, what would I choose ?’\nEverything that falls into the black category is what we are concerned with at this stage.\nSo even though some areas on my cheek are dark, I don’t put those in yet because they are halftones and will come as the portrait progresses.\nYou want to try and keep your darkest shadows one dark tone so when you come to put in the halftones you will have more scope to model the form.\nI’m still keeping a flat tone and a dry brush so the effect is very soft.\nStep 6 – Using a smaller brush\nMore detail, checking the drawing and adding dark to the eyes, lips and collar bone.\nStep 7 – Refining shadows\nI now step back from the painting and squint my eyes, I flick my eyes between the reference photo and the painting and adjust any hard edges and drawing.\nStep 8 – Checking edges and having a cup of tea\nIt is really important when painting oil portraits to give your eyes a break, go and have a cup of tea, come back and make your final tweaks and leave this stage to dry overnight.\nBrilliant, our first stage is done.\nYou might also like:\n1.

{"question":"Could you compare how U.S. courts use historical evidence in Article V interpretation versus how AP U.S. Government exam assesses Supreme Court precedents?","answer":"Both contexts emphasize historical analysis but in different ways. Courts have consistently used historical practice to interpret Article V terms like 'legislature' and 'ratify' for over two centuries, as seen in cases like Hawke v. Smith (1920) and Leser v. Garnett (1922). Meanwhile, the AP U.S. Government exam specifically tests students on landmark Supreme Court cases, requiring analysis of 15 required cases like McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) and Marbury v. Madison (1803) as part of its curriculum. While courts actively use history to resolve constitutional questions, the AP exam focuses on teaching students to understand and compare historical precedents.","context":["In 1988, Oxford University Press published Russell Caplan’s book Constitutional Brinksmanship. It revealed some of the extensive history behind the Convention for Proposing Amendments in Article V of the Constitution.\nMore recently, we have learned much more about that history. We now know that there were over 30 multi-colony and multi-state conventions before the Constitution was adopted, and that the Convention for Proposing Amendments was based on them. We know what their rules were and how they used the terms that the Framers used in Article V. We also have uncovered a rich history of multi-state conventions and Article V activity after the Constitution was adopted.\nAnti-convention alarmists were generally unaware of this history and have been embarrassed by these findings. Some of them, therefore, are now making the astounding claim that all of this prior practice is simply irrelevant!\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court says they are wrong. So do many other courts. In fact, for over two centuries now, the judiciary has used historical practice to interpret the words in Article V. The courts know that they must consult the Founders’ experience to understand how they used terms like “legislature,” “application,” “call,” “ratify, and “convention.” When that evidence isn’t decisive, the courts turn to later practice for guidance. This is settled constitutional law.\nAnd as any constitutional lawyer can tell you, in recent years the Supreme Court has become even more attuned to history in answering constitutional questions.\nSince the courts may have to resolve future Article V issues, their precedents provide far more insight than the unsupported speculations of alarmists.\nListed below are a few of the cases that have used history to interpret Article V.

{"question":"How is packaging material reduction achieved in healthcare and what are the manufacturer's responsibilities for packaging specifications?","answer":"Healthcare packaging material reduction is achieved through advances in materials technology, using thinner or lighter materials through laminates and coextrusions, along with new polymers and additives, potentially reducing packaging by 20-50%. Manufacturers are responsible for providing detailed packaging specifications including measurements for user convenience, proper labeling position for warehouse efficiency, bar code information conforming to industry standards, and ensuring packaging is compatible with standard units of purchase that distributors and customers are familiar with.","context":["The main purpose of Electrical Wholesaling's annual Source Book is to give electrical distributors basic contact information for the electrical and electronic equipment manufacturers that sell their products through distribution. Once distributors have found a potential new manufacturer, they must evaluate whether that company will make a good partner.\nThat's where this checklist comes in. Because of all the merger and acquisition activity on the manufacturer and distributor ends of the market spectrum, it's tougher than ever for these business partners to establish productive, long-term working relationships with each other.

However, the demands placed on many types of healthcare packaging preclude some of these sustainable initiatives. The mantra of ‘Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle’ is severely limited by FDA and EU regulatory requirements for healthcare packaging. For example, there are significant restrictions on reuse or recycling of materials for healthcare products and their packaging. Compostable packaging materials are currently unlikely candidates for healthcare packaging due to concerns about shelf life limitations and sterilization compatibility.\nOn a more positive note, continued advances in materials have made and may continue to make it possible to reduce the amount of packaging used. It is often possible to use thinner or lighter materials for packaging through the use of laminates and coextrusions as well as using newly available polymers, copolymers and additives. These new materials often perform at such a high level that reductions in the amounts of packaging used can reach 20 to 50% depending on the application and existing package structure and sterile barrier system. Because of the potential for cost savings involved, this type of packaging reduction has gone on for many years. Yet, there are still opportunities to reduce the amount of packaging used in many healthcare applications. In addition, package reduction can also be achieved by changes to package design and/or package format.\nWhile the feasibility of including recycled materials into healthcare packaging remains dubious given the current regulatory environment, the potential to recycle healthcare packaging into other applications is more promising. There exists a significant quantity of potentially recyclable material that is lost to landfill due to lack of infrastructure to capture it in a way that would facilitate recycling. The lack of a defined cost effective recycle stream for these materials is a contributing reason for this loss.\nAn additional option is for materials to be channeled into an energy recovery system. In this process materials are incinerated and the energy released in burning is converted to generate electricity. This option does not have the same limitations of materials streams as the recycle process in terms of multi-layers film structures. The EPA identifies that 90% of all potentially infectious medical waste in the US is incinerated. A move towards making this practice into energy recovery systems may offer a better alternative to landfill waste of medical packaging systems.\nAn encouraging development is the recent establishment of industry related groups focused on sustainability in healthcare. The Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC) is one organization. The HPRC website describes the group as follows: “HPRC is a private technical coalition of peers across the healthcare, recycling and waste management industries seeking to inspire and enable sustainable, cost-effective recycling solutions for plastic products and materials used in the delivery of healthcare.” Another organization of note is Practice Greenhealth. The website describes this organization as follows: “Practice Greenhealth is the source for environmental solutions for the healthcare sector and lends support to create better, safer, greener workplaces and communities. Practice Greenhealth is a nonprofit membership organization founded on the principles of positive environmental stewardship and best practices by organizations in the healthcare community.” The Flexible Packaging Association (FPA) has also been actively engaged in pursuing the end of life options for food and medical packaging.\nAn evolving area to explore in packaging sustainability is the source of the raw materials. While recycled materials are not suitable for healthcare packaging, the use of raw materials from sustainable sources can be explored further. One source of sustainable materials suitable for healthcare packaging is familiar polymers made from new sources of hydrocarbons. For instance large scale production of polyethylene using sugar cane as the raw material has recently become a reality. Other similar processes will likely be developed over the next few years to produce other common polymers from sustainable sources, not petroleum or natural gas. Of course, any new material must be tested to prove its suitability for the intended use. If the basic polymer chemistry is unchanged, there is a high likelihood that these new materials will perform like their petroleum based analogs. The new materials lack long term performance data making the willingness for assuming initial risk a potential barrier.\nReferring back to the definition above, “Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” As this relates to packaging it should be noted that the system that creates our ability to package and protect healthcare products, must be evaluated on the broadest possible scale; what materials are used to make the package, how efficiently can it be made to benefit the environment and at the same time provide product protection, maintenance of sterility and aseptic presentation. Consider also available options for end-of-life removal and destruction of the packaging to recover the components with a lower consumption of resources. The manufacture, use and removal of these materials have a broad environmental impact that should be considered.\nAny interest in sustainable packaging should be discussed with your packaging supplier to help determine what options for sustainability are best for your application."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d3e833a2-4c06-4108-84fa-2f828aaac3bc>","<urn:uuid:d4dc8af3-c53d-4a30-805a-30aa15bcb173>"],"error":null}

From 2000 to 2006 the Bulgarian Cultural Institute was publishing the \"Bulgarian News\" newspaper.\n2009 was declared a Year of Bulgaria in Russia. The Festival of the Bulgarian Culture, organized by the Ministry of Culture of Republic of Bulgaria with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation was an essential part of its rich program, presenting different aspects of the socio-political, economic and cultural life in Bulgaria.\nBulgarian Cultural Institute took active part in realization of the numerous events in the frames of the festival which were held not only in the capital but also in many other regions of Russia.\nThe activities of the Bulgarian Cultural Institute in Moscow is characterized by numerous initiatives inspired by historical events included in the calendars of both countries, particular events, anniversaries of institutions and personalities, official visits of representatives of Bulgarian cultural sphere.\nThe activities of the Bulgarian Cultural Institute in Moscow include a wide range of events - from the regular monthly program and guests appearances to active contacts with different Russian institutions and international organizations organizing various cultural events. In the period of financial restrictions the \"mutual initiatives\" formula is a good way for successful realization of a given event ensuring wide publicity.","News 17-05 (No.353)\nIssued : May 25, 2017\nLa Seine Musicale sets sail in Boulogne-Billancourt (France)\nBy Marc Quiquerez\nLa Seine Musicale, a brand-new music center set on Ile Seguin in Boulogne-Billancourt, just west of Paris, celebrated its opening on April 22nd 2017.\n<< Project background and timeline >>\nThe project was initiated in 2011 by the “Conseil Départemental des Hauts-de-Seine”, the local administrative division covering the western inner suburbs of Paris.

The selection process involved three groups led by the major construction companies in France, teaming up with high profile architects and design specialists. It concluded with the selection of the proposal developed by Shigeru Ban Architects Europe and Jean de Gastines Architects and their design team. The team was assembled and organized by global construction firm Bouygues Bâtiment IDF. Construction broke ground in July 2014 and the building was handed over to the client and operator in January 2017.\nThroughout the competition and project, Nagata Acoustics served as acoustical consultant in the design team for room acoustics of the music rooms. Paris-based Lamoureux Acoustics provided acoustical consulting services for sound isolation and noise control. Theater consulting services were provided by dUCKS Scéno, from Lyon (France).\n<< An insular stage on a musical river >>\nWhen approaching the building, one is immediately startled by its unique silhouette. Borrowing from the imposing scale of a cruise ship as well as the light and dynamic profile of a sail boat, La Seine Musicale stretches along more than 320 meters and offers its two flanks to the views of Boulogne to the North and the hills of Meudon to the South. It follows on from the urban planning concept established by Ateliers Jean Nouvel in 2010. It is also inspired by the industrial history of the island, which was the site of Renault car factory for more than half a century. Over a site of 2.5 hectares, the building develops a built surface area of 36,500 square meters.\nAs visitors set foot on the island, they are greeted by an ample public square overlooked by a massive LED screen. To its left, a wide staircase leads up to a landscaped garden of more than 7,000 square meters crowning the building. To its right, a monumental glazed gate leads to the inner street crossing the building on its North side and serving the different spaces and functions of the building.\nLaid at the downstream end of the island as a beacon, the main visual symbol of the building is without doubt the 1,150-seat Auditorium. Nested in a woven structure of wood and glass, the transparent egg-like shape reveals to the outside the iridescent green of the mosaic covering the shell of the hall. On the inside, the audience foyer running around the shell offers panoramic views to the river and the garden. On the upstream side of the egg, a magnificent sail covered by 800 square meters of solar panels follows the sun to provide energy to the building and shadows to the foyer.\n<< The design of the Auditorium >>\nAuditorium - view from balcony\nAuditorium - view from choir\nAuditorium - plan and long cross section\nFrom the onset of the design, the clear goal set by the team was to create an intimate and warm concert experience, emphasizing the proximity of audience and performers. Drawing inspiration from vineyard designs, the audience layout naturally developed in a surround-type hall. The main floor rises with a steep rake in distinct blocks delimited by terrace walls providing essential early reflections to the listeners. A first ring of seating connects to the rear of the main floor and wraps around the stage. Above, a narrow balcony creates a second ring of seating, and contributes to providing useful early reflections to the audience and the stage.\nUpon entering the hall, one is welcomed by the warmth of honey-colored wood lining the walls in alternating waving stripes, creating different visual rhythms along the walls and providing the sound scattering irregularities contributing to the warmth of sound. As the eyes sweep the hall, they meet the curves of the seats with their red velvet cylindrical cushions inspired by the paper tubes that have become one of the signatures of Shigeru Ban’s designs. But one of the most breathtaking sights remains the 1,000 suspended wooden hexagons. They encircle cuts of paper tubes of various sizes, and project their shadows upon the immaculately white curves of the ceiling above. The unusual waves of this massive acoustical ceiling were carefully studied, as well as other detailed geometrical features of the hall, with the help of our proprietary 3D simulation software as well as acoustical testing of a 1:20 scale physical model. The combination of these tools allowed us to analyze the distribution of early sound reflections in the hall and to prevent the occurrence of detrimental echoes on the stage and in the audience.\nDesigned to accommodate a full-size orchestra, the stage is equipped with 29 motorized risers for orchestra and choir. The hall also features an orchestra pit and 3 movable catwalks which can be lowered from the ceiling to create additional lighting positions. A collection of retractable acoustical curtains in the walls and movable catwalks offer acoustical variability for programs with amplified sound.\n<< Other facilities >>\nUnder the Auditorium, and in direct connection with the stage, the resident ensemble Insula Orchestra will find rehearsal rooms for individual, sectional and full orchestra practice, as well as administrative offices.\nIn close proximity, a collection of music rooms of various sizes (including one suitable for full orchestra and one dance studio) will be available as rental for rehearsals and recordings.\nThe larger hall in the facility, “La Grande Seine”, immediately exposes the underside of its seating tiers to the inner street and main foyer. Concealed under the roof garden and dedicated to large scale events and concerts with sound amplification, it can accommodate seated audience of 4,000 people, and up to 6,000 people with standing audience. Its fan-shape design with steep rakes ensures a sense of proximity to the stage, while the curved layout emphasizes the sense of communion and sharing.\nDirectly facing the entrance plaza, the Maîtrise des Hauts-de-Seine, official children choir of Paris National Opera, will benefit from more than 10 practice and teaching rooms, including a large rehearsal room which can accommodate up to 500 singers and staged rehearsals.\nShops and cafes opened to a promenade along the river bank.\n<< Inaugural week and evening, symbols of the project’s ambitions and promises >>\nFollowing the opening ceremony, the inaugural concert in the Auditorium was performed by La Seine Musicale resident ensemble, Insula Orchestra, conducted by music director and founder Maestro Laurence Equilbey, accompanied by four solo singers, Accentus choir and pianist B. Chamayou. The 90-minute concert featured pieces by W.A. Mozart, C. M. von Weber and L. van Beethoven. It offered a wonderful display of the acoustical qualities that the client and design team had set as our goal, with a rich, warm and clear sound, beautifully balancing instrumental ensemble and voices.\nWe are very proud to have taken part in this exciting and ambitious project which, after the new Auditorium of Radio France in late 2014 and Philharmonie de Paris in early 2015, offers yet another unique musical destination for music lovers in Paris, its region and beyond.\nThe URL for La Seine Musicale： http://www.laseinemusicale.com\nMusashino Academia Musicae’s New Ekoda Campus\nBy Fumiaki Sakamaki\nEkoda campus viewed from its South Gate\nThis past April, as the new Japanese school year began, Musashino Academia Musicae welcomed students to its recently completed Ekoda Campus. The new campus project preserved just one of the previously existing campus’ buildings, the 1043-seat Beethoven Hall. The other buildings on the campus have all been replaced by the recently completed project.\nThe newly constructed campus buildings house a 423-seat concert hall named Brahms Hall and the recital and chamber music hall that seats an audience of 100 persons. The chamber music hall is named Mozart Hall, the school’s third hall to bear this name. In addition to these facilities, the campus has three rehearsal rooms—one each for orchestra, chorus, and wind ensemble—as well as multiple classrooms and practice rooms, a library, a musical instrument museum and a range of support rooms.\nThe interior courtyard named Liszt Plaza\nThe Ekoda Campus is located in a quiet, residential neighborhood in western Tokyo. The campus buildings surround the campus’ Liszt Plaza, an interior courtyard which was built at an elevation one level below the ground level outside of the campus. The plaza will serve as a lively outdoor space where students can meet and congregate, so its below-grade elevation and the campus layout of school buildings that surround the plaza together demonstrate the consideration the architects gave to how the project would preserve the quiet nearby neighborhood environment.\nObayashi Corporation led the design and construction of this design-build project. Nagata Acoustics provided full acoustical consulting services primarily for Beethoven Hall and Brahms Hall from the basic design phase through construction and post-construction acoustical measuring and evaluations.\n<< Beethoven Hall Renovation and Retrofit >>\nExterior of Beethoven Hall\nView of Beethoven Hall stage from side balcony seating\nBeethoven Hall interior viewed from the stage\nBeethoven Hall was originally built in 1960 and, when the Ekoda Campus renovation project began, had more than 50 years of history as a beloved concert hall with excellent acoustics. For this project, our mission was to preserve the familiar, excellent atmosphere and acoustical characteristics of the hall.\nThe scope of the renovations and retrofit included upgrades to improve the seismic safety and fire-prevention of the building. Also, the project replaced various equipment and systems to make the hall more comfortable for audiences and performers and to improve the level of quietness in the hall. An elevator and wheelchair access routes were added to make the hall a barrier free environment.\nCeiling of the hall also required fall prevention from an earthquake, without deteriorating its excellent acoustics. From structural point of view, nets were set below the existing mortar ceiling to stop the ceiling from falling instantly. Then from visual perspective, acrylic resin was applied over the net and were integrated to the mortar ceiling, which made the nets almost invisible.\nAcrylic resin is a relatively soft material and the addition of this material as the finished surface of large portions of the hall’s ceiling would have changed the acoustic properties of the hall’s ceiling.\nTo address the concern, during the construction phase of the project a 1:1 mock-up of a portion of the ceiling was made using the planned construction methods for construction and visual inspection, and some small samples were cut out for testing vertical incident sound absorption coefficient with different variation of acrylic resin. After all the testing, we chose acrylic resin with silica sand mixing that hardens on surface for the application.\nWhile the basic premise of our design included making no major changes to Beethoven Hall’s reverberation characteristic, we did make some relatively minor improvements to enhance this venue’s appropriateness for the performance of classical music. Specifically, by eliminating a portion of the perforated panels that are installed at the rear of the auditorium on the ceiling above the audience seating, we succeeded in slightly lengthening the hall’s reverberation time. The renovated hall’s reverberation time (in an empty hall, at 500 Hz) measures 1.9 seconds, which is 0.1 seconds longer than before the renovations.\n<< The New Brahms Hall >>\nExterior of Brahms Hall\nView of Brahms Hall stage from rear audience seating\nA view of the Brahms Hall interior\nfocusing on its unique ceiling configuration\nBrahms Hall Foyer with crystal ceiling light fixtures\nfrom the original Mozart Hall\nThe entirely new Brahms Hall has an audience seating area with a single slope from front to back and 423 seats. Considerations of shadow impacts to the neighborhood meant that our room design of this hall needed to be developed within some difficult constraints on the hall’s ceiling height. Working within the constraints, and in order to obtain the rich acoustics appropriate for a classical music concert hall, we designed the space to have the maximally allowed ceiling height.\nAt its highest point, the Brahms Hall ceiling measures 14 meters (46 feet) from the stage. The ceiling slopes gently downward from this high point towards the rear of the audience seating and the side walls, creating a unique ceiling configuration of four triangular surfaces. The indirect lighting installed at the joints of the ceiling’s surfaces and at the upper portions of the side walls give the hall an impressive appearance.\nTo obtain abundant early sound reflections, we tilted the hall’s side walls outward and we designed the surfaces of the walls so that the early sound reflections effectively reach the stage and the audience seating. The specially designed sound-reflecting surface of the side walls intentionally contains a variety of materials that have different acoustical properties, including wood veneer plywood, ribbed wood material, Japanese Oya stone and Mikage stone, porcelain tile and glass. The design of the side walls surface that combines all of these diverse materials gives a contemporary look to the hall’s interior.\nThe spatial volume of Brahms Hall measures some 6,000 cubic meters (212,000 cubic feet), which equates to 14 cubic meters (500 cubic feet) of space per seat. These measurements provide ample spatial volume for the hall’s intended use of non-amplified musical performances. Because the hall is part of a school campus, it will likely also be used for some classes and exams, so we designed the hall to not have an overly long reverberation time. To accomplish this objective we placed sound absorbing elements in various, dispersed locations around the hall on portions of the walls—including the side walls—where the surfaces do not contribute to promoting sound reflections. In this way, we achieved the desired level of control for the sound reverberation characteristic.\n<< Two Halls with One Reverberation Time and Different Personalities >>\nThe completed Brahms Hall has a reverberation time of 1.9 seconds (in an empty hall at 500 Hz). The rich reverberation time we achieved provides the appropriate acoustical environment for classical music concerts.\nRemarkably, the reverberation times of Brahms Hall and Beethoven Hall, which has a spatial volume of 8,500 cubic meters (300,000 cubic feet), are the same 1.9 seconds (in an empty hall, at 500 Hz), even though the two halls differ in audience seating capacity and spatial volume. What is fascinating about these halls is the very different acoustical impression experienced in each of the two halls. The Beethoven Hall acoustics are bright and expansive, while Brahms Hall has acoustics that sound delicate and intricately precise. Single reverberation time alone cannot explain or define the two halls and their acoustics that now coexist on the same Musashino Academia Musicae Ekoda Campus.\n<< Opening Concert in Brahms Hall >>\nThe Brahms Hall inaugural concert was held on Monday, April 17, 2017. The program featured the woodwind ensemble of Musashino Academia Musicae teachers.\nIn the foyer of Brahms Hall, the school’s original Mozart Hall crystal chandeliers—from the building that completed in 1960—glistened from the new foyer’s ceiling, reinstalled as a symbol of Musashino Academia Musicae’s traditions. The chandeliers keep the school’s history alive and felt by all visitors to the foyer. In 2019, the school will celebrate its 90th anniversary. Even as the anniversary approaches, Musashino Academia Musicae begins a rebirth on its new Ekoda Campus.\nThe URL for Musashino Academia Musicae is http://www.musashino-music.ac.jp/\nNagata Acoustics Inc.\nHongo Segawa Bldg. 3F, 2-35-10 Hongo\nBunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan\nTel: +81-3-5800-2671, Fax: +81-3-5800-2672\n1990 S.

Certain high school courses, such as mathematics and mechanical drawing, may be useful. Some vocational-technical schools offer associate’s degrees in carpentry. The programs vary in length and teach basics and specialties in carpentry.\nCarpenters typically learn on the job or through apprenticeships. They often begin doing simple tasks, such as measuring and cutting wood, under the guidance of experienced carpenters or other construction workers. They then progress to more complex tasks, such as reading blueprints and building wooden structures.\nSeveral groups, such as unions and contractor associations, sponsor apprenticeship programs. For each year of a typical program, apprentices must complete a predetermined number of hours of technical training and paid on-the-job training. Apprenticeship program requirements differ based on the type of program and by region. Apprentices learn carpentry basics, blueprint reading, mathematics, building code requirements, and safety and first aid practices. They also may receive specialized training in creating and setting concrete forms, rigging, welding, scaffold building, and working within confined workspaces. All carpenters must pass the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 10-hour safety course.\nWork Experience in a Related Occupation\nSome carpenters work as construction laborers or helpers before becoming carpenters. Laborers and helpers learn tasks that are similar to those of carpenters.\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\nCarpenters may need a driver’s license to travel to jobsites.\nOptional programs offer certification by specialty that may allow carpenters to find additional work opportunities or lead to career advancement. For example, the National Association of the Remodeling Industry offers various levels of certification for remodeling. The National Wood Flooring Association offers certification for installers, craftsman, and master craftsman.\nCarpenters are involved in many phases of construction and may have opportunities to become first-line supervisors, lead carpenters, independent contractors, or general construction supervisors.\nBusiness skills. Self-employed carpenters must conduct activities such as bidding on new jobs, tracking inventory, and directing workers.\nDetail oriented. Carpenters must be able to precisely cut, measure, and modify the materials they work with.\nDexterity. Carpenters use many tools and need hand-eye coordination to avoid injuring themselves or damaging materials.\nInterpersonal skills. Carpenters need to work as a member of a team, cooperating with and assisting others. They also may interact with customers.\nMath skills. Carpenters frequently use math skills, including basic trigonometry, to calculate the area, size, and amount of material needed for the job.\nPhysical strength. Carpenters use heavy tools and materials that weigh up to 100 pounds. They also must be able to stand, climb, or bend for many hours.\nProblem-solving skills. Carpenters may work independently with little guidance. They need to be able to modify building materials and make adjustments onsite to complete projects.\nReading comprehension skills. Carpenters need advanced reading ability to understand and follow complex instructions for installing certain products, such as doors."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:74e2357f-9ede-4364-82cc-7f049b510782>","<urn:uuid:d6334f1b-c861-45db-b14e-339756e1c007>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do orange and lemon trees differ in their structural strength and fruit-bearing characteristics when it comes to pruning considerations?","answer":"Orange and lemon trees have distinct structural and fruit-bearing characteristics that affect their pruning needs. Orange trees require more extensive pruning of the upper branches because these are the main fruit-producing areas, and without proper pruning, they can become tall and lanky, affecting fruit production. In contrast, lemon trees have naturally strong wood that is less likely to break under the weight of fruit, and they can produce fruit throughout the tree, even in shaded areas. While orange trees need pruning to ensure sunlight reaches the middle branches for better fruit production, lemon trees don't necessarily require pruning for light availability since they can fruit effectively even in shaded areas. Both types of trees should not be pruned more than one-third each year to maintain their health and productivity.","context":["Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this segment we're going to talk about orange tree pruning. Now orange trees are such a beautiful plant and they're great to grow if you live in a warm climate you can leave them outside, if you live in a cold climate, you can always grow them outside and leave them in the greenhouse or the garage for the winter and they'll usually survive. And in warm climates they actually produce fruit and bloom in the wintertime. So the best time to prune them is when they're not producing fruit. So that would be actually in the fall or even in the late summer so that they will produce the fruit for the next year. So there's some simple rules that you can follow. So when you're pruning any kind of fruit tree, the goal is to cut out a lot of the random branches towards the top of the tree because those are usually the more fruity branches that's going to produce the more fruit and you want to thin it out about one third the size each year. And that way it won't just get tall and lanky and it will fill up and you will get a lot more fruit quicker. And so just by cutting out see the lighter colored branches, you can get lot more fruit and you just trim them out and even it out so there's more sun that gets into the middle branches and the tree will do much better. If you have a fruit tree that's been established and it's really tall and not producing fruit and you have not pruned it very much, then you can actually cut out some of the top branches and what you're making is called a vase cut. By doing that, you're forcing most of the growth back down to the bottom part of the tree and you'll get a lot more fruit for the next year. So when you're pruning any type of a tree, you want to be really careful to cut it at the right angle. For example, if it's a large branch, you want to cut first at one side and then the other side and then you're cutting that whole heavy branch off. Because if you just cut from one angle it might actually hurt some of the bark and get into the main trunk and you never want to hurt the main trunk because you will lose a tree if it gets too damaged. And you don't want to cut it too far out either where the C D cut is because what happens is then it gets too much moisture and it will rot and there's too much dead material. You want to cut it right at a little bit of an angle leaving one to two inches right at where the tree is reading with the main trunk. Same thing, you never want to cut right up to the trunk line and make a solid cut because what happens is the tree gets very damaged and sometimes it will eventually kill the tree because it doesn't have bark to protect the main trunk and that is what's needed. So by just cutting some of the dead branches out and thinning your tree not more than one third each year, you will find you will get lots more oranges for the following year.","Deciduous fruiting trees need to be pruned to improve branch set, reduce the possibility of breaking from heavy fruit, increase aeration and light availability, and to improve the overall quality of the fruit. Like other fruiting trees, cutting back lemon trees will foster healthier fruit. The question is, how to prune a lemon tree and when is the best time to prune lemon trees?\nAbout Lemon Tree Pruning\nWhile pruning lemon trees back will engender larger, healthier fruit, citrus wood is strong, and thus, less likely to break under the weight of a bumper crop than other fruiting trees. Citrus trees can also fruit throughout the tree, including shaded areas, so cutting back lemon trees to improve light availability is not necessary. That said, lemon trees should still be pruned on occasion.\nYoung trees should have any sprouts removed and any weak limbs pruned out. Adult trees should also have sprouts regularly pruned out, as well as any dead wood or crossing limbs. The lemon may also need to have its light penetration improved by pruning the lemon tree back.\nWhen is the Best Time to Prune Lemon Trees?\nIt’s important to prune at the right time, lest you risk losing the year’s yield. Lemon tree pruning should occur after it has produced the fall harvest to give it plenty of time to recover prior to the next season’s harvest.\nIf you live in a warm climate, you have a bit more leeway on exactly when to prune; just don’t do it when it’s roasting hot. For everyone else, February through April are the best pruning months. On the whole, however, you can prune any time the tree is producing flowers.\nHow to Prune a Lemon Tree\nWhen cutting back lemon trees, be sure to use very sharp clean pruning shears or saws, and gloves are helpful to protect you from thorns. While the wood of citrus is very strong, the bark is thin and easy to damage. Always make any pruning cuts with the blade toward the tree to reduce nicking the tree.\nDon’t cut the branch flush with the trunk or larger branch. The goal is to preserve the branch collar (the area around the base of a large limb that appears as wrinkled or ridged bark). This area is called the “branch defense zone” and contains cells that activate the callus tissue (wound wood) that grows over a pruning cut and defends the tree against decay.\nYou should use a three-cut system for any branches that are bigger than an inch to prevent damaging the bark.\n- To begin, start with an angled cut 10-12 inches out from the branch union.\n- Cut a third of the way through the branch from the other side – an undercut.\n- Finally, move a few inches up the length of the branch and cut from above, severing the branch.\nNever prune more than one-third of the tree in a year. Begin pruning the lemon in its first or second year to train it to grow how you want it. Trees should be kept around 8-10 feet in height to make it easier to harvest and care for. Don’t be hasty and prune out healthy branches. There is no need.\nPruning container grown lemon trees is much the same as those grown in the orchard.

She kicked two points in the fourth quarter during a game against Texas State University on August 30, 2003.","context":["Not even 30 years ago, before Title IX of the Education Act was passed in 1988, only a paltry two percent of female college students participated in sports. That's an almost unthinkable reality these days: While it's true that male athletes have historically dominated score boards and record books, their female counterparts are holding their own. (Trophies, that is.) These 12 women went head-to-head against the patriarchy and leveled the playing field.\nOn June 8, 1975, boxer Jackie Tonawanda was the first woman to fight in New York's Madison Square Garden. She went up against Larry Rodania—and knocked him out in the second round. After that, she was dubbed \"the female Muhammad Ali.\"\nOn August 30, 2003, Katie Hnida became the first woman to score points in an NCAA Division 1-A college football game as kicker for the New Mexico Lobos at the University of New Mexico. In a game against Texas State University, Hnida kicked two points in the fourth quarter. Hnida was only the second woman to ever dress in a college football uniform in the U.S. Today, the number of women asked to play in the NCAA remains low, but Hnida helped prove that women can score points alongside the guys.\nIn 1973, pros Billy Jean King and Bobby Riggs faced off in a tennis game that became known as \"The Battle of the Sexes.\" Fifty million people in the U.S. and 90 million worldwide watched 29-year-old King play against 55-year-old Riggs at the Houston Astrodome. At stake? A winner's prize of $100,000. King made a stunning comeback after falling behind during the first set. She won all three sets, winning 6 to 3 in the third set. Female tennis plays are now more accepted, but similar \"Battles of the Sexes\" have taken place since King bested Riggs, including in 2013 when Chinese tennis pro Li Na beat Novak Djokovic 3-2.\nDanica Patrick is not only considered the most successful woman in the history of American car racing, but she is one of the few female race car drivers to ever turn a wheel. Patrick, who has been stock car racing since her youth, won the Indy Japan 300 in 2008, becoming the first and only woman to win an IndyCar Series race. In 2009, Patrick placed third in the Indianapolis 500 and marked the highest finish by a female driver in that race. She's continued to set records: In 2013, she became the first female NASCAR driver to take a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series pole in the 2013 Daytona 500; her eighth place finish is the highest finish for a woman in that race to date.\nWrestler Jeff Jarrett was notorious for degrading women both in and out of the ring. But he got his just desserts in 1999 when he battled female wrestler Chyna in a World Wrestling Federation match titled \"No Mercy.\" The participants were allowed to use household objects hit each other, and Chyna eventually pinned Jarrett for the victory. She became the first woman to hold the WWF Intercontinental Champion title and, more importantly, put Jarrett in his place.\nIn 2008, 16-year-old pitcher Eri Yoshida was drafted to the Kobe 9 Cruise, becoming the first woman ever drafted by a Japanese professional baseball team. In 2010, Yoshida became the third woman in history and the first Japanese woman to play in the U.S. male professional baseball leagues on Chico Outlaws, part of minor league Golden Baseball League.

{"question":"What are the key differences between installing a retaining wall versus a metal building in terms of foundation levelness requirements?","answer":"For a retaining wall, achieving perfect levelness is critical specifically in the base layer, requiring a 6-inch trench with 2-3 inches of sand or crusher dust that must be firmly tamped down. In contrast, for metal buildings, the entire ground surface needs to have less than 3 inches of slope in any direction, with some municipal codes requiring a specific slope of one-eighth to half-inch per foot for drainage purposes.","context":["Looking for something to do for Father's Day? How about building a short retaining wall out in the garden? Sounds like a lot of work? Yep, it is. But it is worth all of the blood, sweat, and tears. Let's just hope we can keep the blood and tears to a minimum.\nThere are lots of different ways a retaining wall can solve problems. If your yard has a slope that is under three feet, a wall can help break things up. Measure the space you want to fill. If you aren't sure how the wall will look, lay a garden hose on the grass in its place so you can get a feel for how you want the wall to go. A can of spray paint or a bag of flour also can be used to make a line in the grass to keep you on track. Stakes and a long string create a straight line for a simple wall.\nYou can make the wall as long as you want, but the key is not to go any higher than three feet. If you want a taller one, check with a professional to make sure your wall is engineered to handle water drainage, heavy winter snow, and shifting soil.\nYou can make a retaining wall out of lots of materials, including wooden landscape ties, stone, concrete blocks, and bricks. No matter what type of material you use, begin with a plan on paper.\nDon't build a wall around the base of a tree or in an area with poor drainage. You may end up with more problems in the future.\nConcrete pavers are a quick way to build a short wall or a raised area around the yard. They are made to create gentle curves or straight lines and have indentations and bumps so they will fit together like a puzzle. But you have to work \"with\" the material, not against it. I've walked through some gardens where the do-it-yourselfer installed the bricks backwards. Instead of gently sloping back into the bed, the stones pushed forward. That kind of mistake can result in a failing wall and even injuries if the pavers fall over.\nMeasure the length of the wall you are going to build. Take those measurements to your favorite home and garden center and they will help you get enough material to build the wall. Get a few extra pieces just in case some are broken or don't fit properly.\nBefore you stick your shovel in the ground, call your local utility company to mark the underground lines. You wouldn't want to dig up the phone line, would you? (Not that I have done that before!)\nGet the shovel out and dig a six-inch trench a little wider than the stone. Try to keep the bottom of it as level as you can. Add a two to three-inch layer of sand or crusher dust from a home and garden center and tamp it down so it is firm. Now you are ready to start building.\nA level base is key, so have a rubber mallet or hammer handy to keep the bottom layer as level as possible. Spend extra time making sure things are perfect at this stage; it will make your job a whole lot easier as the wall gets taller.\nStart laying the first row of pavers into the trench. When you get to the end, you might have to cut a paver in half with a chisel and hammer. You want the next row to stagger on top of the row below it, so you will have to add half a paver at the bottom. Save the leftover piece because you will use it in another row.\nOnce you get a couple rows going, back-fill the area with some new soil and tamp it in place. This helps keep the foundation solid. Then put on another row, being careful not to go over three feet high.\nWhen you reach the top, you are ready to put rich top soil in the bed. If you want to keep the weeds out, put the landscape cloth down first before you start planting. It's a perfect place for dad's new hammock!","One of the most common questions we get from our customers before buying their metal building is how level my foundation needs to be? The answer can vary depending on your use case and the size of the carport, garage, RV cover, or barn.\nWhen installing a pre-fab metal building, the ground should have less than 3 inches of slope in any direction. The base needs to be fairly level to avoid the leaning or movement of the structure. This becomes even more important if installing windows and doors on your metal garage or barn.\nWhat if my site is not level?\nUnfortunately, one of the first things people discover when planning the site of their carports or garages is that it is difficult to find a level surface to install the building on. This is the benefit of installing on a concrete slab, which can be made level when being poured. But what if you aren’t able to install your metal building on a slab?\nSome installation crews will opt for using concrete blocks to help level the building out. In some cases, this may work but it can lead to a less attractive, and potentially less stable installation.\nIf grading the site to make it level is not possible, Conestoga Builder’s master builder, Richard Grosse, sometimes recommends the installation of a ledger wall. A ledger wall can be a cost-effective way to create a level metal building installation surface. Many buyers work with our team to identify concrete contractors who can help them complete this work before installing their pre-fab metal buildings.\nUsing a ledger wall is especially useful when installing large buildings including steel barns, triple wide carports, or metal garages that require weatherproofing. With larger metal buildings, small changes in foundation slope can make a huge impact on the stability of the structure.\nThings to Consider Before Pouring a Slab for a Metal Carport, Garage, or Commercial Metal Building\nMany local municipal building codes require garage slabs to have between a one-eighth inch and half-inch per foot slope for drainage purposes. You should also strongly consider the best foundation type for your project\nMetal and Steel Building Foundation Options\nBare Ground Foundation\nFlat ground is fine to use as a carport, garage, or barn foundation and is the most budget-friendly, but if you are unable to have the site leveled, it can be very difficult to find a piece of land sufficiently flat for larger structures. Some leveling can be done using cement blocks or a ledger wall, but these are not always desirable.\nCarports, garages, and barns may be erected on gravel, but many of the same challenges of installing on bare ground foundations exist. It can be difficult to find a sufficiently level piece of earth. Gravel will help reduce mud and control moisture on the ground.\nInstalling a carport, garage, or barn on asphalt can be a great option, especially for areas that experience a lot of rain. These foundations will resist erosion and become unlevel over time. Work with a qualified professional to establish a sufficient level surface.\nConcrete Slab Foundation\nA concrete slab is the best option for installing a steel carport, garage, barn, or commercial building. Concrete is superior for protecting items stored under the structures, controlling moisture, and can be made extremely level. But this is also the most expensive option.\nHow Much Does It Cost to Pour a Concrete Slab for a Carport or Garage?\nThe cost of pouring. Concrete slab for a metal building will vary based on market prices and location but expect to pay between $4 and $8 per square foot. As of Q4 of 2021, the national average was reported at $6.60 per square foot for materials and labor.\nIf you are installing a commercial building or metal barn and will be using the slab for large farming equipment or heavy machinery, consider reinforced concrete. As of Q4, 2021, the national average for reinforced concrete was between $9 and $10 per square foot.\nIf you have any additional questions or need a referral, don’t hesitate to ask our expert builder for the advice!

{"question":"Which prominent early rock 'n' roll musicians had Pentecostal or holiness church backgrounds?","answer":"Several influential early rock 'n' roll musicians came from Pentecostal or similar holiness church backgrounds, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash.","context":["The Devil's Music Captures How Evangelicals Went from Condemning Rock 'n' Roll to Harnessing It\nReligious conservatives have spent as much time studying popular culture as they have condemning it, and they have arguably learned its lessons more effectively than social progressives.\nThe Devil's Music: How Christians Inspired, Condemned, and Embraced Rock 'n' Roll\nRandall J. Stephens\nHarvard University Press\nRandall J. Stephens' deeply researched The Devil's Music charts the long and oftentimes contentious relationship between evangelical Christianity and rock 'n' roll. Along the way, it offers some surprising historical insights and a somber lesson for social progressives who have long scoffed at their evangelical adversaries in America's ongoing culture wars.\nStephens opens the book by outlining the intimate connection between Pentecostalism and rock 'n' roll's originators, declaring that \"The culture of southern Pentecostalism influenced early rock in startlingly powerful ways and helped give birth to the new genre\", then carefully cataloging its development through the work of Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash, all of whom shared Pentecostal or similar holiness church backgrounds. \"The leap from unbridled sanctified music to rock 'n' roll,\" Stephens notes, \"was not a great one. \"Pentecostalism was itself as outside of mainstream religion at its inception as rock 'n' roll music was from the '50s-era mainstream; further, he notes that one of early Pentecostalism's most controversial characteristics (paralleling early rock 'n' roll) was its welcoming of racial mixing amongst adherents, though by the '30s most Pentecostal congregations had self-segregated. Nonetheless, its high energy worship practices and embrace of all forms of music within the church service proved a fertile breeding ground for the first generation of rock 'n' rollers.\nThe intersection of rock 'n' roll and American Christianity is, Stephens contends, an under-investigated subject in popular culture scholarship, though he neglects to reference my and David Janssen's Apocalypse Jukebox: The End of the World in American Popular Music, which examines the influence of Christian millennialism on rock's early proponents. The Devil's Music, nonetheless, succeeds in providing the deepest account yet of their contentious shared history and how each worked to shape the other, sometimes inadvertently and sometimes deliberately. Stephens is particularly effective, as well, in examining how \"fears of religious impurity\" inspired by rock 'n' roll reflected deeper and more insidious \"fears of racial contamination\". His chapter on \"Race, Religion, and Rock 'n' Roll\" examines how, for Southern segregationists and members of such rapidly growing, ethnocentric organizations as the White Citizens Council, rock 'n' roll's racial intermingling was a perceived as a direct \"attack on American values\".\nBy the turn of the '60s religious conservatives had justification in feeling like they'd outlasted the rock 'n' roll fad as the first wave of major rock 'n' rollers had been effectively silenced, with Elvis drafted, Little Richard returning to the ministry, Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry disgraced by sex scandals, and with the deaths of Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, and others taken out of the game by tragic accidents. The rise of the Beatles, however, reignited the flame of concern, which erupted into an unwieldy pyre following John Lennon's \"more popular than Jesus\" comment. However, as Stephens shows, the pseudo-spiritual striving inspired by Beatles worship and associate experiments with psychedelics actually served to strengthen the rising Christian movement among young people by the time of that band's breakup. Many hippies, pilgrim or poseur alike, became disaffected with the movement and disappointed by its many false prophets and so found themselves returning to Jesus for inspiration, though their religious expressions were quite distinct from the conservative churches they'd left behind. This new youth movement and its \"Jesus freak\" proponents gained such momentum that, only three years after Woodstock, the Jesus Music Festival of Dallas's Explo '72, or \"Godfest\" as it came to be called, drew 200,000 young people to celebrate the new Jesus Rock.\nChristian rock would build from there to become a multi-million dollar industry by the '80s, launching superstars like Amy Grant, Petra, The Newsboys, and the hair-metal \"yellow and black attack\" of Stryper. Stephens ponders at length the perpetual outsider status of this popular genre and its near-universal snub by rock's professional critics. But, as he points out, evangelicals who care little for popular culture in general care even less for other's opinions of their forays into it. With rock music as a central example, Stephens shows how evangelicals have shifted in their perspective regarding the evils of the secular world and its mass media in particular: \"In the same years that evangelicals publicly embraced politics and linked their denominations to the GOP in particular, they were also realizing that it was far better to borrow from and exploit popular culture than to reject and condemn it outright.\"\nAnd herein lies perhaps the most important lesson of The Devil's Music. Religious conservatives have spent as much time studying popular culture as they have condemning it, and they have arguably learned its lessons more effectively than social progressives. It is the passion of rock 'n' roll that draws in its converts, but evangelicals have arguably harnessed that power more effectively than secular progressives in the decades since the '80s. It is, of course, an oversimplification to say that liberals think while conservatives feel, but when one observes the patterns of argument within the debates of the culture wars, it is nonetheless true that liberals tend to favor logos while conservatives lead, more often than not, with pathos.\nIf the culture wars are a conflict between thought and feeling, then it would appear, at this juncture in the least, that feeling is winning, and religious conservatives not only have a much deeper well of that passion to draw from but they do a better job of harnessing it from America's secular institutions than do progressives. As Stephens concludes, \"Much of what animates evangelical churches in the twenty-first century comes directly from the unlikely fusion of pentecostal religion, conservative politics, and rock and pop music.\" The progressive left and secular thinkers ignore this at their own peril."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:afc70221-bd1a-433d-bd6f-650f06cab44f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does 5G transport network complexity compare to previous generations, and what considerations should businesses make when choosing between 4G and 5G for IoT deployments?","answer":"5G transport networks are significantly more complex than previous generations, featuring diverse site types and deployment strategies driven by network disaggregation and virtualization. The infrastructure splits into fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul segments, each requiring specialized equipment. When choosing between 4G and 5G for IoT deployments, businesses should consider that 4G LTE is currently more cost-effective and stable for many applications, especially for LTE-M and NB-IoT devices transmitting small amounts of data. While 5G offers advantages like higher speeds and lower latency, it comes at a premium price and should be chosen only when specific use cases demand its advanced capabilities.","context":["- 5G transport needs to provide enough capacity, but it also needs to cater to vertical 5G use cases with high-precision and low-latency connections, provided on intelligent infrastructure.\n- Another key issue that operators will need to tackle is 5G transport diversity and complexity; as 5G radio site types diversify, operators will need to build more diverse transport networks to cover all types of sites in their network.\nIn the first wave of 5G deployments, operators and other players in the telecommunications ecosystem have focused primarily on innovation in radio access, allowing for key improvements next-gen radio brings to existing services like mobile broadband. But as operators start to focus on truly game-changing 5G functionality that will enable IIoT and other advanced use cases, the importance of rebuilding and rethinking transport networks for 5G becomes very clear.\nUnlike in 3G and 4G, evolved 5G transport not only has to provide plentiful capacity – the usual number quoted is around ten times higher than for LTE – but also needs to provide very high-quality connections to ensure smooth performance of advanced 5G services. Additionally, 5G transport network management mechanisms have to ensure a high degree of flexibility and automation to achieve end-to-end slicing capability, traffic isolation, and granular QoS management.\n5G Challenges for Transport Networks\nThe connection quality requirements are all related to system-wide budgets in synchronization precision, jitter, and latency defined in 5G standards – and, again, represent a quantum leap in network performance compared to previous generations of mobile backhaul.\nAdditionally, the transport in 5G networks must have precise, deterministic characteristics when it comes to bandwidth, latency, and jitter. These requirements are system-wide, spanning multiple transport sub-systems. This translates into the need to adhere to very high standards of connection quality in every part of the transport network and, consequently, the need to measure and manage service bandwidth and quality parameters throughout the network precisely and dynamically.\nFor many vendors, these new requirements have spurred the introduction of a new breed of time-sensitive, predominantly IP, transport platforms featuring sophisticated timing and synchronization mechanisms.\nAnother key feature of 5G radio access is the new levels of diversity in site types and deployment strategies available to operators, driven in part by network disaggregation and virtualization, as well as the introduction of new radio bands. Radio access virtualization and decentralization split the legacy radio base station into separate elements of active or passive antennas, radio heads, and processing and enable operators to combine these elements and deploy them flexibly – either close to each other or sometimes kilometers away.\nThis effectively splits the former concept of mobile backhaul connecting the radio site to the operator edge into a significantly more complex 5G Xhaul (encompassing fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul). Each of these transport segments requires specialized equipment with varying deployment characteristics. As a rule of thumb, elements closer to the radio need to be more power efficient and temperature hardened; closer to the operator’s metro network, high routing capacity becomes the most prominent.\nIntroducing new radio bands suitable for covering indoor and outdoor areas with short-range, high-capacity connectivity – especially the millimeter wave (24 GHz and above) – brings to the fore the challenge of deploying high-performance networking devices in very small packaging and in large numbers in various environments. In other words, as radio access gets closer to the end user, transport networks need to follow.\nThe traditional way of solving this issue was using microwave backhaul. While microwave will continue to be relevant going forward, its capacity scalability is limited. Instead, many operators and vendors propose massively scaling fiber-based fronthaul networks. Again, there are several different ways of doing this, ranging from active WDM devices serving fronthaul to utilizing fixed broadband optical plant for this purpose.\nIn Transport, There’s No 5G Without SDN\n5G transport also necessitates changes in the way the networks are operated. Traditionally, mobile transport networks have been treated as slowly changing, overprovisioned ‘dumb pipes’ carrying all traffic without discerning what the traffic is or what kind of connection parameters it requires. The concepts of network slicing, differentiated QoS, and traffic isolation demand fully steerable, software-defined and automated network management and operations. With 5G, SDN becomes a necessity and not an afterthought, as usually was the case in the past.\nTo satisfy operator need for ‘hard’ (fully isolated) network slices, operators and vendors have devised slicing packet network/metro transport network (SPN/MTN) architecture, providing TDM deterministic end-to-end transport channels. The technology has since been accepted as a recommendation by ITU-T.\nThe introduction of 5G thus represents a quantum leap, bringing with it fundamental changes not only for radio access itself but for transport networks as well. With 5G destined to carry much more traffic, and a completely new breed of services in the future, the demands of 5G will continue to drive the direction and pace of IP and optical transport technology innovation in years to come.","When selecting technology for IoT deployments, enterprises need to know how long 4G LTE will be available, whether 5G will make 4G obsolete, and how to plan their investment. The answer is that there will be a long period of time when 4G and 5G will co-exist. LTE, which stands for Long Term Evolution, will be around for at least 10 years, so 5G will not make LTE obsolete any time soon.\nHaving put our fears to rest that 5G will make 4G obsolete, how do you choose where to invest? LTE technology is stable and will be available long term, and 5G is exciting and emerging. Let's talk about some of the benefits we will see with 5G and other key considerations as you plan your 5G journey\n4G or 5G: How to Choose?\nThe arrival of 5G — the next generation of cellular technology — means that not only will more devices be connected to the Internet of Things, but also that those devices will be better\nconnected, with higher data transmission speeds, lower latency and lower power requirements. All of this will produce more efficient and more profitable business solutions than are possible today.\nGiven those advantages, some might assume that every new IoT project should be based on 5G. While it’s true that some 5G IoT use cases\npossible with 5G, many others can work just as well and at significantly lower cost\nwith current 4G LTE technology which, as we've discussed, will be supported in the industry for at least another decade.\nChoosing between 4G LTE and 5G means examining both the technical and business aspects of any new project and projecting the long term costs and benefits of either direction. To support your decision-making, we’ll consider the benefits of 4G LTE, its projected lifespan and how and when making the leap to 5G makes sense.\nWhat’s the Lifespan of a G?\nWhat is the lifespan of a network generation? Good question. Broadly speaking, a new generation (or “G”) of cellular technology comes along every 10 years. Looking back, the last two cellular technologies have had a multi-decade lifespan from first release to sunset:\n- 2G: 1990-2020, 30 years+\n- 3G: 2000-2020, 20 years+\n- 4G: 2008+\nWhy do the older technologies such as 2G and 3G need to sunset\n? The reason for this is that the amount of available spectrum is limited. The same spectrum that has been used for 2G and 3G can now be re-used for 4G LTE to deliver more data at higher speeds.\nOur current generation of cellular technology, 4G LTE, was introduced in 2008 with Release 8 by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project\n(3GPP), which is an organization that develops standards for mobile communications. The 3GPP issues standard releases with incremental improvements about every other year (up to Release 14) and guides the evolution of the 4G standard.\n4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) is a technology that has now been proven in both consumer and commercial applications. 4G LTE is flexible. It accommodates, for example, low-power LTE-M and NB-IoT devices that typically transmit only a few KBs of data, as well as devices capable of high-speed Gigabit data transmission. Because of its widespread adoption, 4G LTE is also very affordable, especially compared to the cost of the newest, high-end 5G technology, which earns the term “bleeding edge” in terms of cost and capabilities, as well as support.\nThe Transition from 4G to 5G\nWith the exponential growth of IoT devices in recent years and the aforementioned limited spectrum, the lifespan of cellular technology is getting shorter. 2G and 3G have been sunsetted to make room for the more spectrum-efficient 4G LTE and emerging 5G technologies. 4G is expected to last for at least another decade, and possibly longer with the help of Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS), which shares available spectrum between 4G LTE and 5G devices. DSS provides improved coverage for 5G devices and greater longevity for 4G LTE devices. The first 4G LTE sunset announcements are expected after 2030, which means that companies can safely invest in 4G-based IoT solutions today and for the foreseeable future.\nTo make 5G technology available early and provide a seamless user experience, first 5G networks and devices will work in non-standalone (NSA) mode, which means that a device will always connect to the 4G LTE network first, and if a 5G network becomes available, the device will use 5G for additional bandwidth. So for example, a 5G NSA device may use 400 Mbps of bandwidth over 4G LTE and another 200 Mbps over 5G, with an aggregate of 600 Mbps, which together is faster than 4G and 5G alone.\nOver the next several years, network infrastructure will evolve to enable 5G-only stand-alone mode (SA). This will bring the low latency and ability to connect with massive numbers of IoT devices that are among the primary advantages of 5G.\nComparing IoT Use Cases for 4G LTE and 5G\nThe speed and throughput of 4G LTE is more than adequate for a wide range of use cases. But as technology advances, new applications and use cases for 5G\nare emerging. Indeed, there are applications that are only possible with 5G’s speed and low latency.\nLet’s consider three commercial examples where the 4G LTE to 5G transition will play out.\n- Traffic: Autonomous vehicles need the extremely low latency of 5G with response times measured in milliseconds. Only 5G is capable of that. But 4G LTE speeds are sufficient for most traffic-related functions, even routing first responder vehicles in an emergency. A good example is the 4G LTE-based, FirstNet™ Ready Digi WR54, which has capabilities for signal timing and traffic management in emergency response situations. In some traffic-related use cases such as data gathering for traffic counts, data could be collected just once a day, making latency a non-issue.\n- Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT): Industrial automation will be greatly enhanced with 5G. Robotic controls that currently require the use of cables because of the limited range and the latency of today’s cellular technology could go fully wireless with 5G, enabling more flexible and efficient factories. An example in a more passive industrial setting would be a sensor measuring the fuel level in a remotely situated fuel tank. This use case would also require wireless because of the remote location. But because only a small amount of data is being transmitted periodically, a battery-powered 4G LTE-M or NB-IoT device is sufficient.\n- Drones: 5G promises to extend the capabilities of IoT drones by enabling a controller wearing 5G Augmented Reality (AR) goggles to see beyond current line-of-sight limits with low latency and high resolution video. Drones using existing wireless technology, however, are currently operating in diverse use cases such as search and rescue, crime scene investigation and increasingly in package delivery.\nFinal Considerations: 4G vs. 5G\nInstead of waiting for the full 5G rollout, organizations can start building for the future now with 4G LTE technology and validate their applications and business models. They can then refine and expand when 5G becomes more widely available and cost-effective. Fortunately, there is no danger of 4G LTE becoming unavailable for at least a decade. Nevertheless, there are use cases where 5G is a more desirable choice, and those are some of the top candidates for adopting the bleeding edge.\nAt the low end, with LTE-M and NB-IoT, as well as in the mid-tier with cellular speeds below 1 Gbps, 4G LTE is clearly the winner in terms of cost, coverage, and availability. When we look at the high-end with cellular speeds beyond 1 Gbps, 5G may become more appealing, but at a premium. A thoughtful upgrade strategy will save money and headaches.\nPositioned as we are, at the point where 5G technology is just starting to become generally available, there are some key considerations and trade-offs as you decide which direction to go with your IoT project. Given the complexity, it's important to work with a knowledgeable solution provider. A good partner can guide you in choosing the right technology for your use case and ensure that you are investing in technology that supports your long-term business goals.\nto discuss your next IoT project and the best technology choice to make it a success."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a5891311-38cb-4863-9a42-7925f6490864>","<urn:uuid:adc77363-a2ae-444f-9e14-6c9ad3b1e5ec>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a historian studying social movements, what are the key differences between the French student protests of 1968 and the French Revolution in terms of their outcomes?","answer":"The French student protests of 1968 and the French Revolution had notably different outcomes. The 1968 protests resulted in a six-week national crisis with temporary effects, including factory and school takeovers, but ultimately failed to create lasting systemic change and were effectively voted out when Richard Nixon won the US elections. In contrast, the French Revolution successfully tore down centuries of political and cultural tradition, establishing modern ideals of citizenship and national identity that reverberated throughout France, Europe, and the world for over two centuries, fundamentally transforming political and social structures.","context":["After exploring new (digital/social/emergent) media through a variety of media studies lenses, we began looking at the possibilities these media present for democratic political projects. This week we begin our next theoretical turn: into the interdisciplinary field of “cultural studies.” This will provide tools to help us think about the relationship between new media and changing configurations of power. It’s only in the context of the latter that possibilities for social and environmental change can be understood in their complexity.\n“Cultural studies” is a term that’s sometimes used very generically: you’ll see it used this way in some bookstores, where the “cultural studies” section is a smorgasbord of books devoted to topics ranging from gender, sexuality, race, popular culture, media, politics, and much more.\nStrictly speaking, however, the term refers to an interdisciplinary academic field that emerged in Britain in the 1950s and spread in North America and elsewhere from the 1970s on. In some universities it is its own program; in many it is found in other programs (most commonly, in the U.S., in literature departments and American studies programs). It draws on established disciplines — such as sociology, anthropology, literary studies, media and communication studies, philosophy, and political theory — but typically weaves them together around a concern over how culture intersects with power and how social change occurs (or might occur). It is, in this sense, more of an “engaged” or “activist” field — like environmental studies — than disciplines that aim for objective or scientific knowledge of the world.\n(I’ll put copies of the tables of contents of a few introductory cultural studies textbooks on Blackboard, so that you can get a sense of the divergence and unity of the field.)\n… after 1968\nThe theme for this week is “Cultural studies (and politics) after 1968” because 1968 is generally considered — on the Left, at least — to have been a watershed year in social change movements. It was a year of assassinations (of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy), confrontations (such as the bloody confrontation between police and anti-Vietnam War protesters at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago), massive strikes and shutdowns (such as students shutting down New York City’s Columbia University), and revolutions, some successful, most (ultimately) failed.\nPerhaps the most prominent “revolutionary” event was the national strike by students and trade unionists in France, which led to a 6-week national crisis that included the takeover of factories and schools, the shut down (and sometimes takeover) of railways and communications media, and street fights throughout Paris leading to the temporary “liberation” of parts of the city. Prominent French intellectuals and artists were involved in the “events of May-June,” and several emerged as leading social theorists in the years following.\nA Columbia University students’ group pamphlet in support of the French “revolution”\nMeanwhile, in Eastern Europe, the “Prague Spring” was a months-long experiment in creating a “socialism with a human face,” that ended suddenly with the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet tanks. Analogous events — protests, insurrections, disturbances, and so on — if on a smaller scale, happened in many other countries in both the developed and developing worlds.\n1968 is often taken as a stand-in for a series of social struggles: against the Vietnam War and, by extension, against perceived imperialism and colonialism of all kinds (around the world); for the civil rights of Blacks in the U.S. (culminating in King’s murder and in the emergence of the Black Panthers), for women’s rights, for gay rights (though the Stonewall riots occurred only a year later), and for environmental causes (though the first Earth Day demonstrations occurred only in 1970).\nFor political and cultural theorists, 1968 would become a year in which ideas were tried out — and largely failed to create the change they had sought, or that succeeded on a small scape but were either crushed by the authorities or (essentially) voted out on a larger scale. (For instance, Richard Nixon won the U.S. elections that year.) “1968″ is in this sense the beginning of a series of reflections on the very possibility of radical social change.\nReading for this week\nThis week we begin reading Jeremy Gilbert’s Anticapitalism and Culture: Radical Theory and Popular Politics (Berg, 2008). There are sections I’d like you to focus on, and others you can skim or leave out altogether, as follows.\nRead all of it.\nRead pp. 11-14 to get a sense of the British context within which cultural studies emerged. Then read pp. 14-27 closely; and pp. 30 to the end. (“The Structuralist Turn” can be skimmed or skipped.)\nRead pp. 44-49 (starting from the last paragraph on p. 49), then pp. 59-62 (to halfway down that page), and finally pp. 68 (bottom paragraph) through to the end of the chapter.\nAbout the author: Jeremy Gilbert is a Reader (the British equivalent of Professor) in the School of Arts and Digital Industries at the University of East London, U.K. He has long been active in the cultural studies field and as a cultural and political activist. He is also the editor of the journal New Formations, which is a leading British cultural theory/studies journal.\nGilbert’s perspective on what he writes about is an engaged participant’s perspective: he comes out of the tradition of the New Left (defined below). But the larger societal processes which he describes are important for us to understand from multiple perspectives, which we will try to do.\nIf Gilbert’s is the first book of post-1960s cultural and political theory that you’re reading, you will likely find a lot of terms that need defining. Some of them he provides good definitions for (I’ll indicate those in my further comments); others I’ll define here (preliminarily) or we’ll deal with as we go along. Definitions will be added on a separate page entitled “Glossary.”\nAssignment for this week\nDo the readings; we will discuss them in class. There is no required blog entry this week, but the following week’s will be expected to address the first 4 chapters of the Gilbert book.\nThe critical analysis proposals are due by next Tuesday’s class. Instructions are here.","Echoes of the French Revolution\nDepartment of History\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno\nBy tearing down centuries of political and cultural tradition in the span of a few decades, the French Revolution ushered in the modern age and created the ideals of citizenship and national identity we know today. For over two centuries, the Revolution sent reverberations throughout France, Europe, and, vis-à-vis its empire, the entire world. By analyzing primary sources and path-breaking historical monographs, this course explores the political, cultural, and social repercussions of the French Revolution to the present day. The first half of the course will explore the Revolution, both in France and in the Atlantic World, and its demands for the satisfaction of three universal ideals: liberty, equality, and fraternity. The second half of the course explores the aftershocks of the French Revolution in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as France built a global empire in which subjects employed France’s own revolutionary values to overthrow imperial subjugation.\n• 20% — Weekly Participation\n• 10% — Leading Discussion\n• 15% — First Paper\n• 15% — Midterm Exam\n• 20% — Final Exam\n• 20% — Final Paper\nRequired Texts to Purchase\n(other texts noted in Schedule available on ARES)\n- Jeremy Popkin. 2009.

{"question":"What are the signs of severe roof damage, and how does snow accumulation make these problems worse?","answer":"Several signs indicate severe roof damage: curling or missing shingles, water stains in the attic, granules in gutters, and a sagging roof structure. A sagging roof particularly indicates serious structural issues with decking or foundation supports that require immediate professional attention. Snow accumulation can severely worsen these problems - while snow appears light when falling, it can add dangerous weight to an already compromised roof. Additionally, as snow freezes and thaws, it can create gaps between shingles, leading to water damage as melting snow seeps into the roof instead of being properly channeled off. This moisture can spread from the roof into walls and floors if not addressed quickly. Warning signs that snow weight is causing imminent roof collapse include visible sagging, unusual creaking or popping sounds, sudden wall cracks, and doors opening randomly.","context":["How to Make the Best Choice From a List of Roofing Companies\nPeople who purchase a new home typically have a home inspection done before they settle on submitting their final offer. A professional inspector will include a roof inspection in their report, so most homes for sale will not have any current problems with the roof. The new owner of the home will probably not need to think about repairing or replacing the existing roof for at least 10 years or more.\nThe average life of an asphalt shingled roof ranges from 15 to 25 years depending on the quality of the shingles used. One of the first signs that a shingled roof needs attention is loosened or curling edges on the shingles, or a serious windstorm may blow several off if they have begun to loosen. Any of these issues is a sign that a roof may need to be repaired or even totally replaced.\nAlthough asphalt shingles are the most common type of roofing material used by modern roofing companies, other roofing materials have gained popularity within the past couple decades. Metal roofing materials are now manufactured to resemble various types of shingles. While metal roofs have at least double and sometimes triple the lifespan of asphalt shingles, the initial cost is considerably higher. A couple important advantages of metal roofing is that it is more resistant to wind damage and can prevent fire damage in the case of a nearby fire. Many home insurance companies offer a policy discount for metal roofed homes.\nSome other types of roofing materials include clay or concrete tiles, slate and wood shakes or shingles. Slate and tile roofing is heavier than asphalt or metal roofing, so care must be taken to ensure the structure of the building can support the extra weight. The advantages of these tiles is that they are nearly indestructible and will perform well as long as the building stands.\nWood shakes are often made of cedar since this type of wood is rot resistant, although there is an increased fire danger with wood roofing. Wood shingles were used extensively before the availability of asphalt or metal roofing, and wood is very aesthetically appealing.\nWhen a homeowner realizes the roof on their home is beginning to deteriorate and needs attention, they need to decide which type of roofing material is their best choice. Asphalt shingles is the material most roofing companies work with these days, and it is likely the type of shingles used for the existing roof. The homeowner may also consider replacing the roof with some other type of roofing than is currently in place.\nLocal home improvement stores usually have a list of professional contractors in the area, so they are probably the first place to look for qualified roofing companies. The store employees may also be able to recommend the most qualified contractors. The yellow pages and the internet are also good sources of contractor listings. One advantage of online searches is the company sites typically include reviews and comments from past customers.\nOnce the homeowner has found information about several professional roofers, they should call at least three to give them a bid on their project. The contractor will first inspect the existing roof to identify the severity of the problem. They may recommend repairing a problem area rather than replacing the entire roof. They should be able to give the homeowner specific advice if they are considering other types of roofing materials.\nLocation and climate have a lot to do with which type of roofing material is best. Homes in very cold climates where a lot of snow falls each year often do best with metal roofing. This is because snow slides off easily and eliminates damage from a heavy snow load. Homes located in the desert southwest are often roofed with clay tiles because they resist sun fading. Tiles can be designed to compliment the adobe homes that are common in that area.\nAlthough some people don’t think much about their roof until they notice a problem, it really is important to the integrity of their home. A leaky roof can allow deterioration of the interior structures of a home which can cause serious and expensive damage.\nWhat to Know About Commercial Roofing Contractors and Designs\nIt is unfortunate that the majority of roofs on commercial properties are often ignored until there is a large problem present, such as a leak or missing shingles. Unlike residential roofs, these commercial roofs will be neglected until the problem is large and must be repaired by professionals. While it is possible to complete roofing repairs independently, the majority of commercial roofing maintenance is difficult to manage because these roofs are not the easiest to access. Furthermore, the longer a business allows a problem to persist, the greater the need for professional skills and equipment to be used in the repair procedure.\nNeedless to say, having regular preventative commercial roof maintenance will save a great deal of money because the repairs will be kept to a minimum. Regular maintenance of both residential and commercial roofs will maintain the longevity of the roof meaning the roof will not need to be replaced as often. Of course, to find the correct contractors to provide this suitable maintenance it is necessary to take certain considerations into account. This article will examine the points to take into account when looking at commercial roofing contractors; as well as the different types of roofing designs used. It is important to look at the designs available because roofing style can influence the longevity and maintenance of the roof.\nWhat Are The Considerations to Make When Choosing a Commercial Roofing Contractor?\nRegardless of whether you are looking at having a commercial roof installed or repaired, it is essential that you choose the correct roofing contractor. By using the correct contractor, you can be sure that the job is on the way to being a success and not a failure. The first point to take into account is that the contractor has several years of experience with a strong reputation. Professionalism is essential and if the company has a bad reputation, the chances are that they will not provide the correct quality of services.\nOne method to identify the company or contractor’s standard of services is to read testimonials or speak to colleagues regarding this issue. A contractor presenting with positive testimonials on their official website demonstrates a degree of professionalism with high quality of customer service. Unfortunately, many official testimonials may be dishonest and misrepresent the company; therefore, it is recommended that you read reviews on a third-party review website before making a final decision.\nAnother factor to take into account is the cost of the service. Cost is a sensitive topic nowadays, irrespective of whether you are operating in the commercial or residential sector. It is highly recommended that you draft a budget beforehand as this will help determine which service is affordable and which is not. Furthermore, it is recommended that you obtain quotes from different contractors before making a final decision. The quotes should be customized and detailed including the discussion of insurance as part of a final payment.\nA person may question why insurance is necessary when paying for commercial roofing repairs, but insurance is imperative as a safety procedure. When a contractor provides work insurance, they will provide coverage for you as an employer removing any liability should the worker experience injury “on the job”. No individual wants to experience injury, but accidents are unpredictable and it is better to be safe rather than sorry.\nWhat Are The Different Types of Corporate Roofing Systems Available?\nWhen choosing a roofing contractor, it is important that you consider the contractor in addition to the roofing system available. By understanding the different roofing systems on offer, you will be able to choose the contractor with the correct skills to deal with your problem. Below are the different commercial roof designs available:\n• The Green Roofing System\nOne of the most popular roofing systems in today’s society is the green roofing system. This is a unique design because it utilizes vegetation as its primary covering. A beneficial design for smaller businesses because the cost of heating and cooling is reduced using the vegetation and its insulation. Unfortunately, the roofing maintenance is labor-intensive and requires a contractor with skills in this particular design for effective maintenance.\n• The Metal Roofing Design\nArguably the most common roofing style is the metal roofing design. Metal roofs are designed using various types of metal materials including steel, copper, metal tile sheeting, and aluminum. This is beneficial option due to the reduced cost of installation, but it can be disadvantageous because of the vulnerability to rust when exposed to sunlight. This means that the steel will require additional layers of protective chemicals to prevent corrosion from sun exposure. Contractors must be aware of this and be willing to deal with these chemicals.\nSigns It’s Time for Roof Repair\nA solid roof is crucial for a cozy, warm, and leak-free home. Although the roofer may have given a service guarantee of at least 25 years, the roof still needs to be maintained and serviced regularly to prevent roofing emergencies. Simple tasks such as having broken shingles replaced, sweeping leaves and twigs off the roof, as well as washing it immediately after winter are some of the roof maintenance tips that can help your roof last much longer. Having your roof inspected at least twice a year also helps detect issues and potential problems should be addressed immediately to avoid a disaster. Some of the issues that call for immediate roof repair are discussed below.\n1. Curling Shingles\nCurling shingles, also known as cupping, are a clear indicator that you may need to have the shingles replaced, or even a new roof. Cupping is an initial sign of individual shingles wearing off and could lead to leaks into the house. Temperature fluctuations may cause cupping among other external factors. Consider calling a roof repair expert as soon as you start noticing roofing shingles cupping or clawing. The contractor may have to inspect the level of damage to determine whether they need replacing or its time for a new roof.\n2. Water Stains in the Attic\nA simple leak in the attic can cause massive structural damage to both the roof and the house. Detecting leak from the attic is relatively easy. You can either have the attic tested or just look for streaks of light getting in through the roof. Testing for dampness in the attic especially past the insulation points is also recommended. If there are water stains in the attic or can see light rays through the roof, it’s then time to call a roofing expert. Although small and simple leaks can be patched up, the contractor will need to test the entire roof for structural damage. Larger leaks may call for a part of the roof taken off and reinstalled afresh.\n3. Granules in the Gutter\nWhile your roof may seem perfectly ok and no signs of leaks, finding a bunch of granules in the gutters is an indication that the roof is deteriorating, fast. Unless it is a freshly installed roof, granules in the gutters mean shingles are wearing off fast and that they aren’t protected from direct sunlight. Manufacturers coat roofing shingles with granules to help improve their durability by preventing baking by the sun. If you notice granules in the gutter, then chances are your roof is halfway through its lifespan, and that you should start planning for a new roof.\n4. Cracked and Missing Shingles\nAlthough a common occurrence, cracked or missing shingles call for immediate fixing. This is particularly important if one part of the roof has broken shingles. The cracked shingles may be as a result of a poor installation job, or wind damage. A good roofing contractor should be able to identify the root cause and have it addressed in no time. Should you however find entire shingles missing, you then need more than just roof repair.\n5. A Sagging Roof\nA sagging roof may be due to a structural issue that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. The problem could be with decking in the attic, or even worse, foundation supports. While you may not be in danger (yet), it would be wise to call your roofer immediately (if the roof is still under warranty). The roofer may have to reroof the house afresh or take on the necessary repair measures.\nMoss and algae may create a habitat on your roof as well. While there may be no cause for alarm, it would be best if you considered having the roof washed to get rid of these microbes. Moss attract moisture onto the roof which not only makes it heavier but could also start decomposing the shingles.\nHiring a Roofer: What to Look For\nOnce confident that the roof requires fixing, it’s important that you find a good roofer to handle the repairs. If the roof is still under warranty, you can then call the roofer to have it fixed ASAP. If it is way past the guarantee provided, you will then have to hire a roofer yourself. Some of the basic qualifications to look for in a roofer include licensing, insurance, experience, expertise, and proper communication. Be sure to get quotes from several service providers to find the right one for the job.","Snow Covered Roof FAQ\nMany people love to see snow falling and see snow covering roofs of houses and the accompanying yards, but snow on the roof of a home is not always as beautiful as it seems. Snow covering a roof has the potential to cause homeowners many difficulties that could be disastrous if not taken care of correctly. Here are some frequently asked questions when it comes to snow piling up on your roof.\nWhat Are The Dangers Of A Snow Covered Roof?\nOne of the biggest dangers of snow covering a roof is the weight. Although snow is light and fluffy as it falls, accumulating snow on a roof can sometimes add too much extra weight to the roof of your home.\nSnow covering a roof can also cause issues with the shingles. As the snow freezes and thaws, the change in temperature and the moisture level can cause gaps in between the shingles and the roof of your home.\nWhat Are Signs That You Are Headed For A Collapse?\nWhen your roof is under lots of extra weight from snow or ice, it is important to watch for signs that it might be in danger of collapsing. If you observe any of the following signs, you should immediately evacuate the home and seek help to get your roof issue resolved.\nOne of the biggest signs the roof of your home is about to collapse is that it is noticeable sagging. If you look at your roof and see it sag, your roof is in imminent danger. Other signs that your roof is in deep trouble include noises not usually heard such as a creaking sound or a popping sound, noticeably bad leaks from the roof, cracks suddenly forming down the walls of your home and doors that randomly open by themselves.\nHow Can Water Damage Occur From Snow On Your Roof?\nBeautiful snow covered roofs can also pose the threat of water damage in your home. As snow and ice are adding weight to your roof, damage to the roof can occur. If damage to the shingles occurs and allows gaps between the shingle and the roof, as the snow and ice melts, the water and moisture can seep down into your roof instead of being routed off the roof with the help of the shingles.\nWater damage is a tricky situation when it comes to homes. Damage can start in the roof of your home from melting snow and ice and if the issue is not quickly resolved, the damage can seep into the walls and ultimately into the floors of the home. The longer water damage goes without being taken care of, the more damage can occur. If you notice a leak in your roof, it is imperative to quickly resolve the issue to keep water damage contained to one area of your home instead of allowing the damage to quickly spread.\nEven though snow covered roofs are pretty, a homeowner must be careful to watch for signs of a roof collapse while admiring the snow. If you observe any sign that your roof might be in trouble for collapsing or leaking, call a professional immediately to get the damage fixed before it leads to other issues."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6da2b4c3-f093-4884-9972-8229116cd96a>","<urn:uuid:66669c9d-d9d2-496b-9640-3b5ef2224238>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do SNP rs7566605 and FTO gene variants compare in their association with obesity across different populations?","answer":"Both genetic variants show mixed evidence and population-specific effects. The FTO gene variant is strongly linked to obesity in European populations but shows weaker association in those of African ancestry. For rs7566605, multiple studies show conflicting results - some studies found no association with obesity in Japanese and Chinese populations, while others indicated that rs7566605(C;C) carriers find it harder to lose weight in clinical intervention programs. This demonstrates that genetic markers for obesity can vary significantly across ethnic groups.","context":["Michael Jackson sang, “It don’t matter if you’re black or white”—and that goes for people in the doctor’s office, too, according to a paper in the May PLoS ONE. A joint team from Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois, and Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York analyzed nearly 1,000 people’s genomes to conclude that individual human beings lie all across a broad genetic spectrum, not in narrow racial hues. However, they did find that race matters at the population level, with chunks of DNA inherited in different patterns in peoples of different ancestry. The results suggest that disease-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from one ethnic group may not translate to another, and that personalized medicine will have to be just that—truly tailored to the person.\nIn addition to the ongoing interest in disease-causing SNPs, researchers are also seeking variants that indicate how well a person will respond to one medicine or another (Urban, 2010). Armed with such data, doctors could offer people a customized panel of drugs most likely to work. In AD, this may be relevant one day in the future for people who carry certain risk alleles. More generally, that dream will only become reality if physicians have good genetic markers to work with. But will markers based on one ethnic group work for another? First author Bamidele Tayo from Loyola University and senior author Erwin Bottinger of Mount Sinai led the study to analyze how much genomic heterogeneity there is among people and ethnicities. At Mount Sinai, they collected samples from nearly 1,000 people of African, European, or Hispanic descent, and used gene array chips to identify more than 800,000 SNPs in each person. They discovered heterogeneity both within and between ethnic groups, suggesting that many of their subjects were of mixed descent.\nThe existence of genetically blended races is not surprising, particularly in the bubbling melting pot that is New York, wrote John Hardy of University College London, U.K., in an e-mail to ARF. “The descriptions used, especially in the U.S., to self-identify racial groups are really historical artifacts with little meaning from a purely genetic perspective.” Everyone of mixed descent who has tried to check the right box on a census form will probably agree.\nBy contrast, when considering the genes of groups of people, ethnicity does matter. It is particularly important in genomewide association studies. In GWAS, marker SNPs stand proxy for the functional mutations the scientists are really after, but may not always be co-inherited with them. For example, the study authors point to the fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, which encodes an enzyme that demethylates DNA. A variant in the FTO locus is strongly linked to obesity in those of European descent, but is much more weakly linked in people with African ancestry (Adeyemo et al., 2010). This may sound like tough luck for the obesity field, but lo and behold! This gene has already shown up in an AD study as well (see ARF related news story on Ho et al., 2010).\nSNPs only point to the right mutation if the SNP and mutation are inherited together in the same chunk of DNA called a linkage disequilibrium block. In their NYC samples, the researchers found that some genetic loci are passed on in different linkage disequilibrium blocks in different subjects who are ostensibly of the same “race.” For example, at the FTO region there were five such blocks in African Americans, two in European Americans, and four in Hispanics. Thus, the study raises the question of whether SNPs from one ethnic group match up with the mutation locus in another. “Until the ‘causal mutation’ is known for [GWAS] findings, it may not be possible to transfer the information from the original study population, virtually always of European ancestry,” the authors wrote.\nThe researchers also considered each genotype individually. When they did so, the boundaries between ethnicities were considerably blurred, with Hispanic genomes fitting in between those of European and African Americans. In particular, Hispanic and African American genomes shared more alleles. “If one dispenses with the conventional labels and relies solely on genotype, the Hispanics…can be appropriately merged with the African Americans,” the authors concluded. “In the genomic era, conventional racial/ethnic labels are of little value.”\nWhat does that mean for a doctor faced with a patient? At least in diverse areas such as New York, it may be useless to consider the race that person writes on a form in diagnosing or selecting treatments (Cooper et al., 2003). Similarly, researchers might be using artificial categories if they stratify people by race (Weiss and Lambert, 2010). The study authors are now analyzing DNA samples from 20,000 folks to discover genetic markers that work best for the multiethnic New York populace—data that will bring them one step closer to personalized medicine.—Amber Dance\n- Urban TJ.

{"question":"I'm studying mitochondrial biology - how exactly does the experimental drug MTP-131 work at the molecular level to protect mitochondrial function?","answer":"MTP-131 (Ocuvia) works by targeting the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it electrostatically and transiently interacts with cardiolipin, including its various forms like peroxidized cardiolipin. Through this interaction, it restores the biophysical properties (healthy ATP and ROS levels) and function of the electron transport chain, thereby modifying ophthalmologic disease progression.","context":["Role of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration\nThe site of intracellular metabolism may be a relevant drug target in dry AMD.\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) accounts for 54% of all blindness in Americans of European ancestry, as well as 5% of all blindness globally.1 It affects 30% of people over the age of 65 and is the most common cause of blindness in the elderly.2 The prevalence of AMD was estimated to be 6.5% in the 2005-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.3 AMD costs the United States more than $51 billion a year in medical expenses and lost worker productivity,4 as reflected by research data associated with disability in instrumental activities of daily living.5 The incidence of AMD in this country is expected to grow from 11 million today to approximately 22 million by 2050.6\nAMD is a progressive degenerative disorder of the macula in which central vision becomes impaired.7 There are two subtypes of AMD: early and late. Early AMD is characterized by moderate to severe lipid-rich, sub–retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) deposits (ie, drusen) and pigment abnormalities. Late-stage AMD is often subdivided into geographic atrophy (degenerative loss of the photoreceptors, RPE, and choriocapillaris) and neovascular AMD (subretinal invasion of pathologic new vessels).\nThe drusen and geographic atrophy stages of AMD are collectively termed dry AMD, and this entity presents a considerable challenge for the vision community because the etiology has not been clearly resolved.8 The pathogenesis of dry AMD is multifactorial, and it includes aging,3,9 genetic abnormalities,10 systemic health,9,11 environmental risk factors (including cigarette smoking),12 and mitochondrial dysfunction.13,14 Currently, no treatment is available for dry AMD, nor, more important, is there any known treatment that causes the regression of drusen or prevents their progression to geographic atrophy.\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR DRY AMD PATHOGENESIS\nMitochondrial Dysfunction Induced by Environmental Toxicants\nMultiple paradigms have been proposed for the pathogenesis of early AMD or, more broadly, dry AMD, including genetic susceptibility interacting with environmental and systemic health factors. We propose that mitochondrial dysfunction induced by environmental toxicants is a fundamental risk factor for, and a hypothesis for, the etiology of dry AMD.\nRole of Mitochondria in Health and Disease\nMitochondria are intracellular organelles necessary for cell function and survival—including the cells of the RPE. They are crucial for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the major form of cellular energy. Understanding of the role that mitochondria play in health, disease, and aging has advanced considerably since mitochondrial dysfunction was first described by Luft et al.15 Major structures of mitochondria include the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, cristae, and electron transport chain (ETC).16 Cardiolipin (CL), a unique phospholipid exclusive to mitochondria and present only in the inner membrane of mitochondria (IMM), acts as a linchpin to hold together the respiratory protein complex subunits (complexes I, II, III, and IV) of the ETC that are essential to achieve optimal functioning of numerous enzymes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism.17\nHowever, CL is susceptible to peroxidation, leading to loss of its biophysical properties that support the ETC. Abnormal function of the ETC drives mitochondrial dysfunction, defined as loss of ATP synthesis, coupled with pathologic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially superoxide, and loss of transmembrane potential of the IMM.\nDry AMD and Mitochondrial Damage\nMitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the etiology of dry AMD. Mitochondria are located along the basal RPE near drusen. Mitochondrial dysmorphology observed in RPE in eyes with AMD is consistent with severe dysfunction, and mitochondrial DNA from these eyes demonstrate increased oxidative damage. Finally, a genetic disease with mitochondrial DNA mutation, maternally-inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD), is associated with an AMD-like maculopathy.14\nA novel mitochondrial protective compound, MTP-131 (Ocuvia, Stealth BioTherapeutics), is a topical ophthalmologic investigational drug under development to treat both common and rare eye disorders, including retinal diseases and inherited mitochondrial optic neuropathies. It works by targeting the IMM, electrostatically and transiently interacting with CL, including its various forms (eg, peroxidized CL), and restoring biophysical properties (healthy ATP and ROS levels) and function of the ETC,18 thereby modifying ophthalmologic disease progression.\nDRY AMD AND CIGARETTE SMOKE–RELATED TOXICANTS\nCigarette smoking is the most important environmental risk factor for dry AMD onset and progression,19-23 although other factors associated with Western lifestyle also play a role. Our laboratory identified a major chemical toxicant in tobacco tar, hydroquinone (HQ), as a potential biochemical cause of RPE cellular injury inducing drusen and geographic atrophy.24 HQ is on the US Environmental Protection Agency’s list of dangerous environmental toxicants.25 In addition to cigarette tar, HQ is present in industrial pollution, engine exhaust, and food stored in plastic containers (due to HQ used in plastics).21,26 Acute exposure to high doses of HQ causes seizures and death; however, less well-known are the health effects of chronic exposure to low levels of HQ.\nPreclinical and Animal Models of Dry AMD and HQ-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction\nOur research has shown that RPE mitochondria are a major target of HQ in the eye, and that HQ exposure induces acute and chronic mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in biochemical and cellular changes consistent with dry AMD. In vitro exposure of cultured RPE to HQ induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn triggers cellular injury pathways consistent with AMD biochemistry. Further, aged mice fed HQ develop AMD-like sub-RPE deposits.24,27 Finally, repeated subconjunctival injection of HQ in young mice over a 2-week period produces sub-RPE deposit formation and mitochondrial dysfunction with biochemical changes similar to those observed in cell culture.\nMTP-131 Prevents Dry AMD Phenotype Associated with HQ-Induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction\nOur laboratory has performed preliminary testing of MTP-131 in cell culture and in a mouse model, and we have found that the investigational drug was highly effective in several experimental models. In cell culture, MTP-131 prevented HQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, activation of biochemical injury pathways, and cellular functions associated with deposits. Even more impressive, MTP-131 prevented HQ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, biochemical injury pathways, and deposit formation in a mouse model.\nAs compared with HQ-exposed, vehicle-treated eyes (Figure 1A), the outer retinas of mice treated with daily MTP-131 (3 mg/kg subcutaneous, Figure 1B) before and during 2 weeks of HQ exposure had normal basal infoldings (yellow asterisk), minimal deposit formation, normal Bruch membrane thickness (red line), and endothelium with fenestrations (black arrowhead). Moreover, RPE mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure, which shows irregular shape and typical vacuolization following repetitive subconjunctival HQ exposure, was normalized by treatment with MTP-131 (Figure 2). These mitochondrial ultrastructural differences between groups treated with vehicle and with MTP-131 are known to closely correlate with ATP and oxidative stress levels, mitochondrial respiration, and overall ETC function.28\nHUMAN STUDY Ongoing\nJeffery Heier, MD, is leading a phase 1/2 open-label, dose-escalation clinical study of topical MTP-131 to better understand its safety and tolerability in patients with diabetic macular edema and dry AMD.29 Our preliminary preclinical studies provide a rationale for advancing this therapy into later-stage clinical trials for early- or late-stage dry AMD. n\nScott W.

{"question":"Is the volume formula different for regular pyramids versus cones?","answer":"No, both regular pyramids and cones use the same basic volume formula of 1/3 times base area times height.

If anyone could help me, that would be helpful(0 votes)\n- To properly answer your question I would need to know what was confuseig. But if you go back and watch a few videos before I think you will understand a lot better.(3 votes)\n- [Instructor] So I have two different three-dimensional figures here. I have a pyramid here on the left, and I have a cone here on the right. And we know a few things about these two figures. First of all, they have the exact same height. So this length right over here is h, and this length right over here, going from the peak to the center of the base here, is h as well. We also know that the area of the bases is the same. So for example, in this left pyramid, the area of the base would be x times, and let's just assume that it is a square, so x times x. So the area here is going to be equal to x squared. And the area of the base, so that's area of this base is equal to x squared. And the area of this base right over here would be equal to area is equal to pi times r squared. And I'm saying that these two things are the same. So we also know that x squared is equal to pi r squared. Now, my question to you is do these two figures have the same volume, or is it different? And if they are different, which one has a larger volume? Pause this video, and try to think about that. All right, now let's do this together. Now, given that we're talking about two figures that have the same height and at least the area of the base is the same, you might be thinking that Cavalieri's principle might be useful. And just a reminder of what that is, Cavalieri's principle tells us that if you have two figures, and we're thinking in three dimension, three-dimensional version of Cavalieri's principle, if you have two figures that have the same height and at any point along that height the cross-sectional area is the same, then the figures have the same volume. So what we need to do is figure out is it true that at any point in this height do these figures have the same cross-sectional area? Well, to think about that, let's pick an arbitrary point along this height. And just for simplicity, let's pick halfway along the height, although we could do this analysis at any point along the height. So halfway along the height there. Halfway along the height there. So this distance right over here, that would be h over two. This distance right over here would be h over two. This whole thing is h. And what we can do is construct what look like similar triangles, and we can even prove it to ourselves that these are similar triangles. So let me construct them right over here. And the reason why we know they're similar is that this line is going to be parallel to this line and that this line is parallel to that line, to that radius. And how do we know that? Well, we're taking cross-sectional areas that are parallel to the base, that are parallel to the surface on which it sits in this situation. So in either case, these cross-sections are going to be parallel. So these lines, which sit in these cross-sections or sit on the base and sit in the cross-section, have to be parallel as well. Well, because these are parallel lines, this angle is congruent to that angle. This angle is congruent to this angle. 'Cause these are transversals across parallel lines, and these are just corresponding angles. And of course, they share this angle in common. And here, you see very clearly right angle, right angle. This angle is congruent to that angle, and then both triangles share that. And so this smaller triangle in either case is similar to the larger triangle. And what that helps us realize is that the ratio between corresponding sides is going to be the same. So if this side is h over two and the entire height is h, so this is half of the entire height, that tells us that this side is going to be half of r. So this right over here is going to be r over two. And this side over here, by the same argument, is going to be x over two. And so what's the cross-sectional area here? Well, it's going to be x over two squared. So it's going to be x over two squared, which is equal to x squared over four, which is 1/4 of the base's area, which is equal to 1/4 of the base's area. And what about over here? Well, this cross-sectional area is going to be pi times r over two squared, which is the same thing as pi r squared over four, or we could say that is 1/4 pi r squared, which is the same thing as 1/4 of the area of the base. The area of the base is pi r squared. Now we're saying 1/4 pi r squared. So this is going to be equal to 1/4 the area. And we already said that these areas are the same, and so we've just seen that the cross-sectional area at that point of the height of both of these figures is the same. And you could do that 1/4 along the height, 3/4 along the height. You're going to get the same exact analysis. You're gonna have two similar triangles, and you're going to see that you have the same areas, same cross-sectional areas at that point of the height. And so therefore, we see by Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions that these two figures have the same volume. And what's interesting about that is it allows us to take the formula, which we've proven and gotten the intuition for in other videos, for the volume of a pyramid. We've learned that the volume of a pyramid is equal to 1/3 times base times height. And say, well, this one must have the exact same volume. It must also be volume is equal to 1/3 times the area of the base times the height. Because in both of these cases, the area of the base is the same, and the height is the same. And we know that they have the same volume.","Volume of Solids – Explanation & Examples\nHow to Find the Volume of a Solid?\nThe volume of a solid is the measure of how much space an object takes up. This article will show how to calculate the volume of a solid and the volume of regular and irregular solids.\nThe method for determining the volume of solid depends on its shape. The volume of a solid is measured in cubic units, i.e., cubic centimeter, cubic meter, cubic feet, etc.\nVolume of a Solid Formula\nHere are the volume formulas for different regular solids:\n- Rectangular prism\nThe volume of a rectangular prism is equal to the product of base area (length times width) and the height of the prism:\nVolume of a solid rectangular prism = l x w x h\nSince we know all sides or edges of a cube are equal in length, then a cube’s volume is equal to any side, or edge cubed.\nVolume of a cube = a³\nThe volume of a prism is equal to the base area’s product and the height of a prism.\nVolume of a prism = Base area x height\n= B x h\nThe volume of a cylinder is equal to the area of its circular base and a cylinder’s height.\nVolume of a cylinder = πr²h\nThe volume of a pyramid is equal to one -third the product of its base area and its height.\nVolume of a pyramid = 1/3Bh\n- Square pyramid\nFor a square pyramid, the volume is given as:\nWhere s is the side length of the base and h is the height of the pyramid.\n- Rectangular pyramid\nThe volume of a rectangular pyramid = 1/3 l w h\nFor a sphere, the volume is given as:\nVolume of a sphere = 4/3 πr³\nSince a cone is a pyramid whose base is circular, therefore, the volume of a cone is:\nVolume = 1/3 πr²h\nThe volume of irregular solids\nSince not all solids are regular in shape, their volumes cannot be determined using a volume formula.\nIn this case, the volume of irregular shaped solids can be found by water displacement method:\nAn irregular-shaped solid is dropped into a graduated cylinder filled with water.\nThe volume of the solid is then found by determining the difference between the initial and final readings of the graduated cylinder.\nThe water displacement method of finding the volume of irregular shaped solids is only suitable if: a solid does not absorb water and also if a solid does not react with water.\nAlternatively, you can find the volume of an irregular shaped object by applying the following steps:\n- First, break down the irregular solid into regular shapes whose volume can be calculated.\n- Calculate the partial volumes of the small shapes\n- Add up the partial volumes to get the total volume of the irregular-shaped solid.\nCompare the volume of a solid sphere with a radius of 2 cm and a solid square pyramid with a base length of 2.5 cm and a height of 10 cm.\nBy the formula, volume of a sphere = 4/3 πr³\n= 4/3 x 3.14 x 2 x 2 x 2\n= 33.49 cm3\nAnd the volume of a square pyramid = 1/3s²h\n= 1/3 x 2.5 x 2.5 x 10\n= 20.83 cm3\nTherefore, the sphere is larger by volume than the pyramid.\nA cylindrical tank of radius 3 m and height 10 has a hemispherical lid of radius 3 m on the top. Find the volume of the tank.\nFirst, calculate the volume of the cylindrical part of the tank.\nVolume of a cylinder = π r² h\n= 3.14 x 3 x 3 x 10\n= 282.6 m3\nVolume of the hemisphere = 2/3 πr³\n= 2/3 x 3.14 x 3 x 3 x 3\n= 56.52 m3\nThe total volume of the tank = volume of the cylinder + volume of the hemisphere\n= 282.6 m3 + 56.52 m3\n= 339.12 m3\nA truncated square pyramid has a height of 15 cm. Suppose the truncated pyramid’s base length and top lengths are 8 cm and 4 cm, respectively. Find the volume of the truncated pyramid.\nA truncated pyramid is an example of a frustum.\nLet the initial height of the pyramid = x\nBy similar triangles\nx/ x – 15 = 8/4\n4x = 8x – 120\n–4x = –120\nx = 30\nTherefore, the height of the pyramid before truncation was 30 cm\nNow, find the volume of the full pyramid\nVolume = 1/ 3 x 8 x 8 x 30\n= 640 cm3\nVolume of the chopped off part of the pyramid = 1/3 x 4 x 4 x (30 – 15)\n= 1/3 x 16 x 15\n= 80 cm3\nSo, the volume of the truncated pyramid = (640 – 80) cm3\n= 560 cm3.\n- A juice carton has the measurements: 5 units by 4 units by 3 units.

{"question":"¿Cómo afectan las actividades humanas y animales a las algas que crecen en los márgenes de los ríos? Me gustaría entender el impacto ecológico.","answer":"Human and animal activities can significantly impact algae in river margins in several ways: 1) Rapid water drawdown from pumping for irrigation can expose the algal band, and repeated exposure limits primary production, 2) Uncontrolled access of stock and feral animals physically disturbs the algal zone, with even moderate disturbance significantly lowering algal production and requiring many days for recovery, 3) Agricultural herbicides may have toxic effects on aquatic algae, though these effects are poorly understood.","context":["Importance of Flood Flows to the Productivity of Dryland Rivers and Their Floodplains\nProf P.M. Davies, Prof S. E. Bunn and Ms F. Balcombe\nEnvironment Australia, 2003\nThe results of this study show the importance of floodplain inundation to important ecological processes in arid zone rivers. The basic ecological economy of these systems is 'boom' and 'bust', corresponding to extended dry periods and floodplain inundation during major flood events.\nDespite the high natural turbidity, permanent river waterholes in this study had a highly productive band of filamentous algae restricted to the shallow littoral margins. Rates of primary production in this zone are among the highest recorded for streams and rivers in Australia and remain high, even during the winter months. Stable isotope analysis has revealed that this bath-tub ring of algae is the major source of energy driving the food web in the permanent waterholes, and supports large populations of snails, crustaceans and fish.\nFactors that influence the distribution and productivity of the bath-tub ring of algae are likely to have a pronounced effect on ecosystem function. For example:\n- Rapid drawdown of water in river waterholes (e.g. pumping for irrigation) may expose the shallow band of algae. Although algae appear to be tolerant of desiccation, repeated exposure is likely to limit primary production and also reduce availability of this food resource to aquatic grazers.\n- Uncontrolled access of stock and feral animals to the margins of river waterholes can physically disturb the algal zone. We have found that even a moderate level of disturbance significantly lowers algal production and recovery to pre-disturbance levels takes many days. Extensive and repeated disturbance of the margins of waterholes by stock and feral animals could limit algal production and threaten the very food base of snails, crustaceans and fish.\n- The toxic effects of agricultural herbicides on aquatic algal are poorly understood, even though several chemicals (e.g. atrazine) are routinely found in inland rivers. Sub-lethal effects (e.g. reduced primary production) may also be important.\nLarge floods transform a dryland river into a vast, slow-moving wetland, triggering benthic (and pelagic) algal production across the inundated floodplain. At the height of a recent flood on the Cooper, a model estimated that the amount of algal carbon produced on the floodplain during a single day of inundation was equivalent to 82 years of aquatic production in the permanent waterholes during the dry. This boom of production on the floodplain was accompanied by a proliferation of aquatic invertebrates, especially small crustaceans. We recorded ten species of fish on the floodplain of the Cooper reaching an average biomass of over 1 tonne km-2. The diets of all fish species were dominated by aquatic sources and with a greater range of dietary items than that recorded in the dry. Some of this floodplain production undoubtedly returns to river waterholes as fish biomass once floodwaters recede. However, given the small area of permanent waterholes (3.2 km2) in this region compared with inundated floodplain (several thousand km2), much of the aquatic production must either be exported downstream or retained on the floodplain.\nSmall floods and in-channel flows periodically connect populations of aquatic organisms and provide an opportunity for dispersal. Altered flow regimes and changed land management affect patterns of connectivity of waterholes (refugia), and are likely to lead to population declines and loss of biodiversity."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ee1c6001-1b5f-46d3-a044-c31c161fc74a>"],"error":null}

However, under Stalin/Choibalsan's Communist rule, severe restrictions were imposed - only two monasteries were allowed to reopen in 1943 under Stalin's orders (one being Gandan Monastery in Ulaanbaatar) specifically to create an impression of religious freedom for American Vice-President Henry Wallace's visit. The Communist government had previously destroyed over 1,250 monasteries and temples, and all other attempts to reopen temples were blocked by the Ulaanbaatar government.","context":["History of Buddhism in Mongolia\nBuddhism in Mongolia: Three or Five Waves of Cultural Blossoming\nBy Glenn Mullin\nAccording to the Origins of Dharma in the Hor Regions by the great Mongolian scholar Lobsang Tamdrin, Buddhism came to the Hor region in three waves.\n1.The first Mongolian Buddhist wave began in the third century B.C., during the time of the Indian Emperor Ashoka, three centuries before Buddhism took root in China, and some eight centuries before it became firmly established in Tibet. Traditionally Mongolians recognize their second highest incarnate lama, Zaya Pandita, as being an emanation of Emperor Ashoka, perhaps in honor of this early connection.\nAccording to Lobsang Tamdrin, Ashoka extended his empire northward all the way to the Silk Road, and eventually captured the city of Khotan. Khotan was the westernmost region of Hor, and thus in Lobsang Tamdrin’s eyes was part of Mongolia. Emperor Ashoka was a strong Buddhist, and actively promoted Buddhism as the national religion of all lands under his rule.\nFrom Khotan Buddhism gradually spread eastward to the Mongolian Gobi kingdoms along the Silk Road. Lobsang Tamdrin comments that Hor supported a population of over 100,000 Buddhist monks even in these ancient days.\nCave paintings along the Hor section of the Silk Road certainly bear witness to an early Mongol enthusiasm for Buddhism. The cave paintings in Dung Huang of modern-day China are an excellent example. Dung Huang at the time was part of the Mongolian patchwork of kingdoms. It was conquered by the Tibetan emperor Songtsen Gampo in the seventh century A.D., reverted to Mongolia under Chinggis Khan.\n2.The second great wave of Mongolian Buddhism began with Chinggis Khan and his sons, and the special relationship that Chinggis established with the Sakya School of Tibetan Buddhism. Indeed, Chinggis’ grandson Kublai went so far as to have his Tibetan guru Chogyal Pakpa (known to Mongols today as Pakpa Lama) create a special form of the Tibetan Buddhist script for use in all territories under his rule.\nThis script, known as the Pakyig, continued as the formal script of choice by the Mongol emperors who came thereafter, and was in common use for Mongol Buddhist literature until the Third Wave took hold some three centuries later.\nIn fact, one theory holds that Kublai intended to use this script for all purposes throughout his empire, and replace the Chinese and Uighar scripts with it. Only the bubonic plague brought this vision to a close.\nKublai Khan’s strong dedication to Lama Chogyal Pakpa and his brand of Tibetan Buddhism is strongly documented in The Journals of Marco Polo. Marco Polo had been charged by the Vatican Pope with the task of converting Kublai to Christianity. However, although Kublai was happy to sponsor Christians in his court and to retain them as advisors, he personally remained strongly Buddhist. Marco Polo laments this fact in his Journals, attributing his failure to convert the Khan to the superior skills in paranormal activities such as telekinesis demonstrated by Chogyal Pakpa.\nChogyal Pakpa’s biography (still not available in English translation) records the many Buddhist Tantric lineages and teachings that this great lama gave to Kublai Khan and his inner circle, a testament to the dedication that this great khan held for the enlightenment tradition.\nOf note, Dr. Gene Smith, the director of the Tibetan Buddhist Research Center in NY, whose institute to date has digitized almost ten million pages of Tibetan and Mongolian texts, recently wrote to me stating that the oldest surviving manuscript in the TBRC database is a Buddhist text on the Kalachakra Tantra that was published on the occasion of Kublai Khan’s passing in 1294, to ensure the great emperor’s rebirth in the Kalachakra pure land of Shambhala.\nThe fall of Mongolian rule in China, and the according rise of the Ming from Nanking, saw the retreat of the Mongols to their original territories north of the White Wall. Eventually a lack of strong Mongol leadership, and the division of the remaining regions of the empire among the princely khans, also saw a decline of the Buddhist movement, and accordingly of Buddhist art.\n3.Mongolia’s Third Buddhist wave, as outlined by Lobsang Tamdrin in The Origins of Dharma in the Hor Regions, refers to the coming of the Dalai Lama School of Tibetan Buddhism to Mongolia in the 1570s, and its adoption by Altan Khan as the national religion of the country.\nThe Dalai Lama incarnation lineage was not, of course, known by the name “Dalai” at the time. Rather, both at home and abroad he was known as Jey Tamchey Khyenpa, or “The Omniscient Master.” The Third carried the ordination name of Sonam Gyatso. When he arrived in Hohhot, the then southern capital of Mongolia, the king Altan Khan translated the “Gyatso” part of his name in Mongolian. Thus Gyatso became Dalai, and Jey Tamchey Khyenpa became “The Dalai Lama Dorjechang.”\nAlthough Hohhot is now no longer within Mongolian territory, having been stolen by China in the questionable treaty of 1921, the temple built by Altan Khaan for the Third Dalai Lama in Hohhot in 1580 still stands today.\nMoreover, the Erdene Zuu temple built for the Third Dalai Lama in Karakorum by Altai Sain Khan in 1584, had also largely survived, although it was badly damaged and the monks killed, sent to Russian gulags, or “re-educated” under instruction of the murderous Communist dictator Marshal Chobailsan in the 1930s. Later it was turned into a museum, which it remains today. The Dalai Lama Temple in Erdene Zuu is still the earliest Yellow School Temple in Mongolia.\nThe Third Dalai Lama passed away in Hor in 1588. Not long after his passing a Mongol child was born in the family of Prince Sechen Chokhor, one of Altan Khan’s grandsons. Although he and his wife had both been disciples of the great Third Dalai Lama, they were rather shocked when the State Oracle in Lhasa announced that the Third Dalai Lama’s rebirth had taken place in Mongolia. They were even more shocked a year later when the search team from Lhasa identified their son as that reincarnation. This was the first time that a Dalai Lama was reborn outside of Tibet.\nEventually the child was enthroned as the official reincarnation, and was taken to Kumbum, the monastery in Kokonor that had been built a generation earlier by the Third Dalai Lama on Lama Tsongkhapa’s birthplace. Here the child spent some time learning the Tibetan language, as well as memorizing the basic Buddhist liturgies. He then continued on to Lhasa and his enthronement in Drepung Monastery.\nOf note, at that time the Kumbum area belonged to Mongolia, and not to Tibet. The present Dalai Lama was born some twenty miles from the monastery, and the former Panchen Lama also somewhat nearby. The region is still predominantly Mongol, although these days it lies within the Chinese province of Qinghai. “Qinghai,” of course, is itself a Mongolian word, as is “Kokonor.”\nThe work of the Third and Fourth Dalai Lamas had a major impact on the enlightenment tradition of Mongolia. The Yellow School quickly became the dominant spiritual force in the country as a result of their inspiring deeds. This school remains the largest spiritual tradition in Mongolia today.\nThe Fourth Wave of Mongolian Buddhism\nLobsang Tamdrin’s Hor Chojung mentions hundreds of other Buddhist lineages that came to Mongolia over the centuries.\nTibetan Buddhism, for example, began its flow northward in the seventh century, when the Lhasa King Songtsen Gampo conquered large sections of west and southwestern Hor, including Khotan and Kokonor. The pace picked up with Padma Sambhava’s work in Tibet in the eighth century. Two of his twenty-five main disciples were Mongol (Sokpo Tamdrin and Sokpo Lhapel), and they carried their lineages back with them. Early traces of the Nyingma School can be found from this period.\nThen, according to legend, after the Buddhist monk Pelgyi Dorje assassinated the Tibetan king Langdarma in 841, he fled to Mongolia for sanctuary, and built a monastery near Karakorum. Mongols today speak as this as Ogin Hrid, the ruins of which can still be seen.\nHowever, the three waves listed by Lobsang Tamdrin certainly played the most dominant roles in defining the Mongol character as well as Mongolian history.It is relevant to speak of a fourth wave with the advent of Under Gegen, a Mongol lama who travelled to Tibet in the mid-seventeenth century, became a close friend of the Fifth Dalai Lama. The two were co-students of the great Fourth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chokyi Gyaltsen.\nLater Under Gegen became “lama king” of Mongolia, a role somewhat modeled on that of the Fifth Dalai Lama in Lhasa. Today he is popularly referred to as Zanabazar, a Mongolian mispronunciation of the Sanskrit form of his Tibetan monastic name, or Yeshe Dorje. Yeshe Dorje becomes Jnanavajra in Sanskrit, a name not easy to the Mongol tongue. It emerged as Zanabazar. Like the Fourth Dalai Lama, he also was a direct descendent of Chinggis Khaan.\nZanabazar work could rightly be called a fourth wave of Mongolian Buddhism, because it came to pervade much of the Hor region. His vision of Mongolian Buddhism flourished for more than two and a quarter centuries, until the Communist takeover of 1921.\nIt continued until the Cultural Purges of 1928-1938, when most lamas and monks were killed, sent to gulags, or “re-educated.”\n5.The Cultural Holocaust of 1928-1938\nThe Soviet-backed “Modern Mongolia” that emerged in 1921 proved to be a mixed blessing. Less than a decade later Stalin carried Russia into a path of unprecedented mass murder, social repression, and seemingly endless cultural purges, and Mongolia soon fell prey to the same evils. The Mongol regions directly under Russian occupation (Buriatia, Siberia and Tuva) suffered first, but this soon spread to independent Mongolia.\nOne rarely meets a Mongol who did not lose several relatives during that period. Known by the somewhat benign term as “The Cultural Purges,” the Communists systematically rounded up all representatives of Mongolia’s pre-Communist period.\nMany were murdered with a single bullet through the head, as was done in the Soviet Union. Others suffered an even worse fate, being deported to Soviet concentration camps, where they became guinea pigs in Stalin’s program of chemical experimentation. Two of my best friends in Ulaanbaatar, today prominent members of the new democratic Mongolian government, spoke of how several of their ancestors were arrested, purged, deported and then murdered in these ways.\nA small museum in Ulaanbaatar documents some of the most horrific events of these cultural purges, and Mongolians are only now coming to terms with what they lost during that period.\nIn the recent decade, the Arts Council of Mongolia has documented more than 1,250 monasteries and temples that were destroyed in this way, together with their libraries, art reserves, medical facilities and other treasures.\nThen a rather curious event occurred in 1943. Rumors emerges that the American vice-president Henry Wallace would be visiting Moscow to discuss agricultural aid that the American government had given to the Soviet Union, and that he had requested to see Ulan Ude in Buryatia and Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia.\nWallace had been a friend and student of Nicholas Roerich, and through Roerich had developed an interest in Mongolia and Mongolian Buddhism.\nStalin, wanting to give the impression that there was religious freedom in the Mongol lands, and sent out the order that a monastery should be opened in each of these two cities. A few dozen surviving monks had to be found to fill them.\nThus it came to pass that two monasteries were re-opened in the Mongol territories during the Stalin /Choibalsan era. One of them was Gandan Monastery in Ulaanbaatar, and stayed open throughout the remaining five decades of the Communist era as Mongolia’s only monastery.\nAll other attempts to re-open temples or monasteries were quashed by the Ulaanbaatar government.\n6.The Fall of Communism\nThe collapse of the Communist rule over the Soviet Union in 1989 resulted in rapid changes within Mongolia, and a democratic government quickly emerged. Things transformed almost overnight. By the mid-1990s the country had privatized most property and state assets, relaxed regulations on international travel, granted freedom of the press, and dismantled most of its state-owned monopolies.\nNow, almost two decades later Mongolia is a different country altogether. Young Mongolians now study in universities all over the globe, where previously they had been restricted to institutions in Soviet-bloc countries.\nDemocracy also brought freedom of religion to Mongols. Whereas Ganden was the only monastery allowed during the Communist era, the people were now allowed to rebuild some of what had been destroyed. To date, small replicas of approximately 200 temples have been created across the country. All of them are tiny compared to the originals that were ravaged by the Communists almost seven decades ago, but it is nonetheless a proud beginning.\nIn addition, whereas during the Communist period the few monks permitted by the government were under the complete control of the secret police, especially in terms of education and travel, there are now somewhere between three and five hundred monks and nuns training in the great Tibetan monasteries of India.\nAmong the new monasteries there is Idgaa Choiziling college of Ganden Monastery in Ulaanbaatar, which was entirely rebuilt with the financial support of FPMT Mongolia.\nMongolians still face economic hardships and relentless religious challenges. However with the continual establishment of many Buddhist monasteries and centers, Mongolians can now face the future with the support and inspiration of the compassionate teaching of the Buddha. Buddhism is in the heart of every aspect of Mongolian culture. The revival of this powerful Buddhist heritage is critical to Mongolia’s future peace and happiness.\nGlenn Mullin is the author of more than two dozen books on Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism, including translations of many important works by the early Dalai Lamas, especially the First to Seventh in the line of reincarnations. Many of these have been translated into a half dozen languages around the world","|Part of a series on|\nThe Jebtsundamba Khutuktu (Mongolian: Жавзандамба хутагт, Javzandamba Khutagt; Tibetan: རྗེ་བཙུན་དམ་པ་, Wylie: rje btsun dam pa, \"Holy Precious Master\") are the spiritual heads of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. They also hold the title of Bogd Gegeen, making them the top-ranked lamas in Mongolia.\nThe first Jebtsundamba, Zanabazar (1635–1723), was identified as the reincarnation of the scholar Taranatha of the Jonang school of Tibetan Buddhism. Zanabazar was the son of the Tüsheet Khan Gombodorj, ruler of central Khalkha Mongolia, and himself became the spiritual head of the Khalkha Mongols.\nLike Zanabazar, the 2nd Jebtsundamba Khutughtu was a member of Mongolia's highest nobility and direct descendant of Genghis Khan. After Chingünjav's rebellion and the demise of the second Jebtsundamba Khutugtu, the Qianlong Emperor decreed in 1758 that all future reincarnations were to be found from among the population of Tibet.\nWhen northern Mongolia declared independence in 1911, the eighth Jebtsundamba (1869–1924) was elevated to theocratic ruler, called Bogd Khan. He was the head of state until his death in 1924. The communist government of the Mongolian People's Republic, which replaced the theocracy in 1924, declared that there were to be no further reincarnations.\nA reincarnation was in fact found almost at once in north Mongolia, and some high lamas of the dead Khutughtu's suite went to interview the child's mother, Tsendjav, and to instruct her in the details of the life of the former incarnation, so that she could familiarize the child-candidate with the tests which he would have to undergo. Faced with the possibility of a new Khutughtu who was born within Mongolia and was not even a foreigner from Tibet, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided in July 1925 to turn the matter over to the elderly 13th Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The Dalai Lama's decision would nonetheless be subject to new Mongolian legislation for the separation of church and state. In February 1929, the installation of any further Khutughtus was forbidden.\nA 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu was installed by the 14th Dalai Lama as the head of a reinvigorated Jonang lineage. He was born Jampal Namdol Chökyi Gyaltsen in 1932 and he died in early 2012. Despite the Chinese government's claim to have inherited the authority and ultimate decision right for the choice of successor of all high lamas in Mongolia and Tibet, the 9th Jebstundamba has passed will to be reincarnated within the independent Mongolia and the selection will be confirmed by the Dalai Lama. This puts China in a dilemma of endangering their foreign affairs with Mongolia for the choice of the next Lama or to forfeit this right that they claim to have control of religious affairs, ultimately giving up their authority over the choice of the next Dalai Lama and putting their current choice of the Panchen Lama in question.\nList of Jebtsundamba Khutuktus\nBogdo gegeen (Mongolian and ceremonial Tibetan-language names)\n- 1635 - 1723 Öndör Gegeen Zanabazar (Blo-bzang-bstan-pa'i-rgyal-mtshan), 1st Jebtsundamba Khutughtu\n- 1724 - 1757 Luvsandambiydonmi (Blo-bzang-bstan-pa'i-srgon-me), 2nd Jebtsundamba Khutughtu\n- 1758 - 1773 Ishdambiynyam (Ye-shes-bstan-pa'i-nyi-ma), 3rd Jebtsundamba Khutughtu\n- 1775 - 1813 Luvsantüvdenvanchug (Blo-bzang-thub-bstan-dbang-phyug), 4th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu\n- 1815 - 1841 Luvsanchültimjigmed (Blo-bzang-tshul-khrim-'jigs-med), 5th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu\n- 1843 - 1848 Luvsantüvdenchoyjijaltsan (Blo-bzang-dpal-ldan-bstan-pa), 6th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu\n- 1850 - 1868 Agvaanchoyjivanchugperenlaijamts (Ngag-dbang-chos-kyi-dbang-phyug-'phrin-las-rgya-mtsho), 7th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu\n- 1870 - 20 May 1924 Agvaanluvsanchoyjindanzanvaanchigbalsambuu (Ngag-dbang-blo-bzang-chos-rje-nyi-ma-bstan-'dzin-dbang-phyug rJe-btsun-dam-pa Bla-ma), 8th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu and Bogd Khan (b. 1869 - d. 1924)\n- 1936 - 1 March 2012 Jambalnamdolchoyjijantsan (Jampal Namdrol Chokye Gyaltsen), 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu (b. 1932 - d.

{"question":"I'm into winter sports - how can I enjoy Lake Vermilion State Park during the snowy season?","answer":"Lake Vermilion State Park offers several winter activities due to its annual snowfall of about 52 inches. The park features easy rolling hills on former logging trails that are ideal for Nordic Skiing. For snowmobilers, the Taconite Trail runs through the southern portion of the park with a spur that leads to the mine or visitor's center. Additionally, the Soudan Underground Mine could be open for winter tours if there are enough trail users. The park is designed to be a year-round destination for winter sports enthusiasts.","context":["New state parks don’t come in a box. If they did, the new Lake Vermilion State Park would come in a large puzzle box with thousands of pieces.\nThe box cover would display a panoramic picture taken from one of the park’s rocky peaks, capturing a bird’s-eye view of the 40,000-acre lake, complete with 368 islands and 340 miles of pine covered shoreline, demonstrating why Lake Vermilion is listed as one of Minnesota’s ten largest lakes.\nProject Manager Erika Rivers and a cadre of experts are charged with putting all the pieces of the Lake Vermilion State Park together in a plan by the end of the year. Earlier this year, the state purchased the 3,000-acre plot of land-directly east of the 900-acre Soudan Underground Mine State Park-from U.S. Steel for $18 million.\nBefore the first campfire is lit, civil engineers, botanists, archeologists, historians, wildlife specialists and user groups will gather all the pieces in piles, one for the lake and sky, another for the land of trees, rock, trails and camping possibilities and a third for the cultural and regional possibilities of this new venture.\nA big piece of the puzzle is the 10 miles of shore on the southern edge of Lake Vermilion spreading across Swedetown, Stuntz, Mattson, Cable and Armstrong Bays. Stuntz Bay, located in the Soudan portion of the property, has a popular and historic boat landing with 144 corrugated steel boathouses listed on the National Registry of Historic Places. The boathouses were built in the first half of the 20th Century, and since they became part of Soudan Underground Mine State Park, questions have arisen about how these man-made survivors fit into the mission of the park. Are they quaint representations of the lake’s history or an obstruction to the shore’s natural beauty?\nHundreds of motorboats launch from Stuntz Bay every weekend, and the park is expected to become a destination for thousands of boaters using the lake. One piece of the Vermilion puzzle will be how to provide camping accessability for motorboats and paddle craft. Planners envision shoreline campsites for boaters, hikers, skiers or dog sleds. Another possibility could be camper cabins or yurts at some remote sites.\nMost pieces of this puzzle display rock, marsh and hills.\nThe rock can be found at the top of the many tall peaks overlooking the lake like the 1,589-foot peak overlooking Mattson Bay. Three rock formations converge at this site, mixing with the remains of a dramatic volcano some 2.7 billion years ago and making rare rock formations.\nBefore the underground mine was built, hundreds of 8- to 10-foot deep test pits were dug on the property, offering interpretive opportunities, but also strange obstacles to building campsites and trails.\nFor decades beavers have built 10- to 20-foot dams, creating large ponds and marshlands throughout the center of the park. Visible from the peaks, these are good for wildlife watching.\n“These rocks, marshland and hills give the park its beauty, but they also make it hard to plan campsites, toilets and trails,” said Larry Peterson, a civil engineer and park developer.\n“This causes us to be more creative in the design and layout of the facilities. You can’t expect beaver dams to look and function the exact same way-even over the course of a ten-year period, so you have to work within the naturally changing framework of these structures,” added Peterson.\nPeterson notes while campsites need level ground, they aren’t built in the wide spaces once used.\nThis 3,000-acre piece of land doesn’t have the pristine, untouched beauty of the Boundary Waters. It’s tall white and red pines were logged off like much of northern Minnesota around the turn of the century. Thirty years ago, much of the property was logged again leaving a terrain of aspen, birch and rough-cut logging trails.\nFortunately, a 300-foot strip of pines has been left along the shoreline and many large pines remain in the park.\nThe legislature mandates each state park reestablish plants and animals that existed during pre-settlement conditions. Regional Resource Specialist Tavis Westbrook has been surveying every corner of the new park and believes the forest may partially return to its original condition in a few generations.\n“Logging can mimic natural forest disturbance much like a forest fire by setting the clock back to zero. The first growth comes in aspen and birch. If enough seed trees remain, a growth of pine, balsam, spruce and cedar could follow. We can help the return of conifer trees in selected areas where regeneration is not happening with select plantings. For now, we are just seeing that initial cohort of species typical of a younger forest in northern Minnesota. With that said, parks will manage this land quite differently than how it’s been managed in the past. By allowing natural processes to occur and encouraging older forests, many areas of the park will succeed without much intervention. Either way, it would take generations,” said Westbrook.\nNow that the U.S. Steel land is in public hands, two regional trails can be worked into this park puzzle.\nThe Mesabi Trail running from Grand Rapids to Tower can soon be extended through the park, on to Bear Head Lake State Park and then to Ely, allowing bikers to span the 18-mile addition.\n“This is a wonderful thing. We just have to figure out how it is going to fit. The trail from Tower into the park is about seventy percent clear. We now need to find a way to cover the remaining thirty percent without disturbing trees. The state may also be moving Hwy 169 to the south, giving us an opportunity to use the old Hwy. 169 if possible,” said Bob Manzoline, Executive Director of the St. Louis & Lake Countries Regional Railroad Authority that oversees the Mesabi Trail.\nManzoline also said they have records of an old portage trail through the area that archeologists are trying to locate.\nHe added a group of Ely dog sled enthusiasts would like to ride the new Mesabi trail (which may follow an old portage trail), to the park, stay over night and return the next day.\nThe Taconite Trail has brought snowmobilers through the area for many years. A spur cuts through the southern portion of the park, which could be used to bring snowmobilers to the mine or a visitor’s center.\nPark Manager Jim Essig believes the Soudan Underground Mine could be open for tours in the winter if trail users increased.\nNo picture of Lake Vermilion would be complete without snow, about 52 inches a year to be exact. Rivers sees the park as a year-round destination. Many of the logging trails are over easy rolling hills just right for Nordic Skiing.\nThe people in this puzzle are as varied as the park’s history. Dakota and Ojibwa used the area to hunt, fish and gather berries and herbs. Voyageurs out of Montreal came to trade for beaver pelts some 350 years ago. Miners came in the middle of the 19thcentury to extract iron ore.\nEach group of people has left a significant mark on this parkland. How to interpret that mark will be an important part of the Vermilion puzzle.\nThere are also many types of people wanting to use the park, from backpackers to RV campers, from skiers to snowmobilers, from kayakers to houseboaters and from rock hounds to mining tourists.\n“We know many people will want to use this park in many ways,” said Park Manager Essig. “Our challenge will be how are we going to accommodate them and preserve the natural resources at the same time.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3a6d8d00-9c6a-413a-bbbe-849d2c376cea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do modern institutions implement the Golden Rule compared to its traditional religious interpretations?","answer":"Modern institutions implement the Golden Rule through formal programs and initiatives, while religious interpretations focus on spiritual and moral guidance. For example, Arizona established itself as a 'Golden Rule State' with a program to recognize citizens who demonstrate living by this principle through good deeds and acts of kindness, allowing people to nominate others who treat people as they wish to be treated. In contrast, religious interpretations, as seen in Romans, emphasize spiritual aspects like not judging others and treating fellow believers as family members in God's household. Both approaches share the core principle of treating others well, but differ in their implementation - institutional versus spiritual.","context":["Reading through Romans\n+ In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\nPraise to You, Lord Jesus Christ, King of endless glory. You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.\nA reading from Romans: Romans 14:2–13a (NLT)\nFor instance, one person believes it’s all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables. Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don’t. And those who don’t eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them. Who are you to condemn someone else’s servants? Their own master will judge whether they stand or fall. And with the Lord’s help, they will stand and receive his approval.\nIn the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable. Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him. Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating. And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God. For we don’t live for ourselves or die for ourselves. If we live, it’s to honor the Lord. And if we die, it’s to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. Christ died and rose again for this very purpose — to be Lord both of the living and of the dead.\nSo why do you condemn another believer? Why do you look down on another believer? Remember, we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. For the Scriptures say, “‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will declare allegiance to God.’”\nYes, each of us will give a personal account to God. So let’s stop condemning each other.\nReflection: Romans 14:2–13a (John Stott, The Message of Romans: God’s Good News for the World)\nThe will of God for changed relationships: (Romans 12:1–15:13)\nAll believers, irrespective of their ethnic origin, are brothers and sisters in the one international family of God, and so all have precisely the same vocation to be the holy, committed, humble, loving and conscientious people of God.\n(Romans 14:1-15:13) Our relationship to the weak: welcoming, and not despising, judging or offending them\nIf we are trying to picture a weaker brother or sister, we must not envisage a vulnerable Christian easily overcome by temptation, but a sensitive Christian full of indecision and scruples.

This principle is better even than the golden rule. It is safe to treat others as we would like them to treat us, but it is safer still to treat them as God does.\n(ii) Welcome him because Christ died and rose to be the Lord (4–9)\n[Paul] lifts the very mundane question of our mutual relationships in the Christian community to the high theological level of the death, resurrection and consequent universal lordship of Jesus. Because he is our Lord, we must live for him. Because he is also the Lord of our fellow Christians, we must respect their relationship to him and mind our own business. For he died and rose to be Lord.\n(iii) Welcome him because he is your brother (10a)\nWe are related to one another in the strongest possible way, by family ties. Whether we are thinking of the weak, with all their tedious doubts and fears, or of the strong, with all their brash assurances and freedoms, they are our brothers and sisters. When we remember this, our attitude to them becomes at once less critical and impatient, more generous and tender.\n(iv) Welcome him because we will all stand before God’s judgment seat (10b–13a)\nBecause God is the Judge and we are among the judged, let us stop passing judgment on one another, for then we shall avoid the extreme folly of trying to usurp God’s prerogative and anticipate judgment day.\n“Revelation Song” – Kari Jobe\nChrist, as a light illumine and guide me.

Golden Rule Ethics, 3 CEUs\nDescription: Give what you want to get. That is a very simple summary of the Golden Rule (GR). The GR tries to connect you with the other person that you are dealing with in a very mutual way. If you give trouble, you get trouble. If you give kindness, kindness comes back to you. In this way, you control your environment. You can do something about your circumstances. You are not at the mercy of others. If you do them good, they will do good to you. Or at least that is how we start.\nObjectives: After completing the course, participants will: 1. understand the meaning of the Golden Rule, 2. be able to report how it is applied, and 3. list ways how it fits into the study of ethics.\n1.1 What is the Golden Rule?\nQuestion: “What is the Golden Rule?”\nAnswer: The “Golden Rule” is the name given to a principle Jesus taught in His Sermon on the Mount. The actual words “Golden Rule” are not found in Scripture, just as the words “Sermon on the Mount” are also not found. These titles were later added by Bible translation teams in order to make Bible study a little easier. The phrase “Golden Rule” began to be ascribed to this Jesus’ teaching during the 16th–17th centuries.\nWhat we call the Golden Rule refers to Matthew 7:12: “So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.” Jesus knew the human heart and its selfishness. In fact, in the preceding verse, He describes human beings as innately “evil” (verse 11). Jesus’ Golden Rule gives us a standard by which naturally selfish people can gauge their actions: actively treat others the way they themselves like to be treated.\nThe English Standard Version translates the Golden Rule like this: “Whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.” Jesus brilliantly condenses the entire Old Testament into this single principle, taken from Leviticus 19:18: “Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.” Again, we see the implication that people are naturally lovers of self, and the command uses that human flaw as a place to start in how to treat others.\nPeople universally demand respect, love, and appreciation, whether they deserve it or not. Jesus understood this desire and used it to promote godly behavior. Do you want to be shown respect? Then respect others. Do you crave a kind word? Then speak words of kindness to others. “It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35). The Golden Rule is also part of the second greatest commandment, preceded only by the command to love God Himself (Matthew 22:37–39).\nWhat is interesting to note about the Golden Rule is that no other religious or philosophical system has its equal. Jesus’ Golden Rule is not the “ethic of reciprocity” so commonly espoused by non-Christian moralists. Frequently, liberal critics and secular humanists attempt to explain away the uniqueness of the Golden Rule, saying it is a common ethic shared by all religions. This is not the case. Jesus’ command has a subtle, but very important, difference. A quick survey of the sayings of Eastern religions will make this plain:\n• Confucianism: “Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you” (Analects 15:23)\n• Hindusim: “This is the sum of duty: do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you” (Mahabharata 5:1517)\n• Buddhism: “Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful” (Udanavarga 5:18)\nThese sayings are similar to the Golden Rule but are stated negatively and rely on passivity. Jesus’ Golden Rule is a positive command to show love proactively. The Eastern religions say, “Refrain from doing”; Jesus says, “Do!” The Eastern religions say it is enough to hold your negative behavior in check; Jesus says to look for ways to act positively. Because of the “inverted” nature of the non-Christian sayings, they have been described as the “silver rule.”\nSome have accused Jesus of “borrowing” the idea of the Golden Rule from the Eastern religions. However, the texts for Confucianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism, cited above, were all written between 500 and 400 BC, at the earliest. Jesus takes the Golden Rule from Leviticus, written about 1450 BC. So, Jesus’ source for the Golden Rule predates the “silver rule” by about 1,000 years. Who “borrowed” from whom?\nThe command to love is what separates the Christian ethic from every other religion’s ethic. In fact, the Bible’s championing of love includes the radical command to love even one’s enemies (Matthew 5:43–44; cf. Exodus 23:4–5). This is unheard of in other religions.\nObeying the Christian imperative to love others is a mark of a true Christian (John 13:35). In fact, Christians cannot claim to love God if they don’t actively love other people as well. “If someone says, ‘I love God’ and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen” (1 John 4:20). The Golden Rule encapsulates this idea and is unique to the Judeo-Christian Scriptures.\n1.2 What Does The Golden Rule Mean?\nRead the following article by Paul Dallgas-Frey about the meaning of the Golden Rule (Source)\nThe Golden Rule\n“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”\nBut what does that mean exactly?\nOne day a large crowd…\n…was following Jesus.\nSo he climbed to the top of a hill so every one could see him. He sat down on a rock, and all the people sat down on the grass around him. And then Jesus began to tell them all about God (after all, who would know better than God’s own son!).\nWhat he said was something like this…\n“If you were a mom or a dad, and one of your children asked you for something for breakfast, would you give them a snake? Or a bowl full of spiders? No! You know better than that! And you know hardly anything about being a parent.\n“Just think then. Your Father in heaven knows everything about being a good parent. When you ask him for something, will He give you something bad? Would He give you a bowl of spiders? No way! He will give you only what is good.\n“Don’t you see? You already know what is good and what is bad. So always do for other people what you would like them to do for you. You know that that is good. Be good to others, just like you want them to be good to you. That is what all the laws in all the world are really all about.”\n… Jesus was teaching his disciples and he said to them, “Now I am going to tell you something that is hard to do.\n“Love your enemies.\n“Even if they hate you, and do mean things to you, love them back. If someone pulls your hair, don’t pull theirs back. Do something nice for them instead. If someone takes something of yours, don’t get all mad and try to grab it back. Instead, let them have it, and be happy for them, just like you would be happy if they let you have something of theirs.\n“That’s hard! But believe me, if everyone did this, it would change the world!\n“Do for others just what you want them to do for you. If you really do that, you may just find that your enemy will become your friend.”\n1.4 Additional Reading\n- Research into the Golden Rule\n- “The Golden Rule” from Baker’s Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology\n- The term “Golden Rule” is not found in Scripture, but is the popular way of referring to the words of Jesus\n2. How the Golden Rule is Applied\n2.1 Golden Rule State\nMay 13, 2003\nFor more information, contact Kevin Tyne at 602-542-4919.\nSecretary of State Jan Brewer Announces New Program\nArizonans can nominate those who Live by the Golden Rule for Recognition\nPHOENIX – At a signing ceremony declaring Arizona a “Golden Rule State,” Secretary of State Jan Brewer today announced a new program to recognize Arizonan citizens “who live by the Golden Rule.” The signing ceremony was conducted to present copies of Senate Concurrent Resolution 1006, “a concurrent resolution encouraging the citizens of Arizona to live the Golden Rule” to members of the legislature and media. As part of the ceremony Secretary Brewer handed out Golden Rule marbles to remind those to live the rule.\nAs a new “Golden Rule” state, Secretary Brewer established the Golden Rule program to recognize those who treat others the way they would like to be treated and who make a difference in Arizona.\n“I am pleased to present this great new program that celebrates people who truly make a difference in our lives,” stated Secretary Brewer. “I think Arizonans should take time out to recognize those who demonstrate and exemplify ‘living the golden rule’. People need to be acknowledged for their good deeds and acts of kindness.”\nSecretary Brewer explained the process which is very easy to nominate someone as a Golden Rule Citizen. Those interested simply need to log on to the Secretary of State Web page at www.azsos.gov, click on the “Golden Rule” link, and fill out a nomination form. For those without Internet access, Arizonans are encouraged to use computers available at either the Secretary of State’s Office in Phoenix, 1700 W. Washington, the Tucson Satellite Office at400 W. Congress, 2nd Floor, Room 252, or visit their local library.\n“Living the ‘Golden Rule’ really is contagious,” said Secretary Brewer. “The positive affect from just one person living the rule often influences many others to do the same.”\nE37.2 Golden Rule City\nWhat Is a Golden Rule City?\nIn 2003, the State of Arizona declared itself to be a “Golden Rule State”. On November 18, 2008, the Flagstaff City Council followed the State’s lead by unanimously passing Resolution No. 2008-68 designating the City of Flagstaff as a “Golden Rule City”. The Flagstaff community cherishes the diversity that has made Flagstaff into the multifaceted northern Arizona gem that it has become. Cultures, faiths, and languages are the basis of a thriving, synergistic population. In such a community, prejudice, hate, bigotry, and intolerance have no place.The ultimate goal of a Golden Rule City is that its citizens treat each other the way they would like to be treated; helping those in need, embracing diversity, and transcending differences. Resolution No. 2008-68\n2.3 The Golden Rule in the Bible\nSummation of the Golden Rule\n- Matthew 7:12 – So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. (NIV)\nApplications of the Golden Rule from the Bible\n- Luke 6:31 – And just as you want people to be doing to you, be doing to them likewise. (DLNT)\n- Galatians 5:14 – For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself. (ESV)\n- James 2:8 – If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. (NASB)\n- Mark 12:31 – The second most important commandment is this: ‘Love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ No other commandment is greater than these. (GW)\n- 1 Peter 3:9 – Do not pay others back evil for evil or insult for insult. Instead, keep blessing them, because you were called to inherit a blessing. (ISV)\n- Matthew 7:1-5 – Do not judge, so that you may not be judged. For with the judgment you make you will be judged, and the measure you give will be the measure you get. Why do you see the speck in your neighbor’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to your neighbor, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while the log is in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor’s eye. (NRSV)\n3. Golden Rule Ethics\n3.1 Golden Rule Reasoning\nGolden Rule Reasoning, Moral Judgement and Law\nThis article examines ‘Golden Rule reasoning’ – reasoning according to the principle that we should treat others as we would have them treat us – as a basis for moral action and as a criterion for assessing the moral quality and implications of laws. After distinguishing the Golden Rule from other ideas and principles with which it is sometimes associated, I embark upon a defence of the Golden Rule as a principle of fairness. The main approach to defending this principle has been to detach Golden Rule-based behaviour from the desires of agents and recipients. The purpose of adopting this approach is to avoid reducing the Golden Rule to the proposition that we are entitled to impose on others preferences that we would happily have imposed on us. I examine various attempts to show that the Golden Rule requires that agents do not simply project their values and desires onto others and I argue that the most successful of these is R. M. Hare’s explanation of Golden Rule reasoning in universal prescriptivist terms. Although the universal prescriptivist explanation is open to various criticisms – as becomes obvious when it is applied to particular moral problems such euthanasia and abortion – it nevertheless provides a strong philosophical basis for claiming not only that Golden Rule reasoning need not be connected to particular tastes and preferences but also that, as a matter of moral principle, we should never tolerate double standards where cases are relevantly similar. While I accept and try demonstrate the merits of interpreting the Golden Rule in universal prescriptivist terms, however, I conclude that a more robust interpretation of the Rule is one which is advanced by some natural law philosophers and which has it that doing to others as one would have done to oneself is necessarily a case of doing good towards others. The article ends with some reflections on the implications this version of Golden Rule reasoning for legal policy-making, and in particular for the abortion debate.\n3.2 Ethics and the Golden Rule\nIt is commonly accepted that the golden rule―most often formulated as “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”―is a unifying element between many diverse religious traditions, both Eastern and Western. Its influence also extends beyond such traditions, since many non-religious individuals hold up the golden rule as central to their lives.\nYet, while it is extraordinarily important and widespread, the golden rule is often dismissed by scholars as a vague proverb that quickly leads to absurdities when one attempts to formulate it in clear terms. In this book, Harry J. Gensler defends the golden rule and addresses all of the major philosophic objections, pointing out several common misunderstanding and misapplications. Gensler first discusses golden-rule reasoning and how to avoid the main pitfalls. He then relates the golden rule to world religions and history, and to areas like moral education, egoism, evolution, society, racism, business, and medicine. The book ends with a discussion of theoretical issues (like whether all morality reduces to the golden rule, which the author argues against).\nThe first couple chapters are available as a preview on on Amazon’s Website. This book is recommended if you wish to study this topic in further depth.\n3.3. What is Ethics in Research & Why is it Important?\n“When most people think of ethics (or morals), they think of rules for distinguishing between right and wrong, such as the Golden Rule (“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you”), a code of professional conduct like the Hippocratic Oath (“First of all, do no harm”), a religious creed like the Ten Commandments (“Thou Shalt not kill…”), or a wise aphorisms like the sayings of Confucius. This is the most common way of defining “ethics”: norms for conduct that distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior…”\nRead the rest of this article on the following site:\n- What is Ethics in Research & Why is it Important?\n- By David B.

{"question":"Hola! Me gustaría saber cuáles son los componentes básicos necesarios para controlar un relay con Arduino? 🤔","answer":"The basic components needed to control a relay with Arduino are: a 5v or 6v relay, BC547 transistor, 1k resistor, breadboard or PCB, connecting jumper wires, power supply, 1n4007 diode, and a screw terminal or terminal block.","context":["Arduino Relay Control Tutorial\nLED Blinking is a very common and almost first program for every embedded learner or beginner. In which we blink an LED with having some delay. So today we are here with the same project but here we will use an AC bulb instead of normal LED and will blink an AC bulb.\nWhenever we need to connect any AC Appliance in our embedded circuits, we use a Relay. So in this arduino relay control tutorial we will simply learn How to interface a Relay with Arduino. Here we are not using any Relay Driver IC like ULN2003 and will only use an NPN transistor to control relay.\n- 5v or 6v relay\n- AC appliance or Bulb\n- BC547 transistor\n- 1k resistor\n- Breadboard or PCB\n- Connecting jumper wire\n- Power supply\n- 1n4007 diode\n- Screw terminal or terminal block\nRelay is an electromagnetic switch, which is controlled by small current, and used to switch ON and OFF relatively much larger current. Means by applying small current we can switch ON the relay which allows much larger current to flow. A relay is a good example of controlling the AC (alternate current) devices, using a much smaller DC current. Commonly used Relay is Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) Relay.\nWhen there is no voltage applied to the coil, COM (common) is connected to NC (normally closed contact). When there is some voltage applied to the coil, the electromagnetic field produced, which attracts the Armature (lever connected to spring), and COM and NO (normally open contact) gets connected, which allow a larger current to flow. Relays are available in many ratings, here we used 6V operating voltage relay, which allows 7A-250VAC current to flow.\nThe relay is always configured by using a small Driver circuit which consists a Transistor, Diode and a resistor. Transistor is used to amplify the current so that full current (from the DC source – 9v battery) can flow through a coil to fully energies it. The resistor is used to provide biasing to the transistor. And Diode is used to prevent reverse current flow, when the transistor is switched OFF. Every Inductor coil produces equal and opposite EMF when switched OFF suddenly, this may cause permanent damage to components, so Diode must be used to prevent reverse current. A Relay module is easily available in the market with all its Driver circuit on the board or you can create it on perf board or PCB like below. Here we have used 6V Relay module.\nHere to turn on the Relay with Arduino we just need to make that Arduino Pin High (A0 in our case) where Relay module is connected.

{"question":"How do biometric fingerprint systems and password-based authentication compare in terms of security risks? 🤔","answer":"Biometric fingerprint systems offer several security advantages over password-based authentication. While passwords can be weak (like '123abc' or 'Pa$$w0rd'), easily guessed, shared, lost, or stolen, fingerprints cannot be easily duplicated, shared, or stolen. Fingerprint authentication provides proof of identity and eliminates the costs and efforts needed to manage lost passwords or tokens. However, biometric systems are not 100% accurate, as they rely on matching against stored templates and can have False Match Rates (FMR) and False Non-Match Rates (FNMR). Password systems, in contrast, provide definitive yes/no authentication but are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and social engineering.","context":["Biometric Access ControlYour Fingerprint – Always with you!\nIdentity Management is about proving you are who you say you are.\nBiometric Fingerprint Access Control\nWHY USE BIOMETRICS?\nTO IDENTIFY A PERSON\nIdentification answers the question: \"Who is this person?\"\nIdentification (one to many) consists of matching a fingerprint captured by the fingerprint reader to a fingerprint template in a library of biometric templates held in the reader's memory.\nTO AUTHENTICATE A PERSON'S IDENTITY\nAuthentication answers the question: \"Is this person really Mr X?\"\nAuthentication (one to one) consists of verifying that biometric data held in the ID Card, National ID Card or Passport chip's memory or held in a local database and identified by the card, relates to the document holder.\nThe process for finding a match for a person's fingerprint in a database of many thousands of fingerprint templates is complex and can be time consuming. There are two approaches to matching fingerprints:\n- Put the fingerprint matching software and template database on a central computer with a network of connected fingerprint readers. The readers scan fingers and transmit the fingerprint images to the central computer's software for matching.\n- Put the fingerprint matching software and template database at the fingerprint reader. The reader matches and validates the fingerprint at source. This does not require the fingerprint images to be held at the reader as it only uses templates which are a mathematical representation of a fingerprint that can't be turned back into an image.\nRisks when matching is done by a single computer with a number of connected fingerprint readers:\n- A single resource is shared across a number of competing readers, resulting in response delays when all readers are used concurrently at times of peak activity;\n- Network availability and transmission speed limit the resilience of the system;\n- All connected fingerprint readers will stop working when the central computer or a network connection fail.\nBorer's Biometric Solutions do the fingerprint matching and authentication at the reader, avoiding single point of failure and slow response during fingerprint matching.\nBiometric Enrolment – How it works\nThe enrolment of a user on the biometric fingerprint access control system is simple and secure.\nFingerprint Biometrics is a convenient, secure, easy to use and accurate form of identity authentication.\nFingerprint Access Control is the most popular form of biometric identification because it is the most developed and cost effective of the biometric technologies.\nTokens, passwords and PINs can be shared, compromised, lost or stolen, while a fingerprint provides proof of identity and eliminates the cost and effort needed to administer, issue and replace lost and stolen keys, cards, PINs and tokens.\nBorer uses biometric technology and fingerprints to confirm a person’s identity before granting access. At each individual site, up to 5000 users can gain access by presenting their fingerprint alone. Additional users are required to enter a PIN or present an ID Card before presenting their finger. Users with more demanding security requirements can apply multiple checks including fingerprint plus identity card and/or PIN for proof of identity.\nOur range of biometric fingerprint readers and door controllers deliver cost effective identity authentication and access control solutions.\nAdvantages of Borer Fingerprint Access Control\nFully Integrated Solution\nBiometric fingerprint registration and authentication fully integrated into the access control system. The whole solution sits on a single database and communicate over a local or wide area network (LAN/WAN). This enables biometric finger print templates to be distributed to each door’s access reader over the LAN/WAN.\nReduction in Cost of Ownership\nThere is no ongoing requirement for consumer items such as proximity access cards, card printer ribbons, etc. There is little maintenance needed as all field devices are of solid state construction with no moving parts, not even relays.\nSimple to Manage\nEstablish a set of security policies and set these up as rules so it is simple to manage the entire enterprise and all its sites from any workstation. Management of the system can be devolved to building managers.\nTime Limited Access\nShort term contractors and visitors are accommodated by enrolling them on the system with time limited access and automatic expiry.\nLEVELS OF IDENTITY AND AUTHENTICATION\nBiometric Fingerprint only\nFingerprint only identification delivers speed and convenience without the hassle and cost associated with card systems - no codes to remember, no lost or stolen cards or tokens. The number of people who can participate in one to many match, needing only their finger to gain access, is currently limited to 10,000.\n- Schools, Colleges and Nurseries\n- Retail Outlets and Retail Chains\n- Offices, Warehouses and Factories\n- Leisure Centres and Gyms\n- Hospitals and Clinics\n- Laboratories and Research and Development Centres\nBiometric Fingerprint and Card or Pin\nWhen a system has to accommodate more than 10,000 people, then the reader's database of up to 64,000 templates can be grouped into frequent and occasional users. Of those, up to 10,000 frequent users gain access using fingerprint only, while the remaining occasional users require a card, token or PIN combined with a fingerprint. The tapping of a proximity or smart card or input of a PIN at the reader will identify the user and load their biometric template for a 'one to one match'. This enables Borer FUSION to support a much larger user population than would be possible with fingerprint alone. Possible applications include:\n- Public Buildings\n- Public Utilities\n- Stadia and all large Business and Factories\nBiometric Fingerprint on Card\nFingerprint on card delivers multi-factor authentication combining high level security with proof of identity. A cardholder's biometric template together with related information such as photograph and security credentials are written to a smart card's chip.\nWith the biometric fingerprint encrypted and held on the card, there is no practical limit to the number of cardholders a system can accommodate, since a person's identity is verified using credentials carried in their card. This eliminates network dependency and the risks and time it takes to transmit biometric templates and identity credentials between locations.\nBiometric template on card is appropriate whenever there is a need for proof of identity and high levels of security. This includes any organisation needing high levels of personnel authentication, or with a large and mobile workforce, including:\n- Police and Military\n- Air or Sea Ports with large personnel base and many access points; the need for mobile terminals to validate personnel while they travel around the site and between sites is also accommodated\n- Utility Providers such as Water, Telecoms and Energy with a mobile workforce operating across many sites and substations\nHOW THE SYSTEM WORKS\nFingerprint templates of employees, contractors or visitors are enrolled onto the Access Control system by placing a finger onto an enrolment reader. After three successful scans of the person’s biometric fingerprint template is generated, it is encrypted and saved in the system’s database or written to a smart card’s memory.\nGranting of Access Permissions\nThe person is then given access rights according to the security clearance and work activities by allocating them to a temporary or permanent access group or access profile.\nAccess Authorisation and Fingerprint Template Distribution\nA summary of the person’s details including identity number, biometric template and access credentials are downloaded to the door controllers via the LAN.\nFingerprint Authentication and Granting Access\nTo gain access a person, once enrolled, simply present their finger to the door access biometric reader. Once their credentials and access authorisation have been checked and passed they will be given access.\nAccess Reports and Audit Trails\nThe system maintains an audit trail of all access events and attempts which can be displayed in real time and also logged to the database for future referral.\nBorer Fingerprint Sensors\nThe sensors, which use patented optical technology and biometric algorithms, deliver high levels of performance and robustness.\nSensor Features include:\n- High quality fingerprint acquisition\n- Embedded processing capabilities: MINEX compliant Coder & Matcher inside\n- FBI PIV IQS certification and fake finger detection option available\n- Security features include encryption and digital signature\n- Image Compression using WSQ algorithm from FBI/NIST\n- Biometric Feature Extraction to generate templates, Feature Extractor is MINEX/FIPS 201 compliant\n- Support for ISO 19794-2 or ANSI 378 formatted templates\n- Templates held in the reader's database\n- The sensor's generous capture surface (14x22mm) ensures that the richest area on the fingerprints is captured. The larger the acquisition, the better the overall biometric performance, as this determines the number of minutiae captured. Other smaller sensors allow different areas of the same finger to be presented with each placement, leading to poor data acquisition, narrow areas of overlap and more chance of matching failures.\n\"Performance of biometric systems is dependent on the quality of the acquired input samples. Presenting the matcher with good quality fingerprint images will result in high matcher performance.\" ~ NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)\n\"As biometric template data is stored as a series of 1s and 0s no reference to the individual can be obtained from the data. \" ~ British Security Industry Association","Biometric Authentication: How It Works\nPasswords are potentially the weakest link in your organization's information security systems. Biometric authentication technologies promise a more secure alternative.\nHave passwords outlived their usefulness? Take a look at some of the weak passwords exposed in website breaches this year, and judge for yourself. The frequent usage of weak passwords such as \"changeme,\" \"123abc,\" and \"Pa$$w0rd\" (real-life examples uncovered in the recent breach and defacement of a security software vendor's website) are a strong indicator that enterprise organizations might be well-advised to consider a shift to new mechanisms for secure authentication that are more resistant to subversion by careless end-users.\nWeak passwords are a problem because they are easy to guess – and they are certainly no match for brute-force password attacks by criminals using automated password cracking software such as John the Ripper.\nOne way to beef up the security of your authentication process is to force users to create long, complex passwords, but such enforcement comes at the risk of employees writing the passwords down – thereby defeating the attempt to increase security.\nA better method is to adopt a two-factor authentication system. To authenticate, users have to supply a password (\"something they know\") as well as information from a second factor – typically \"something they have,\" such as a one-time password generator token.\nThe Biometric Advantage\nOf course, one-time password tokens can be lost as well as potentially hacked, so relying on \"something they have\" is not always a foolproof approach.\nInstead, an even more secure two-factor system can be based on \"something they are\" – that is, biometric information derived from measurable biological or behavioral characteristics.\nCommon biological characteristics used for enterprise authentication are fingerprints, palm or finger vein patterns, iris features, and voice or face patterns. These last three involve no physical contact with a biometric sensor, which makes them less intrusive to use.\nBehavioral characteristics such as keystroke dynamics – a measure of the way that a user types, analyzing features such as typing speed and the amount of time they \"dwell\" on a given key – can also be used to authenticate a user.\nThe biggest growth area is the deployment of systems that make use of a smartphone as a portable biometric sensor, according to Ant Allan, a research vice president at Gartner. \"There is an explosion in the choice of authentication methods open to organizations, and we are certainly seeing a shift towards biometric systems that take advantage of sensors in mobile devices – the camera, for face or iris recognition, the microphone for voice recognition, and the keyboard for typing rhythm,\" he said.\nThe advantages of this smartphone-based approach are that it is not necessary to purchase any special biometric hardware, because users are likely to have their phone with them any time they need to log on to a system, and the phone's cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity can be used to transmit biometric information to a back-end authentication system.\nBenefits and Drawbacks\nThe main benefit of using a biometric authentication factor instead of a physical token is that biometrics can't easily be lost, stolen, hacked, duplicated, or shared. They are also resistant to social engineering attacks – and since users are required to be present to use a biometric factor, it can also prevent unethical employees from repudiating responsibility for their actions by claiming an imposter had logged on using their authentication credentials when they were not present.\n\"Biometric systems can be much more convenient than tokens and other systems, and are useful to augment existing security methods like passwords,\" said Alan Goode, a security analyst at Goode Intelligence. \"For added security they are also sometimes used as a third factor,\" he added.\nThe main drawback of any biometric system is that it can never be 100 percent accurate. To use a biometric system, it is first necessary for each user to enroll by providing one or more samples of the biometric in question (such as a fingerprint) which is used to make a \"template\" of that biometric. When a user attempts to authenticate, the biometric they provide is then compared with their stored template. The system then assesses whether the sample is similar enough to the template to be judged to be a match.\nA measure of a system's accuracy is commonly provided by two statistics: False Non Match Rate (FNMR) and False Match Rate (FMR). The former measures how often a biometric is not matched to the template when it should be, while the latter measures how often a false biometric is matched (and authentication is allowed) when it shouldn't be. Most biometric systems can be \"tuned\" to reduce one of these two measurements, usually at the expense of the other. \"It's important to understand that when a user supplies a password or a number from an OTP (one time password) token, it is either correct or it isn’t. With biometrics you never get a definitive yes or no,\" explained Mark Diodati, a Gartner analyst.\nWhat To Look For\n# 1. Cost. The purpose of implementing any biometric system is generally to maintain the same level of security at lower cost, or to improve security at a reasonable cost. The cost of implementing a biometric system will depend on whether biometric authentication can be added to your existing authentication infrastructure using standards such as BioAPI (vendors such as Entrust support fingerprint readers as authenticators on their platform), or whether your entire authentication platform has to be replaced, or whether you decide to use an additional biometric authentication system in parallel with your existing one.\nAn alternative approach could be to use biometrics to access a single sign-on system that then accesses your existing authentication system(s).\nOther factors include the cost of sensors such as fingerprint readers or iris scanners that have to be purchased. This drawback obviously does not apply with biometric system that use smartphones as sensors.\n# 2. Biometric type and security. Different biometric systems provide different levels of security as measured by FNMR and FMR scores – and with the current state of technology, a good fingerprint reader generally offers a lower FNMR and FMR (and therefore \"better security\") than non-contact technologies such as voice or face recognition.\nBut before rejecting any biometric type on the grounds that its FNMR and FMR scores are too high, it is important to consider what level of security you really need a biometric system to provide. A biometric system that you plan to use as the single factor for authentication needs to offer more security than a system that you plan to use as a second or third factor.\nIt's also important to take into account the environment the biometric authentication system will be used in. For example, fingerprint readers do not work well in environments where users' fingers are likely to be dirty. Similarly, voice recognition systems are not a good match for excessively noisy environments.\n# 3. Anti-spoofing measures. One potential problem with biometric factors is that they are not \"secrets\" in the way that passwords or tokens are. This means that it could be possible for a hacker to present a photograph to fool a facial recognition system, to present a wax cast of a fingerprint to a reader, or to play back a recording of a voice to a voice recognition system. It may even be possible to intercept the biometric data from the reader and replay it later, bypassing the biometric sensor. Before purchasing any biometric technology, be sure to understand what types of anti-spoofing measures it employs.\nVendors tackle this problem in a number of ways. For example, some voice recognition systems require users to authenticate by asking them to speak a series of random words, preventing them from using a previously recorded voice sample. Similarly, face recognition systems may attempt to detect blinking to ascertain that the image in front of the camera is not a photograph. Sophisticated fingerprint readers also measure heat or electrical conductivity to establish that the finger is \"alive.\"\n# 4. Revocation. Unlike a password, biometric characteristics such as fingerprints can't be revoked or changed. This can pose a serious problem should a hacker successfully compromise the database housing the biometric credentials. Some biometric systems may deal with this challenge by uniquely distorting or transforming the biometric template when it is stored, and transforming or distorting the biometric in the same way during the match process. If a hacker compromises a fingerprint template database, users can then re-enroll and distinct templates can be generated by using a different distortion or transformation. Ask any vendor you talk to how their system deals with template revocation.\n# 5. Compatibility with operating systems and devices. Make sure any biometric system you are considering works with every operating systems in your organization that will use it. The same goes for mobile devices such as tablets and cellphones.\n# 6. Ease of management. When evaluating a biometric authentication system, make sure to pay particular attention to how easily the system can be managed using the management software provided to you by the vendor. It's particularly important to investigate how easily you can enroll large numbers of users into the system.\n# 7. Integration with directory systems: It's advisable to consider if the system can integrate easily with Active Directory or any other LDAP directory system you use. If not, does it use its own directory system, and how practical would it be for you to use it?\nAuthentify offers out-of-band authentication system authenticates users via their smartphones. It employs voice recognition to match a user's voice with a template, and verification is performed against a phrase that is randomly generated to prevent the use of recorded samples.\nBioID provides biometric authentication as a cloud-based service. It uses a desktop or laptop webcam or smartphone camera and microphone to carry out face- and voice-recognition authentication. The company's \"live detection\" technology detects blinking and other non-intentional movements to ensure that a real person (not a photograph) is presented to the camera. BioID also supplies the biometric component to Intel's SSO and McAfee's Cloud Identity Manager.\nDaon's DaonEngine is a back-end authentication system which supports a wide range of biometrics though \"SnapIns\" – optional modules that enable authentication with different biometrics such as fingerprints, iris, voice, and palm patterns, using industry standard hardware and matching algorithms. Other modules supply functionality such as enrollment and performance analytics.\nDigitalPersona's Pro Enterprise system is a complete multi-factor authentication system managed via ActiveDirectory that supports conventional authentication tokens as well as face and voice recognition. For smaller companies, it also offers a cloud-based solution which offers fingerprint biometrics as well as smart cards.\nM2SYS' Hybrid Biometric Platform supports fingerprint, finger vein, palm vein, and iris recognition using a range of hardware such as the Hitachi finger vein reader and the Fujitsu PalmSecure palm vein reader. It also supplies biometric middleware to enable the integration of its biometric platform into Windows and web software, and a product called Bio-SnapOn which allows its biometric authentication to be attached to any Windows or web application without any code-level development.\nPlurilock's BioTracker uses behavioral biometrics – mouse movements and keystroke rhythms – to authenticate users as they log in with a user name and password. The software then continues to analyze these behavioral biometrics during the user's session to protect against situations in which a legitimate user logs on, but the session is then continued by an unauthorized user.\nPrecise Biometrics' Tactivo is a smart casing for Apple's iPhone and iPad mobile devices that incorporates a smart card and fingerprint reader. It enables a user's fingerprint to be matched against a template stored in a smartcard, allowing secure authentication to VPN connections into corporate networks, web based applications, and applications and data stored on the mobile device.\nRealtime North America's Biolock authentication system is designed to bring biometric authentication to SAP, either to replace standard passwords or as part of a multifactor authentication system. The software works with off-the-shelf fingerprint readers from vendors like SecuGen, and allows administrators to configure the system so that users have to re-authenticate when carrying out specific activities such as fund transfers, or accessing restricted information.\nPaul Rubens is an award-winning technology journalist who has been covering IT security for over 20 years.

{"question":"I'm planning to catch some crabs in Lake Macquarie. How do Blue Swimmer Crabs compare to Mud Crabs in terms of their availability and meat yield?","answer":"Blue Swimmer Crabs and Mud Crabs have different characteristics in terms of availability and meat yield. Blue Swimmer Crabs are available year-round with peaks from November to April, yielding about 35% meat with a mild, sweet, nutty flavor. In contrast, Mud Crabs are also available year-round but yield about 25% meat, mostly from their front claws, and have a slightly stronger flavor and firmer texture. While Blue Swimmer Crabs are present in Lake Macquarie all year round, they are generally quieter during the cooler months.","context":["WITH the advance of the cooler weather, our fishing tactics begin to change a little.\nThis year, the warm currents were late coming to our area, so as long as the waters stay warm through April, the fishing should remain quite good.\nDuring the cooler months, I usually give the Swansea channel a rest and target the greater lake. Lake Macquarie has a healthy population of the flat-headed ones and they readily respond to fresh baits, soft or hard lures. The best areas are along the drop-overs into the deeper waters of the lake.\nMy favourite area is from the end of the sticks off Lake Road, south towards Nesca Park. This area has a blue mud bottom and the lizards love it. If you happen to pull blue mud on the anchor, don’t be in too much of a hurry to leave the spot, as these locations are not only good for flathead. Bream, flounder and squire also cruise the mud.\nThere are various methods of fishing this area but I have found two that work best for me.\nAnchor in from two to four metres of water and get a steady stream of berley running. At times it may take a while for the berley to kick in but if the fish are around then you could be in for a hot session.\nA feature of Lake Macquarie is the strange undercurrents that move in different directions, so if fishing at anchor anywhere in the lake away from the obvious tidal run, always check the drift of the berley stream. You may find the berley drifting off in a completely different direction to the lay of the blunt end of the boat.\nBest baits are strips of fresh mullet, while bloodworms are also a good option. Bream love them and the odd whiting still turns up in the cooler weather. There are dozens of baits that will work on occasions, so try the lot. I firmly believe that if those scaly critters are hungry they will damn near eat anything.\nThe second method is to let the boat drift and cast lures ahead of the drift. Let the lure sink to the bottom, then retrieve with a lift-and-wind action to bounce the lure along the bottom. The soft lures, used with a jig head to suit the size of the lure, are excellent for this type of fishing.\nHard-bodied lures are a little more difficult to keep on the bottom, but I have had some success using the small rattlers and weighting the leader with a few split shots placed about a metre in front of the lure. The weight should be just enough to sink the lure.\nFrom this month on, those striped bronze critters should come into their own, so polish up those blackfish wands and look for that elusive patch of weed.\nAngling for luderick is not one of my better skills, but I can easily spend a couple of hours watching the experts at work and I can see how easily it would be to get well and truly hooked on fishing with the green weed and float.\nApril and the ensuing Easter tides signal the last great run of prawns for the lake. The last few days of the last quarter of the moon till the first day of the first quarter will possibly be the last chance for most of us to catch our Winter supply.\nThe prawns will still be around next month but will not be swimming out to sea in great numbers.\nThis time of year is also quieter for blue swimmer crabs. These delightful delicacies are about all year round, but a little bit of local knowledge will usually guarantee a few. Just talk to the locals.\nNext month I will list a few more options for the colder weather.\nNo 1. The moorings in Swan Bay are an excellent area for targeting flathead and bream on lures. More about Swan Bay next month.\nThe channel markers leading from the boat ramp at the end of Lake Road, Swansea. Wangi Wangi Point is straight ahead. Hang a left at the end of the sticks and start fishing the drop-over toward Pulbah Island.\nA work bench with bait board attached is a handy addition to the author’s ageing fibreglass boat. The boat might be old but he wouldn’t swap it for the world (unless someone has a new barra boat they want to get rid of!). The bait board was a gift from a mate and the bench was made from scrap timber.

They are found in a wide range of marine habitats and vary greatly in size and appearance, but many have delicious soft, moist, sweet flesh and are less expensive than other comparable shellfish.\nMost edible Crabs in Australia belong to the ‘swimmer’ family, and can be identified by flat paddles on the end of their back legs. Only a few species are targeted around Australia, with the rest being bycatch. The three main species seen in Australia are:\nBlue Swimmer Crabs (Portunus pelagicus), distinctive for the mottled bright blue to purple of the males’ shells (the females tend to be more mottled brown), are caught year-round with peaks from November to April. They weigh an average of 200-300g and, like all crustacea, turn orange when cooked. They are one of the few Crabs not sold live, but cooked or green (uncooked), as they don’t survive well once captured. They yield about 35% meat, are medium priced and have a mild, sweet, nutty flavour.\nMud Crabs, also swimmer Crabs, are found mainly on the muddy bottoms of shallow coastal mangroves. A number of closely related Mud Crabs, are differentiated by colour, but the Giant Mud Crab (Scylla serrata), with its dark blue-green to mottled brown shell, is by far the major species in Australia. Most common in Queensland, where only the males are caught, they are available year-round. Supply peaks from January to April in Queensland and NSW and from May to August in the NT. They have large front legs and developed claws and generally weigh 500g-1kg. They’re mostly sold live (as they can live out of water for days) but are also available cooked. It is best not to buy dead uncooked Mud Crabs as it’s difficult to determine their quality. They yield about 25% meat, largely from the front claws, and are high priced with sweet flesh that has a slightly stronger flavour and firmer texture than that of other Crabs.\nSpanner Crabs (Ranina ranina), with their long, almost goblet-shaped, bright orange shells (even when uncooked) and spanner-shaped front claws, are quite distinctive. Usually found close inshore, often buried in sand, they are mainly fished off NSW and Queensland from January to October, peaking from July to October with the fishery closed for most of December. They average about 400g and are usually sold cooked, although they can occasionally be found live. Although they only yield 25% meat, they are lower priced than other Crabs and some chefs prefer their distinctive flavour.\nOther Australian Crabs include:\nGiant Crabs (Pseudocarcinus gigas), the world’s heaviest Crabs, are found only in Australia’s southern waters. They have an almost triangular-shaped orangey-red shell with cream flecks and very developed front legs and claws with black tips. Very popular in the 1990s, especially in Chinese restaurants where they are often still seen, there is increasing realisation that the fishery for these slow growing, long living creatures needs to be carefully managed. There is some experimental aquaculture in Tasmania. Incorrectly called King Crab in the past, they are not related to the King Crabs of Alaska.\nCrystal Crabs (Chaceon bicolor) are large chalky-white Crabs of increasing importance, caught commercially off WA. Previously known as Snow Crabs, they are unrelated to the true Snow Crabs of the northern hemisphere.\nChampagne Crabs (Hypothalassia armata) have a mottled pale brown to cream shell with spiny edges, black tips on their claws and spines along their legs.\nFour other swimmer Crabs are caught as a bycatch of Blue Swimmer Crab fishing:\nThree-spotted Crabs (Portunus sanguinolentus) named for the three distinct white-edged purple/red spots towards the back of their greenish-yellow shells. Hairyback Crabs (Charybdis natator) with a covering of fine hairs all over their shells. Sand Crabs (Ovalipes australiensis) with pale blue/grey shells and two prominent red spots at the back of their shells. Coral Crabs (Charybdis feriata) with distinctive vertical dark brown to purple stripes on their shells.\nRegardless of the type of Crab, look for ones which feel heavy for their size and have their legs and claws intact. With dead Crabs, if possible, give them a gentle shake to ensure there’s no sound of sloshing water. Live Crabs should be vigorous. Females with eggs are always protected, and in Queensland catching any female Crabs is prohibited (except for Spanner Crabs without eggs).\nThe NSW Department of Primary Industries and RSPCA have guidelines for the humane killing of all crustaceans. The most acceptable, and easiest, method is to chill them in the freezer for about 45 minutes until they become insensible (but not long enough to freeze them). Once chilled, they should be killed promptly by splitting them in half or dropping them into rapidly boiling water.\nKeep live Crabs in a cool place with a damp cloth over the container, ensuring that the cloth remains damp. Cooked or dead Crabs should be wrapped in plastic wrap or foil and stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days or frozen, at -18ºC or lower, for up to 3 months. Picked crabmeat can be stored in the same way.\nCrabs can be steamed, poached, deep-fried, stir-fried, pan-fried, grilled or barbecued. Don’t try to pick raw crabmeat, it’s almost impossible as the flesh is too watery.\nIf you need Crab meat, place chilled whole Crabs in a large pot of rapidly boiling water, that has been well salted (½ cup table salt to 2.5 litres water), for 8 minutes per 500g up to 1kg, or 5 minutes per 500g for larger specimens (timed from when the water returns to the boil). Refresh them in iced water then twist off legs and claws, crack and remove the meat with a Crab pick, skewer or crochet hook. Tip the body of the Crab over and, from underneath, lift off the top shell, most of the inedible organs will come away attached to the shell. Break off the eyes and the shell holding them in place. Lift out and discard the grey feathery gills (deadman’s fingers) from the body, use a small spoon to remove the internal organs, then wipe clean with a damp cloth. Some people like to keep the yellow ‘mustard’ (liver) to add a deeper flavour to the dish. Quarter the Crab and pick out all the meat from the body.\nIf stir-frying or marinating Crabs, it is easiest to work with uncooked (green) Blue Swimmers as they are already dead, clean as above without removing legs and claws, quarter the body and crack legs and claws with nut crackers so flavours can penetrate.\nServe boiled Crab with Asian dipping sauces or mayonnaise (flavoured with mustard, garlic, or herbs), or hot melted butter with a squeeze of lemon juice. Do not re-cook cooked Crabs, pick the meat and use it in salads, as a garnish for soups, tossed through hot pasta or in dishes where it’s only lightly reheated such as Crab cakes and omelettes.\nAll Crabs shed their shells from time to time as they grow. Once they’ve moulted they have a period of about 2 hours when their new shell is developing and hardening and they are edible shell-and-all. So ‘Soft Shell Crabs’ are not a particular species of Crab, but any Crab that’s undergoing this process. Some Crabs, however, are more commonly sold with soft shells. On the east coast of the USA it’s the highly prized Blue Crab that is harvested from the wild. In Australia high-tech aquaculture has begun, with Blue Swimmer and Mud Crabs being carefully monitored by robotics that detect when the Crabs have just moulted. The Crabs are then removed from the water which stops the recalcification of their shells (as they can no longer access calcium from the water).\nCrab sticks aren’t made from Crab. Their official name is Surimi and they’re made from inexpensive fish with flavourings and colourings added.\nMany British and North American recipes talk about brown and white meat in Crabs. The brown meat is the internal organs (sometimes also called oily, or fatty, meat), prized in some cultures, but generally not used in Australia (except for the ‘mustard’ mentioned above).\nDressed Crabs, often sold in the UK, refers to cooked crabmeat presented in the cleaned top shell in rows, usually with a row of brown meat on both sides and a row of white meat in the middle. It may be pure, but may also have breadcrumbs or seasonings added."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:83f64006-41e7-4860-87ce-5ca9a2da4ae6>","<urn:uuid:590d4a21-bf33-4b7e-8a47-a5a7b0392889>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the sustainability features compare between Canal House in Amsterdam and TECLA in Italy in terms of their construction materials?","answer":"TECLA and Canal House use different sustainable approaches in their materials. TECLA uses local clay soil mixed with rice husk fibers and a small amount of binder (less than 5%), creating a biodegradable shell with low waste and energy consumption during construction. In contrast, Canal House uses sustainable bioplastics containing over 80% vegetable oil, which is heated to 170 degrees Celsius before being compressed and extruded. Both projects demonstrate innovative approaches to sustainable 3D-printed construction.","context":["How might architecture aid in solving the housing crisis and help build a more sustainable future? West of Ravenna, Italy, in the small town of Massa Lombarda, Mario Cucinella Architects has completed a prototype for a home that aims to do both, by combining some of the newest technology with the oldest housing materials. The dwelling, called TECLA, is the first 3D-printed home made from clay, and its founder, Mario Cucinella, hopes that its program design can become a viable option to house people who lack adequate housing due to financial issues or displacement.\nThe twin-circular design of the TECLA prototype includes a bedroom, living room and bathroom. It is the first 3D-printed home made of clay. Credit: Iago Corazza\nBut while previous structures have been built using concrete or synthetic materials like plastic, TECLA — whose named is both derived from writer Italo Calvino’s fictional city of Thekla, and an amalgamation of “technology” and “clay” — was built from soil found at the site mixed with water, fibers from rice husks and a binder, the last of which Cucinella notes is less than 5% of the total volume. Cucinella believes this approach can be replicated in different parts of the world, using whatever local materials are available, and could be particularly helpful in underserved rural areas, where industrial construction materials may be harder to come by.\nPrinting with clay does have its drawbacks. It’s a much slower process than quick-drying concrete — the design can be printed in 200 hours but the clay mixture can take weeks to dry, depending on climate, according to Cucinella — and it also has height limitations (all-clay skyscrapers are not in the future).\nRelated video: See the first community of 3D-printed homes\nHowever, the program’s flexibility of using available soil and its ease of construction means that TECLA could be well-suited to provide housing in many different countries. In 2015, Habitat for Humanity estimated that a staggering 1.6 billion people lack adequate housing, and UN-Habitat — the United Nations program for human settlements and sustainable urban development — estimates that by 2030, 3 billion people, or 40% of the world’s population, will require access to accessible and affordable residences.\n“You can build this kind of house in many more places when you are not dependent on some specific product,” Cucinella explained in a video interview.\nTradition meets new technology\nBuilding homes from earth, Cucinella pointed out, is not new. Adobe — made from a mix of earth, water and organic material — is one of the world’s earliest construction materials, known for its durability, biodegradability and natural insulation.\n“The challenge was really using an old material in the history of architecture with new technology to find a new shape of house,” Cucinella said.\nThe project uses WASP printers to make everything from the structure of the home down to the furnishings. Credit: Iago Corazza\nTo that end, the Crane WASP printers mixed water with the local earth, and then printed the 60-square-meter (645-square-foot) TECLA prototype layer by layer, using an intricate lattice work pattern. The design features two circular spaces joined together, with skylights in each filtering light onto its textured walls. The residence includes a living area, a bedroom and bathroom. Its furnishings, including tables and chairs, can also be printed using WASP’s machinery, while components like doors and windows were installed post-printing.\nBut the idea behind TECLA isn’t necessarily to replicate the same home for any environment, but to adjust the design based on the location. “We are not producing one type of house that you can print and do it everywhere… Because, of course, it’s different if you design a house in the north of Italy, or… in the middle of Africa, or in South America,” Cucinella explained. “We adapt the house to different climates.”\nA rendering of TECLA before it was printed shows what the bedroom could look like with a family living in it. Credit: Mario Cucinella Architects\nA rendering of what a TECLA community might look like. “If we look to the past, we can tap into the knowledge of how architects were able to design buildings with no energy for many, many centuries,” Cucinella said. Credit: Mario Cucinella Architects\nCucinella claims that TECLA is low-waste since its shell is biodegradable (extra fittings like doors and windows are not) and the construction process uses far less energy than building a standard home.\n“When we talk about sustainability, I think we need to also think about the process of construction, because construction processes are very high-consuming and (make) high emissions of CO2 (carbon dioxide),” Cucinella said.\nHe believes we can learn from pre-industrial architectural design to make buildings that won’t harm the planet. “If we look to the past, we can tap into the knowledge of how architects were able to design buildings with no energy for many, many centuries,” he said.\nThe TECLA prototype is currently undergoing structural and thermal performance testing — an essential step before the project can be scaled. If it goes into production, Cucinella said he would happily live there, saying the materials evoke a sense of home and history.\n“You get the feeling of something long ago from your memory,” he said.\nTop caption: A photograph of TECLA at night.","Newer is always better!

The technique is steadily evolving from novelty, to practical application and the prospect of seeing 3D printed houses in towns and cities around the world is now looking increasingly likely.\n3D printing is the process of creating a three dimensional object by laying down many layers of a material in succession. On an industrial scale, this has many advantages over traditional manufacturing techniques and has fast-become a valuable tool for rapid prototyping in the manufacturing sector.\nAbove: 3D printing promises to reduce on-site time and project costs (image courtesy of China Foto Press).\nIf successfully scaled and applied in the construction and engineering industries, it could reduce on-site time and project costs. It also has advantages for sustainable construction, as very little material is ever wasted during the build process.\nSeveral organisations around the world are now racing to effectively scale 3D printing and to develop viable solutions for the building sector, with a particular focus on housing. We’ve rounded-up the current front-runners:\n5 - TEN HOUSES IN ONE DAY, CHINA\nPerhaps more than any other company, Shanghai-based Winsun have captured the world’s imagination when it comes to 3D printing full scale buildings. Winsun generated headlines back in 2014 when they claimed to have printed not one, but ten houses in a single day.\nAbove: Winsun claims to have printed 10 houses in a single day (image courtesy of China Foto Press).\nThe single-storey detached properties were created using four large printers, each standing 20 feet (6.6 metres) tall. At a cost of around USD $4,800 each, the houses were printed from a concrete aggregate that was part-formed from recycled construction waste.\nAlthough the houses are not very refined, they certainly captured the world’s attention.\n4 - CANAL HOUSE, THE NETHERLANDS\nInitiated by DUS Architects, Canal House is an ongoing attempt to print a full-scale classic canal side house in the centre of Amsterdam. Partially funded by the municipality of Amsterdam, the 13-room home is being developed as a publicly accessible research project to investigate the potential of various materials and techniques.\nAbove: DUS Architects are printing a full-scale classic canal side house in the centre of Amsterdam (image courtesy of DUS Architects).\nThe team are working with a six metre tall printer that uses sustainable bioplastics containing over 80% vegetable oil. Inside the printer, granular plastic is heated to 170 degrees Celsius before being compressed to form a homogeneous liquid. This is then extruded from the printer head to create each component. The components are being printed onsite piece-by-piece and then assembled.\n3 – AMIE PAVILION, UNITED STATES\nIn the United States, architects Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) have worked in partnership with the US Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to create a 3D printed prototype pavilion.\nAbove: This 3D printed prototype pavilion was designed by US-architect SOM (image courtesy of SOM).\nFormed in a reinforced carbon fiber material, the 38 feet (11.6 metre) long building was the world’s largest 3D printed polymer structure when it was first completed. The pavilion is composed of 3D-printed panels that act as exterior cladding while providing structural support, insulation and moisture protection.\nSolar panels integrated into the roof feed a generator under the building, which in turn powers the structure’s lighting at night.\nAbove: When it was completed the pavilion was the world’s largest 3D printed polymer structure (image courtesy of SOM).\n2 - OFFICE OF THE FUTURE, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES\nDubai’s “Office of the Future” claims to be the “most advanced 3D printed building in the world”. The 2,600-square-foot (250 square metre) structure was completed in 2016 and now houses the Dubai Future Foundation.\nDesigned by US architectural practice Gensler, the office was printed by Winsun in Shanghai using a 20-foot (six metre) tall 3D printer before being shipped to Dubai.\nAbove: The Office of the Future is the world's most advanced 3D printed building (image courtesy of Dubai Future Foundation).\nPrinting took 17 days in total and the full installation was completed on-site in just 48 hours. Subsequent work on the building services, interiors, and landscape took approximately three months to complete. The project team estimate that 3D printing reduced labour costs by 50% and construction waste by more than 30%.\nWhile not technically a house, this office clearly demonstrates the quality of buildings that can now be achieved with 3D printing. The Office of the Future looks set to be the first of many 3D printed structures in Dubai; the government has announced that it aims to be 3D printing 25% of all new buildings in the emirate by 2030.\n1 – APIS COR, RUSSIA\nCurrently leading the pack is a house that was printed in less than 24 hours in 2017. The USD $10,000 building is the closest anyone has come to 3D printing a fully-formed house.\nCreated by San Francisco-based startup Apis Cor, working with the Russian home-building company PIK Group, the house was printed at a test site just south of Moscow. While 3D printing a home typically involves manufacturing components off-site and then assembling on-site, this 400 square foot (38 square meter) house was printed entirely in-situ.\nAbove: This is the closest anyone has come to 3D printing a fully-formed house (image courtesy of Apis Cor).\nIt was formed with an impressive large scale mobile 3D printer, which has a rotating manipulator arm capable of covering a 1400 square foot (130 square meter) area from a single point. The printer was removed from the centre of the new house once the structural elements had been formed. Insulation was then placed in the walls before the roof and windows were added and finishes applied. The result was a fully-functioning home.\nWith the first 3D printed skyscraper now being mooted in Dubai, and the Saudi Arabian government inviting Winsun to print 1.5 million homes over the next 5 years it seems we’ll be seeing much more large scale 3D printing in the construction sector.\nImages courtesy of SOM, Apis Cor, DUS Architects, Dubai Future Foundation, China Foto Press and Oak Ridge Laboratory.

It has 42 sharp teeth specially designed for tearing flesh and crushing bones.\n- Arctic wolves have short legs and thickly padded paws, which allows them to walk easily on the snow and frozen grounds.\nArctic Wolf Physical Description – Arctic Wolf Characteristics\nArctic Wolf Size\n- Arctic wolves have body sizes from 3.2 to 5.9 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters).\n- They have sexual dimorphism and male individuals are usually bigger than females.\nArctic Wolf Weight\n- The bodyweight of Arctic wolves ranges from 31.7 to 79.3 kg (70 to 175 pounds).\nArctic Wolf Height\n- The average standing height of Arctic wolves from head to toe is about 3 feet (0.9 meters).\n- At the shoulder region, their height may vary from 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6 to 0.7 meters).\nArctic Wolf Length\n- The body length (head to tail) of Arctic wolves ranges from 3.2 to 5.9 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters).\nArctic Wolf Lifespan\n- The lifespan of Arctic wolves in the wild is about 7 to 10 years.\n- In captivity, they live longer for more than 18 years due to the proper availability of food and protection from natural hazards.\nArctic Wolf Eyes\n- Arctic wolves have blue color eyes at birth.\n- When they grow, the color of their eyes changes to yellow-golden or orange.\n- Adult full-grown individuals usually have golden-brown eyes.\nArctic Wolf Species\n- Arctic wolf belongs to the species of grey wolf (Canis lupus).\nWhat Do Arctic Wolves Eat – Arctic Wolf Diet\n- The Arctic wolf is a carnivore in nature and eats the flesh of other animals as its primary diet.\n- They usually hunt musk oxen and Arctic hare. However, they also eat caribou, moose, Arctic fox, lemmings, birds, seals, and beetles.\n- They are opportunistic and also sometimes scavenge on garbage and carrion.\n- Studies show that muskoxen are their primary prey. Because in the presence of abundant muskoxen, Arctic wolves have a higher reproduction rate as compared to the higher availability of Arctic hares.\n- Another study suggests that the consumption of the two species (muskoxen and Arctic hares) depends on the year and season and it is uncertain how much Arctic wolf relies on the two species.\n- Arctic wolves hunt in packs usually to prey on muskoxen or caribou.\n- The packs are also known for killing cubs of the polar bear.\n- During the winter, they will follow migrating caribou for a large distance.\n- In one meal, an Arctic wolf can eat about 9 kg (20 pounds) of meat.\n- Large hunts usually last for a few days. Between the meals, all members of the pack take turns to guard carcass against scavengers.\nWhat Do Arctic Wolves Hunt – Arctic Wolf Prey\n- The most common prey of Arctic wolves are:\n- Arctic hares\n- However, they also hunt other animal species like:\nWhere Do Arctic Wolves Live – Arctic Wolf Habitat\n- Arctic wolves are native to the Arctic region of North America and Greenland.\n- They spent their whole lives in the Arctic tundra biome.\n- A pack of Arctic wolves has a very large territory of about 1,000 square miles (2,500 square kilometers). The size of their territories depends on the availability of food.\n- Arctic wolves use caves or outcrops to take shelter, as it is difficult to dig the frozen snowy ground to create a den.\n- Many of the Arctic wolf populations live close to the sea to feed on seabirds and seals.\nArctic Wolf Habitat Map\nArctic Wolf Range- Arctic Wolf Location\n- The habitat range of the Arctic wolves occurs above the latitudes of 67° North.\n- The location of their habitat is:\n- Northern parts of Alaska in the United States\n- Queen Elizabeth Islands (from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island) in Northern Canada\nArctic Wolf Climate\n- Arctic wolf is one of the few mammals that tolerate extremely harsh conditions.\n- The climate of their habitat region is extremely cold throughout the air.\n- The temperature range in the region is widespread. The month of January is the coldest month of the year, in which the temperature lowers to an average of about -38℃ (-36.4 ℉). The warmest month is July, in which the average highest temperature is about 10℃ (50 ℉).\n- The daylight in their habitat also fluctuates highly with the season. Days in the winter are dark and without sunlight while the sun does not set in the summer days.\n- Most of their habitat region is covered with snow throughout the year.\n- The average precipitation is 250mm per year.\nWhat Other Animals Live With The Arctic Wolf\n- The following are some of the other animals that share the Arctic wolf’s habitat:\n- Arctic hares\n- Arctic fox\n- Many species of birds (such as Arctic tern, snow goose, and ptarmigan)\n- Lemmings and various other types of rodents\nArctic Wolf Adaptations\nThe following are the major structural and physiological adaptations of Arctic Wolves, which helps them to survive in the harsh Arctic climate:\nShort Muzzle and Ears\n- Arctic wolves have short muzzles and small ears as compared to other subspecies of grey wolves.\n- This feature reduces the surface area to volume ratio and prevents excessive heat loss through the mouth and ears.\nCoat Color and Thick Fur\n- Arctic wolves have white or light grey coat colors, which provides them with excellent camouflage.\n- They also have a double layer of fur; an inner layer of fine and soft hair and an outer layer of thick long hair.\n- The inner layer keeps their body insulated while the outer layer is waterproof and keeps them dry and warm.\n- Their fur grows denser during the cold season to provide extra insulation.\n- The paw structure of Arctic wolves is also well-adapted to their habitat.\n- Their paws have a covering of fur, which acts like snow shows.\n- The fur on their paws provides insulation as well as a strong grip when they walk on the snow and frozen slippery surfaces.\nCountercurrent Heat Exchange System\n- Arctic wolves have a special blood circulation mechanism in their paws that reduces heat loss, as their paws have direct contact with the cold snowy surface.\n- In this mechanism, the blood coming to the paws is used to heat the blood that is leaving.\n- In such a way, excessive heat loss is prevented while the paws are also saved from extreme coldness.\n- Such a mechanism is also found in the feet of penguins and the legs of Arctic foxes.\nThick Layer of Body Fat\n- Arctic wolves have a thick layer of body fat beneath their skin.\n- It provides insulation and also serves as a food reservoir in case of food scarcity.\nArctic Wolf Sense Of Smell\n- Wolves have about 100 times a greater sense of smell than humans. The smell receptive region in a wolf’s nose is about 14 times greater than a human nose.\n- Like other wolves, Arctic wolves also have a keen sense of smell.\n- Their scent recognition level is extremely higher, which they use for hunting potential prey.\nArctic Wolf Behavior\n- Arctic wolves are social and live in groups known as packs. The number of individuals in a pack varies from five to eight.\n- Arctic wolves have very large territories. A pack may have a territory of about 2,500 square kilometers (1,000 square miles) or more. Their territory’s size depends on the availability of food.\n- They communicate through signs, smell, behaviors, and sounds. They howl to communicate with other packs. A pack of Arctic wolves can compare its size with other packs by hearing the howling of other packs. Small packs move to another region to find food upon hearing the howls of bigger packs. In such a way, they avoid fighting with other packs.\n- Arctic wolves are unafraid of humans. In some regions, they can be persuaded to approach humans cautiously and curiously. This behavior is believed to be due to their very rare encounter with humans.\n- Arctic wolves migrate during the wintertime to avoid the complete darkness of their habitat. The 24 hours darkness of their habitat makes it hard to study their movement. So very little is known about their migration.\nArctic Wolf Pack\n- The group of Arctic wolves is known as a pack.\n- A pack has 5 to 8 individuals.\n- Every pack has a dominant male and female known as alpha male and female. They are the leaders of the pack.\n- Sometimes, a pack’s size reaches up to 20 individuals, however, it is uncommon.\n- Most of the packs are extended families and composed of a breeding pair and their pups.\n- A pack cooperatively hunts large animals.\n- All the pack members take care of the pups and protect them from predators and other threats.\n- Individuals of a pack use scent and urine to mark its territory’s borders.\nArctic Wolf Life Cycle\n- The life cycle of Arctic wolves starts when they attain sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years.\n- A mature Arctic wolf leaves its birth pack and establishes its territory along with its mate or either stays within its birth pack.\n- If the size of its birth pack is large, it would have the opportunity of breeding. As in small packs, only the alpha members can reproduce.\n- Upon mating, a litter of 2 to 3 pups is born after a gestation period of 63 days.\n- The lifespan of Arctic wolves is 7 to 10 years in the wild and more than 18 years in captivity.\nArctic Wolf Reproduction\n- Alpha male and female breeds only in the pack of Arctic wolves. However, other mates also breed in large-sized packs.\n- They are known to remain with only one mate.\n- The breeding season of Arctic wolves is from January to March, in which the pairs mate.\n- After a gestation period of about 63 days, the females give birth to a litter of 2 to 3 pups.\n- Arctic wolves use outcrops, caves, or even shallow depressions as a den where the females give birth, as digging the frozen floor is so difficult for them. However, if the frozen snow is not too hard, they will dig a den.\n- The birth of pups occurs in late May to early June.\n- The pups stay with their mother for about 2 years.\nFemale Arctic Wolf\n- As Arctic wolves have sexual dimorphism, the females have a smaller size than males.\n- Female Arctic wolves reproduce, feed the pups with their milk, and take care of them until they become completely mature.\nArctic Wolf Babies – Baby Arctic Wolf – Arctic Wolf Pups\n- The babies of Arctic wolves are known as pups or whelps.\n- They are born after a gestation period of about 63 days.\n- At birth, the pup weighs about 2 to 3 pounds and has dark fur.\n- They are blind and deaf at birth and become able to see and hear after 12 to 14 days.\n- The pups have blue color eyes that become orange or yellow-golden when they are between 2 to 4 months old.\n- As an Arctic wolf is a mammal, the mother feeds the newborns with her milk.\n- After a few weeks, mothers bring small pieces of chewed food to the pups and they start nibbling it.\n- The pups stay in their birth den or cave for about 1.5 months along with their mother.\n- After 1.5 months, they start to join the pack in their activities and learn skills to survive.\n- The pups become full-grown at the age of about 8 months.\n- They stay with their mother for about 2 years.\n- Pups attain sexual maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years.\n- The pups stay generally with the same pack for many years.\nAre Arctic Wolves Endangered – Why Are Arctic Wolves Endangered\n- No, Arctic wolves are not endangered.\n- Due to their isolated habitat, they are not even threatened by hunting or habitat loss.\n- Climate change is the greatest threat to their survival. Extreme variations in the weather cause food scarcity for muskoxen and Arctic hares. It causes a decline in the populations of these species and so, in turn, leads to the reduction of the traditional food supply of the Arctic wolves.\nArctic Wolf Conservation Status\n- The conservation status of the Arctic wolf on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern.\nArctic Wolf Population\n- According to the Cool Antarctica Resources, the total population of Arctic wolves is estimated at 200,000 individuals.\nArctic Wolf Role In The Ecosystem\n- Like other wolves, Arctic wolves also play a vital role to maintain the health, structure, and balance of the ecosystem.\n- They keep the population of prey species in control.\n- Their presence affects the behavior and population of their prey and changes their foraging patterns.\n- In turn, it affects the plants and animal communities and often causes changes in the landscape.\n- That is why wolves are described as the keystone species.\nArctic Wolf Predators\n- Arctic wolf is itself the apex predator of its habitat.\n- The polar bear is the only natural predator of the Arctic wolf.\nArctic Wolf Interesting Facts – Fun Facts About Arctic Wolves\n- Arctic wolf is one of the rare examples of animal species that are relatively not threatened by humans. Due to the isolated habitat range, Arctic wolves are not disturbed by urbanization or habitat destruction.\n- An Arctic wolf has a special countercurrent heat exchange system in its feet, which prevents its feet from freezing while walking on the snow.\n- Arctic wolves are born with blue eyes that become brown or golden-brown when they are growing old.\n- Arctic wolves are fast and can run at the speed of 40 miles per hour when chasing prey.\n- Youngsters of the Arctic wolves eat partially digested food that their mother and other members of the pack regurgitate after hunting.\n- In a pack, only the highest-ranking members are allowed to reproduce. They are known as the Alpha male and females.\n- Like other wolves, packs of the Arctic wolves communicate through howling. They can compare the size of their pack with other packs’ sizes by hearing howlings.\n- Arctic wolves usually avoid conflicts with other packs and small packs simply move to other regions to find food."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7896e363-13ff-4314-aa6a-80a2f053c887>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone researching regional development, what are the main challenges LEPs face in building their policy-making capacity?","answer":"The main challenges LEPs face are insufficient funding and analytical capacity. Most evidence reviews had to be conducted by external consultants due to lack of internal analytical capacity. Additionally, uncertainty related to future funding and government policy impeded their ability to develop Local Industrial Strategies. There is a clear need for longer-term funding commitments to support LEPs in building their policy-making capacity.","context":["Understanding the policy-making processes behind local growth strategies in England\nThere is great value in the development of Local Industrial Strategies. However, there is a clear need for a commitment to longer-term funding to support LEPs in building policy making capacity.\nThis report provides insight into the policy-making processes behind Local Industrial Strategies (LISs). The research undertaken for this report identifies areas of good practice, and common challenges, emphasising their wider relevance to debates regarding the implementation of future local economic growth policies in five areas:\n- Purpose – There is a need for better communication and understanding between central government and Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs). There is widespread understanding about the purpose in principle of LISs but less of an understanding to what this means in practice.\n- Process – Local stakeholders thought that the process has worked well locally and LEPs are well placed to coordinate sub-national economic policy. Improvements should still be made in terms of co-production with government, and inter-LEP policy co-ordination. Uncertainty related to future funding and government policy impeded the process of developing LISs.\n- Collaboration - Collaboration was the strongest theme identified in this research LEP staff are well embedded locally, are aware of local strengths and challenges and have good working relationships with key local stakeholders. Local areas consulted widely with a range of diverse stakeholders, including local businesses, academia, and local authorities. Most interviewees believed the development of LISs was a constructive exercise that focused minds on achieving common goals.\n- Prioritisation – There is a widespread appreciation of how data can drive prioritisation processes alongside stakeholder engagement. However, evidence reviews were mostly conducted by external consultants indicating lack of analytical capacity in LEPs. A partial solution to this issue is to improve access to the latest regional data and academic research.\n- Evaluation – Robust evaluations are a cornerstone of understanding “what works” and making informed funding decisions. However, there was little focus on ensuring robust policy evaluations locally. There is a disjoint between the long-term nature of evaluation and short-term funding cycles. Central government and LEPs/Combined Authorities should work together to agree a minimum analytical requirement in LEPs, including both staff and evaluation spend.\nAndy Haldane, Chair of the Industrial Strategy Council said:\n‘Covid is likely to increase the importance of the Government’s levelling-up agenda. As this research report from the Industrial Strategy Council demonstrates, making a success of levelling-up will require a significant investment in capacity and capability at the sub-national level.’\nChristine Gaskell, member of the Industrial Strategy Council said:\n‘Local Enterprise Partnerships and Combined Authorities are well-placed to develop local economic policies, but some of them are under-staffed and under-funded. Our research clearly reinforces the importance of key messages of the Council's Annual Report - scale, longevity and policy coordination. Funding of local policies and institutions needs to be proportionate to the size and the long-term nature of the challenge that is \"levelling up\". National coordination of Local Industrial Strategies needs to be improved to ensure that local policies are greater than the sum of their parts. Local institutions are at the forefront of policy delivery and will have to play a greater role in the near future, if we want to see an effective recovery from the COVID-19 economic crisis.’\nKate Barker, member of the Industrial Strategy Council said:\n‘This study demonstrates that local coordination and enthusiasm have been significant positives in the development of Local Industrial Strategies. But now the LEPs and Combined Authorities are looking for evidence of coordination and enthusiasm from central government in response. The combination of the Covid crisis and Brexit uncertainties should not become a reason for delay from Whitehall, which needs to support local leaderships to maintain this positive momentum.'\nThe IS Council and City-REDI (University of Birmingham) co-hosted a webinar to discuss key findings from the research report, the future of local economic policy, and the importance of places for the post-COVID-19 economic recovery.\nThe expert panel of local and national leaders included:\n- Andy Haldane (Industrial Strategy Council, Chair)\n- Mark Bretton (LEP Network, Chair)\n- Andrew Hodgson (North East LEP, Chair)\n- Rebecca Riley (City-REDI, Director of Business Development)\n- Kate Barker (Industrial Strategy Council, Places Steering Group)\n- Christine Gaskell (Industrial Strategy Council, Places Steering Group)\nYou can watch the whole event here and download the report below.

{"question":"As a military aviation enthusiast, I'm wondering why the French withdrawal from NATO in 1959 and the development of MiG-15UTI trainers were both significant developments in Cold War military history?","answer":"The French withdrawal from NATO's command structure and MiG-15UTI development represented different approaches to military independence during the Cold War. France withdrew from NATO's command in 1959 and developed its own nuclear force because it opposed American dominance in NATO, removing its Mediterranean Naval Fleet from NATO command and banning foreign nuclear weapons from French soil. Meanwhile, the MiG-15UTI was developed as a two-seat training variant of the MiG-15 fighter, becoming crucial for pilot training in Soviet-aligned countries. The aircraft was so significant that it was produced under license in multiple Eastern Bloc countries including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and China, helping to maintain Soviet air power independently of Western influence.","context":["The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) was created in 1949. NATO was seen as being a viable military deterrent against the military might of the Soviet Union. In response to NATO admitting the membership of West Germany, the Soviet Union was to gather all its client states in Eastern Europe into the Warsaw Pact in May 1955. The heart of NATO beat around the military and financial muscle of the United States. However, because the post-war Soviet threat was perceived to be against Western Europe, the headquarters of NATO was based in Brussels, Belgium.\nThe original members of NATO were USA, UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, France, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Greece and Turkey joined in 1952.\nThe principal part of NATO membership states:\n“The parties of NATO agree that an armed attack against one of more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against all of them. Consequently, they agree that if such an armed attack occurs, each of them in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence will assist the party or parties being attacked, individually and in concert with other parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”\nThis agreement did not tie a member state down to a military response but a response as “deemed necessary” was expected.\nIn 1952 at the Lisbon Conference, member states discussed expanding NATO to 96 divisions – this was in response to the perceived threat of communism after the North Korean invasion of South Korea and the subsequent Korean War. However, in 1953, it was agreed to limit NATO to 35 divisions but with a greater reliability on nuclear weapons.\nFrance, angered by what they saw as the dominance of America in NATO, effectively withdrew in 1959 and developed her own independent nuclear force. Charles de Gaulle made it clear that only the French government would determine when and if such weaponry would be used. He ordered the withdrawal of the French Mediterranean Naval Fleet from NATO command and in the same year banned all foreign nuclear weapons from French soil. In 1966 all French military forces were withdrawn from NATO’s command. France remained a member of NATO but had its armed forces under the control of the French government. However, in secret talks, plans were made to put French forces back under NATO command in the event of an invasion of Western Europe by Warsaw Pact states.\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War Two, Western Europe relied on American support and power to defend itself against the Soviet threat. However, as Western Europe found its feet after World War Two, a more independent streak was identified that deemed America to be too dominant in NATO and West European affairs – hence the move by France to make herself an independent nuclear state. In the UK something similar occurred – though the UK was less openly critical of America’s dominance of NATO – and an independent nuclear capability was developed based around the V Force (Vulcan, Victor and Valiant bombers) and the Blue Streak missile development. Both France and the UK developed an independent nuclear submarine capability as well – though the UK purchased US missiles, thus empathising America’s importance to Western Europe and NATO.\nTo defend the heart of Europe, NATO based a huge land and air force in West Germany. This was a clear response to the Soviet Army that dominated the Warsaw Pact. In 1979, in response to a build-up of Warsaw Pact military strength, NATO agreed to deploy American Cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe. In 1983-84, when the Warsaw Pact deployed SS-20 missiles in Eastern Europe, NATO responded by deploying more modern Pershing missiles. Combined with her nuclear capability, NATO could also call on a formidable conventional force.\nIn 1983, NATO claimed to have within Western Europe:\n1,986,000 ground force troops\n20,722 main battle tanks\n2,080 anti-tank guided weapon launchers\n385 anti-submarine submarines\n314 capital ships (carriers, cruisers etc)\n821 Other naval craft\n4,338 fighter aircraft\n6869 anti-aircraft guns and surface to air missiles.\nWith such a military capacity, NATO and Western governments were in a strong position to negotiate with Moscow an arms reduction. It was generally considered that the USSR had major financial troubles and could not compete with NATO in the modernisation of its weaponry. This dual approach – reducing weapons while at the same time maintaining a very strong military force – reaped dividends in the era of Gorbachev and Reagan and helped to end the Cold War.","MiG-15UTI (NATO reporting name ´Midget´) two-seat advanced jet training aircraft, participating in the both flying and static displays of the XIV International Aviation and Space Salon MAKS-2019, Zhukovsky, Moscow area.\nMiG-15 is one of the aircraft that needs no introduction. It was, presumably, the most produced jet aircraft ever, with more than 18,000 aeroplanes built, and probably is still operationally used as a trainer by the North Korean Air Force, as rumours says.\nThe new jet entered the Soviet Air Force in 1949, with the role of interceptor aircraft, and pretty soon it became a basic fighter in many Eastern countries. Although MiG-15s had their combat premiere already during the final stage of Chinese Civil War, they usually are mentioned with relation to the Korean War that made them famous.\nThere were approximately 40 air forces operating MiG-15 fighters in Europe, Africa and Asia. More than 15 variants were introduced, including MiG-15UTI – two-seat, dual-control advanced training aeroplane. Apart from the Soviet Union, MiG-15 jets were produced under licence in Poland (designated as Lim-1 and Lim-2), Czechoslovakia (as S-102 and S-103) and China (JJ-2).\nMiG-15UTI was also the fatal aircraft for the first man in space, Yuri Gararin – on 27th March 1968, Gagarin, together with Vladimir Seryogin, performed a training flight from Chkalovsky airfield. Their aircraft crashed near Kirzhach, killing both pilots.\nToday, there are many MiG-15s preserved in the aviation museums worldwide, as one of the Cold War era icons. There are several airworthy aircraft in the USA and Europe, and our photo shows one of them, the only airworthy MiG-15UTI in Russia.\nThis aircraft was manufactured in 1954 and spent all its operational years in ДОСААФ (Volunteer Society for Cooperation with the Army, Aviation, and Navy – DOSAAF), flying as an advanced trainer at Vorotynsk, Kaluga area. In 1989 it was withdrawn from the service, stored for many years and changed several owners.\nAfter almost thirty years from the last flight, the group of aviation enthusiasts decided to return this legendary aircraft into the sky. The restoration process lasted a few years and was led by the ´Avion´ company, with the participation of specialists from Moscow Aviation Institute.\nIt´s no surprise that this renovation wasn´t easy, as some spare parts had to be custom-made or adopted from other aircraft (for example, the ejection seats came from L-29 aircraft). Finally, on 31st August 2011, the restored MiG-15UTI piloted by test pilot Ildus Khasanovich Kiramov (Ильдус Хасанович Кирамов), took-off for its maiden flight from Dvoevka airfield, Vyazma area. Soon after, the aircraft received the registration RA-0488G and the official certificate of airworthiness.\nFor the first time, the renovated MiG-15UTI was presented to wide public at the air show organized in Zhukovsky in 2012, celebrating the 100th anniversary of Russian Air Force. Today, this aircraft is a part of ´Flying Collection´ belonging to Andrei Stanislavovich Chizhik (Андрей Станиславович Чижик) and based at Stupino / Krutyshki airfield.\nAn interesting fact is, that the word ´чижик´ means a small siskin bird in Russian. And that´s probably why the funny drawing of a siskin became a nose art of restored MiG-15UTI, together with the MAI logotype and the owner´s name placed below the canopy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1c2d76fa-a50d-49bd-9712-e4c2c89b6dcc>","<urn:uuid:669adefc-6835-44a2-ba23-082943e02605>"],"error":null}

They aren’t a good choice for apartment life.\nHistory and Origins\nThe Australian Cattle Dog played an important role in the development of the beef industry in Australia, which was a significant part of the economy. In the early 1800s, people from Britain began to move away from the original settlements along the coast and into the grassy plains of the western inland. This area was ideal for raising cattle, so herding dogs were needed to help make it possible.\nHealth and Entertainment for your Australian Cattle Dog\nSee all of our expert product reviews.\nIn the beginning, Australian livestock owners imported British Smithfield dogs, but these breeds were not suitable for the hot weather, rough terrain, and long travel times to market in their new homes. Therefore, ranchers began a lengthy effort to create a herding dog that could handle the conditions of the Australian outback. To do this, Smithfields were bred with Dingoes and other breeds like Scottish Highland Collies. As a result, farmers developed the strong and reliable herding dogs they desired.\nGeorge Elliot from Queensland was a major contributor to the development of the Australian Cattle Dog, as he bred Dingoes with Collies and sold the puppies to farmers. This created a dog that was close to being the ideal herding dog for Australia. Later, Jack and Harry Bagust refined the breed even more by mixing in Dalmatians, and a sheepdog called the Black and Tan Kelpie. This combination of breeds produced the ACD that we know today.\nThe Australian Cattle Dog was accepted into the American Kennel Club in 1980 and became a founding member of the Herding Group when it was established in 1983.\nSize and Weight\nThis is a medium-sized breed with short hair. The average height of a male is 19 inches, while a female is 18 inches tall at the withers. Both males and females weigh 45 pounds when fully grown at 16 months. An 8-week-old puppy should weigh 10.5 pounds.\nThe record for the oldest Australian cattle dog is held by Bluey, who lived to be 29 years old.\n|Male||19 inches||18 inches|\n|Female||45 lbs (fully grown)||45 lbs (fully grown)|\nCommon Health Issues\nProgressive retinal atrophy is a common health issue of this dog. This is a degenerative disease that affects the photoreceptor cells in the eye. It is a genetic condition and can lead to blindness. Hip dysplasia is another common health issue. The hip joint consists of a ball and socket. When a dog develops hip dysplasia, the ball and socket don’t fit together in the right way. Over time, this inherited condition causes deterioration of the hip joint. A third common health issue is elbow dysplasia. This genetic condition involves abnormal cell growth. It causes malformation of the elbow joint. Elbow dysplasia may not appear in a dog until it’s at least 4 months old.\nThe most common health issues for an Australian cattle dog are:\n- Progressive retinal atrophy\n- Hip dysplasia\n- Elbow dysplasia\nTemperament and Behavior\nEnergetic is the best word to describe the behavior of this breed. This is a working dog bred to herd cattle, sheep, or any other livestock. A family with children is going to have a loyal, entertaining pet.\nThis dog has a friendly personality. They love to be around humans and other pets.\nOne of its most notable traits is its intelligence. They were bred to handle herding responsibilities. Their intelligence makes obedience training relatively simple.\nHow to Take Care of an Australian Cattle Dog\nWhen caring for this breed, there are certain things to keep in mind. Giving a red or blue heeler the proper diet, grooming, exercise, etc., can help to keep it in good health. Factoring common health issues into its care can also contribute to the well-being of a puppy or adult dog.\nThe Best Dog Food\nNot surprisingly, puppies need a different type of care than adult dogs.\nPuppy food: This breed of puppy needs food high in protein. This ingredient supports the activity of this highly energetic dog. Fiber contributes to a puppy’s digestive health, and fatty acids support skin and coat health. Vitamin A supports healthy retinal function, which can protect against progressive retinal atrophy. Calcium and vitamin D are nutrients that help a puppy guard against hip dysplasia.\nDog food: Just as puppies need protein, so do adults. This nutrient contributes to a dog’s muscle health. Food with a small percentage of carbohydrates gives an adult dog energy while not causing excess weight gain. Vitamins A and C support eye health and provide antioxidants to guard against disease. Calcium keeps bones and joints strong, which can help to prevent hip and elbow dysplasia.\nYour Australian Cattle Dog needs well-balanced food to fuel all that energy and joyful activity.

These dogs have short-haired, double coats, so they’re moderate to heavy shedders. A proper grooming routine can reduce the amount of loose dog hair around a home.\nThis dog requires weekly brushing. A soft brush with boar hair bristles is a great tool to use. Start at the dog’s head and brush toward its tail, following the natural direction of its coat. A grooming glove is an effective tool for the dog’s legs and tail.\nIt’s a good idea to bathe this dog once per month to remove odors and dirt from its coat. The hair of an Australian cattle dog’s coat resists moisture, so it will dry quickly.\nFur loss or irritated skin due to the presence of fleas or mites are also common afflictions.\nThis herding dog is smart and a quick learner. So, training is a relatively easy process. One thing to keep in mind is these dogs can have an independent streak. They share this trait with border collies. Australian cattle dogs are the boss of the herds they are moving along. So, sometimes, they try to be the boss of a household. This makes it all the more essential that an owner establishes who is boss during training. As with any other lesson, these dogs are quick to catch on! Using treats during training is helpful in making sure lessons are effective.\nThese dogs have a lot of energy. So, they need exercise at least one hour per day. It’s best to give them a lot of space to run and play. Just think, this working dog was bred to run through acres and acres of fields following herds of sheep or cattle. They need space to stretch their legs. This is part of the reason why they are not appropriate pets for people who live in apartments. A large yard, a big, enclosed field, or a park are all good places to take this dog. Exercise isn’t a luxury. It contributes to their overall health.\nFetch, pulling a rope, frisbee, rolling a ball, or playing chase are just a few of the games these dogs enjoy. A large dog park is another fun place to take an Australian cattle dog.\nPuppies of this breed grow to be fairly large in a short amount of time. They weigh 10.5 pounds at eight weeks. So, these puppies need a lot of space for exercising and growing right from the start. Plus, they are the most ideal choice for a family. These are social puppies/dogs that like to be with family members.\nThough this dog is a good choice for families with children, there are some things to bear in mind. This is a working dog at heart. They were bred for herding. So, it’s in their DNA to herd things even if there are no cattle or sheep around. Part of their herding behavior is to nip at the heels of the livestock. Some Australian cattle dogs may try this with children as they run through the yard. Training can help with this behavior. Also, if a family is able to get an Australian cattle puppy, it’ll grow up knowing how to behave around young children.\nDogs Similar to the Australian Cattle Dog\nSome dogs that are similar to Australian cattle dogs include Border collies, Welsh Corgis, and German Shepherds.\n- Border collies: This is another herding dog with the same intelligence and alertness as an Australian cattle dog. It’s also easy to train.\n- Welsh Corgis: The body of a Welsh Corgi is muscular and compact like the Australian cattle dog. It’s also known for its intelligence and focus.\n- German Shepherd: Another energetic dog with intelligence and loyalty. Both this dog and the Australian cattle dog have pointed ears that are always listening.\nAustralian Cattle Dogs vs the Blue Heeler\nThe red and blue heeler are the two types of Australian cattle dog.

{"question":"What kind of legal test applications are evident in the Suresh Kumar Koushal case versus the East Kent Hospitals case regarding the assessment of risk and discrimination?","answer":"The two cases show different approaches to legal test applications. In Koushal, the Supreme Court failed to properly apply the discrimination framework and constitutional analysis under Article 15, avoiding a thorough examination of the harm of discrimination and its impact on individual autonomy. In contrast, the East Kent Hospitals case demonstrates a more nuanced approach to risk assessment, establishing that 'material risk' must be more than 'theoretical,' 'background' or 'negligible,' and considering the patient's own demonstrated risk tolerance through their previous actions and discussions. While Koushal bypassed established frameworks for protecting minority rights, East Kent Hospitals developed specific criteria for evaluating what constitutes material risk in medical contexts.","context":["Of Koushal v NAZ Foundation’s Several Travesties: Discrimination and Democracy\nThere are many things wrong about the 98 page decision of the Indian Supreme Court in Suresh Kumar Koushal v NAZ Foundation. The Court’s extensive quoting but tenacious refusal to engage with the text of the Delhi High Court judgement (of which this case is an appeal); reciting but refusing to analyse the arguments made before the Court in any depth; the “self-restraint” in exercising judicial review which bleeds into the abdication of the constitutional mandate to review laws at the altar of fundamental rights; a misplaced reliance and eventual misapplication of the presumption of unconstitutionality; and the glaring absence of any well-considered constitutional analysis based on fundamental rights leading to the final decision of overturning the decision below that read down s 377 of the Indian Penal Code to de-criminalize consensual sex between consenting homosexuals. All these aspects present a wide template for criticising a rather unexpected, and deeply shocking decision.\nBarely a day after celebrating the Human Rights Day and a few down registering a win for Indian democracy through the Delhi Assembly Elections with an impressive debutant performance of the grassroots Aam Aadmi Party (Common Man Party); we are handed the Koushal decision – leaving a disparaging impact upon human rights adjudication, in the name of upholding democracy. The core of the decision lies in the Court’s understanding of its role in adjudicating fundamental rights of the citizens and how it uses, rather poorly, the theories of separation of powers, democracy, judicial self-restraint and deference, all within the smokescreen of presumption of constitutionality (para 26), for dogging a concrete legal analysis. It is the manner of using this doctrine, which the Delhi High Court might have underplayed in its assertion that “there is no presumption of constitutionality of a colonial legislation”, which is problematic. The trouble lies in the Court’s failure in carrying the doctrine through to analyse the evidence before it for rebutting the initial presumption in reference to the Constitution. That is what the Court had previously done in Anuj Garg for a pre-constitutional provision stating that: ‘Although it is saved in terms of Article 372 of the Constitution, challenge to its validity on the touchstone of Articles 14, 15 and 19 of the Constitution of India, is permissible in law.’\nThe lack of a full appreciation of the rebuttal based on fundamental rights, whilst jumping to the final decision that s 377 has no constitutional infirmity, is legally untenable. For the Court, the decision seems to have been made simply with the fact that a presumption existed at all. In its zeal to save s 377 it forgets that although presumed to be constitutional, the provision may still have to withstand constitutional scrutiny. The absence of any real and critical constitutional analysis is disturbingly omnipresent. The oversight in relation to Article 15 of the Constitution (the anti-discrimination guarantee) is perhaps most fatal. Whilst equality gets a passing reference (para 42), the Court turns a complete blind eye to the well-crafted Article 15 analysis of the Delhi High Court. In this way, the apex court at the end of 2013 further diminishes an already deplete discrimination jurisprudence in India.\nBoth Anuj Garg and the Delhi High Court had very carefully revived the content and scope of Article 15 by: (i) giving meaning to the harm of discrimination as infringing upon individual autonomy; (ii) realising the salience of grounds for extending the protection to ‘analogous’ grounds; and (iii) establishing a stricter standard of scrutiny in discrimination cases. The Court in Koushal bypasses even a bare mention of the discrimination framework before reaching its conclusion on Article 15. Had the Court referred to this framework it would have been reminded of its role in human rights adjudication. As noted in Anuj Garg: ‘It is for the court to review that the majoritarian impulses rooted in moralistic tradition do not impinge upon individual autonomy.’\nIt is the significance of rights like Article 15 on the right against discrimination which remind the Court of the value and consequence of protecting those rights. A Court which appreciates the prohibition of certain devious distinctions, also understands what it has to do in regards those distinctions. Repeated reliance on footnote four of Carolene Productsdoes little to aid the Court’s myopia where it should have ordinarily seen that ‘prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities’. By leaving it to the democratic procedures of the Parliament, the Court bypasses its own constitutional mandate of reinforcing democratic processes through judicial review. Instead, it abdicates the essential role of adjudicating upon a breach of fundamental rights, especially in relation to, ‘miniscule fraction of the country’s population’ (para 43), who have a right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation.","The Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in the case of Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board  UKSC 11 on 11 March 2015.\nThe case concerned an alleged failure to advise a diabetic mother of the risks of encountering shoulder dystocia during labour, and to offer caesarean section to avoid injury to the child and/or mother. It was accepted that the risk of shoulder dystocia in the mother's case was in the region of 9%. The Supreme Court concluded that the correct legal test to apply was not what a reasonable obstetrician would have advised a patient in these circumstances, based on the principles laid down in Bolam v Friern Hospital  1 WLR 582, but instead the correct test was one of patient autonomy. Please click here to read our previous article on Montgomery.\nBased on the above, it has been suggested by many advisors, both for the Claimant and Defendants, that patients must be informed of all risks in respect of any treatment option in order to provide informed consent. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that the consenting process should always be video recorded. In our view, this is clearly not practical and indeed this is not our interpretation of the judgment given that the Court specifically states that: \"The doctor is however entitled to withhold from the patient information as to a risk if he reasonably considers that its disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the patient's health. The doctor is also excused from conferring with the patient in circumstances of necessity, as for example where the patient requires treatment urgently but is unconscious or otherwise unable to make a decision.\" In addition, the Court specifically states that the duty is to inform of any material risk.\nThe question therefore is what a material risk is and more importantly how do you determine what is material to a specific patient?\nIn the case of A v East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust  EWCH 1038 (QB), Mr Justice Dingemans set out his interpretation of material risk as defined by the Supreme Court. The case is a wrongful birth claim where A sought damages for the costs associated with raising a disabled child.\nA had attempted to conceive naturally which had resulted in one pregnancy, which unfortunately spontaneously miscarried at eight weeks. A and her partner paid privately for a DNA fragmentation and sperm aneuploidy test. The results showed that the DNA test had been carried out on chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 with no abnormality noted. However, A was informed that only the three most common chromosome abnormalities had been tested, so there was a possibility that abnormalities could be found in the other 43 chromosomes. Knowing this, A proceeded to a cycle of IVF via ICSI, which was successful.\nNuchal translucency and serum biochemistry tests in the first trimester confirmed that the foetus was not at an increased risk of genetic abnormalities for trisomies with chromosome 13, 18 and 21. The risks were 1:37,891 for a trisomy with chromosomes 13 and 18, and 1:1753 for a trisomy with chromosome 21. A was happy to proceed with the pregnancy with these known risks as it was her evidence that they represented \"no risk at all.\"\nAt the anomaly scan at 21 weeks gestation, no structural abnormalities were noted, but the fetus was recorded as growing along the 5th centile. The fetus remained constitutionally small throughout the pregnancy and on review by a Consultant; A was advised that the most likely cause for the restricted growth was placental insufficiency. Following delivery, the child was found to be suffering from an unbalanced translocation of chromosomes 4 and 11 and is significantly disabled.\nIt was the evidence of A that had she known that a possible cause of fetal growth restriction was chromosome abnormality, she would have undergone amniocentesis. On discovering the unbalanced translocation she would have terminated the pregnancy at either 32 weeks or 35 weeks gestation.\nThe issues to be determined by the Court were as follows:\n- Should A have been informed of the possibility that chromosome abnormality was causing fetal growth restriction\n- If so, would A have proceeded to amniocentesis in the second trimester\n- If amniocentesis had been carried out, would A have terminated the pregnancy at 32 or 35 weeks gestation?\n1. Should A have been informed of the possibility of chromosome abnormality?\nA relied on the fact that she had undertaken DNA fragmentation testing and first trimester testing to support her position that she did not want a disabled child. In addition, she relied on the judgment of Montgomery stating that a child with disability was a material risk to her and had she known that there was a possibility, however small; she would have wanted to know about it. Her experts confirmed that the risk of chromosome abnormality in this pregnancy was more than 1% and more likely in the order of 3%. It was argued by A that a risk of more than 1% in such circumstances was material and therefore A had the right to be informed of that risk.\nThe Court accepted the evidence of the Defendant trust that chromosome abnormality of the type suffered by A's child was so rare that the actual risk was in the order of 0.5%. The Court accepted that placental dysfunction was the likely cause of fetal growth restriction (which was in fact accepted by A's experts) and it was reasonable not to advise A of a \"theoretical\", \"negligible\" or background\" risk which was less than 1%.\nIn respect of what A considered to be material, the Court determined that A had accepted some risk, namely a risk of Down's syndrome as her first trimester test recorded a risk of 1:1753. On this basis, given that the risk of alternative chromosome abnormality was less than that of having a child with Down's syndrome, the Court did not accept that the theoretical risk of such abnormality needed to be conveyed to A, as she would not have considered it relevant.\n2. Would A have undergone amniocentesis in the second trimester?\nThe evidence suggested that the risk of premature labour with a second trimester amniocentesis was 1%. Premature delivery increased the risk of the child being born with disabilities. In addition, of that 1%, there was a 10% chance of death. A argued that she would have accepted that risk given that she absolutely did not want a disabled child.\nThe Judge found that the risk of chromosomal abnormality was \"theoretical\". When compared to a real risk of premature delivery causing disability and/or death, the Court found that A would not have proceeded with amniocentesis when it was the evidence of the clinicians and the experts that the likely cause of restricted growth was placental dysfunction.\n3. Would A have proceeded to termination of pregnancy at 32 or 35 weeks gestation?\nA stated that whilst she understood the mechanism of late termination of pregnancy, she would have proceeded with the same had she known that the fetus had an unbalanced translocation which would cause significant disabilities.\nThe Court determined that A would not have proceeded to termination of pregnancy on the basis that when she was advised of possible premature delivery she was \"shocked\" and was willing to do what she could to maintain the pregnancy, even if that meant that she might have to deliver at any time and suffer the possible consequence of a having a disabled child.\nMaterial risk and the need to obtain informed consent\nThe judgment in A is confirmation that the Court's decision in Montgomery does not mean a patient has to be informed of all risks. Material has to be more than \"theoretical\", \"background\" or \"negligible\". How the patient has communicated with her clinicians and the decisions taken during treatment are also relevant. A patient cannot simply rely on Montgomery to state they have an absolute right to know of all risks.

{"question":"Please tell difference between airplane and car carbon fiber manufacturing costs?","answer":"The manufacturing costs differ significantly between aerospace and automotive CFRP production. For aerospace, the cost is higher due to stringent standards, strict compliance requirements, high licensing and inspection costs, and reliance on autoclave-based production methods. In contrast, automotive manufacturers like BMW have developed more cost-effective methods by implementing automated production lines, standardizing materials (like their 50k carbon fiber), and focusing on waste reduction. The aerospace approach requires high capital expenditure due to longer production cycles, while automotive has optimized for higher volume production with shorter cycle times to reduce costs along the value chain.","context":["Fiber reinforced composites finds its application in various fields of engineering such as automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. Various advancements in technology, have led to development of lightweight composites with high tensile strength. Carbon fiber reinforced plastic, also referred to as carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics, and is manufactured by blending carbon fiber with plastic, in order to enhance its strength. Carbon filaments produced from polymers such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), rayon, and petroleum pitch, are the essential elements used in the manufacturing of CFRP. The carbon fiber is woven into resin, mostly epoxy resin, to culminate in the formation of a material exhibiting extremely high strength, rigidity, low density, excellent damping properties, and high resistance to thermal expansion. CFRP also exhibits enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity as compared to glass fiber reinforced plastics (GRP). These key attributes of CFRP allow for its incorporation in a wide range of applications such as aerospace & defense, wind energy, automotive, sports equipment, construction equipment, pipe & tanks, marine, electrical, and electronics. Methods such as molding, vacuum bagging, compression bolding, and filament winding are used in the manufacturing of CFRP. Carbon fiber and carbon fiber reinforced polymers are recognized as clean energy technologies by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency, and Renewable Energy (EERE). Major contributors of the CFRP market share include the aerospace, defense, wind energy, and sports equipment industries.\nGlobal Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics Market Taxonomy\nThe global CFRP market is classified on the basis of the following segments:\nPrevalent Scenario in Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics Market\nCarbon fiber reinforced plastics are extensively used in the aerospace industry for manufacturing aircraft. Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus are enormously investing in research and development activities as means of manufacturing aircraft capable of withstanding high environmental stresses. These aerospace applications are subject to high standards, stringent compliances, and incur high licensing & inspection costs. Stringent regulations on vehicle emissions have compelled the key automotive manufacturers such as Volkswagen, BMW, Ferrari, and Audi to lay more emphasize on reducing the weight of automobiles. In order to curb the weight of vehicles, CFRP is being widely used as a polymer composite, resulting in improved fuel-efficiency of vehicles. Also, stringent regulations such as Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ) standards in the U.S. and carbon emission standards in Europe have led to an increasing demand for lightweight composites, in turn, driving growth of the CFRP market. Growing awareness about renewable energy among the populace, has increased the installation of wind farms, in turn, fueling the demand for CFRP products. The thermosetting CFRP products consist of cross-linked polymers, which do not melt at high temperatures, during the curing procedure. This property increases the significance of thermosetting CFRP, among others and is used in variety of applications, thus contributing a major market share in the CFRP market. The cost of manufacturing of CFRP products is higher than that of glass and steel polymers, thus resulting in higher selling price of these products. Research and development of the CFRP products and its incorporation into a wide range of applications, also incurs high costs. The manufacturing of CFRP products is highly dependent on the supply of large volumes of raw materials, which leads to limited production capacities. North America market contributes to a larger market share as compared to Europe, due to increasing research and development in aerospace and defense industries in the region. However, the presence of large number of major automobile manufacturers in Europe, positions it as a high growth region in the global CFRP market.\nThe global carbon fiber reinforced plastics market is highly fragmented due to the presence of many established and emerging players in the CFRP market. Major players involved in the market include Toray Industries Inc. (Japan), Teijin Limited (Japan), Mitsubishi Rayon Co. Ltd. (Japan), SGL-Group (Germany), Formosa Plastics Corporation (Taiwan), and Hexcel Corporation (U.S.).\nCoherent Market Insights followsa comprehensive research methodology focused on providing the most precise market analysis.

And, second, will the required low takt times be achieved with capable manufacturing technologies? Looking at the state-of-the-art autoclave production value chain, I’m skeptical that this will be the path forward.”\nTakt time is the average time recorded between the start of production of one unit and the start of production of the next unit, when these production starts are set to match the rate of customer demand.\nHighly automated, out-of-the-autoclave technologies must be implemented to achieve low takt times, said Wüllner, who has worked at the SGL Group longer than 20 years.\nThat’s because build rates of the single-aisle airliners will grow going forward: “Think about 10 to 12 twin aisles, A350 or B787, aircraft per month. Doing the math with 20 average workdays results in .5 aircraft per day or a takt time of something like 2,880 minutes. Compare this to a takt of approximately 5 minutes, which comes close to the BMW 7-series production!”\nBuilding the Airbus 350 or Boeing 787 requires a production rate of one wing per day by 2020, he said.\n“This is doable with autoclave technologies. But, imagine if six wings per day for the single aisle planes, A320 and B737, had to be manufactured with CFRP. How should this be achieved? Who could and would afford such investments?”\nIn automotive, carbon fiber composites evolved from carbon fiber prepreg monocoques—vehicle structures in which the chassis is integral with the body–for racing and super sports cars cured in autoclaves in the 1980s. “This is still the prevailing technology for expensive, low-volume cars,” Wüllner said.\n“Then, roofs and hang-on parts found their way into larger production volumes, up to a few thousands vehicles per year. By the end of the 1990s, BMW started its CFRP in-house development.”\nBMW gained “a lot of experience in small series applications, such as CFRP roofs or bumper structures for the famous M models,” he said.\nWhen BMW in 2008 began investigating “the future of mobility with a team called project I, one of the objectives was to develop a vehicle for the world’s megacities,” Wüllner said. A year later, the automaker had to choose between an aluminum chassis and a carbon fiber passenger compartment mounted on an aluminum frame.\n“As you may know, they decided in favor of the carbon fiber solution and started to develop the underlying product and production technologies for the car that became the BMW i3 battery electric vehicle.”\nThe passenger compartment is made from several plies of 50k carbon fiber unidirectional non-crimped-fabric of different area weights and orientations, he added. “Hence, the designers had full flexibility to add plies where needed, without inflating the number of base materials.\nThe stacking of such plies is performed in fully automated production lines. Molding and infiltration with epoxy resin is done by high-pressure resin transfer molding of the preform or by compression molding, followed by oven curing.”\nSeveral hurdles had to be overcome for setting up the technology for a capacity of more than 30,000 units per year. But “these learnings were the foundation for the next development step, the so-called carbon core of the recent BMW 7-series,” Wüllner said. “This set of different technologies allows for the combination of several materials, conventional steel, press-hardened steel, aluminum, and CFRP in the vehicle chassis.”\nIn 2009, SGL Group began to set up “the unique supply chain for BMW’s i3, i8, and 7-series models,” he said. “The 50k polyacrylonitrile precursor is spun in our Japanese joint venture in Otake. From there it is being shipped in boxes to our state-of-the-art carbon fiber plant in Moses Lake, Wash. Further production steps are being made in Germany. Non-crimped-fabrics and nonwovens made from recycled production off-cuts are being manufactured in Wackersdorf. Stacking of the non-crimped-fabric plies is done in Wackersdorf by BMW.\nThe German firm has three US sites: Hitco Carbon Composites in Arkadelphia, Ark, producing fabricated insulations for the aerospace industry; Hitco Carbon Composites in Gardena, Calif, serving automotive, aerospace and industrial applications; and SGL’s American hub for high tow count carbon fiber production, in Moses Lake, Wash.\nWüllner called being involved in designing and building up the dedicated global supply chain for BMW, stretching from carbon fiber precursor to textile materials, a “once in a lifetime opportunity.”\nThat allowed the production of the BMW i3, a purpose-designed battery electric vehicle, starting in 2013.\n“Since then, we came a long way until the launch of the carbon core BMW 7-series model in 2015.”\nIt was his education “regarding series manufacturing with carbon fibers in the automotive industry.”\nWüllner asked the Aeodef crowd, “Wouldn’t it be great to build the next generation of single-aisle commercial aircraft in the second half of the 2020s with a significant percentage of carbon fiber composites?”\nBoeing started using carbon fiber-reinforced plastics in commercial airplanes in the late 1960s, with its 737 and 747 models. Airbus followed with the 300. “However, the percentage of the airframe weight remained in the single-digit order of magnitude. CFRP utilization in new commercial aircraft programs showed a steady increase from about 5% to about 15% between 1970 and 2000. In those early years, CFRP was mainly used in secondary structures.”\nSince 2000, driven by the new A380, B787, and A350 programs, the CFRP content in the aircraft structure surged to above 50% in the Dreamliner and A350, he said. Now, CFRP is also extensively used in primary aircraft structures with the highest performance requirements.\nBut, carbon fiber composites remain expensive and the manufacturing process is more complicated and typically takes longer compared with other materials.\nThe aerospace and defense industry was always at the forefront of the technology development for carbon fiber based parts. “Numerous types of high performance carbon fibers, materials, manufacturing and curing methods have been developed over time,” Wüllner said. “However, the aerospace and defense industry typically doesn’t have to care about takt time as the auto industry has to.”\nThousands of cars are built each month. But only tens of commercial aircraft are built each month. “The existing manufacturing technologies are not adequate for further market penetration in aerospace and defense.”\nWhile CFRP adoption of up to 50% of the airframe weight in Boeing’s and Airbus’ twin-aisle models is remarkable, “this development took four waves and began more than 40 years ago,” he said. “We expect the usage of carbon fiber in commercial aircraft to reach a plateau around 2020. Until then, build rates will go up and the 777 X will have entered into service. However, due to the longevity of the supply contracts, I don’t see major changes in the supply base.”\nOn top of that, other sub suppliers are converting carbon fibers into braided preforms and prepreg patches.\nIn automotive, “besides developing the products and the underlying production technologies we had to build the plants from scratch,” he said. “The carbon fiber plant in Moses Lake was erected between 2010 and 2014…. The oxidation process is fueled with electric energy generated from hydropower. All carbon fiber lines are based on the same design. The first lines built have been retrofitted to resemble the newer lines benefitting from the learnings made over time.\n“Hence, in Moses Lake we have a plant with the most modern abatement technology to comply with the stringent environmental standards,” he added. “Statistical process control and traceability from polymer production in Otake to part manufacture in Germany are core principals of our production system.”\nWackersdorf, with its “unique unidirectional fabrics tailor-made for the requirements of large volume series production,” is the largest carbon fiber textiles plant in the world, Wüllner said.\n“Exchangeability is key to our supply chain. Therefore, any part can be made from any combination of spinning line, carbon fiber line, or warp- knitting machine of our qualified supply chain. This allows for immediate response to changes in demand.\n“The plants in Moses Lake and Wackersdorf are connected to a common manufacturing and quality software system.”\nHe showed the Aerodef audience a slide with the 34 different CFRP parts of the BMW i3.\n“The victory tour of carbon fiber composites in automotive and aerospace depends on material utilization,” Wüllner said. “Therefore, waste reduction in combination with low takt times is crucial.”\nTowpregs and braided parts offer “excellent material utilization but still suffer from long cycle times,” he said. “Those must be reduced to become successful. Otherwise high capital expenditure and operating cost will lead to negative business cases.”\nAerospace and defense firms can learn these things from the automotive industry’s experience with large series CFRP production at low takt times, Wüllner said in summary:\n- The design process has to be adopted to series production. In addition, the tool design for such processes should incorporate solutions for minute variations in part geometry.\n- To reduce cost along the value chain, define and implement standard materials, “as we did with our 50k carbon fiber, which was optimized for minimum variation of properties and for the downstream textile manufacturing steps.”\n- Adopt automated manufacturing processes with short cycle times to minimize CapEx.\n- Focus on waste reduction, statistical process control and inline quality inspection."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:20cb4455-7cce-4a20-8e5f-9cc7ebacd201>","<urn:uuid:34c46bf0-2258-4f00-ba02-0e973b878deb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a materials scientist studying precious metals: Could you explain the key differences between extracting gold from ores versus recovering platinum through electroplating processes?","answer":"The processes differ significantly. Gold extraction from ores requires complex processes to separate it from host rocks, often using methods like cyanidation or gravity concentration, with gold particles being particularly difficult to extract when locked in sulfide minerals that make them impermeable. In contrast, platinum electroplating is a more controlled industrial process where platinum salts and ions in an electrolyte solution are deposited onto a substrate using DC electric current, typically achieving coating thicknesses of 0.5-5 microns. The platinum ions are dissolved and then precisely deposited onto the target surface through controlled oxidation and electrical current flow.","context":["Precious Metals Guide - Meierotto Jewelers,Traditional metals used in jewelry are the noble metals: silver, gold and the ...

Although platinum is extremely rare — more so than both gold and silver — it’s used to make around 20 percent of all consumer products either in a component of the product itself or as a part of the manufacturing process.\nThe term “platinum” is sometimes used to refer to all of a group of six metallic elements that appear together on the periodic table and have similar physical and chemical properties. These platinum-group metals, or PGMs, include:\nThe durability of PGMs is one of their most attractive properties. As noble metals, they resist corrosion and tarnishing and can stand up to high temperatures as well as stand the test of time. Because of platinum’s strength, it often serves as a protective coating for other less-sturdy metal surfaces through a process known as electroplating.\nIn the platinum electroplating process, workers attach the substrate — the object that needs to be plated — to a rack and dip it into an electrolyte solution in which platinum salts and ions are dissolved. The platinum connects to a positively charged electrode while the substrate attaches to a negatively charged electrode.\nA DC electric current then flows through the rack to the platinum, oxidizing it, dissolving the platinum ions and depositing the ions onto the substrate. At the end of the process, you’ll have a platinum coating with a thickness of 0.5 to 5 microns.\nThis electroplating process allows equipment and components made of materials like silver or titanium to also have some of the beneficial characteristics of platinum. The durability of industrial platinum plating makes it an ideal choice for applications in a variety of industries, including the automotive, energy, medical and manufacturing sectors.\nWhat Is Durability?\nAll these different industries use platinum plating because it’s highly durable and allows the equipment it coats to operate more efficiently over a longer period of time. But in what ways, exactly, is platinum plating so durable?\nAdding a platinum coating to a softer material will increase its hardness and make it less susceptible to damage such as scratching or denting. You can measure the hardness of a material with the Mohs hardness scale, which ranks materials from one to 10 from softest to hardest. Diamond is a 10 on the scale while plastic is a one.\nPGMs fall toward the high end of the scale. Platinum is a four to 4.5, palladium is a 4.75 and rhodium is a six. Although tungsten, titanium and hardened steel are harder than PGMs, few other metals are. Gold and silver both rank as a 2.5 to a three while tin is just a 1.5.\nAdding a layer of platinum to a base material makes it thicker. This added thickness provides additional protection from damage, increases the quality and strength of the component and helps it last longer because there is more material to protect the substrate.\nYou can adjust the plating process to achieve your desired thickness, but the typical thickness is between 0.5 and five microns. It is possible, however, to achieve a thickness of 10 microns. A micron, also known as a micrometer, is one millionth of a meter. Although this may not seem like a large difference, an additional 0.5 to 10 microns of platinum adds a substantial amount of durability.\nEvery component is subjected to the wear and tear that comes with regular use. As a material comes into contact with other objects, it will eventually wear down due to friction. It will also suffer deterioration caused by abrasion, general material fatigue and other processes.\nAdding an extra layer increases the amount of time that this process takes to cause significant damage. Using a durable material for plating, such as platinum, will increase an object’s lifespan by even more. This saves you money by reducing the amount of maintenance an item needs and the frequency with which you need to replace it.\nCorrosion isn’t just unsightly — it also signals serious damage to equipment, since it is the gradual destruction of a material. Corrosion occurs when a metal interacts with something in its environment that causes it to break down. The most well-known form of corrosion is electrochemical oxidation, which occurs when a metal reacts with an oxidant. Rust is one common example of this.\nBecause corrosion is so destructive, it’s imperative that industrial operations protect their equipment from it as much as possible. This is one of the most valuable uses of platinum plating. It offers excellent corrosion resistance and often acts as a sacrificial barrier that slows or stops rust from forming on the surface below it.\nPrevention of Tarnishing\nAlthough tarnishing is essentially a minor form of corrosion, it’s often identified as a separate issue. Tarnishing reveals itself as a thin film that is black or gray in color on the surface of a material. Silver is especially susceptible to becoming tarnished, but the issue can occur on other metals, too, such as aluminum, brass and copper.\nAlthough tarnishing is common with these metals, platinum is immune to it. For this reason, platinum plating is frequently used to prevent tarnishing, which is more cost-effective than attempting to remove it at afterwards with hand-sanding, abrasive blasting or another method.\nIn some applications, materials need to be able to withstand high temperatures. This is especially critical in industries such as the automotive, aerospace and energy generation sectors, but resistance to heat is also important for many other applications as well.\nAn extremely high temperature can, of course, melt a metal and destroy a component completely. Heating can also cause chemical deterioration known as high-temperature corrosion if a material encounters a hot environment that contains oxidizing compounds. Heat can also alter the properties of a metal. It can cause it to expand, become less hard and become more resistant to the passing of electrical current, which can cause electrical components to not work as intended.\nPlatinum plating can protect products from damage caused by high temperatures. Platinum has a high melting point of 3,224 degrees Fahrenheit, which is greater than other metals including titanium, iron, silver and gold. Because of this high heat resistance, coating an object in platinum can help protect it from heat-related damage.\nIndustrial Applications That Benefit From Platinum Plating’s Durability\nWhen manufacturers need an item to withstand harsh conditions as well as the wear and tear of long-term use, they often turn to platinum. Its durability makes it ideal for a wide range of components in a number of different industries and applications, including some emerging technologies. Electroplating transfers platinum’s valuable properties to other materials as well.\nHere are a few examples of uses for platinum plating that demonstrate its supreme durability.\nThe equipment used to manufacture chemicals and synthetic materials must be able to withstand high temperatures and resist corrosion. Platinum, rhodium and iridium are perfect for this application because of their high melting points and because they remain stable when subjected to heat. They also resist damage caused by the other materials used in these industrial processes.\nOne example is the production of crystals. The procedure for growing crystals requires the crucible to contain molten salts, so the crucible must be highly heat-resistant. The resulting crystals have uses in laser technology, electronics and medicine as well as uses such as drilling, cutting and engraving.\nHigh-quality glass and glass fibers are manufactured via similar processes. The production of the glass used in plasma screens and Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) requires the crucible to withstand temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Platinum also won’t react with glass, as some base metal alloys do, which maintains the purity of the glass.\nResearchers are currently looking for ways to efficiently store energy created with solar technology. They’re essentially attempting to create an artificial leaf, or photoelectrochemical cell. Platinum, it seems, will play a central role in these energy storage solutions.\nThese cells use a process called water electrolysis to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, which can then be used as fuel. Platinum is the most commonly used catalyst for this hydrogen evolution reaction. The metal’s durability and ability to function in acidic conditions allow it to consistently perform even over extended use in this application.\nOne group of researchers also found that copper plated with platinum performed better than the more expensive indium tin oxide (ITO) typically used as transparent electrodes in photoelectrolysis cells. In the study, the copper-platinum nanowires retained their conductivity despite bending and maintained high transmittance under all of the circumstances required for the process.\nThermal Barrier Coating for Gas Turbine Engines\nIn both commercial and military gas turbine engines, a thermal barrier coating, or TBC, protects the engine from heat damage and oxidation. This coating improves engine performance and prolongs the life of its components. Platinum plays an important role in forming the bond coat layer of the TBC.\nGas turbines employ platinum because it is non-reactive, resistant to corrosion and able to withstand high temperatures. Using gas to run an engine creates harsh conditions for the components inside of it. The materials used must continue to perform despite these circumstances. If they don’t, the results could be damaging to the equipment, dangerous to workers and cause power outages.\nOne group of researchers added a thin extra layer of platinum to the TBC to address the issue of molten droplets of calcium magnesium aluminum silicate (CMAS) and increase the effectiveness of the barrier.\nImplantable Micro-Wire Multi-Electrode Arrays\nMulti-electrode arrays are medical devices that essentially connect neurons in the brain to electronic circuitry in order to stimulate brain activity. Doctors have used these arrays in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy and depression.\nFor implantable micro-wire multi-electrode arrays, coating the electrodes within platinum black has been shown to reduce the impedance of electrical signals, leading to the activation of more than twice the neurons of unplated microelectrodes. Using electroplating under ultrasonic agitation, known as “ultrasonic electroplating” or “sonicoplating,” has been shown to increase the durability of platinum black even further.\nThis means that implantable multi-electrode arrays could be more effective and longer-lasting thanks to the use of a specialized kind of platinum plating.\nThe automotive industry frequently uses platinum plating to strengthen parts of vehicles and protect them from corrosion, wear and scratching. The PGM palladium is especially common because of its use in catalytic converters, which change toxic gases and pollutants created by internal combustion engines into less harmful gases. In fact, more than half of all palladium used in manufacturing ends up in catalytic converters.\nPalladium’s hardness and resistance to corrosion and wear help make it the perfect material for use in catalytic converters. It will not oxidize when exposed to air and lasts much longer than other metals would under similar conditions. It also absorbs excess hydrogen in exhaust gas, which prevents the formation of hydrogen sulfide gas.\nMedial Device Coating\nPlating medical devices with platinum can help to increase their durability. This applies both to tools such as medical clamps and to devices implanted into the body, such as those used in hip and knee replacements. These implanted devices were traditionally made of steel, but today they might also be made of titanium or magnesium.\nAny medical device must be able to come into contact with the human body without injury. Because of this, the plating must be smooth. It also needs to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Platinum fits these criteria and also increase the strength of a device and helps it to resist corrosion, which is crucial for creating a long-lasting solution to medical conditions.\nCoating medical tools such as clamps and scalpels with platinum can also increase their strength and lifespan, improving their effectiveness and reducing the frequency with which medical facilities need to replace them, potentially lowering the cost of medical treatment.\nPlatinum Coatings from Sharretts Plating\nThese are just a few of the most impressive and exciting examples of how platinum plating improves equipment across various industries. You can find platinum in many other applications across a wide range of sectors.\nIndustry has used platinum group metals for years because of their many valuable attributes — especially their durability. These noble, precious metals have excellent strength and are resistant to wear, corrosion and heat. To attain these advantages for a larger group of materials and applications, today’s industries use platinum plating for both established and emerging devices.\nAt SPC, our experienced scientists and engineers use our perfected plating process to achieve high-quality results that will help your devices perform better and last longer through a variety of conditions and uses.

{"question":"What are the primary symptoms of childhood apraxia of speech, and what treatment methods have proven effective for this condition?","answer":"The primary symptoms of childhood apraxia of speech include inconsistent sound errors, difficulty with mouth movements, use of vowels or grunting for communication, groping for correct placement of speech organs, and limited expressive language despite good comprehension. Treatment must be intensive and may last several years, requiring multiple approaches. Effective treatment methods include multiple repetitions of sound sequences, visual prompting to show how speech sounds are made, co-production with the speech-language pathologist, and intensive one-on-one treatment programs. Children also benefit from oral-motor exercises, tactile cues, visual cues (using mirrors), and auditory feedback. Alternative communication methods like sign language or picture communication boards may be used initially to decrease frustration while working on speech production.","context":["Childhood Apraxia of Speech Causes, Symptoms and Treatment\nWhat is childhood apraxia of speech?\nChildhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a speech disorder in which a child’s brain has difficulty coordinating the complex oral movements needed to create sounds into syllables, syllables into words, and words into phrases. Typically, muscle weakness is not to blame for this speech disorder.\nParents of children with childhood apraxia of speech commonly say things like, \"No one can understand my son,\" \"It looks like he is trying to say the word, but can't get it out,\" and \"He said that word one time, and then I never heard it again.\"\nThe most common description of a child with childhood apraxia of speech is that he is often very difficult to understand.\nChildhood apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder. There is something in the child's brain that does not allow messages to get to the mouth muscles to produce speech correctly.\nIn most cases, the cause is unknown. CAS is not a disorder that can be “outgrown,” rather children with CAS will not make progress without treatment.\nThere is little data available about how many children have childhood apraxia of speech. The number of children diagnosed with the disorder appears to be on the rise, but it is hard to measure how the incidence has changed over time.\nSome factors influencing the rise in diagnosis include:\n- Increased awareness of childhood apraxia of speech by professionals and families\n- Increased availability of research on CAS\n- Earlier-age evaluation and identification\nSigns and symptoms\nAccording to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA, 2007), the three most common features in children with apraxia of speech are:\n- Inconsistent errors on consonants and vowels in repeated productions of syllables or words (for example, a child says the same word differently each time he tries to produce it).\n- Difficulty producing longer, more complex words and phrases.\n- Inappropriate intonation and stress in word/phrase production (for example, difficulty with the timing, rhythm and flow of speech).\nSome additional characteristics of speech production associated with childhood apraxia of speech include:\n- Late development of the child's first words and sounds.\n- A decreased sound inventory (for example, a lack of variety of consonant and vowel sounds expected at a certain age).\n- Multiple and/or unusual sound errors.\n- Vowel sound errors.\n- Excessive movements of the mouth or attempting to position the mouth for sound production.\n- Persistent or frequent regression in the number of words produced.\n- Differences in performance of automatic speech (such as \"hello\" and \"thank you\") versus voluntary speech. In most cases, voluntary speech is more affected by apraxia of speech.\n- Errors in the order of sound production in words (such as sounds omitted, switched, or added to words and within words).\nTesting and diagnosis\nAn accurate diagnosis of childhood apraxia of speech requires a comprehensive speech and language evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). The SLP will evaluate your child's speech skills and expressive and receptive language abilities, while gathering information from your family about how your child communicates at home and in other situations.\nIt is important that the SLP evaluating your child has experience and expertise in diagnosing and working with childhood apraxia of speech so an accurate diagnosis can be made and other possible diagnoses are ruled out. For example, childhood apraxia of speech is often confused with a severe articulation disorder, since both diagnoses include poor speech intelligibility. Unfortunately, the approach taken to address an articulation disorder is vastly different than the approach for childhood apraxia of speech, and confusing the two could result in reduced therapy gains.\nAn assessment for childhood apraxia of speech must include an evaluation of your child's expressive and receptive language abilities; many children with this disorder demonstrate deficits in their language skills. In addition, gaps between receptive and expressive language skills, word order confusion, and difficulty with word recall are common in children with apraxia of speech. A thorough assessment of your child's abilities is needed so therapy goals can be developed based on his individual needs.\nTreatment for apraxia of speech should be intensive and may last several years depending on the severity of your child’s disorder. Many children with childhood apraxia of speech benefit from:\n- Multiple repetitions and repeated practice of sound sequences, words and phrases during therapy\n- The use of visual prompting to show how speech sounds are made as sequences of sounds are combined into words\n- Co-production, or having the child say the word at the same time as the SLP or caregiver\nIf your child only has a limited number of words in his vocabulary, therapy will initially focus on improving his functional communication skills. It is critical for your child to have positive experiences with communication. If producing words is too difficult for your child initially, positive interactions may be achieved through other modes of communication, such as sign language, picture communication boards and voice output communication devices. Using other modes of communication while working on speech production has been found to promote verbal skills and decrease frustration in children while communicating.\nIt is important for SLPs, teachers, parents, related professionals and all family members to be actively involved in the treatment process so your child with ataxia of speech can achieve maximum progress. Additional research on this disorder is needed to explore causal factors, diagnostic criteria and the effectiveness of various therapy approaches.\nWith commitment from professionals, researchers and families, children with apraxia of speech can make significant improvements to their speech and communication skills.","With help, kids can overcome apraxia of speech\nNancy E. Labaki, M.A., CCC-SLP\nMedCentral Pediatric Therapy\nAs parents of most healthy kids know, speaking is easy for them after they've had a chance to practice syllables and words. But it isn't easy for children with apraxia of speech. This motor speech disorder prevents kids from consistently moving their face, tongue, lips and jaw into the correct position to make speech sounds or produce syllables or words.\nSymptoms of apraxia of speech may include:\n- Difficulty imitating mouth movements\n- Use of vowels, grunting or single syllables for communication\n- Limited ability to produce speech sounds\n- Inconsistent speech sound errors\n- Groping for correct placement of the tongue, lips and jaw during speech\n- Abnormal voice quality\n- Omission of words in sentences\n- Unusual or lack of facial expression\n- History of feeding difficulties\n- Limited expressive language skills, in spite of good understanding of language.\nWhen a physician suspects a child might have apraxia of speech, he or she might ask that a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP) assess the child's oral-motor abilities, melody of speech and speech sounds development. The SLP will determine if speech is developing normally, at a slower rate than typical or if the speech is truly disordered. A child's speech and language skills are considered to be developmentally delayed when the child is following the normal path of development, just at a slower rate. In contrast, some children are able to understand language (good receptive language skills), but have unclear speech - or no expressive speech at all. This might simply indicate an expressive language disorder; however, the child should be evaluated for the presence of a specific speech disorder such as apraxia. In addition to the unclear or absent speech we observe with apraxia, many kids also need to develop language skills, such as using appropriate word endings, verb tenses and sentence structure.\nWith some exceptions, most children with apraxia of speech learn to speak clearly. Some might have minor lingering differences in their speech patterns, and a few might even need alternative methods of communication. One thing that is certain is that learning to speak clearly is often very challenging for children with apraxia, and treatment might be necessary for a long time. Children with apraxia benefit most from intensive one-on-one treatment programs. Typical articulation and language therapy approaches are not very effective for these children. Kids with apraxia of speech benefit more from a combination of apraxia specific tools used by a SLP, in addition to oral-motor exercises, tactile \"touch\" cues, visual cues (watching in a mirror) and auditory feedback. The SLP will design a therapy regimen that best suits your child, and will modify that approach as your child's speech improves.\nBecause many of these children will become frustrated in their efforts to communicate, a strong family support system is critical. Encouraging children in their communication efforts and providing unconditional support will help them feel like and become successful communicators.\nIf you think your child may have any symptoms of apraxia, please discuss it with your physician, consult with a speech therapist in your area or visit the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association online at www.asha.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:222dae0e-01cc-4ff6-ac7c-134f39b376d6>","<urn:uuid:104d2be9-cf7f-4e09-96e7-64cf4d20d687>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you list the main differences between how weaving expertise is transmitted in Laos versus Uzbekistan's ikat tradition?","answer":"In Uzbekistan, there are two formal paths to becoming a master weaver: 1) Being an apprentice to a master until receiving permission to work independently, followed by traditional gift-giving, or 2) Working with and learning from one's father until taking over his position. In Laos, the transmission is more informal and gender-specific, with the tradition being passed down from mother to daughter for generations. While Uzbek masters oversee teams of workers (like Rosuljon's 52-person unit), Laotian women traditionally wove only for themselves and their families.","context":["\"Ikat is my ancestor's work. It came to me by blood.\"\nMeet Rosuljon, UNESCO-award winning Ikat Master Weaver.\nHe lives in Margilan, Uzbekistan, and leads the team behind the creation of our Uzbek Ikat Silk Scarves.\nIf you appreciate the skill and beauty of the ancient art of ikat weaving, then you will love the provincial city of Margilan. Located in a remote corner in the northeast of Uzbekistan, Margilan is squeezed between borders with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in a fertile, green region known as Ferghana Valley.\nWhile ikat weaving is believed to have been practiced in Central Asia for centuries, the only physical evidence to have emerged of ikat weaving in the region is dated from the 19th century. At this time, several centers were engaged in ikat weaving, but as of today, Margilan has emerged as the main ikat weaving center in all of Central Asia.\nClick on image for details\nA visit to the bustling Sunday market, Kumtipa, will help you realise just how vital ikat is to the region; stall after stall fills one crowded corner of the market, meters of ikat yardage hanging from the walls and brides to be buying up big for all the ikat outfits they will need for their wedding events. While the binding and dying process is always carried out by hand, much of the fabric on offer here is woven by machine, which, for us at House of Wandering Silk at least, deducts greatly from its beauty.\nHappily, there are still a handful of Master Weavers committed to reviving the art of ikat weaving by hand. One such Master Weaver is Rosuljon Mirzaakhmedov, awarded by UNESCO for his skill and promotion of the particularly complicated and luxurious velvet ikat.\nRosul is from a long line of ikat weavers; born in Margilan in 1973, he is a 9th generation weaver, taught the art by his father. After a five year jail sentence in the last decade of the tumultous Soviet era when crackdowns were common, his father was forced to move from Margilan to nearby Andijon to find work. As the USSR began to collapse and the Central Asian states declared independence, Rosul and his father returned to Margilan to establish their own ikat weaving business. This is the same business he continues today.\nRosul and his team work from a beautiful 19th century madrassa (Islamic school). Built by a local businessman as a philanthropic donation to the community, it was closed during the Soviet era. Inaugurated in 2007 for the 2000th year anniversary of the city of Margilan by the Uzbek president, the madrassa is a stunning piece of architecture; one of only two madrassas in Central Asia with a running water channel flowing through it. The individual madrasa cells, once taken up by students, are now given over to several local master craftsmen - a coppersmith creating stunning brass and copper work, a felt making unit of women and one cell for suzani embroidery. The rest of the cells are used by Rosul's team, and the winter mosque of the building, an enclosed area with high ceilings and intricately painted wooden beams, is the showroom for the stunning ikats they create.\nHOWS. What is the difference between a master weaver and a weaver?\nRosul: A weaver must weave what the master tells him to. All the calculations, the drawings and the selection of the design is made by the master. There are two ways to become a master weaver. The first is to be an apprentice to a master, to learn from him. When the apprentice wants to leave, to work independently, the master must agree to it. The tradition is for the father of the apprentice to then bring gifts to the master, such as chapans (thick, Central Asian robes). The second way is to work with your father, and this way you continue to work together and learn the art until your father retires, when you take his position as Master Weaver.\nHOWS. How many people work in your unit?\nRosul: There are a total of 52 people working in the ikat unit; my partner, Aziz, and I, who manage the entire operation; and the binders, dyers and weavers.\nHOWS. What is the proudest moment of your career?\nRosul: Reviving the complicated technique of velvet ikat production.\nHOWS. What does ikat mean to you?\nRosul: Ikat is my ancestor's work. It came to me by blood. There is an Uzbek saying, \"if you continue your father's work, you will be more prosperous\". I believe this.\nHOWS. What is the most challenging element of ikat?\nRosul: Now there is no aspect of ikat production which is difficult for me. The hardest part, however, is choosing the designs which will be most popular.","Silk Weaving in Laos : An Ancient Asian Tradition\nLao Silk Textiles - Detailed Motif\nSilk Weaving in Laos\nThe women of Laos have been weaving silk for over 1000 years. This ancient tradition has been passed down from mother to daughter for generations, and silk weaving remains a beautiful, creative expression of Lao culture today. Laos is a small country in Southeast Asia with a population of just 6.2 million and few exports.\nThe art of weaving experienced a long period of decline, but then the number of visitors to Laos began to increase. Westerners, seeing the wonderful designs and incredible detail of Lao traditional dress woven in silk, took an interest causing a revival of the tradition in the early 1990s. An American women named Carol Cassidy with a deep interest in weaving visited Laos in 1989 and fell in love with the country and its rich weaving tradition. Carol established one of the first commercial weaving studios in Laos and did a great deal to promote Lao weaving.\nToday several studios in Laos are weaving silks of spectacular quality, incorporating ancient tribal designs as well as contemporary designs. Thanks to international media coverage, Lao silk is now receiving deserved recognition from around the world. The demand for woven silk textiles from Laos is steadily climbing as more and more people have the opportunity to appreciate this superb art form.\nIn the past, Laotian women normally weaved only for themselves and their family. They bred the silk worms, extracted the silk and dyed it with natural dyes before weaving textiles to be worn for every day use or for special occasions. Often they would take an heirloom piece as inspiration and modify it somewhat.\nOver past centuries, the various ethnic groups in Laos have provided a vast pool of influences, leading to an astonishing variety of patterns, color schemes and shapes. The women of Laos are passionate about silk weaving, and joyfully work their looms. Silk weaving plays a vital role in Lao tradition. The growing demand for silk textiles is helping to stimulate a tiny economy with few exports by providing a valuable source of income for women and their families as well as helping to promote tourism.\nTraditional Silk Loom\nThe Lao have spent hundreds of years perfecting the art of silk cultivation and the thread used is of a consistently high quality. The silk taken from a cacoon consists of a single filament up to 3000 feet long. Five or so filaments are often combined to make a usable silk thread.\nAfter the silk is dried and spun it is then dyed using a variety of plant extracts:\n- · Indigo plant - blue, black and green\n- · Mahogany tree-dry earth and brick red\n- · Ebony fruit -grey\n- · Annatto seeds –orange\n- · Jackfruit -yellow\n- · Bark of the Indian trumpet flower tree -green\n- · Almond leaves -olive\nAncestral dyeing techniques are very meticulous and great care is taken when selecting the plants from which the dye is extracts. Most fabrics in the world today are dyed with synthetic dyes, which lack the natural beauty of natural dyes. Some studios in Laos are now using German synthetic dyes which are fade resistant.\nLao Silk Wall Hangings\nOnce the weaver is clear on the design to be used, silk weaving begins on a traditional wooden loom. It’s a remarkable experience to watch a complex motif emerge slowly with each expert movement of a master weaver. The skill and patience required by the weaver is staggering. A single piece can take months to complete. Traditional designs or motifs include ancient symbols such as diamonds, temples, birds, mythical serpents (Naga), elephants, flowers and other animals. These ancient symbols are said to offer protection to the owner. The starflower and other geometric designs attract good luck and prosperity. Certain animal characters are believed to increase fertility, while the firestone and spinning tools reflect wisdom and creativity.\nWeaving techniques used include warp, weft, supplementary weft, matmee or ikat and tapestry.\n- Warp refers to the silk threads stretched lengthwise on the loom to be crossed by the weft, which then forms the cloth.\n- Supplementary weft refers to a decorative technique in which the motif is formed using additional threads. This imaginative technique can appear to some as though it were embroidered onto the cloth.\n- Matmme or ikat is the process of adding a pre-dyed pattern into the warp. Silk threads are dyed in a pattern and woven into the piece creating an interesting effect where the colours appear to bleed into one another. This technique is also used in India and Indonesia.\n- Tapestry is a freestyle weaving technique popular in the Northern Laos.\nSilk Weaver, Laos\nLao Silk Textiles Home Décor\nUnlike mass produced machine woven textiles, the surfaces of loom woven silk are not perfect, but show the beautiful organic characteristics of hand-woven and dyed silk. When considering the value of a silk it is only fair to take into account the massive volume of time and exceptional skill required to create these beautiful textiles. The more detailed pieces created by master weavers are really works of art.\nLao silk textiles can be used as wall hangings, table runners, bed runners or wraps. Some pieces also look wonderful framed. Vintage textiles sometimes combine cotton with silk, especially the pieces that originally formed the hems of skirts worn by Laotian women. These pieces are in short supply and will increase in value over time.\nThe exquisite textiles woven by the women of Laos lend a wonderful, warm ambiance to the home and capture much of the mystical, exotic and playful sense of Southeast Asia.

{"question":"How did the recording quality and production approach differ between the 1961 Village Vanguard session and the 1968 Ronnie Scott's performances of Bill Evans?","answer":"The 1961 Village Vanguard recording had utterly crystalline fidelity that captured every detail, including audience coughs, with spine-tinglingly rich nuance audible in each instrument - remarkable for its vintage. The 1968 Ronnie Scott's recordings were actually captured by drummer Jack DeJohnette himself during their residency at the club, and were later discovered and produced by Resonance Records with careful attention to post-production. Both recordings serve as important historical documents but were captured and preserved through different means.","context":["The Concord Music Group recently added five new entries to its Original Jazz Classics Remasters series. All presented with their original cover art and liner notes, and in some cases previously unreleased bonus tracks, this series helps preserve jazz history. The latest batch includes: Miles Davis featuring Sonny Rollins – Dig (1951), Chet Baker – Chet Baker Sings: It Could Happen To You (1958), Bill Evans Trio – Waltz For Debby (1961), Vince Guaraldi Trio – Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus (1962), and Wes Montgomery – Boss Guitar (1963).\nAs Ira Gitler explains in a new essay in the CD booklet, Dig was originally released in the obsolete ten-inch LP format. The five tune track list was expanded by two in 1956 after the twelve-inch LP became standard. Every reissue since has included all seven numbers. Miles Davis assembled a sextet for this October 5th, 1951 session, most notable for the presence of Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone. Nineteen year old Jackie MacLean played alto sax. Walter Bishop was the pianist, while the rhythm section consisted of Tommy Potter on bass and Art Blakey on drums.\nThe group comes out swinging hard right-off the top with the title track, the first of four Davis originals. The uptempo “Dig” features exciting soloing from all three horn players. Although Gitler asserts Rollins’ squeaky reed during “It’s Only a Paper Moon” doesn’t mar his solo, I have to respectfully disagree (it’s a little annoying). “Denial” is highlighted by the adrenaline rush of Blakey and Davis trading fours. Later in the album, the classic Davis tune “Bluing” serves as the album’s centerpiece. Nearly ten minutes long, Davis’ soloing during this relaxed blues is particularly masterful.\nChet Baker Sings: It Could Happen To You hit record stores when Baker, who began his career strictly as a trumpet player, was already established as a popular vocalist. Due to his dulcet singing tone, this is probably the most accessible to non-jazz fans of these five reissues. Baker sings ten standards on the original album, with four alternate takes added to the CD (two of which are previously unreleased). He plays trumpet on most of them, but on some he takes a scat vocal solo instead. The album’s original liner notes make the interesting observation that Baker’s scatting was styled after his horn playing, similar both in tone and in phrasing.\nThe piano playing by Kenny Drew is the album’s somewhat underrated strength. Drew does an excellent job of accompanying Baker’s vocals, breaking away for highly dexterous, tightly controlled solos. The rhythm section for these sessions was a combination of four musicians. Half the album’s tunes features George Morrow on bass, while the others feature Sam Jones. The drumming is mostly handled by Philly Joe Jones, with Dannie Richmond filling in on three numbers. With most of the songs hovering around the three minute mark, the combo’s function here is supporting their leader. Award winning jazz writer Doug Ramsey contributes an informative new essay to go with the original notes.\nRecorded live at the Village Vanguard, June 25th, 1961, the Bill Evans Trio established an very high standard of excellence with Waltz For Debby. Ten days later, bassist Scott LaFaro was killed in a car accident at the age of twenty-five. His legacy (a career that spanned only six years) lives on in this transcendent recording. The work of Evans on piano, LaFaro on bass, and drummer Paul Motian is hypnotic. Their interplay is fascinating, with each member contributing distinctive parts. Evans meditative piano playing is the obvious highlight, but rarely has a rhythm section been so well attuned to their leader.\nThe original six tune album is augmented with an exploration of “Porgy (I Loves You, Porgy)” and three alternate takes of tunes found earlier in the album. The fidelity of the live recording is utterly crystalline, especially considering its vintage. Every time someone so much as coughs (which occurs numerous times during the opener, “My Foolish Heart”), the microphones capture it. Not that listeners want to be distracted by audience noise – the upside is the spine-tinglingly rich nuance audible in each instrument. New liner notes were contributed by the album’s original producer, Orrin Keepnews.\nEven if they don’t recognize his name, pianist Vince Guaraldi is one of the best known jazz musicians amongst people who have little to no interest in the genre. Guaraldi composed and performed the indelible scores for numerous Peanuts television specials. Tunes like “Linus and Lucy,” “Charlie Brown Theme,” and “Christmas Time Is Here” are all his work. Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus preceded his Peanuts work, but its best known track reportedly inspired producer Lee Mendelson to hire Guaraldi to score A Charlie Brown Christmas.\nThat tune, “Cast Your Fate To the Wind,” won Guaraldi a Grammy in 1963 and was covered by many (including non-jazz artists). Kicking off the second half of the album, it’s one of just two Guaraldi originals. As suggested by the album’s title, many of the tunes are Guaraldi’s interpretations of themes from the movie Black Orpheus. These bossa novas make up the album’s first half. Very melodic and often quite swinging, the Vince Guaraldi Trio (Monty Budwig on bass, Colin Bailey on drums) offers up a very accessible brand of Latin jazz. Four of the five bonus tracks are previously unreleased, including an alternate take of “Cast Your Fate To the Wind.”\nWes Montgomery had long been acknowledged as one of the finest jazz guitarists by the time Boss Guitar was released in 1963. Backed by Mel Rhyne on Hammond B-3 organ and Jimmy Cobb on drums, Montgomery demonstrates his astonishing technique. Perhaps most jaw-dropping is the trio’s interaction on “Dearly Beloved” – the passage with Montogomery and Cobb trading fours is stunning. Of the two Montgomery originals found here, “The Trick Bag” climaxes with a thrillingly tense solo from Rhyne, backed by rather agitated fills courtesy of Cobb. An even faster alternate take spotlights more of the same rhythmic ingenuity.\nThese five reissues were produced by Nick Phillips and boast 24-bit remastering by Joe Tarantino. Jazz fans should thank Concord Music Group for keeping these classic albums in circulation. The packaging is without frills, but the new essays accompanying the original liner notes in each release are welcome additions.Powered by Sidelines","If ever there was a case for designating a single label as a museum dedicated to the preservation of Jazz Music with art exhibits dedicated to Bill Evans and Wes Montgomery that honour would, hands down, go to Resonance Records with George Klabin [and Zev Feldman] as Curators-in-Chief of those exhibits. The case is strong. There are already five dedicated to Wes Montgomery, the first Jazz great guitarist after Charlie Christian, and six exhibits dedicated to Bill Evans’ trios including one [from the label’s mid-priced series The Takao Fujioka Collection, a sampler that gathers music from a few of his performances] that serves as an an homage to his genius. Eleven of Resonance’s “museum” exhibits.\nBill Evans: Live at Ronnie Scott’s is the third in the Resonance series featuring a relatively-speaking “less” celebrated trio that included Jack DeJohnette – all of them from a tour of Europe in 1968. This date at Ronnie Scott’s is special perhaps because it comes from a month-long residency at the iconic London club, Ronnie Scott’s. The importance of being able to play such a long residency cannot be over-estimated; it can, in fact, be heard to magnificent effect in songs – such as “You’re Gonna Hear from Me” and “Emily” that were played [and recorded here] on separate occasions. The feeling of oneness among the members of the trio – of trusting one another enough to be able to leap off into the unknown; of using each of her as invisible safety-nets in order to stretch and explore melodic and harmonic inventions is palpable here, as it is elsewhere on the recording; on Mr Evans standards “Very Early” and “Waltz for Debby”, for instance.\nIt is well-known [and also well-documented] that Bill Evans had a hard time settling back into music after Scott LaFaro tragically passed away in 1965. While he seemed to find a soul mate in Eddie Gomez, it felt as if he was left groping – at least for a time – with drummers [and there is a concert that has been taped at a television studio in Europe where he interrupts his performance several times to instruct drummer Alex Riel how he wanted to get a particular rhythmic feel to song.] We find none of this with the trio that included Jack DeJohnette, who joined Mr Evans’ trio in 1968, the same year the group headlined the Montreux Jazz Festival and produced the album Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival – all this before Mr DeJohnette returned toured Europe with the trio, returning stateside to work briefly with Stan Getz and his quartet before he joined – and recorded several seminal recordings with Miles Davis.\nMr DeJohnette had the presence of mind to record these live sessions with Bill Evans’ trio at Ronnie Scott’s and, of course, Zev Feldman with his incomparable ability to sniff out seemingly “lost” recorded documents got wind of this set from July 1968. Then, as a result of bringing the long arm of Resonance – George Klabin and his art of A & R, research, production and post-production [read that as Fran Gala], as well as legal and other aspects of doing the right things right – we have yet another priceless two-disc set documenting the return of Bill Evans [if you will] after the dismantling of his most famous [1964-65] trio. And that too bears mention because Mr Evans, in the quietude of his extraordinary trio music, had already re-defined three-way Jazz conversations – in fact he had done so before his first trio, in 1959, when he helped shape Miles Davis’ ground-breaking album Kind of Blue [Columbia].\nThe translucent, near-spiritual beauty of Mr Evans’ playing is all over this recording – celestial on “Turn Out the Stars” – drenched in soulful angst in “My Man’s Gone Now” , hypnotic and hopeful on “Someday My Prince Will Come”, elementally melancholic on “Alfie”, breathtakingly beautiful on “Very Early” and “Waltz for Debby” and soaring again in an ethereal sort of way on “Nardis”. Eddie Gomez is right there with Mr Evans, his rumbling – and often weeping gravitas – accompanying the great pianist with epic empathy and even pathos like a player in a classic Grecian drama. By 1968 you get a bit used to that empathetic performance from the prodigiously-gifted bassist. The surprise is how seamlessly Jack DeJohnette fits into Mr Evans’ musical conception. On the other hand, perhaps this is not really surprising considering Mr DeJohnette’s impressive sense of belonging almost entirely to the music – and by that one means: music in general.\nIt is a music that seems to exist in solitary splendour; a performance that makes one feel that this is more than just a musical document of a particular period; it is, in fact, essential part of the music’s history as well as a kind of “bearing witness” to the continuing development of Bill Evans – the musician. The sense that often this music comes as a result of a rush of blood through the veins of the pianist is very real. There is no tentative probing and poking at a melody to find the optimal point from which to take off into the stratosphere and re-harmonise a tune, de-construct the song before sculpting long inventions and sensuous improvisations so much so that the song itself becomes a re-invention of itself. Fortuitously Eddie Gomez was there with Mr Evans, as was Jack DeJohnette not only to erect an elegant rhythmic edifice, but – in the drummer’s case, in this instance – to record it all.\nBill Evans left us several epic documents of his live performances. His two residencies at The Village Vanguard – with Scott LaFaro and Paul Motian [Riverside, June 1961] and with Marc Johnson and Joe LaBarbera [Nonesuch, 1980] are among the most valued collectables of all live music for aficionados of great music to listen to with a true sense of wonder. To those great live performances, one can surely add Resonance Records’ five live recording releases from 1968 and 1969 – especially the ones where Mr Evans performed in Europe. Each is a recording to die for. Yet somehow, this set from Ronnie Scott’s seems to be a little more special. The packaging, for instance, takes us back to the days of classic record-cover art, with the late David Stone-Martin’s exquisite illustrations worked into a retro-design by art director John Sellards; perhaps it’s also the combination of informative and passionate essays and interviews with Mr Gomez and Mr DeJohnette, and old photographs you cannot help but devour with your eyes and mind.\nAnd perhaps its also the fact that despite all of this embarrassment of riches, what carries a little more weight is the boundless energy of the three musicians that seems to be ignited with the throwing of a nuclear switch by the drumming of Jack DeJohnette in that trio that has something to do with it… no matter what, it’s an album to die for.\nTrack list – Disc One 1: A Sleepin’ Bee; 2: You’re Gonna Hear From Me [Version 1]; 3: Yesterdays; 4: Turn Out The Stars; 5: My Man’s Gone Now; 6: Emily [Version 1]; 7: Spring Is Here; 8: Embraceable You; 9: For Heaven’s Sake; 10: Someday My Prince Will Come; Disc Two – 1: Quiet Now; 2: ‘Round Midnight; 3: Stella By Starlight; 4: Alfie; 5: You’re Gonna Hear From Me [Version 2]; 6: Very Early; 7: Emily [Version 2]; 8: Waltz For Debby; 9: Autumn Leaves; 10: Nardis\nPersonnel – Bill Evans: piano; Eddie Gomez: contrabass; Jack DeJohnette: drums\nReleased – 2021\nLabel – Resonance Records [HCD 2046]\nRuntime – Disc One 50:47 Disc Two 49:31"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:06bbdce8-a2fd-45cf-b481-b9abca66699d>","<urn:uuid:e22b016a-9fab-4ce0-89f8-eb2a072d4287>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm curious about educational research methods - what's the connection between scientific experiments and educational studies, and how do they measure success?","answer":"Scientific experiments and educational studies share important methodological parallels in how they measure success. Both fields rely heavily on control groups to determine what works - in science, this helps identify experimental failures or successes, while in education, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) use control groups to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching approaches. Success measurement in both fields requires rigorous repetition and validation - scientific experiments need to be replicated multiple times for publication, while educational studies use both quantitative and qualitative researchers to assess learning impacts. Additionally, both fields track progress through systematic assessment - education uses various types of assessments (diagnostic, formative, summative, etc.) to measure student learning, while science uses experimental controls and replication to validate findings. This systematic approach helps both fields maintain research quality and reliability.","context":["Growth in the evidence ecosystem\nScientific progress does not follow a linear path and although development is made, it is full of bumps and turns. There are parallels between this work and that of the advancement of evidence within the educational ecosystem.\nI was a scientist for over nine years in the field of Bioinformatics. There were times when my experiments wouldn’t work, and as I would hold up a blank piece of film in horror, all I could see was the many days of wasted time in preparation. I remember a scientist told me that experiments had an 80 per cent failure rate; my lived experience confirmed this.\nTo help with understanding experimental failure we would incorporate a control group, so we could tell what had failed or, in those rare moments of success, what had worked. If there was success, we needed to repeat the experiment another two times and produce the same result, so we could publish.\nEvidence in education is continually growing. Often not in a consistent way, but in the same manner as science through new findings that are sometimes contradictory. This is why I am so passionate about educational research. I love the way the numbers change based on the incorporation of new studies into meta-analyses (Education Endowment Foundation, 2018b; Hattie, 2009; Marzano, Waters & McNulty, 2005).\nEvidence helps strengthen the argument of quality programs and puts to rest those that have unproven results. This says that education is a dynamic field, like the experiments in my laboratory. Like science, it is driven by a spirit of curiosity (Deeble & Vaughan, 2018), by wanting to know what works, for whom, and in what circumstances.\nThe dynamic nature of educational evidence\nAn example of a growth in the evidence ecosystem I work in is the soon to be updated Teaching & Learning Toolkit. There are exciting changes in quite a few numbers, based on the incorporation of new studies. This is a process that occurs every 12 months with an international literature review. Sometimes this results in changes to previously held beliefs in educational evidence. As movement occurs based on new results, the Toolkit captures the live and dynamic nature of evidence in education. This can result in changes to months’ worth of learning progress.\nIn the latest updates to the Toolkit, we will see changes to the approaches of metacognition and self-regulation, reading comprehension and mentoring. Metacognition and self-regulation will change from eight to seven months of learning progress (see Figure 1), while reading comprehension will gain an additional month of progress – moving from five months to six months. Why have these changes occurred? Additional studies drive the changes that alter the overall effect size, to result in a months’ worth of learning progress.\nFigure 1: Effect sizes for metacognition and self-regulation in 2017 and 2018.\nCapturing good evidence\nThe best studies that help grow the evidence ecosystem are those that have appropriate designs, such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (Gorard, See & Siddiqui, 2017; Hutchison & Styles, 2010; Vaughan & Roberts-Hull, 2018). This draws a parallel with the use of control groups within scientific studies. RCTs are expensive, time consuming and require specific expertise but are critical to allow us to capture good evidence. Crucial to these studies are the teams of qualitative researchers working alongside the quantitative researchers, to determine how the changed learning conditions have impacted students’ learning. For example, a RCT in the UK has looked at the impact of Embedding Formative Assessment that involved 25 000 students. It showed the importance of providing feedback that moves learning forward. The evidence showed students made two additional months’ worth of learning progress (Education Endowment Foundation, 2018a).\nEvidence for Learning is currently commissioning three of these studies. One of these is the independent evaluation of Thinking Maths , led by a team of researchers including Dr Hilary Hollingsworth and Dr Katherine Dix from the Australian Council for Educational Research. The research results from this evaluation have been released today.\nGrowth within the evidence ecosystem is fed by undertaking rigorous studies. The use of control groups in educational research helps us to be confident about the accuracy of the results. The light of curiosity also drives growth within the ecosystem; a constant pursuit to determine what works best for our students and in what circumstances.\nDeeble, M., & Vaughan, T. (2018).

There’s no point in designing a learning program that doesn’t help learners become more successful. If you’re going to go through the effort, don’t you want to at least know that your program is effective? In this post, I’ll outline five types of learning assessments and key questions to ask as you design your assessment strategy, so that you can start to measure success and increase learner satisfaction right away.\n5 Types of Assessments\nDiagnostic assessments are typically given before instruction in order to ascertain what the learner knows about the subject before the lesson begins. In what areas does the learner need to improve? In what areas are they already proficient? The diagnostic evaluation is intended to be used as the basis for developing course content, or directing the learner to existing resources. It can be administered as a quiz or survey. Diagnostic surveys are also used to conduct a comparative analysis against the learner’s performance in other exams.\nFormative assessments are issued throughout a course. Learners are tested on how well they can integrate newly introduced content with what they learned in previous experiences. Course designers use formative assessments to tweak instructional content, making adjustments to pacing, sequencing, language, interactivity, etc. Formative assessments can be quizzes, conversations with an instructor, or games.\nAlso referred to as the interim assessment, benchmark evaluations are issued periodically over a longer period of time (usually months) and are typically used to predict how well a learner will perform on the summative evaluations. Course designers use benchmark tests to map out the strengths and weaknesses of their learners so that they can provide resources to assist them in these areas in preparation for the final exam. Essentially, benchmarks are interim summative assessments.\nHow well are learners performing against their peers? The norm-referenced assessment is designed to measure the performance of learners within a certain group or demographic, like grade-level, age, nationality, etc. This information is useful when analyzing how social and cultural factors contribute to learner performance.\nA summative assessment is administered at the end of a lesson. There should only be one summative assessment per lesson. Summative evaluations cover all of the topics introduced by the lesson objectives(s).\nDesigning an Assessment Strategy\nAssessments are designed around the learning objectives of a particular course or lesson, that is, what you want the learner to know, how you want them to think, or what you want them to be able to do. It is a good idea to design your lesson around the assessment questions, which should be drafted beforehand. Now that you know the different types of assessments, here are some questions you should ask yourself when designing your assessment strategy:\nHow can the learner adequately demonstrate knowledge and mastery of the subject?\nInclude opportunities for the learner to retrieve, recall and demonstrate what they have learned in the lesson thus far. For virtual learning or blended learning environments, multiple choice questions, simulations, short and long answers are common ways to achieve this.\nWhat is the mode of assessment?\nWill the evaluation be issued over computer, by written assignment, quiz, class conversation, etc? Do some research on the subject, the participants, and the environment before designing the lesson.\nHow frequently are learners being tested?\nThe frequency of testing influences learner engagement, motivation and memory. The more opportunities the learner has to retrieve and recall information the more likely they will have a productive learning experience. Test the participant after presenting 3-5 new concepts within a lesson.\nHow much time does the learner have to finish the assessment?\nWhen designing tests, take into account how quickly the participant reads, their cognitive level, and the complexity of the questions being asked. Are they multiple choice, matching, drag and drop, short answer or long answer? What types of motor and cognitive skills are needed to answer the question? Will they have to show their work? Give the participant enough time to read each question at least three times, or enough time to review a writing block at least 3 times. The first time a participant reads a question they are cognitively orienting themselves to the question, hopefully retrieving the answer before they have read options presented. The second time, the participant is reviewing all of options presented and making their choice, and the third time, the participant is reviewing their choice against all others. Bear in mind, timed questions increase motivation but they may also increase anxiety, so give the learner ample time to complete tasks.\nWhere is the learning environment?\nConsider whether the learner will be at home, in school, at work, etc, and any impact this will have on how the assessment is designed. Adjust the difficulty of the questions based on where the exam will be administered. Typically home-based examinations are more difficult because it is difficult to make sure the participant doesn’t cheat. In office and school environments, timed examinations are appropriate because of their hours of operation.\nAre the questions appropriate for the cognitive level of the learner?\nConsider whether the questions are too easy, or too difficult, and whether they are age-appropriate. Questions that are too easy or too difficult negatively affect the motivation of the participant. If a learner understands the lesson but does not understand the wording of the test they will more than likely answer the question incorrectly. For example, if a learner is at the concrete operational stage of development, do not present questions that require a formal operational thinking unless the lesson was designed to improve the latter.\nDoes the learner know what to expect during the assessment?\nHave you sufficiently set expectations for the type of assessment? Is the learner being testing on the appropriate content? For example, a course teaches the phases of the water cycle, and each unit breaks down the phases into individual lessons. For the assessment, the questions must pertain to only information that has already been presented in the course. For a formative assessment, test on content within a specific unit, the benchmark would test on all units that have been covered, and the summative assessment would test on the entire program.\nLearning objectives and assessments are some of the most important elements of any instructional plan. Assessments are equally important for learners and course designers, facilitating a feedback loop that is used to build an engaging, informative, challenging, yet motivating interactive learning experience.\nFor help designing an assessment strategy, contact Reva Digital for a consultation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f8c297d2-3c9c-4950-8721-4becc241280e>","<urn:uuid:0c5f60bb-8245-4a7f-a0bf-e5e4cefb9411>"],"error":null}

They are essential in coal preparation plants to break coal into specific sizes for separation and processing. As for pillar systems, there are two main types: crush pillars and squat pillars. Crush pillars have fragmented material with limited resistance and negligible cohesion, while squat pillars provide better support by connecting hangingwall and footwall beams both vertically and horizontally. Squat pillars are preferable as they allow better management of stope closure, improve shock absorption, and help maintain equilibrium in the regional host rock. The pillar system must be designed considering both the pillar material properties and surrounding rock strata characteristics.","context":["versão On-line ISSN 2411-9717\nversão impressa ISSN 0038-223X\nJ. S. Afr. Inst. Min. Metall. vol.111 no.10 Johannesburg Out. 2011\nCOMMENT ON PAPER\nComment on the paper: design of merensky reef crush pillar\nF.S.A. de Frey\nThe author would like to refer to his contribution to the paper 'Design of pillar systems in South Africa' by Ozbay et al.1.\nThe authors agreed 'wholeheartedly that further research, together with carefully planned field trials, in pursuit of this potentially highly rewarding concept' of the small span small pillar method is warranted.\nOn 30 September 2010 the author went underground at the Kroondal Chrome Mine to observe how the concept of smaller spans was being applied. He was pleasantly surprised to find that the typical coal mine bord and pillar sytem was being used very successfully. Although the deepest mining was taking place at a depth of only 450 metres, Kroondal would be an ideal mine to do further research together with carefully planned field trials. At Crown Mines Gold Mine, where the author worked, he was informed that the first recorded rockburst took place at a depth of 635 metres below surface. The depth of the platinum and chrome mines is increasing, with the risk of an excalation in injuries and fatalities due to'backbreaks' and siesmic activity. The rock engineer at Kroondal was not aware of backbreaks occuring on the mine. It is important that the rock engineers of the base mineral and gold mines get together and give more serious attention to the host rock environment in which the pillars are situated.\nStudying the spreadsheet of the pillar design at Kroondal it seems that the factor of safety (FOS) of 2.4 is acceptible to a depth of 800 metres below surface. The percentage extraction will, however, be diminished from 71.4 to 44.7.\nAfter his visit to the Koondal Mine, the author studied the papers 'Merensky pillar strength formulae based on back-analysis of pillar failures at Impala Platinum' by Watson et al.2, 'Design of Merensky Reef crush pillars' by Watson et al.3, and 'Pillar design in coal mines' by Wagner4.\nThe author would like to share his thoughts on his findings with readers:\nWatson et al.2 state, and I quote 'If a sufficiently large mining span is achieved, or the stope abuts a geological feature, a large volume of hangingwall rock can become unstable, resulting in a stope collapse, or colloquially a \"backbreak\". In order to prevent these backbreaks a high resistance support system is required.'\nThe author fails to see how the residual strength of crush pillars can provide the required support resistance to prevent backbreaks and keep the stope hangingwall stable.\nThe crush pillar\nA crushed pillar will have the following characteristics:\nFragmented material with limited resistance to closure\nNegligible vertical or lateral cohesion in the pillar as well as its surrounding region\nNo shock absorbtion ability to transfer shockwaves vertically or laterally\nIncreased vertical and lateral stresses in the hangingwall and footwall\nDiminished ability to form stable beams between crushed pillars\nFailure to assist in maintaining equilibrium by the inability to distribute strains and stresses, especially tensile stresses, equally amongst the pillars and their host rock\nWeak clamping effect between pillars, especially where geological disturbances are present in the pillars as well as the bords.\nThe squat pillar\nThe squat pillar will support the following conditions:\nSolid pillar material will connect hangingwall and footwall beams vertically as well as horizontally\nThe arching effect from pillar to pillar allows better absorption and distribution of shock waves caused by seismic events\nSquat pillars allow the closure of the stoped area to be managed and minimized\nMinimizing closure diminishes vertical and lateral strains and improves the ability to form stable beams in the pillar, hangingwall, and footwall. This assists the maintenance of the equilibrium in the regional host rock.\nThe support and cohesion in areas where geological disturbances are prevalent is also improved. Horizontal confinement of beams between pillars is improved.\nA squat pillar should never fail! This is achieved in the following manner:\n1 Assess the weakest material in the pillar as well as the host rock immediately in the hangingwall and footwall so as to be able to estimate/calculate the possibility of punching\n2 Using the above information and considering the vertical and lateral stresses, calculate the maximum span that the material can carry as a beam without failing\n3 Taking the stoping width and width to height ratio, together with the depth below surface of the squat pillar into consideration, calculate the minimum measurement of the length and width of the pillar.\n4 The span stability, and not the pillar stabiliy must determine the span.\nThe pillar should never be subjected to stresses in excess of its critical excess shear stress characteristics.\nThe author agrees that pillars could have burst as a result of local siesmicity (p. 454).\nThe following statements by Watson et al.2 underline the author's above reasoning:\nThe punching phenomenon becomes an important aspect of the failure mechanism of the pillar system, and effectivel controls the pillar at larger width-to- height ratios.\nThe failure of realistic pillar systems, with the probable exception of very slender pillars in hard rock, is to a large extent controlled by fracture and failure processes in the foundation. The author would like to add failure in the hangingwall.\nResults of numerical models clearly show that pillars need to be viewed as a system that incorporates the immediate hangingwall and footwall as well as the pillar itself.\nIncreasing pillar strength and pillar load results in increasing damage and failure in the hanging and or footwall. The author is of the opinion this can be alleviated by smaller pillars carrying smaller loads as a result of smaller spans. Stable pillar design and behaviour cannot be considered in isolation.\nIn their paper 'Design of Merensky Reef Crush pillars' Watson et al.3state that pillar size should be designed with residual strength in mind, and also the need to consider peak strength and loading environment. It is the author's considered opinion that no crush pillar design will achieve this.\nWatson et al.3 again concentrate on assessing pillar strength but come to the conclusion that, and the author quotes: 'The calculations should include panel spans between pillars rather than a pure extraction ratio.' It is the author's opinion that this should not allow any probability of failure by loading pillars in excess of their peak pillar strength.\nWagner4 in his paper 'Pillar design in coal mines' conduct a critical examination of the principles underlying the design of coal pillars, and states that pillar strength must take into account the properties of the pillar material and the surrounding rock strata as well the nature of the contact surfaces.\nWagner4 states that the most important parameters that control the magnitude of induced stresses, decrease with increasing pillar size and decreasing bord width.\nUsing his equation for the maximum normal stress at the end of the beam, Wagner4 finds that a change of bord dimensions from 6 metres to 5 metres results in a 31 per cent reduction in maximum tensile stress in the immediate hangingwall beam. He also states that not enough use is being made of this effective method of improving roof quality. He also emphasises the effect of strata and pillar stiffness and of panel dimensions on pillar loads.\nAccording to Wagner4, the most imortant parameters that control the magnitude of the induced stresses are the size of the pillars and the bord width. The author is of the opinion that of late too much emphasis is being placed on the size and strength of the pillars, while the effect of the bord widths are being neglected when analysing critical stress levels.\nThe author suggests the following research procedure using the appropriate analytical solution and numerical models techniques.\nAssume a fixed extraction ratio of 75 per cent.\nVary the size of square pillars and square boards of equal length and width dimensions to find the most favourable tensile stress condition for the applicable variables of the strength of host rocks, strength of pillar material, and width-to-height ratio.\nThe author wishes to acknowledge Wouter van Aarde, Rock Engineering Manager of Xstrata Alloys-Western Mines, for his support and for arranging the underground visit to Kroondal Chrome Mine.\n1.

{"question":"How do arc flash incidents commonly occur, and what safety measures exist to protect workers from them?","answer":"Arc flash incidents occur due to two main categories of causes: environmental factors (like moisture, insulation failures, overvoltage, corroded terminals, dust, and animals) and human error (including improper work procedures, misplaced tools, loose connections, and inadvertent contact with energized components). To protect workers, multiple safety measures are employed, including personal protective equipment (PPE) rated for different energy levels, engineering controls to reduce incident energy, and arc-resistant equipment features like reinforced enclosures, internal venting systems, and pressure dams. Additionally, proper system modeling and analysis through Arc Flash Hazard Analysis (AFHA) helps identify and mitigate risks before they cause harm.","context":["The most significant safety issue in the electrical industry is the threat of electrical workers being injured or killed by arcs and blasts. The principal hazards associated with such arcs and blasts include thermal burn injuries and physical trauma from the blast concussion and flying projectiles caused by partially melted components being propelled by the force of the blast. Therefore, it’s important to understand that the focus of arc flash hazard analysis (AFHA) is to mitigate hazards — not merely to select flame-resistant (FR) clothing.\nMany electrical engineers have used the methodologies discussed in this article to calculate the “heat” associated with electric arcs, but then used that information only to recommend electrical workers wear higher levels of FR clothing when performing energized work. The appropriate approach would be to first exhaust reasonable attempts to make engineering changes to the system to reduce the “heat,” and then select the appropriate FR clothing for the risk that cannot be adequately controlled through engineering interventions. Let’s take a closer look at the AFHA process and examine what factors electrical engineers should consider when attempting to protect electrical workers in the workplace.\nAFHA integrates both electrical engineering and safety engineering. Unless the electrical engineer performing the AFHA is fluent with proper methods of hazard analysis and systems safety principles, he will be at a disadvantage when determining appropriate methods to address safety issues in an AFHA (see Avoiding Traps in the AFHA Process). Furthermore, the person conducting an AFHA must have a great depth of experience in power systems design. This is because there are many occasions where the arc flash calculations will provide erroneous results, and the engineer must have enough knowledge/experience to identify when reasonable results are produced — or when investigation is needed to identify why an erroneous value was produced during calculations.\nAn AFHA consists of four distinct engineering functions, including:\n- System modeling\n- Data entry and validation\n- System analysis\n- Reporting and recommendations.\nLet’s take a closer look at each of these phases for additional clarification.\nSystem modeling — Given that all subsequent analysis of the project hinges on the accuracy of the front-end information, it’s critically important to accurately capture the electrical system in a commercially available AFHA software program. This step involves physically gathering data relative to the system components and settings on electronic system protective devices, such as power circuit breakers, protective relays, and fuses. The initial evaluation captures the facility electrical system in its normal operating state, which includes the normal position of bus ties, generator operation, and feeder contribution from the electric utility.\nData entry and validation — This stage includes populating the AFHA software with the needed information to predict system function in both normal operation and during faulted conditions. An added benefit of this stage is that an accurate schematic diagram of at least the main feeders of the facility is created as a natural output of the study.\nFrom a practical standpoint, these first two stages constitute about two-thirds of the total time involved in an AFHA study. In addition, the graphical representation of the facility (schematic diagram) must be verified before proceeding to the analysis process because the software program uses the diagrams in running the engineering calculations.\nSystem analysis — The analysis stage of the study includes evaluation of the system from several perspectives, including performing a short circuit analysis, protective device duty analysis, and coordination analysis. Brushing up on the technical vocabulary involved in such analysis is also useful (see Terms and Definitions).\nYou must first determine the amount of short circuit current (SCC) generated by the system during faulted conditions at each “node” (i.e., location) in the facility. This information is valuable for ensuring protective devices are properly rated to interrupt the available SCC and properly sizing grounding cables. SCC is mostly a function of the mega-volt-amperes (MVA) ratings of the source generators and transformers from the electric utility; however, many modern industrial customers have extremely large internal generation systems (>50MVA). The AFHA must take these internal generation capabilities into account when performing the study.\nOne key output of the SCC analysis is a report known as the “protective device duty analysis,” which compares the capability of protective devices (fuses, circuit breakers) to interrupt SCC to which it is subjected. In cases where the SCC exceeds the interrupting rating of the protective device, a “through-fault” results, which means the protective device operates but is unable to interrupt the flow of SCC. Because the result is the same effect as not having a protective device in the circuit, the SCC must then be interrupted by the next protective device in series with the system “upstream” toward the source. This results in much slower arc clearing times, which, in turn, translates into far greater incident energy exposure levels for electrical workers.\nCoordination analysis involves evaluating the time current curves (TCC) of the protective devices to ensure that the electrical system will clear faults in an orderly or “coordinated” manner. A TCC refers to the speed at which a device will “clear” SCC as a function of the amount of SCC to which it is exposed. In general, the higher the SCC, the faster the protective devices will operate. This reality often explains why systems with low SCC can actually have more incident energy — because the time an arc continues to “burn” determines how much heat eventually develops. The coordination study evaluates two scenarios that will later appear in reports. The first evaluates the coordination of the current configuration (i.e., the “as-built” case) of the system. The second looks at the system once the recommended engineering changes have been implemented (i.e., the “revised” case). The recommended engineering changes that come out of this step can involve any combination of the following:\n- Reducing trip times on adjustable circuit breakers.\n- Using current-limiting fuses.\n- Reducing fuse sizes of non-current-limiting fuses.\n- Replacing fuses with other styles of fuses that have different TCC characteristics.\n- Changing protective relay settings on systems where an electronic relay actuates a separate circuit breaker. Note: These systems are far more expensive but provide maximum flexibility for engineering interventions because many different relays can be connected to a single circuit breaker. This means the protective systems can be “smarter” than simply sensing magnetism or heat, as is the case in a simple thermal-magnetic circuit breaker found in a home.\n- Inserting additional protective devices in series with existing devices. Note: Often, the use of motor overloads in series with fuses can result in much lower values of incident energy because fuses can be set to interrupt only SCC while relying on the overload sensors to interrupt overloaded conditions.\nThe normal approach to making incident energy calculations is to use commercially available software programs that have essentially automated the use of the IEEE Standard 1584 Arc Calculation spreadsheet. The most impressive use of this software is in the area of adjusting system coordination. The engineer can adjust an individual protective device in the system, which, in turn, simultaneously updates the values of any other related system elements. This allows the engineer to test different scenarios and receive instantaneous feedback. Needless to say, the investment in AFHA software is worth the price in terms of saved man-hours of engineering time.\nReporting and recommendations — This stage of an AFHA typically includes five major steps:\n- Tabular data from the study: It is important to provide tabular data for each section of the report, because doing so allows critical review by other engineers and enables others to catch data entry mistakes in equipment labeling, etc.\n- Protective device duty analysis: Identifies devices at or near their interrupting duty ratings. Some software programs produce an “equipment duty report,” which is synonymous with the protective device duty analysis.\n- Incident energy calculations: Highlights areas where incident energy levels exceed 10 cal/cm2. We recommend using a 10 cal/cm2 threshold because studies have shown that third-degree burns result from exposures to 10.7 cal/cm2 (unprotected skin) or more.\n- Recommended engineering interventions: Provides revised breaker/relay settings when those changes will result in satisfactory outcomes. This section also includes a cost-benefit section for recommended interventions that necessitate either equipment replacement or significant retrofitting of equipment to lower incident energy exposure levels.\n- Equipment labeling: The NEC (110.16) requires that all equipment with arc flash hazard potential (i.e., >1.2 cal/cm2) be field marked to warn electrical workers of the hazardous condition. This label normally includes the calculated incident energy value and other important safety information.\nThe hazards represented by electrical arc blasts have been identified as a significant hazard for many years. Previously, the preferred method for protecting electrical workers from arc flash hazards was through the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as FR clothing, face shields, etc. However, many accident reports revealed that incident energy levels could easily reach values for which there was no PPE capable of providing adequate protection. As such, it was necessary to reduce incident energy to manageable levels through the use of engineering controls.\nThe use of formal engineering studies, such as AFHA, represents a significant improvement for protecting electrical workers from arc flash hazards in the workplace. The IEEE 1584 methodology has emerged as the standard for AFHA in the United States since its publication in 2002. Although the methodology presented in this standard is very powerful, there are inherent weaknesses within it that qualified engineers must consider when determining the best methods to protect electrical workers.\nA number of commercially available AFHA software programs make AFHA significantly easier — programs that allow an engineer to easily test different coordination scenarios and result in better systems analysis and improved recommendations. Automating the many calculations needed to perform AFHA reduces mathematical errors and improves the end product.\nIn the final analysis, safety professionals and engineers alike must remember that AFHA is about people, not engineering calculations or OSHA regulations. A miscalculation by an engineer or errors in data gathering can result in death of a human being. Thus, all parties must maintain great diligence in ensuring that every facet of AFHA is performed to the highest standards possible.\nKolak is president of Praxis Corp., a company specializing in electrical engineering and electrical safety training based in Granbury, Texas.

The clearing time is comprised of three separate variables: the time it takes for the protective device to “sense” the fault, the mechanical operating time of the protective device (circuit breakers or fuses), and the time it takes for the protective device to extinguish the arc.\nArcing fault current: A fault current flowing through an electrical arc plasma, also called arc fault current and arc current.\nArc-in-a-box: The estimated incident energy for an arc in a cubic enclosure with sides of 20 in.\nArc rating: The maximum incident energy resistance demonstrated by a material (or a layered system of materials) prior to break-open or at the onset of a second-degree skin burn. Arc rating is normally expressed in calories per square centimeter.\nAvailable fault current: The electrical current that can be provided by a serving utility and facility-owned generation devices and large electrical motors, considering the amount of impedance in the current path.\nBolted fault current: A short circuit or electrical contact between two conductors at different potentials in which impedance between the conductors is essentially zero.\nElectrical hazard: A dangerous condition in which inadvertent contact or equipment failure can result in shock, arc flash burn, thermal burn, or blast.\nExposed: Capable of being inadvertently touched or approached nearer than a safe distance by a person. It is applied to parts that are not suitably guarded, isolated, or insulated.\nFault current: A current that flows from one conductor to ground or to another conductor through an abnormal connection (including an arc) between the two.\nFlame-resistant (FR): The property of a material whereby combustion is prevented, terminated, or inhibited following the application of flaming or non-flaming source of ignition — with or without removal of said flaming source.\nFlash hazard analysis: A method to determine the risk of personal injury as a result of exposure to incident energy from an electrical arc flash.\nFlash protection boundary: An approach limit at a distance from live parts that is un-insulated with which a person could receive a second-degree burn. This is defined as incident energy levels of 1.2 cal/cm2 or more.\nIncident energy: The amount of energy impressed on a surface, a certain distance from the source, generated during an arc event. Incident energy is measured in joules per square centimeter or calories per square centimeter.\nSidebar: Avoiding Traps in the AFHA Process\nInexperienced engineers (or non-engineers) often fall into some of the more common traps when performing arc flash hazard analysis (AFHA), including those outlined below.\nHyper focus on high-voltage (>600V) systems — There is a general belief that high-voltage systems present a much greater threat from arc flash than low-voltage (<600V) systems. The tabular approach in NFPA 70E contributes to this misunderstanding, because the tables in the document require high levels of flame-resistant (FR) clothing for high-voltage systems and relatively little FR clothing for low-voltage systems. However, there are numerous occasions when low-voltage systems represent significantly higher arc flash hazards to workers than do high-voltage systems. One reason for this is that most high-voltage work is performed using insulated sticks, which can range in length from 4 ft to more than 35 ft. The increased working distance when using insulated sticks often renders the actual incident energy exposure levels to values far less than working on low-voltage circuitry.\nAnother reason to avoid high-voltage hyper focus relates to employee exposure to high-voltage systems. In the commercial/industrial realm, most electricians or maintenance workers only interface with high-voltage systems perhaps once per year. As such, many organizations will use a “phased approach” to AFHA due to costs, almost invariably devoting scarce resources to the high-voltage system first. However, this is the antithesis of what should be done. By far, electrical workers interface with low-voltage systems more often than high-voltage systems. Therefore, the focus of the AFHA should first be to mitigate arc flash hazards on the low-voltage system in most organizations.\nModeling the system based upon voltage levels — A dangerous practice in AFHA is to model the electrical system to only a certain voltage level rather than the actual arc flash hazard. The most common practice is to stop at the 480V level of the system, assuming that lower levels of the system do not present a real hazard. However, experience teaches us that some of the highest incident energy levels in a facility are on the 208V side of 480V/208V dry transformers. There are literally thousands of examples where there are incident energy levels of only 0.1 cal/cm2 on the 480V side of the transformer and levels of as high as 600 cal/cm2 on the 208V side of the same transformer.\nStopping analysis when low incident energy levels are achieved — In many cases, once incident energy has been reduced to acceptable levels at one level of the system, it’s often true that lower levels of the system on the same circuit have the same or lower incident energy level. However, a good practice to follow when performing AFHA is to “sample” downstream circuits, just to ensure they do, in fact, have low incident energy levels.\nA recommended way of sampling would be to model each style of circuit breaker or fusible element on lower level circuits. The reason for this approach is that short circuit current (SCC) levels usually decrease as you move to lower levels of the system. The clearing times on protective devices will increase in response to the lower SCC levels. However, in some cases, incident energy levels can actually increase when SCC levels dip below the level where a protective device will operate. This results in arcs that can last for several seconds and often translates into dangerously high incident energy levels.\nBlindly accepting computer-generated results — Only competent electrical engineers should perform AFHA, because the software is not perfect and can occasionally produce erroneous results. In these cases, it takes someone with both experience and engineering training to first recognize the error and then hand calculate the correct results. Another difficult step requires the engineer to re-integrate the correct results into the software program for use with the rest of the study.\nHere’s a good example. Looped systems can present a challenge for AFHA software because algorithms in the software may “look” for certain mathematical results when determining the “source” for a fault. This can also happen when generators are involved. In these cases, the software can sometimes produce erroneous results, because these situations usually require more than one protective device to operate in a specific order to clear the fault. If the software “picks” the wrong source — or if it doesn’t properly calculate the sequence of events in the fault event — it will produce inaccurate results.\nIt’s also important to note that AFHA software programs often do not include comprehensive “reasonability check” systems to verify that inputted results are reasonable for the system being modeled. Once again, the responsibility for catching these situations rests with the engineer doing the analysis. Clearly, not having a properly qualified person doing the analysis increases the likelihood of erroneous results.","In seeking arc flash solutions, don’t overlook validation\nArc flashes are responsible for about 80% of electrical accidents in the U.S. each year.\nArc flashes happen when an electric current passes through the air between two conducting metals—an arc fault. Almost instantly, an arc can superheat the air around it to a temperature up to 35,000 F—about four times the sun’s surface temperature. This extreme heat ionizes all nearby materials, including copper, insulation, and metal enclosures, creating explosive gaseous plasma as those materials expand to many thousands of times their solid volumes.\nUnder these conditions, the copper changes to plasma, with a volume about 67,000 times that of its solid form. Or, stated differently, each cu in. of copper converts to almost 39 cu ft. of copper vapor.\nArc faults are different from bolted faults on the load terminals of standard, metal-enclosed switchgear. Switchgear equipment is designed to withstand bolted fault currents until circuit breakers or fuses interrupt the current flow. When a bolted fault occurs, the voltage at the point of the fault is virtually zero and the total fault energy gets dissipated into the entire power system, while any arcs are contained and cooled within the circuit breaker’s interrupters or the fuses.\nBy contrast, the incident energy of an arcing fault is much more difficult to contain and is concentrated almost entirely at the fault location. Its flash can spread hot, ionized plasma over a distance of 20 ft. or more with significant accompanying sound and shock waves. This explosive force can cause significant injury, even death, to individuals in the immediate vicinity.\nArc flashes are responsible for about 80% of electrical accidents in the U.S. each year. In human terms, they are responsible for hundreds of deaths, thousands of serious injuries, and significant lost work time every year.\nEvolving safety standards\nArc faults have numerous causes that fall into two categories. One comprises intrusive environmental factors such as cabinet moisture, insulation failures, overvoltage, corroded terminals, dust, dirt, and animals, including rodents and snakes. The second category is human error such as improper work procedures, misplaced tools, loose connections, and inadvertent contact with energized components.\nInadequate maintenance practices are often contributors to both categories. As the number of arc flash incidents suggests, they are a paramount electrical safety concern, for which a range of industry safety standards have evolved.\nIn North America, the main safety standard for working with electrical equipment is NFPA 70E: Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace. It addresses electrical safety requirements for workplaces to safeguard employees during such activities as the installation, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of electric conductors, electric equipment, signaling and communications conductors and equipment, and raceways in public and private facilities.\nUnder NPFA 70E, employees whose work may potentially expose them to arc flashes are required to wear arc-rated protective clothing. This clothing is made of fabric that provides thermal insulation and is also self-extinguishing to minimize burns, as prescribed by ASTM F 1506-08, Standard Performance Specification for Wearing Apparel for Use by Electrical Workers to Momentary Electric Arc and Related Thermal Hazards.\nOSHA has said that clothing conforming to ASTM 1506 complies with the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.269 (Electrical Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution) directive regarding the wearing of protective clothing that will not contribute to severity of burns. Personal protective equipment is a primary part of an arc flash injury mitigation, which can also include other equipment such as a helmet or headgear, face shield, gloves, and ear protection.\nThe amount of PPE required is dependent on the calculated arc flash incident energy on a worker’s body, which depends on arc current, system voltage, and duration and distance from the arc. NFPA 70E defines five categories of PPE, each category providing progressively greater protection against higher and higher energy levels. The energy levels correspond to specified “boundaries” that define the degree of danger and required protection.\nThe highest tops out at 40 calories/cm2 skin exposure requiring the highest levels of PPE (compared to a curable second-degree burn caused by 1.2 calories/cm2 of skin exposure). When the incident energy level goes beyond 40 calories/cm2, it becomes exceedingly difficult to provide any practical means of PPE.\nSafer equipment, safer environments\nOf course, the simplest and most effective measure to prevent an arc flash is to shut off all power to the equipment to be worked on. Siemens advises that individuals should work on motor control centers (MCCs) or other electrical equipment only after all power to the equipment has been turned off. In fact, this is often done through mandated lock-out protocols.\nArc flash prevention, safety training, and PPE can only go so far in keeping workers out of harm’s way should an arc fault occur. Although PPE can provide protection from an arc flash, it still cannot protect an operator from being struck by enclosure doors blown off or open from an arc flash—or from fragments ejected from a disintegrating enclosure.\nThat is why manufacturers have taken steps to design arc flash hazard mitigation and arc-resistant features into their electrical equipment. These features are designed to complement each other. Arc flash mitigation features aim:\n- To keep the workers beyond the arc flash boundary or,\n- To shorten the arc flash duration.\nArc resistant equipment’s goal is to make sure that, in the event of an arc flash when the MCC’s doors are closed and latched, the equipment will contain the explosion, directing the arc blast, including its heat, plasma, and pressure, away from workers.\nIn addition, the industry has codified the performance testing of arc-resistant features according to the rigorous requirements set forth in the IEEE Guide for Testing Metal-Enclosed Switchgear Rated Up to 38 kV for Internal Arcing Faults (ANSI/IEEE C37.20.7 – 2007).\nTaking Siemens type WL low-voltage switchgear as an example, arc-resistant features can include:\n- ANSI/IEEE Type 2 arc resistance to protect personnel at the front, back, and sides of the equipment (Type 1 arc resistant protection only applies to the front of the cabinet.)\n- UL Listed, performance tested, and classified as arc resistant per ANSI/IEEE C37.20.7\n- Reinforced enclosure to withstand pressure from internal arcing faults\n- Internal venting system with pressure dams and pressure vents to channel the flow of arc fault gases and vent these gases out the top of the gear and away from personnel\n- Reinforced front with gaskets plus doors with extra hinges and stronger latching systems\n- One-piece circuit breaker doors with insert panels for control devices such as fuses, indicating lights, and circuit breaker control switches when required\n- Reinforced bolted rear covers\n- Insulated bus bar system\n- Shutters in circuit breaker compartments\n- Sill channel with integrated arc plenum\n- No configuration restrictions\n- Suitable for solidly grounded or resistance-grounded configurations.\nThere are five criteria listed in ANSI/IEEE Std C37.20.7-2007 as follows:\nCriterion 1: That properly latched or secured doors, covers, and so on, do not open. Bowing or other distortion is permitted provided no part comes as far as the position of the indicator mounting racks or walls (whichever is closest) on any assessed surface.\nCriterion 2: No fragmentation of the enclosure occurs within the time specified for the test. The ejection of small parts, up to a individual mass of 60 g, from any assessed external surface above a height of two meters and from any external surface not under assessment, is accepted. No restriction is placed on the number of parts allowed to eject.\nCriterion 3: Assessment of burn-through: It is assumed that any openings in the switchgear caused by direct contact with an arc will also ignite an indicator mounted outside of the switchgear at that same point. Since it is not possible to cover the entire area under assessment with indicators, any opening in the area under assessment that results from direct contact with an arc is considered cause for failure. Openings above the indicator mounting rack height (two meters) that do not cause ignition of the horizontally mounted indicators are ignored.\n- Accessibility Type 1: That arcing does not cause holes in the freely accessible front of the enclosure.\n- Accessibility Type 2: That arcing does not cause holes in the freely accessible front, sides, and rear of the enclosure.\nCriterion 4: That no indicators ignite as a result of escaping gases. Indicators ignited as a result of the burning of paint or labels, glowing particles, and so on, are excluded from this assessment. High-speed movies or video may be used to evaluate the cause of indicator ignition.\nHoles in horizontally mounted indicators caused by particles that do not ignite the indicator are ignored. Surface discoloration or charring that does not result in glowing or flaming of the indicator cloth is allowed. Any indicator cloth with surface discoloration or charring shall be replaced with new cloth before additional testing.\nCriterion 5: That all the grounding connections remain effective.\nArc flashes present a serious safety risk. While the best protection is prevention by enforcing strict safety rules, mandating proper maintenance, and supporting that with regular safety training, advances in technology have enabled electrical equipment manufacturers such as Siemens to design and engineer much more arc-resistant safety features into their products and systems such as switchgear and MCCs.\nWhile standards continue to evolve, they inherently follow these kinds of innovations. Nonetheless, the proper performance testing of new and innovative arc-resistant safety features cannot await standards. At the same time, it is important that the application testing of new safety features be validated by a qualified third-party like the UL to ensure that the safety features work as intended and to prevent tragic accidents.\nPablo Medina is product manager, Walt Karstens is product engineer for tiastar MCC, and Keith Flowers is program manager for WL breakers, all part of Siemens Industry Inc."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a1dbd45f-17f1-4aa3-9baa-6b30b99bd86a>","<urn:uuid:e1f64d3c-7b97-49a7-977e-9f23baadb255>"],"error":null}

The following is the first in a three-part series in cooperation with the Marshalltown Times-Republican.)\nMARSHALLTOWN Iowa farmers are often said to be “feeding the world,” but a cadre of would-be commercial farmers in Marshall County have a desire to feed people in their own community.\nFour students from Marshalltown Community College have four different paths they are taking to reach a common goal to earn a living by growing food and by raising meat and dairy animals for consumers who live in nearby communities.\nTheir path to the goal leads through a two-year degreed program – Entrepreneurial and Diversified Agriculture – at Marshalltown Community College.\nLinda Barnes, who created the MCC course in 2003 and continues to teach it, said “We’re helping to train farmers to provide the growing demand for local foods.”\nCaite Grieshop, of Ames, grew up on a hobby farm near Ames. As an adult and in her second year of the program, she hopes to create a way to plug into providing food to local families. Currently, she has Katahdin hair sheep on her 6.5-acre farm and wants to expand into dairy goats and laying hens.\nGarret Caryl, 20, of Colo, is a certified welder and helped to erect the wind turbines around his hometown. He is in his second year in the course. His plans are to expand his direct marketing business he has with Birkshire hogs and poultry, plus add a welding business as an additional income source.\nJacque Rhodes, of Marshalltown, said she has no background in farming, except that she worked for three years for a nearby pork producer. She is hoping to eventually start a fish farm, possibly raising organic catfish. “You never hear of organic fish,” she said. “I hope there’s a market.”\nMary O’Dell, of Kellogg, lost her job, along with her husband, when the Maytag plant shut down in 2007. Although she owns no farm land, this city girl wants to raise pigs, goats, cattle and poultry “in a sustainable way,” she said. She hopes to sell her meat products locally. Her husband is taking courses in ag machinery repair and maintenance.\nAll have different backgrounds, but they share a common belief that sustainable agriculture is the farming method of the future. They believe in it and want to participate in it.\nSustainable agriculture is sometimes confused with natural farming or organic farming. Although it can include those, sustainable ag simply refers to the ability of a farm to produce farm products without causing severe or irreversible damage to ecosystem health.\nThe MCC course they are studying is part of a widespread local food initiative in Marshall County that includes encouraging people with a passion for producing nutritious food for local markets. Barnes’ course attempts to move them from desire to empowerment to pursue their food-producing goals.\nBarnes said there are three key components to the 10-subject curriculum. These include:\n- Issues of sustainable agriculture. This is key in understanding farming and how it relates to local food systems, Barnes explained.\n- Applied systems thinking. “This helps them to see the whole as a working system.” Barnes said that on her own farm, every asset has to serve three purposes “or else you aren’t integrated enough.” Our sheep fertilize the gardens, keep the grass down between the buildings and provide revenue from meat and tanned hides.”\nShe one Japanese farmer was known to cut his rice production inputs down by adding ducks, which fertilized the rice, ate rice-attacking insects and laid eggs which he sold. He later added fish, which kept nutrients stirred up, making for healthier rice and the fish were sold as well.\n“Every property and every system will be different,” Barnes said.\n- Internships. Students have a chance to work in an ag industry in which they are interested, seeing how different operations work in the field.\nCaite Grieshop, who is an Iowa volunteer coordinator for Heifer International, has a culinary arts background and said she wants to help people connect with the foods they eat. She hopes to eventually create a year-round farmers market, with an online format.\nShe said MCC’s course has helped her to see that successful food-growing systems start from the ground up. This includes learning that she can find soil profiles on her farm ground and understand why some crops grow better in some areas. “This will help me improve my production without trial and error,” Grieshop said.\n“I get my money’s worth here.”\nShe’s also learned that because she feed grass only to her sheep, she has traded some market weight in exchange for a lower feed bill – a trade she said she is happy to make.\nThe course includes visits from farmers who have switched to sustainable programs in some or all of their operations. Garrett Caryl said the guest presenters helped him understand how to raise his livestock without antibiotics, unless his animals are ill.\n“I don’t have organic livestock,” Caryl noted, “but I hope to work in some organic stock, too.”\nUnafraid of voicing his convictions, Caryl said he has considered raising livestock for natural food processors like Niman Ranch, based in San Francisco. “But I don’t think food should have to travel over 60 miles.” Selling locally, he added, “Burns fewer fossil fuels from producer to the plate.”\nCaryl and Grieshop agree that organic and natural food products are an easier sell to urban dwellers. “In the rural areas,” Caryl said, “you have to sell taste, not organic.”\nHe said he thinks it’s a reasonable expectation to accept a 10 percent yield drag with organic crop management, than by conventional farming techniques, but also expects that organic farming requires less input costs.\nWhen asked how he responds to the argument that the world would starve if all farmers went organic, he simply said, “I feel that organic farming can feed local people.”\nGrieshop also hopped onto the opinion wagon and said that America could revamp its health care system “if we all ate organically.” In addition, she’s convinced the world’s demand for corn cannot be met long term if it continues to be used for biofuels and corn syrup.\nMary O’Dell graduates from the two-year course in December and hopes to embark on her new career after losing her 14-year job at Maytag. “I want to grow sustainably and to sell (food) locally.”\nO’Dell said that since she was a child she wanted to work with animals. But her job with Maytag became “a trap,” she said, “because the pay was too good to quit.”\nHer inlaws, she added, are in their 70s and 80s and still farm. She sees agriculture as her new direction that will sustain her and her husband for years to come.\nThrough farm internships, and guest speakers, O’Dell said she has met many people “who have taught me what I have to do to get there.\n“And I like the idea of raising animals in a better way.” She defined her “better way” as producing meat animals, most likely swine, not in confinement buildings.\nThe students say they understand there is resistance in the Iowa farming culture for what they want to do.\n“It’s just a different way of doing things,” O’Dell said.\nThe best revenge against detractors, added Grieshop, “is to do it and make money at it.”\nContact Larry Kershner at (515)573-2141, ext. 453, or by e-mail at email@example.com.\nPlease Enter Your Facebook App ID.

{"question":"How did Japan's invasions of Korea in the 16th century compare to their 20th century occupation?","answer":"The 16th century Japanese invasion (1592) was a military campaign where Admiral Yi Sun-sin successfully defended Korea using innovative turtle ships (geobukseon), believed to be the world's first ironclad battleships. In contrast, Japan's 20th century occupation (1910-1945) was a complete colonial takeover that involved cultural suppression, including banning Korean-language education in schools. During this colonial period, Japan economically exploited Korea, and their assimilation policy led to widespread oppression, including the use of Korean women as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers. The colonial authorities tortured or murdered Koreans who resisted, and deliberately distorted Korean history. The colonial period ended only with Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945.","context":["- THREE KINGDOMS AND GAYA\n- UNIFIED SILLA AND BALHAE\n- KOREA EMPIRE\n- FOUNDING OF THE REPUBLIC\nPeople began living on the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding areas from some 700,000 years ago.\nThe Neolithic Age began some 8,000 years ago. Relics from that period can be found in areas throughout the Korean Peninsula, mostly in coastal areas and in areas near big rivers.\nThe Bronze Age began around 1,500 to 2,000 B.C. in present-day Mongolia and on the peninsula.\nAs this civilization began to form, numerous tribes appeared in the Lioaning region of Manchuria and in northwestern Korea. These tribes were ruled by leaders, whom Dangun, the legendary founder of the Korean people, later united to establish Gojoseon (2333 B.C.). The founding date is a testament to the longevity of Korea's history. This heritage is also a source of pride that provides Koreans the strength to persevere in times of adversity.\nThree Kingdoms and Gaya\nTown-states gradually united into tribal leagues with complex political structures which eventually grew into kingdoms. Among various tribal leagues, Goguryeo (37 B.C.- A.D. 668), situated along the middle course of the Amnokgang River (Yalu River), was the first to mature into a kingdom.\nGoguryeo's aggressive troops conquered neighboring tribes one after another, and in 313, they even occupied China's Lolang outposts.\nBaekje (18 B.C.-A.D. 660), which grew out of a town-state located south of the Hangang River in the vicinity of present-day Seoul, was another confederated kingdom similar to Goguryeo. During the reign of King Geunchogo (r. 346-375), Baekje developed into a centralized and aristocratic state.\nSilla (57 B.C.-A.D. 935) was located in the southeast corner of the peninsula and was initially the weakest and most underdeveloped of the three kingdoms.\nHowever, because it was geographically removed from Chinese influence, it was more open to non-Chinese practices and ideas. Its society was built on an advanced Buddhist order that was markedly class-oriented, including a military that featured a unique corps of young aristocratic warriors called Hwarang.\nGaya (42-562) began as a type of confederation, formed when several tribes from the Nakdonggang River came together.\nUnified Silla and Balhae\nBy the mid-sixth century, the Silla Kingdom had brought under its control all of the neighboring town-states within the Gaya Confederation.\nThrough an alliance with the Tang Dynasty of China, Silla unified the Korean Peninsula in 668 and saw the zenith of its power and prosperity in the mid-eighth century. It attempted to establish an ideal Buddhist country. Bulguksa Temple was constructed during the Unified Silla period. However, its Buddhist social order began to deteriorate as the nobility indulged in increasing luxury.\nSilla had repelled Tang attempts to subjugate Goguryeo and Baekje by 676. Then in 698, the former people of Goguryeo who resided in south-central Manchuria established the Kingdom of Balhae. Balhae included not only people of Goguryeo, but also a large Malgal population.\nBalhae established a government system centered around five regional capitals, which was modeled after the Goguryeo Kingdom's administrative structure. Balhae possessed an advanced culture which was rooted in that of Goguryeo.\nBalhae prosperity reached its height in the first half of the ninth century with the occupation of a vast territory reaching to the Amur River in the north and Kaiyuan in south-central Manchuria to the west. It also established diplomatic ties with Turkey and Japan. Balhae existed until 926, when it was overthrown by the Khitan. Many of the Balhae nobility, who were mostly Goguryeo descendants, moved south and joined the newly founded Goryeo Dynasty.\nThe Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) was founded by Wang Geon, a general who had served under Gungye, a rebel prince of the Silla Kingdom. Choosing his native town of Songak (present-day Gaeseong in North Korea) as the capital, Wang Geon proclaimed the goal of recovering the lost territory of the Goguryeo Kingdom in northeast China.\nWang Geon named his dynasty Goryeo, from which the modern name Korea is derived. Although the Goryeo Dynasty could not reclaim lost lands, it achieved a sophisticated culture represented by cheongja or blue-green celadon and flourishing Buddhist tradition.\nNo less significant was the invention of the world's first movable metal type in 1234, which preceded the Gutenberg Bible of Germany by two centuries. About that time, skilled Korean artisans also completed the herculean task of carving the entire Buddhist canon on large woodblocks.\nThese woodblocks, numbering more than 80,000, were intended to invoke the influence of Buddha for the repulsion of the Mongol invaders. Called the Tripitaka Koreana, they are now stored at the historic Haeinsa Temple.\nIn 1392, General Yi Seong-gye established a new dynasty called Joseon. The early rulers of Joseon, in order to counter the dominant Buddhist influence during the Goryeo period, supported Confucianism as the guiding philosophy of the kingdom.\nThe Joseon rulers governed the dynasty with a well-balanced political system. A civil service examination system was the main channel for recruiting government officials.\nThe examinations served as the backbone for social mobility and intellectual activity during the period. The Confucian-oriented society, however, highly valued academic learning while disdaining commerce and manufacturing.\nDuring the reign of King Sejong the Great (1418-1450), Joseon's fourth monarch, Korea enjoyed an unprecedented flowering of culture and art. Under King Sejong's guidance, scholars at the royal academy created the Korean alphabet Hangeul. It was then called Hunminjeongeum, or \"proper phonetic system to educate the people.\"\nKing Sejong's interest in astronomical science was comprehensive. Sundials, water clocks, celestial globes and astronomical maps were produced at his request. King Sejo (r.1455-1468) later established an institutional framework for government by publishing a compendium of legal codes, called Gyeongguk Daejeon.\nIn 1592, Japan invaded the peninsula to pave the way for its incursion into China. At sea, Admiral Yi Sun-sin (1545-1598), one of the most respected figures in Korean history, led a series of brilliant naval maneuvers against the Japanese, deploying the geobukseon (turtle ships), which are believed to be the world's first ironclad battleships.\nFrom the early 17th century, a movement advocating Silhak, or practical learning, gained considerable momentum among liberal-minded scholar-officials as a means of building a modern nation.\nThey strongly recommended agricultural and industrial improvements along with sweeping reforms in land distribution. The conservative government aristocrats, however, were not ready to accommodate such drastic change.\nIn the latter half of the Joseon era, government administration and the upper classes came to be marked by recurring factionalism. To rectify the undesirable political situation, King Yeongjo (r.1724-1776) eventually adopted a policy of impartiality. He was thus able to strengthen the royal authority and achieve political stability.\nKing Jeongjo (r.1776-1800) maintained the policy of impartiality and set up a royal library to preserve royal documents and records. He also initiated other political and cultural reforms. This period witnessed the blossoming of Silhak. A number of outstanding scholars wrote progressive works recommending agricultural and industrial reforms, but few of their ideas were adopted by the government.\nIn the 19th century, Korea remained a \"Hermit Kingdom,\" adamantly opposed to Western demands for diplomatic and trade relations. Over time, a few Asian and European countries with imperialistic ambitions competed with each other for influence over the Korean Peninsula.\nJapan, after winning wars against China and Russia, forcibly annexed Korea and instituted colonial rule in 1910.\nColonial rule stimulated the patriotism of Koreans. Korean intellectuals were infuriated by Japan's official assimilation policy, which even banned Korean-language education in Korean schools. On March 1, 1919, a peaceful demonstration calling for independence spread nationwide. The Japanese authorities ruthlessly repressed the demonstrators and their supporters, slaughtering thousands.\nAlthough it failed, the March 1 Independence Movement created strong bonds of national identity and patriotism among Koreans. The movement led to the establishment of a Provisional Government in Shanghai, China, as well as an organized armed struggle against the Japanese colonists in Manchuria. The Independence Movement is still commemorated among Koreans every March 1, which is designated a national holiday.\nDuring the colonial period, Japan's economic exploitation of Korea continued. The lives of Koreans deteriorated under colonial rule until the end of World War II in 1945.\nFounding of the Republic\nKoreans rejoiced at Japan's World War II defeat. However, their joy was short-lived. Liberation did not instantly bring about the independence for which the Koreans had fought so fiercely. Rather, it resulted in a country divided by ideological differences caused by the emerging Cold War. Korean efforts to establish an independent government were frustrated as U.S. forces occupied the southern half of the peninsula and Soviet troops took control of the north.\nIn November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that called for general elections in Korea under the supervision of a UN Commission.\nHowever, the Soviet Union refused to comply with the resolution and denied the UN Commission access to the northern half of Korea. The UN General Assembly then adopted another resolution calling for elections in areas accessible to its commission.\nThe first elections in Korea were carried out on May 10, 1948, in the areas south of the 38th parallel. This parallel came to divide the Korean Peninsula into South and North.\nRhee Syng-man was elected the first President of the Republic of Korea in 1948. Meanwhile, north of the 38th parallel, a communist regime was set up under the leadership of Kim Il-sung. On June 25, 1950, North Korea launched an unprovoked full-scale invasion of the South, triggering a three-year war which drew in U.S., Chinese and other foreign forces. The entire peninsula was devastated by the conflict. A cease-fire was signed in July 1953.\nKorea's growth-oriented, export-led economic development since the 1960s was so remarkable that it earned the expression \"the Miracle on the Hangang River\" in the 1970s. Subsequently, Seoul successfully hosted the 24th Olympics in 1988 and Korea co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan soccer finals with Japan. Through these occasions, Korea has demonstrated to the world its rich cultural heritage and love of art, as well as modern technologies. In the 1950s, Korea ranked among the poorest countries. Today, its economy is around the 13th largest in the world, and the nation is determined to become even more of a global economic leader throughout the new millennium.\nThe Republic of Korea has steadily followed the path to mature democracy and market economy. Even though the legacies of the Cold War still linger on this peninsula, Korea today is poised to make a new economic take-off. The Koreas are also working toward a durable structure of peace on the peninsula and promoting common prosperity for South and North Korea through peace, reconciliation and cooperation.","Gojoseon, the first official kingdom of Korea, is most commonly believed to have been founded in 2,333 BC by Dangun Wanggeom, who is depicted as the grandson of Hwanin, the “Lord of Heaven.” A legend says his mother turned from a bear into a woman after surviving a hundred days on garlic and mugwort without sunlight. Gojoseon covered all of Korea and much of Liaoning, China, and Manchuria. With the fall of Gojoseon emerged the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje, established in 37 BC, 57 BC, and 18 BC, respectively. Silla and Baekje were located in South Korea and Goguryeo in North Korea of today. The three kingdoms, covering the entire Korean peninsula in addition to China and Russia, were significantly influenced by China and its culture and continued to battle one another for dominance over the nation of Korea. Goguryeo and Baekje took over most of the era, stopping multiple Chinese invasions along the way. However, Silla steadily rose in power and eventually overthrew the other two kingdoms, giving birth to the Unified Silla in 668 AD. This new dynasty lasted 267 years prior to King Gyeongsun’s submission to Goryeo in 935; a warlord by the name of Taejo Wang Geon defeated his rival and became ruler of the succeeding Goryeo Dynasty, from where the name “Korea” derives. This era introduced legitimate laws and a civil service system, and, with the impact of China, Buddhism became Korea’s predominant religion. In the thirteenth century, the Mongol Empire invaded Goryeo six times and overruled Goryeo for approximately eighty years, but Goryeo regained independence in 1350.\nBaekje vs. Silla\nGeneral Yi Seong-gye, or King Taejo, conquered Goryeo and became king, beginning the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. The king moved the capital to Hanseong, the present-day Seoul. Joseon held the entire Korean peninsula, but because Korea carried the impact of China and its culture, Koreans mainly remained Buddhists and abided by the teachings of Confucianism until missionaries from Europe came over and spread Christianity. In 1443, King Sejong created Hangul, the Korean alphabet; previously, Koreans wrote in modified Chinese characters, still taught in Korean schools today. Japan invaded Korea between 1592 and 1598; Admiral Yi Sun-sin, although killed at the end of the war, led Korea and pushed away the force of Japan. In the 1620s and 1630s, the Manchu Qing Dynasty invaded Joseon numerous times.\nTo this day, Korea, excluding North Korea of today, has never been the instigator of any battle. This 5,000-year history of Korea’s constantly being invaded yet preserving independence and the country’s own identity proves the persistence and pride of Korean ancestors. After Japan triumphed in both the First Sino-Japanese War from 1894 to 1895 and the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905 for control over Korea, the Japanese invasion of Korea became inevitable; Japan annexed Korea from 1910 to 1945. During this time, Koreans were banned from speaking Korean or even learning about Korea, and Korean history became deliberately distorted. Whatever Koreans did had to be under the Japanese flag, and tens of thousands of Korean women were used as sex slaves to Japanese soldiers. The regime tortured or even murdered courageous Koreans who retaliated.\nPrior to the intrusion, as Japan’s seizing Korea became apparent, many Korean families who lost hope immigrated to other parts of the world for a chance to lead greater lives and opportunities. Simultaneously, patriotic Korean men moved to mostly nearby countries to prepare a rebellion against and bring independence back to Korea from Japan. A handful immigrated to Kearney, Nebraska, to receive education and military training. This group of Korean nationalists worked as houseboys in exchange for room and board. In 1908, Yong-man Park, a renowned name in the Korean independence movement, enrolled in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps while studying political and military science at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. On a farm roughly a mile west of the Buffalo County Courthouse in Kearney, Park established The Young Korean Military School in June 1909, four years after the foundation of the Nebraska State Normal School at Kearney. This military school offered courses in English, Korean, history, and agriculture and military training to nationalistic Koreans willing to fight for the preservation of their roots. Hastings College, where Park went to school temporarily, lent him additional twenty acres of farm on which to train his student-soldiers.\nPark met South Korea’s eventual first president, Syngman Rhee, in imprisonment, fighting for political reform. Park accepted an editor position for the Korean National Association in San Francisco, California, and asked Rhee to take over the military school. Rhee was pessimistic about Korea’s chances of escaping the Japanese colony and abandoned the school, which led to the school’s closing in 1915. Park was murdered on October 17th, 1928, in Tianjin, China. Henry Chung, another protagonist of this journey, attended Kearney High School and graduated from the Nebraska State Normal School at Kearney in 1914 with a degree in political science. He briefly partook in Park’s military school but primarily focused on academics. Ironically, he served as ambassador to Japan under Rhee’s presidency. Chur-hoo Park, a cum laude student out of the Nebraska State Normal School at Kearney, taught at Chosun Christian College upon his return to Seoul, South Korea. Ilhan New, the most respected businessman in Korea to date, immigrated to Kearney in 1904 at the age of nine from Pyongyang, North Korea. He enrolled in Park’s military school in 1909 and learned the history and mentality of Korean ancestors. He established La Choy Food Products in 1922 and the Yuhan Corporation in 1926 under the belief “only healthy citizens can seek sovereignty.” The latter company became the first to work for the benefit of all Korean citizens rather than its own.\n“The past is never dead. It’s not even past,” said William Faulkner. These ancestors may be gone physically, but their influence lives on. The freedom in which South Koreans live testifies to this; we breathe and taste independence because of the unconditional sacrifice of our ancestors for our future. Will we take pride and keep their legacy in the present or push this pivotal chapter back into a dusty past?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:41003c88-2e76-4291-916e-b26ab702b53f>","<urn:uuid:4dd2dc18-f473-44d8-9a63-e433039af19d>"],"error":null}

These tests simulate the forces that a rattle may experience during normal use and abuse by children 0-18 months of age. If the rattle or any piece that comes off after this testing fits through the opening, the rattle fails.\nAre there any other requirements for rattles?\nWhat are the additional requirements for rattles required by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008?\nRattles are subject to surface coating requirements, lead and phthalate content limits, requirements under the mandatory toy standard (ASTM F963), testing and certification, and tracking label requirements. These requirements are discussed below and at www.cpsc.gov/BusinessEducation:\n- Surface Coating Limit Rattles may not be painted with paint that contains more than 0.009 percent lead.\n- Lead Content Limit Rattles cannot contain greater than 100 ppm (0.01 percent) of total lead content in any accessible component part.\n- F963 Toy Standard Under ASTM F 963, neither the noisemaking part, nor the handle of a rattle, should end in a ball, half ball, or circular flare that may choke a child. If an end shaped like this goes all the way through the opening of the supplemental test fixture, the rattle may present a choking hazard.\nFigure 2 - Rattle Supplemental Test Fixture\n- Phthalate Content Limits Plasticized components of rattles must not contain more than 0.1 percent of the following eight specified phthalates: di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), di-n-pentyl phthalate (DPENP), di-n-hexyl phthalate (DHEXP), and dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP).\n- Testing and Certification Rattles, like all products that are designed or intended primarily intended for children 12 years of age or younger, must be tested by an accredited and CPSC-accepted, third party laboratory for compliance with the rattle regulation and all other applicable children's product safety rules. Based on that testing, a domestic manufacturer (or importer) of rattles must issue a Children's Product Certificate specifying each applicable rule and indicating that the product complies with those rules.\n- Tracking Labels Rattles must have a tracking label or other distinguishing permanent mark affixed to the product and its packaging. The tracking label shall be a permanent distinguishing mark on the product and its packaging, to the extent practicable, and must contain certain basic information, including the source of the product, the date of manufacture, and cohort information such as a batch or run number.\nWhere can I find additional information?\nFor more information on the requirements for rattles, contact the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission:\n- Office of Compliance (for specific enforcement inquires): e-mail: firstname.lastname@example.org; telephone: (800) 638-2772\n- Small Business Ombudsman (for general assistance understanding and complying with CPSC regulations): e-mail: Please use our Contact Form, which is the best way to get a fast response; telephone: (888) 531-9070.\nThis communication has been prepared for general informational purposes only.

{"question":"How do the GATT's approach to tariff reduction and UNCTAD's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) differ in their impact on developing countries?","answer":"The GATT and UNCTAD's GSP had different approaches to helping developing countries. GATT focused on general tariff reductions among all member countries, reducing average tariffs from 40% to about 5% for industrial countries. In contrast, UNCTAD's GSP was specifically designed to help developing countries by allowing their manufactured exports and some agricultural goods to enter developed countries duty-free or at reduced rates, while imports from other developed countries remained subject to normal duty rates, giving developing countries a competitive advantage.","context":["United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\nThe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) (French Conférence des Nations unies sur le Commerce et le Développement (CNUCED)) was established in 1964 as a permanent intergovernmental body.\nUNCTAD is the principal organ of the United Nations General Assembly dealing with trade, investment, and development issues. The organization's goals are to: \"maximize the trade, investment and development opportunities of developing countries and assist them in their efforts to integrate into the world economy on an equitable basis.\"\nThe primary objective of UNCTAD is to formulate policies relating to all aspects of development including trade, aid, transport, finance and technology. The conference ordinarily meets once in four years; the permanent secretariat is in Geneva.\nOne of the principal achievements of UNCTAD has been to conceive and implement the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). It was argued in UNCTAD that to promote exports of manufactured goods from developing countries, it would be necessary to offer special tariff concessions to such exports. Accepting this argument, the developed countries formulated the GSP scheme under which manufacturers' exports and some agricultural goods from the developing countries enter duty-free or at reduced rates in the developed countries. Since imports of such items from other developed countries are subject to the normal rates of duties, imports of the same items from developing countries would enjoy a competitive advantage.\nThe creation of UNCTAD in 1964 was based on concerns of developing countries over the international market, multi-national corporations, and great disparity between developed nations and developing nations. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was established to provide a forum where the developing countries could discuss the problems relating to their economic development. The organisation grew from the view that existing institutions like GATT (now replaced by the World Trade Organization, WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of developing countries. Later, in the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD was closely associated with the idea of a New International Economic Order (NIEO).\nThe first UNCTAD conference took place in Geneva in 1964, the second in New Delhi in 1968, the third in Santiago in 1972, fourth in Nairobi in 1976, the fifth in Manila in 1979, the sixth in Belgrade in 1983, the seventh in Geneva in 1987, the eighth in Cartagena in 1992, the ninth at Johannesburg (South Africa) in 1996, the tenth in Bangkok (Thailand) in 2000, the eleventh in São Paulo (Brazil) in 2004, the twelfth in Accra in 2008 and the thirteenth in Doha (Qatar) in 2012.\nCurrently, UNCTAD has 194 member states and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. UNCTAD has 400 staff members and a bi-annual (2010–2011) regular budget of $138 million in core expenditures and $72 million in extra-budgetary technical assistance funds. It is a member of the United Nations Development Group. There are non-governmental organizations participating in the activities of UNCTAD.\nAs of October 2012, 194 states are UNCTAD members: all UN members and the Holy See. UNCTAD members are divided into four lists, the division being based on United Nations Regional Groups with six members unassigned: Armenia, Kiribati, Nauru, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tuvalu. List A consists mostly of countries in the African and Asia-Pacific Groups of the UN. List B consists of countries of the Western European and Others Group. List C consists of countries of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States (GRULAC). List D consists of countries of the Eastern European Group.\nThe lists, originally defined in 19th General Assembly resolution 1995 serve to balance geographical distribution of member states' representation on the Trade Development Board and other UNCTAD structures. The lists are similar to those of UNIDO, an UN specialized agency.\nThe full lists are as follows:\n- List A (100 members): Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi , Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, Micronesia, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Qatar, South Korea, Rwanda, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\n- List B (31 members): Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holy See, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States.\n- List C (33 members): Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela.\n- List D (24 members): Albania, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.\n- Not assigned countries (6 members): Armenia, Kiribati, Nauru, South Sudan, Tajikistan, Tuvalu.\nThe inter-governmental work is done at five levels of meetings:\n- The UNCTAD Conference – held every four years:\n- UNCTAD VIII in Cartagena, Colombia on 8–25 February 1992\n- UNCTAD IX in Midrand, South Africa on 27 April – 11 May 1996\n- UNCTAD X in Bangkok, Thailand on 12–19 February 2000\n- UNCTAD XI in São Paulo, Brazil on 13–18 June 2004\n- UNCTAD XII in Accra, Ghana on 21–25 April 2008\n- UNCTAD XIII in Doha, Qatar on 21–26 April 2012\n- The UNCTAD Trade and Development Board – the Board manages the work of UNCTAD between two conferences and meets up to three times every year;\n- Four UNCTAD Commissions and one Working Party – these meet more often than the Board to take up policy, programme and budgetary issues;\n- Expert Meetings – the commissions will convene expert meetings on selected topics to provide substantive and expert input for Commission policy discussions.\nIn response to developing country (Least Developed Country, LDC) anxiety at their worsening position in world trade, the United Nations General Assembly voted for a 'one off' conference. These early discussions paved the way for new IMF facilities to provide finance for shortfalls in commodity earnings and for the Generalised Preference Schemes which increased access to Northern markets for manufactured imports from the South. At Geneva, the LDCs were successful in their proposal for the conference with its Secretariat to become a permanent organ of the UN, with meetings every four years.\nNew Delhi, 1968\nThe New Delhi Conference, held in February and March 1968, was a forum that allowed developing countries to reach agreement on basic principles of their development policies. The conference in New Delhi was an opportunity for schemes to be finally approved. The conference provided a major impetus in persuading the North to follow up UNCTAD I resolutions, in establishing generalised preferences. The target for private and official flows to LDCs was raised to 1% of the North's GNP, but the developed countries failed to commit themselves to achieving the target by a specific date. This has proven a continuing point of debate at UNCTAD conferences.\nThe Santiago Conference, April 15, 1972, was the third occasion on which the developing countries have confronted the rich with the need to use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.\nNairobi, 1976 and Manila, 1979\nUNCTAD IV held in Nairobi May 1976, showed relative success compared to its predecessors. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper of April 1979 highlights one reason for success as being down to the 1973 Oil Crisis and the encouragement of LDCs to make gains through producers of other commodities. The principal result of the conference was the adoption of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. The programme covered the principal commodity exports and its objectives aside from the stabilisation of commodity prices were: 'Just and remunerative pricing, taking into account world inflation', the expansion of processing, distribution and control of technology by LDCs and improved access to markets.\nUNCTAD V in the wake of the Nairobi Conference, held in Manila 1979 focused on the key issues of: protectionism in developing countries and the need for structural change, trade in commodities and manufactures aid and international monetary reform,technology, shipping, and economic co-operation among developing countries. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper written in 1979 focuses its attention on the key issues regarding the LDCs` role as the Group of 77 in the international community.\nThe sixth UN conference on trade and development in Belgrade, 6–30 June 1983 was held against the background of earlier UNCTADs which have substantially failed to resolve many of the disagreements between the developed and developing countries and of a world economy in its worst recession since the early 1930s. The key issues of the time were finance and adjustment, commodity price stabilisation and trade.\nUNCTAD produces a number of topical reports, including:\n- The Trade and Development Report \n- The Trade and Environment Review \n- The World Investment Report \n- The Economic Development in Africa Report \n- The Least Developed Countries Report \n- UNCTAD Statistics \n- The Information Economy Report \n- The Review of Maritime Transport \n- The International Accounting and Reporting Issues Annual Review \n- The Technology and Innovation Report \nIn addition, UNCTAD conducts certain technical cooperation in collaboration with the World Trade Organization through the joint International Trade Centre (ITC), a technical cooperation agency targeting operational and enterprise-oriented aspects of trade development.\nUNCTAD is a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative along with the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), and the UN Global Compact.\nList of Secretaries-General and Officers-in-Charge\n1 September 2013.\n- International trade\n- Foreign direct investment\n- List of countries by received FDI\n- Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries (GSTP)\n- United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection\n- from official website\n- Membership of UNCTAD and membership of the Trade and Development Board\n- \"UNCTAD VI: background and issues\".

Irwin\nEver since Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations in 1776, the vast majority of economists have accepted the proposition that free trade among nations improves overall economic welfare. Free trade, usually defined as the absence of tariffs, quotas, or other governmental impediments to international trade, allows each country to specialize in the goods it can produce cheaply and efficiently relative to other countries. Such specialization enables all countries to achieve higher real incomes.\nAlthough free trade provides overall benefits, removing a trade barrier on a particular good hurts the shareholders and employees of the domestic industry that produces that good. Some of the groups that are hurt by foreign competition wield enough political power to obtain protection against imports. Consequently, barriers to trade continue to exist despite their sizable economic costs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, for example, the U.S. gain from removing trade restrictions on textiles and apparel would have been almost twelve billion dollars in 2002 alone. This is a net economic gain after deducting the losses to firms and workers in the domestic industry. Yet, domestic textile producers have been able to persuade Congress to maintain tight restrictions on imports.\nWhile virtually all economists think free trade is desirable, they differ on how best to make the transition from tariffs and quotas to free trade. The three basic approaches to trade reform are unilateral, multilateral, and bilateral.\nSome countries, such as Britain in the nineteenth century and Chile and China in recent decades, have undertaken unilateral tariff reductions—reductions made independently and without reciprocal action by other countries. The advantage of unilateral free trade is that a country can reap the benefits of free trade immediately. Countries that lower trade barriers by themselves do not have to postpone reform while they try to persuade other nations to follow suit. The gains from such trade liberalization are substantial: several studies have shown that income grows more rapidly in countries open to international trade than in those more closed to trade. Dramatic illustrations of this phenomenon include China’s rapid growth after 1978 and India’s after 1991, those dates indicating when major trade reforms took place.\nFor many countries, unilateral reforms are the only effective way to reduce domestic trade barriers. However, multilateral and bilateral approaches—dismantling trade barriers in concert with other countries—have two advantages over unilateral approaches. First, the economic gains from international trade are reinforced and enhanced when many countries or regions agree to a mutual reduction in trade barriers. By broadening markets, concerted liberalization of trade increases competition and specialization among countries, thus giving a bigger boost to efficiency and consumer incomes.\nSecond, multilateral reductions in trade barriers may reduce political opposition to free trade in each of the countries involved. That is because groups that otherwise would oppose or be indifferent to trade reform might join the campaign for free trade if they see opportunities for exporting to the other countries in the trade agreement. Consequently, free trade agreements between countries or regions are a useful strategy for liberalizing world trade.\nThe best possible outcome of trade negotiations is a multilateral agreement that includes all major trading countries. Then, free trade is widened to allow many participants to achieve the greatest possible gains from trade. After World War II, the United States helped found the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which quickly became the world’s most important multilateral trade arrangement.\nThe major countries of the world set up the GATT in reaction to the waves of protectionism that crippled world trade during—and helped extend—the Great Depression of the 1930s. In successive negotiating “rounds,” the GATT substantially reduced the tariff barriers on manufactured goods in the industrial countries. Since the GATT began in 1947, average tariffs set by industrial countries have fallen from about 40 percent to about 5 percent today. These tariff reductions helped promote the tremendous expansion of world trade after World War II and the concomitant rise in real per capita incomes among developed and developing nations alike. The annual gain from removal of tariff and nontariff barriers to trade as a result of the Uruguay Round Agreement (negotiated under the auspices of the GATT between 1986 and 1993) has been put at about $96 billion, or 0.4 percent of world GDP.\nIn 1995, the GATT became the World Trade Organization (WTO), which now has more than 140 member countries. The WTO oversees four international trade agreements: the GATT, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and agreements on trade-related intellectual property rights and trade-related investment (TRIPS and TRIMS, respectively). The WTO is now the forum for members to negotiate reductions in trade barriers; the most recent forum is the Doha Development Round, launched in 2001.\nThe WTO also mediates disputes between member countries over trade matters. If one country’s government accuses another country’s government of violating world trade rules, a WTO panel rules on the dispute. (The panel’s ruling can be appealed to an appellate body.) If the WTO finds that a member country’s government has not complied with the agreements it signed, the member is obligated to change its policy and bring it into conformity with the rules. If the member finds it politically impossible to change its policy, it can offer compensation to other countries in the form of lower trade barriers on other goods. If it chooses not to do this, then other countries can receive authorization from the WTO to impose higher duties (i.e., to “retaliate”) on goods coming from the offending member country for its failure to comply.\nAs a multilateral trade agreement, the GATT requires its signatories to extend most-favored-nation (MFN) status to other trading partners participating in the WTO. MFN status means that each WTO member receives the same tariff treatment for its goods in foreign markets as that extended to the “most-favored” country competing in the same market, thereby ruling out preferences for, or discrimination against, any member country.\nAlthough the WTO embodies the principle of nondiscrimination in international trade, article 24 of the GATT permits the formation of free-trade areas and “customs unions” among WTO members. A free-trade area is a group of countries that eliminate all tariffs on trade with each other but retain autonomy in determining their tariffs with nonmembers. A customs union is a group of countries that eliminate all tariffs on trade among themselves but maintain a common external tariff on trade with countries outside the union (thus technically violating MFN).\nThe customs union exception was designed, in part, to accommodate the formation of the European Economic Community (EC) in 1958. The EC, originally formed by six European countries, is now known as the european union (EU) and includes twenty-seven European countries. The EU has gone beyond simply reducing barriers to trade among member states and forming a customs union. It has moved toward even greater economic integration by becoming a common market—an arrangement that eliminates impediments to the mobility of factors of production, such as capital and labor, between participating countries. As a common market, the EU also coordinates and harmonizes each country’s tax, industrial, and agricultural policies. In addition, many members of the EU have formed a single currency area by replacing their domestic currencies with the euro.\nThe GATT also permits free-trade areas (FTAs), such as the European Free Trade Area, which is composed primarily of Scandinavian countries. Members of FTAs eliminate tariffs on trade with each other but retain autonomy in determining their tariffs with nonmembers.\nOne difficulty with the WTO system has been the problem of maintaining and extending the liberal world trading system in recent years. Multilateral negotiations over trade liberalization move very slowly, and the requirement for consensus among the WTO’s many members limits how far agreements on trade reform can go. As Mike Moore, a recent director-general of the WTO, put it, the organization is like a car with one accelerator and 140 hand brakes. While multilateral efforts have successfully reduced tariffs on industrial goods, it has had much less success in liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles, and apparel, and in other areas of international commerce. Recent negotiations, such as the Doha Development Round, have run into problems, and their ultimate success is uncertain.\nAs a result, many countries have turned away from the multilateral process toward bilateral or regional trade agreements. One such agreement is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which went into effect in January 1994. Under the terms of NAFTA, the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed to phase out all tariffs on merchandise trade and to reduce restrictions on trade in services and foreign investment over a decade. The United States also has bilateral agreements with Israel, Jordan, Singapore, and Australia and is negotiating bilateral or regional trade agreements with countries in Latin America, Asia, and the Pacific. The European Union also has free-trade agreements with other countries around the world.\nThe advantage of such bilateral or regional arrangements is that they promote greater trade among the parties to the agreement. They may also hasten global trade liberalization if multilateral negotiations run into difficulties. Recalcitrant countries excluded from bilateral agreements, and hence not sharing in the increased trade these bring, may then be induced to join and reduce their own barriers to trade. Proponents of these agreements have called this process “competitive liberalization,” wherein countries are challenged to reduce trade barriers to keep up with other countries. For example, shortly after NAFTA was implemented, the EU sought and eventually signed a free-trade agreement with Mexico to ensure that European goods would not be at a competitive disadvantage in the Mexican market as a result of NAFTA.\nBut these advantages must be offset against a disadvantage: by excluding certain countries, these agreements may shift the composition of trade from low-cost countries that are not party to the agreement to high-cost countries that are.\nSuppose, for example, that Japan sells bicycles for fifty dollars, Mexico sells them for sixty dollars, and both face a twenty-dollar U.S. tariff. If tariffs are eliminated on Mexican goods, U.S. consumers will shift their purchases from Japanese to Mexican bicycles. The result is that Americans will purchase from a higher-cost source, and the U.S. government receives no tariff revenue. Consumers save ten dollars per bicycle, but the government loses twenty dollars. Economists have shown that if a country enters such a “trade-diverting” customs union, the cost of this trade diversion may exceed the benefits of increased trade with the other members of the customs union. The net result is that the customs union could make the country worse off.\nCritics of bilateral and regional approaches to trade liberalization have many additional arguments. They suggest that these approaches may undermine and supplant, instead of support and complement, the multilateral WTO approach, which is to be preferred for operating globally on a nondiscriminatory basis. Hence, the long-term result of bilateralism could be a deterioration of the world trading system into competing, discriminatory regional trading blocs, resulting in added complexity that complicates the smooth flow of goods between countries. Furthermore, the reform of such issues as agricultural export subsidies cannot be dealt with effectively at the bilateral or regional level.\nDespite possible tensions between the two approaches, it appears that both multilateral and bilateral/regional trade agreements will remain features of the world economy. Both the WTO and agreements such as NAFTA, however, have become controversial among groups such as antiglobalization protesters, who argue that such agreements serve the interests of multinational corporations and not workers, even though freer trade has been a time-proven method of improving economic performance and raising overall incomes. To accommodate this opposition, there has been pressure to include labor and environmental standards in these trade agreements. Labor standards include provisions for minimum wages and working conditions, while environmental standards would prevent trade if environmental damage was feared.\nOne motivation for such standards is the fear that unrestricted trade will lead to a “race to the bottom” in labor and environmental standards as multinationals search the globe for low wages and lax environmental regulations in order to cut costs. Yet there is no empirical evidence of any such race. Indeed, trade usually involves the transfer of technology to developing countries, which allows wage rates to rise, as Korea’s economy—among many others—has demonstrated since the 1960s. In addition, rising incomes allow cleaner production technologies to become affordable. The replacement of pollution-belching domestically produced scooters in India with imported scooters from Japan, for example, would improve air quality in India.\nand environmentalists in rich countries have most actively sought labor and environmental standards. The danger is that enforcing such standards may simply become an excuse for rich-country protectionism, which would harm workers in poor countries. Indeed, people in poor countries, whether capitalists or laborers, have been extremely hostile to the imposition of such standards. For example, the 1999 WTO meeting in Seattle collapsed in part because developing countries objected to the Clinton administration’s attempt to include labor standards in multilateral agreements.\nA safe prediction is that international trade agreements will continue to generate controversy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d71f517d-d76a-4e1e-b046-c59530e55487>","<urn:uuid:9ccebd54-323f-4615-8d0b-f2da394c4a00>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a policy researcher studying international development, I'd like to understand how participatory development compares with the capability approach in terms of their effectiveness. What are the key differences?","answer":"Participatory development emphasizes local engagement in development decisions but has been criticized for inadequately addressing power dynamics and often equating basic consultation with true participation. It can deepen exclusion of certain groups without explicit inclusion efforts and sometimes perpetuates the myth that communities can achieve development solely through mobilization. The capability approach, in contrast, focuses on expanding people's actual freedoms and abilities to achieve the lives they value. It explicitly recognizes the role of institutions, governance structures, and political factors in development outcomes. While participatory development can fall into an apolitical, neoliberal framework that removes the state from consideration, the capability approach acknowledges that individual freedom requires social commitment and institutional support to be meaningful.","context":["Resilience is a concept that has gained popularity across many disciplines during the past decade. Resilience refers to the capacity of an individual or system to recover from or adapt to shocks or other changes. The idea originated in studies of ecology, but is increasing utilized to understand human systems. In a world beset by crises ranging from natural disasters to financial collapse to armed conflict, the concept of resilience is critical to understanding how communities and groups respond to traumatic changes.\nAmong the practitioners integrating the idea of resilience into their work are those in the international development profession. Many aid organizations seek to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and communities to famine, climate change and other shocks and crises that affect populations in numerous parts of the world. Development agencies are increasingly describing their work in this are in terms of strengthening the resilience of vulnerable groups. However, this turn towards resilience is not without its challenges. Notable among these is the need to adopt an understanding of resilience that considers the political dimensions of the concept. If development practitioners fail to address the political nature of resilience, their work in this area may lead to disappointing outcomes.\nThe Perils of Development ‘Fads’\nAs noted, the idea of resilience is being increasingly utilized in the field of international development. In this regard, it is increasingly becoming the latest in a line of popularized concepts, such as social capital, empowerment, and participatory development. Each of these ideas came to the fore in development circles and was widely adopted by aid organizations, only to recede as the next ‘fad’ took hold. Individually and together, these concepts had the potential to transform development practice by focusing attention on the relationships and networks of power and inequality that undergird chronic poverty (see Mosse, 2010). Yet social capital, empowerment and participatory development were each criticized for the manner in which they were applied by development practitioners, absent sufficient consideration of issues of power and politics (Cooke & Kothari, 2001; Fine, 1999; Rowlands, 1995).\nCritics have particularly scrutinized the application of the idea of participatory development, the simple, yet seemingly radical notion that local individuals and groups should be engaged meaningfully in development decisions and processes that affect them. Scholars pointed out that participatory development, as conceptualized and applied, was riddled with assumptions about the power dynamics of groups, communities and households (Cleaver, 2004). Furthermore, critics noted that development practitioners often equated consulting local people with participation, ignoring who was excluded, how individuals exercised voice, what previous ‘agenda setting’ had occurred, among other issues. As Andrea Cornwall notes,\n“‘participatory’ processes can serve to deepen the exclusion of particular groups unless explicit efforts are made to include them…. Without a dynamic understanding of people’s social networks and the institutions and dimensions of difference that matter in the pursuit of their livelihoods, naıve efforts to bring about inclusive development may simply make things worse (2008, pp. 277, 279).”\nFurthermore, other scholars have argued that the use of the concepts of social capital, empowerment and participatory development (and likely resilience) by development agencies has led to a misconception of the role of communities in development:\nDevelopment practitioners excel in perpetuating the myth that communities are capable of anything, that all that is required is sufficient mobilization…and the latent capacities of the community will be unleashed in the interests of development (Cleaver, 2001, p. 46).\nAccording to this (mistaken) logic, participatory methodologies can empower individuals and communities to drive their own development processes. Absent from this conceptualization is any role for the state, as development is defined as a community-driven and -owned process. In removing the state from the equation, this understanding of development falls into an essentially neo-liberal framework and is devoid of political considerations regarding inequality, rights, control of resources and distribution of decision-making power.\nThis vision of development as an apolitical process has long been embedded in the approaches of many development institutions, despite a more recent rhetorical acceptance of the role of politics (Carothers & De Gramont, 2013). Indeed, the message about the centrality of politics in development has been growing clearer, as the following quote from a United Kingdom Department for International Development research report demonstrates:\n“To understand development we must understand the politics that shape it. …The key message from all four research programmes has been the centrality of politics in building effective states and shaping development outcomes (Department for International Development, 2010).”\nYet despite an increasing acknowledgement that ‘politics matters’, aid organizations struggle to adapt their procedures and technocratic approaches to this reality.\nResilience could fall into the same trap and become locked into an apolitical, and likely, neo-liberal mold, lionizing the resilient, empowered community unreliant on state institutions or on broader structural reforms to address development needs. This possibility is highlighted by one group of scholars investigating the increasing use of idea of resilience in development:\n“…resilience approach is not particularly well equipped to embrace these social issues of agency and power. … [by utilizing] a resilience framework, there is therefore a risk to move back to technical, apolitical interpretations and solutions with the consequence to ‘evacuate’ the social justice/transformative dimension (Bene, Godfrey Wood, Newsham, & Davies, 2012, p. 28).”\nThus, the idea of resilience risks falling into the mold of previous development concepts and being applied without incorporating political considerations. This could lead to interventions by development agencies that fail to fully address the vulnerabilities faced by those communities aid practitioners seek to support.\nResilience is political.\nWhen natural disasters or armed conflicts strike, poor communities (and rich ones, for that matter, as “Superstorm” Sandy made clear in the United States) cannot adapt and “bounce back” on their own, they require the support of public institutions. Amatya Sen famously argued that famines do not occur in democracies, not because communities in democratic countries are more resilient to famine, but rather because a free press and political competition oblige governments to mobilize public institutions to support famine-struck areas (Sen, 1999). Yet in many countries around the world, democracy is partial, and public institutions are weak and corrupt. Strengthening democratic governance and state institutions is not primarily an issue of achieving proper institutional forms or building technical capacity, rather it is an intensely political process, one involving elites, coalitions, contestation, and the long road to reform (Leftwich & Sen, 2010).\nSome streams of the discourse on promoting resilience makes it clear that governance is a critical element of resilience. According to the U.S. Agency for International Development’s policy on resilience:\n“Functioning institutions of good governance and democratic accountability are also essential, as building resilient countries and systems requires effective and inclusive governments that hold themselves accountable for results (2012, p. 5).”\nDiane Davis, in her investigation of resilience in situations of chronic violence, makes governance even more central to resilience. In her formulation:\n“…resilience appears at the interface of citizen and state action, and is strengthened through cooperation within and between communities and governing authorities…. citizens…and governing authorities establish institutional networks of accountability that tie them to each other at the level of the community….activities produced through citizen-state networks are most accountable, legitimate, and durable when they are directed and monitored by communities themselves, in a relationship of cooperative autonomy (2012, p. 9).”\nThus, resilience is a product of good governance, of constructive and mutually-accountable relationships between citizens and state actors. However, just as with building strong public-sector institutions, strengthening relationships between vulnerable communities and the state is an inherently political process. Indeed, those communities that are most impacted by trauma or crisis are the same communities that are often politically marginalized, and thus have relationships with political authorities marked by clientelism, disenfranchisement and/or indifference. In the case of Davis’ discussion of chronic violence, she investigates this phenomenon primarily in poor urban neighborhoods, yet in communities such as these relationships with government actors are most often marked by networks of patronage and vote buying, rather than mutual accountability (Desai, 2010).\nDevelopment agencies and practitioners interested in promoting resilience must then focus on strengthening accountable and inclusive governance frameworks in which vulnerable communities are embedded. Yet even as governance has emerged as a prominent area of intervention for aid agencies, practitioners have been slow to understand the political drivers of poor governance and slower still to incorporate politically-informed practices into their programs. Sue Unsworth has proposed three mutually reinforcing barriers that prevent the integration of political considerations:\n- Getting people to take politics seriously requires them to change their existing mental models of how development happens;\n- Institutional incentives within aid agencies and development NGOs that reinforce the status quo;\n- Political analysis highlights the stark reality that there may be very limited local ownership of a development agenda (2009, p. 889).\nAlthough some progress has been made in incorporating politics into development work, primarily through the growing popularity political economy analyses, politically informed development practice is still the exception rather than the rule (Carothers & De Gramont, 2013).\nThere is an additional danger that in their rush to promote resilient communities, development agencies will displace their true purpose: combating poverty. Strengthening resilience should not be conflated with efforts to address poverty, for:\n“there is no relation between poverty alleviation and resilience building. Resilience is poor-neutral; in other words, it is not a pro-poor concept; nothing in it makes it specifically linked to the poor (except perhaps that the poor are often presented/assumed to be more vulnerable, or less resilient, than others). And this last assumption is exactly where the concept of resilience starts falling apart. Indeed, in contrary to what people seem to believe, households can be very poor and very resilient. … This means that the whole discourse about how it is important to build resilience as a tool for poverty alleviation is flawed: there is no direct and obvious way out of poverty through resilience. Ultimately, development should therefore remain about poverty alleviation and wellbeing, not about resilience building (Bene, et al., 2012, p. 48).”\nThus, the trend towards a focus on strengthening resilience may likely mean that development agencies (likely unintentionally) de-emphasize combating poverty. Yet this does not have to be the case. Promoting resilience and addressing poverty both require tackling governance and political issues. Strengthening resilience by promoting strong public institutions and accountable governments would advance poverty reduction goals as well. Yet if development agencies and practitioners are to achieve real gains in these areas, they will have to adopt politically-informed analyses and approaches.\nIn sum, resilience depends critically on capable public institutions and inclusive and accountable governance. The processes of strengthening state institutions and democratic governance are inherently political. After several decades of highlighting the importance of governance, development agencies are still struggling to come to terms with the political nature of this concept and to move towards politically-informed interventions to strengthen governance. If aid providers have been slow to incorporate politics at the heart of their governance work (and their development work more generally), it is unlikely that they will readily adopt a political understanding of resilience. Ultimately, this failure may lead to disappointing outcomes and perhaps the decline of resilience (joining social capital, empowerment and participatory development in the development fad dust bin) in favor of the next popular conceptual tool that will surely emerge in the years to come.\nBene, C., Godfrey Wood, R., Newsham, A., & Davies, M.

Journal of International Development, 21(6), 83-894.","By Siraj Aziz, International Exco Alumni MYCorps\nThe early writings in development economics, especially after the Second World War concentrated greatly on ways to achieve economic growth and increase GNP and total employment (various authors cited in Sen, 1988). This narrative of ‘high growth’ as the central objective of development, in the midst of economic reconstructions particularly in Europe is not entirely flawed. Nevertheless, the emerging contemporary consensus (on the grounds of various political, socioeconomic and environmental catastrophes in later stages of 20th century) has been the clear concept of ‘welfare’ or ‘standard of living’ which is not defined in terms of commodities. Essentially, does economic growth mean more development? Is there any conflict between wealth and human liberty, for instance? Or are we asking the wrong questions here?\nThis essay argues that human well-beings (defined as ‘freedom’ later) must be the principal means and primary objective for an effective enhancement process of physical and living conditions. This invites the narrative of “human liberty”. Therefore, we attempt to challenge the conventional income-approach to development by using inter-country analysis within Amartya Sen’s capability-approach framework. Here, Sen’s thesis that “development stems from freedom” is scrutinized. We then analyse Malthusian Population Trap model alongside Banerjee and Duflo’s works on the lives of the poor to inform policy implications.\nFirstly, we believe that relationship between GNP and life expectancy, a measure of well-being is far from simple. Based on figure 1 (adopted from Sen, 1999), Sri Lanka, Kerala and China had the highest life expectancy (70+ years) despite having the lowest GNP per head (way less than $1000) in the 7-country sample. In contrast, oil-producing Gabon had the highest GNP per capita but with the lowest life expectancy. Unfortunately, Gabon’s massive wealth resources per head is not converted into actual achievement; its citizens’ well-being. It is like having a bicycle as a resource for mobility but is non-beneficial for a disabled person. Therefore, could corruption (accumulation of massive wealth in the hands of the very few elites and leakages in the funding of government social policies) explain this phenomenon? Thus, we believe that life expectancy is a good proxy for life ‘achievement’ as every human life is “too precious to be too short-lived and non-fulfilling”. Hence, we support Sen’ argument that “development analysis must include length and nature of the life that people succeed in living in each period” (1988). GNP remains fundamentally inadequate for concept of development and does not tell the nature of people succeeding at the end of a development process. Therefore, more integral view of the people’s lives is needed to assess what kind of life they aspire in living (Sen, 1988).\nIf income and wealth do not promise well-being, what else do? Sen (1999) studied mortality reduction in twentieth-century Britain. Detailed nutritional studies in England and Wales confirmed that during the two World Wars, cases of undernourishment declined sharply and extreme undernourishment almost entirely disappeared despite significant fall in per capita food availability. Mortality rates also fell sharply (excluding war mortality). During two periods of World Wars, there were fast expansion of support-oriented policies at the back of much greater sharing of means of survival that led to effective distribution of food and healthcare. Jay Winter found out that these social attitudes of “sharing” and public policies to nurture “sharing” as well as supportive and shared social arrangements were blossoming in the First and Second World War respectively. In both World Wars, life expectancy rose outstandingly by nearly seven years! (See\nfigure 2) We can now claim that even without wealth possessions but strong social support system as “means” towards the objective to survive the wars, people can still achieve “high survival rates”.\nBased on the above examples, we can agree that income does not guarantee well-being. In fact, Sen (1999) argued that we should not assess well-being and development within the domain of income based on how much commodities we possess or how much command we have over them – but rather in the space of functionings; what is it that we are able to do and become. Indeed, development is about expanding this set of functionings of “doings”, “beings” and “choosing” (also called ‘set of capabilities’). Expanding “ability to choose from functionings” or freedom, according to Sen (1999), manifests in five distinct components including political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees and protective security. These five “freedoms” complement each other and help to advance general capability of a person. Promoting these “freedoms” will assist public policies to foster human capabilities and substantive freedom in general. Freedom becomes the central to development for two important distinct reasons. Firstly, for evaluative reason; assessment based on whether freedoms that people have are enhanced. Secondly, for effectiveness reasons; achievement of development is thoroughly dependent on free agency of people (Sen, 1999). So, if expanding people’s set of capabilities that people have reasons to value is the ultimate objective of development, then any policies that violates their freedom cannot be the means of development.\nSen’s Capability Approach is not popular within policy circle probably because it gives way to discussion regarding moral evaluation of social arrangements beyond development context such as liberty and civil rights which state authorities are not comfortable with. But first, look at the following examples; open democratic elections in the UK and USA, social justice in functioning judiciary system, comprehensive social safety nets and pension schemes in Scandinavian countries, generously subsidized and comprehensive healthcare system in France and free tertiary education in Germany. By living in progressively democratic societies, citizens of these countries have substantive freedoms to choose from wider set of functionings in politics, social community, health and education for the kind of fulfilling life they have reason to value. Their high standard of living is reflected by their high life expectancy. This is in stark contrast to Sen’s personal experience of witnessing a knifed Muslim daily laborer, Kader Mia who had come for work for a tiny reward despite the area’s hostility caused by Muslim-Hindu communal riots (1999). With his family had nothing to eat, he got no choice but to work and suffered from economic “unfreedom”. Violation of freedom is a sad narrative of “under-development” in many least developing countries. Sen (1999) believes that freedom must be both the principal means and primary ends of development.\nSen’s thesis that development stems from freedom informs us that there is no one-size-fits-all policies in development. This implies that individual freedom is an important social commitment within country-context. Firstly, in explaining a phenomenon whereby large population growth hinders economic growth, Malthus (1788) controversially claimed that citizens are not reliable to solve larger social problems which require collective coordination; citizens lack moral constraint and lack of cognitive capacity to coordinate themselves. Figure 3 illustrates Malthusian Population Trap. As food supply increases at a constant rate and population grows exponentially, per capita income or food will start falling to low equilibrium level due to diminishing returns to fixed resources. The idea is to push towards point T after which income starts to grow more positively. China’s controversial one-child policy, which began in 1979 was planned top-down and centralised by the state authority to control social choice in China’s family size planning and consequently, population growth. This reduced the scope for agent-based development and gave rise to violation of freedom to achieve the kind of family life they have reason to value. After all, fertility is a micro-level choice. Household decides the number of children based on preference culturally and socially, or opportunity cost to child rearing or income considering substitutes for old-age related and other economic returns. Essentially, it is the households’ democratic right to have their own family planning. In fact, birth rate amongst the poor can fall given improvement in education and agency of women, reduction in infant mortality and development of old-age support schemes such as pensions and social support. Ironically, Chinese population growth rate did decline even before 1979 due to investment in primary education and public amenities.\nThis issue of “top-down policy making” impedes poverty eradication efforts. Institutional association of poverty with hunger for instance, such as in UN’s Millennium Development Goals persuaded a large part of governments’ efforts such as Egypt’s food subsidies and Indonesia’s Rakhsin programme to help the poor based on the idea that the poor desperately need food (Banerjee and Duflo, 2012). In describing poverty trap, the poor is implicitly assumed to eat as much as they can. However, Banerjee and Duflo (2012) found that even the very poor do not put every available penny into buying more calories when they get slightly richer. A 1% increase in overall expenditure translated into only 0.67% increase in the total food expenditure in Maharashtra, India in 1983. Besides, a food consumption pattern study by Jensen and Miller in two regions in China (Cited in Banerjee & Duflo, 2012) found that with staple food subsidy (on wheat noodles, rice), they buy less of both and instead opt for better-tasting meat and shrimp. With that subsidy, they “feel rich” and thus consume less of the staple food which is associated with being “poor”. The poor don’t seem to maximize expenditure on calories or micronutrients. For them, is there any more important thing than food? By defining poverty merely at income deprivation, we are at risk overlooking poverty as the deprivation of basic capabilities in society to achieve the kind of live they have reason to value.\nNow we know that simply giving more money or subsidized food does little to persuade them to eat more. Indeed, the main issue is not calories (quantity), but shortage of micronutrients (quality). While conventional food policies impose such notion of “more cheap grains help reduce hunger” in strategizing policy execution, recognizing their actual and implicit needs instead is a much better proposition. In fact, the social returns of directly investing in nutrition for children and pregnant mother, two of the most socially vulnerable groups in society are tremendous (Banerjee & Duflo, 2012). In Colombia, micronutrient packets are sprinkled on kids’ meals in preschool. In Mexico, social welfare payments come with free nutritional supplements for the family. Within capability framework, we must recognise that the poor aspire to achieve more than just “enough food on table”. They want “positive freedom” to enjoy tasty, healthier food and to feel happy, pleasant and content about life, like the rich do. In food policy terms, mass subsidized cheap food is a misleading instrument (“means”) to tackle the problem of food hunger (“ends”) which itself is inaccurately perceived as be-all, end-all problem in eradicating extreme poverty (“process”).\nBut micronutrients supply in practice has its own challenges. In Indonesia, demand for ironfortified fish sauce by anemic workers is low despite its low prices. (Banerjee & Duflo, 2012) An Indonesian study concluded that because employers pay everyone the same wage irrespective of their effort, there would be no reason for those employees to eat more and eat nutritiously to get stronger. That flat wage structure unfortunately impedes contribution of higher productivity from food nutrients into higher earnings. It is obvious that significant increase in earnings is only among self-employed workers – if they get stronger, they can work harder on their small businesses by themselves and gain even higher earnings. Their effort is deservedly rewarded. These findings imply that wage structure in the labour market must be market-based to provide “capability” and “negative freedom”, without external intervention or pressure from job market regulations. Workers can then keep themselves motivated (“incentives”) and work more productively.\nBanerjee et al (2007) comprehensively studied economic lives of the poor and the choice “unfreedom” they face in various life aspects. Their findings suggest that recognizing the poor as “agency” – “someone who acts and brings about change, and whose achievements can be judged in terms of her values and objectives irrespective of external criteria” (Sen, 1999) – produces more effective policy solutions. For instance, the poor have multiple jobs because they opt for riskspreading, to have fulfilling and productive spare time and they also cannot raise the capital they need to run a business that would occupy them fully. The existence of many petty entrepreneurs also suggests that they lack of access to financial markets for capital loan and financing. In this case, Financial Intermediaries must empower the poor as “agency” by providing affordable savings, investment and loan financing schemes, coupled with financial literary awareness and entrepreneurship mentoring to ensure sustained “financial freedom”. Besides, the poor don’t migrate for long-term despite its huge economic gains to which Munshi and Rosenzweig (2005) claim that it reflects their value of remaining close to one’s social network as the only available source of (informal) insurance for them. Making more money is not their huge priority. In education, parents in poor community do not react to low quality of schools either by sending children to better schools or pressuring government. They may often be illiterate themselves and consequently may have a hard time recognizing that their children are not learning much. Therefore, education policies in poor countries must empower participatory collaboration between parents and schools community to ensure effective teaching and learning process in class. Of course, there are critiques towards Sen’s Capability Approach (CA). Firstly, the theory’ approach is too individualistic (“freedom seeking”) whereby it ignores groups, communities, structures and institutions. However, CA does value groups, communities, structures and institutions as they are significant components to influence individuals’ substantive freedom. Besides, CA’s multidimensional nature reduces the focus on inequality between rich and poor, and on redistribution. CA actually sees income and wealth as means to an end but not ends in themselves. Both are crucial ‘means’ and relevant to analysis of society’s restricted capability across a wide range of domains. Lastly, is on CA being idealisitic and apologetic towards capitalism. Indeed, specifications of Capability list and thresholds do matter alongside analytical framework so that CA can be put to study a range of users.\nTo conclude, development policy requires a more complex understanding of social systems which combines economic, social, cultural and political institutions and their changing interactions over time (Adelman, 2001) and indeed “real freedom” is the be-all, end-all of development.\nAdelman (2001), “Fallacies in Development Theory and Their Implications for Policy” in Frontier in Development Economics\nBanerjee and Duflo (2012) Poor Economics\nBanerjee, Abhijit V., and Esther Dfulo. 2007. “The Economic Lives of the Poor.” Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21(1):141-168\nSen, A.

{"question":"Y'all mind explaining - en la Supreme Court, ¿how do tribal sovereign immunity cases like Bay Mills and Lewis & Clarke affect state regulatory powers?","answer":"In Bay Mills, the Court acknowledged states had other means of enforcing their laws against tribes despite sovereign immunity, including denial of licenses, suits against tribal employees/officials to enjoin state law violations, and criminal prosecution of tribal officials. However, in Lewis & Clarke, the plaintiffs argued that broadly applying tribal sovereign immunity would intrude upon states' regulatory authority, specifically their ability to use tort actions as a regulatory tool. The Lewis case highlighted how states' regulatory powers could be weakened if tribal employees were completely shielded by immunity. The key tension in both cases was between preserving tribal sovereignty and maintaining states' ability to enforce their regulatory schemes, with courts trying to balance these competing interests.","context":["November 01, 2014\nOctober 31, 2014\nOctober 30, 2014\nOctober 29, 2014\nThe Supreme Court Decides Bay Mills Case, Leaves Tribal Sovereign Immunity Intact\nIn its long-awaited decision in Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, the U.S. Supreme Court today re-affirmed its 1998 holding in Kiowa Tribe v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc. 523 U.S. 751 (1998) that tribal sovereign immunity extends to tribes’ governmental and commercial activities, both on reservation and off. In a 5-4 decision, the Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit’s decision that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act waiver of tribal sovereign immunity for suits to enjoin gaming on Indian lands in violation of a tribe’s gaming compact with a state did not apply to tribal gaming on non-Indian lands and that the State was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity from suing the Tribe directly for damages.\nThe Court rejected Michigan’s arguments that Kiowa was wrongly decided and that tribes should enjoy no immunity with respect to their commercial, off-reservation activities. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Kagan and joined by Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Breyer and Sotomayor, emphasized the doctrine that the court should not overrule its previous decisions without special justification (stare decisis), pointing out that (1) the Court had explicitly invited Congress to consider limitations on tribal sovereign immunity its Kiowa decision, (2) Congress had, in fact, considered several bills that would have imposed broad limits but had not enacted any of them (\"Having held in Kiowa that this issue is up to Congress, we cannot reverse ourselves because some may think its conclusion wrong\" Slip. Op. 20), and (3) Michigan had other means of enforcing state law against Bay Mills, including denial of required licenses, suits against employees and officials of the tribe to enjoin violations of state law and criminal prosecution of tribal officials and employees and for violations of state criminal laws.\nThe Court concluded:\nAs \"domestic dependent nations,\" Indian tribes exercise sovereignty subject to the will of the Federal Government. …Sovereignty implies immunity from lawsuits. Subjection means (among much else) that Congress can abrogate that immunity as and to the extent it wishes. If Congress had authorized this suit, Bay Mills would have no valid grounds to object. But Congress has not done so: The abrogation of immunity in IGRA applies to gaming on, but not off, Indian lands. We will not rewrite Congress’s handiwork. Nor will we create a freestanding exception to tribal immunity for all off reservation commercial conduct. This Court has declined that course once before. To choose it now would entail both overthrowing our precedent and usurping Congress’s current policy judgment.\nIn her concurring opinion, Justice Sotomayor asserted that the historical basis for tribal sovereign immunity is stronger than the dissent recognized and that the result reached by the majority is consistent with comity in view of the fact that State sovereign immunity prevents states from being sued by tribes. Justice Sotomayor also pointed out the special challenges that tribes face with respect to raising revenue and the role that their commercial enterprises play in funding government.\nThe unmistakable premise of the dissenting opinion, authored by Justice Thomas and joined by Justices Scalia, Ginsburg and Alito, is that sovereign immunity as currently exercised by tribes under the rule of Kiowa has led to widespread, grave and intolerable injustices. These injustices, according to the dissenters, warrant departing from the rule of stare decisis to correct the Court’s \"mistake\" in the Kiowa decision:\nIn Kiowa, this Court adopted a rule without a reason: a sweeping immunity from suit untethered from commercial realities and the usual justifications for immunity, premised on the misguided notion that only Congress can place sensible limits on a doctrine we created. The decision was mistaken then, and the Court’s decision to reaffirm it in the face of the unfairness and conflict it has engendered is doubly so.\nDissent, slip Op. 18.\nJustice Thomas’ opinion highlights areas, including taxation, tobacco commerce, payday lending and campaign finance, in which tribes have \"exploited\" immunity to avoid state regulation. In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Ginsburg expressed her view that the Court had gone too far not only in expanding the scope of tribal sovereign immunity in Kiowabut also in expanding state sovereign immunity from suits by tribes to enforce federal laws in Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996). Justice Ginsburg would impose greater limits on the immunity of both sovereigns.\nThe Court’s decision leaves unclear two areas of tribal sovereign immunity jurisprudence. First, the Court expressly acknowledged that it has never \"specifically addressed\" whether immunity \"should apply in the ordinary way if a tort victim, or other plaintiff who has not chosen to deal with a tribe, has no alternative way to obtain relief for off-reservation commercial conduct. The argument that such cases would present a ‘special justification’ for abandoning precedent is not before us\" Slip. Op. 16, n.8. The Court’s comment will be viewed as an invitation for a plaintiff to make the argument that this situation does indeed present a \"special justification\" for an exception to immunity.\nThe Court’s opinion also leaves unaddressed the extent to which tribal sovereign immunity applies to subsidiary entities. In a footnote, the dissent observed, without comment, that \"[l]ower courts have held that tribal immunity shields not only Indian tribes themselves, but also entities deemed ‘arms of the tribe.’ … In addition, tribal immunity has been interpreted to cover tribal employees and officials acting within the scope of their employment.\"\nThe consequences of the Court’s decision are likely to be (1) arguments by state lobbyists that Congress should take action to limit tribal immunity for the reasons set forth in the dissenting opinion and (2) suits based on the assertion that there should be an exception to tribal sovereign immunity for a \"tort victim or other plaintiff who has not chosen to deal with a tribe\" who has \"no alternative way to obtain relief for off-reservation commercial conduct.\"","Does a lawsuit against a tribal employee for an act he committed within the scope of his employment by the tribe violate tribal sovereign immunity?\nWith Lewis and Clarke, the Supreme Court will venture into the relatively unfamiliar legal territory of tribal sovereign immunity for individuals employed by Indian tribes. The case arises out of an automobile accident between Brian and Michelle Lewis and William Clarke, an employee of the Mohegan Sun Casino, which is owned by the Mohegan tribe. In a lawsuit brought by the Lewises, Clarke successfully convinced the Connecticut Supreme Court that he was entitled to tribal sovereign immunity. The Lewises argue that sovereign immunity does not apply when a tribal employee is sued in his individual capacity because the finances of the tribe are not formally at risk. Clarke counters that the finances of the tribe are at risk in this suit, and thus, the sovereign immunity of the tribe should extend to him because he was acting within the scope of his tribal employment. To some, the voyage of Lewis and Clarke into the obscure realm of tribal sovereign immunity for individuals imperils tribal coffers; to others, the regulatory power of the states is at stake.\nQuestions as Framed for the Court by the Parties\nWhether the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe bars individual-capacity damages actions against tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment.\nLewis and Clarke’s five-year voyage to the Supreme Court began on October 22, 2011 with the chance encounter of Brian and Michelle Lewis (“Lewis”) and William Clarke (“Clarke”) in Norwalk, Connecticut. See Lewis v. Clarke, 135 A.3d 677, 679 (Conn. 2016). At the time, Clarke was an employee of the Mohegan tribe and was responsible for transporting patrons of the Mohegan Sun Casino in a limousine to their homes. See id. While Clarke was thus navigating Interstate 95, he collided with Lewis’s vehicle, propelling Lewis onto a concrete barrier on the left side of the highway. See id. Thereafter, Lewis set out to sue in the Connecticut Superior Court, alleging the accident was a tort as it occurred due to Clarke’s negligence and carelessness. See id.\nClarke sought to dismiss the lawsuit, asserting a right to tribal sovereign immunity and claiming that he could not be sued because he was an employee of the Mohegan tribe. See Lewis, 135 A.3d at 679. According to Clarke, Lewis should have sued in the Mohegan tribe’s Gaming Disputes Court, which the tribe established pursuant to an agreement with the state of Connecticut for the purpose of deciding tort claims arising out of the tribe’s gambling activities. See Brief for Respondent, William Clarke at 4–5. The Superior Court denied Clarke’s motion to dismiss, concluding that tribal sovereign immunity did not extend to Clarke as an individual. See Lewis, 135 A.3d at 679–80. According to the Superior Court, sovereign immunity would have applied had Lewis sued Clarke as an official of the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority. See id. The Superior Court held that, because Lewis sued Clarke seeking compensation not from the Mohegan tribe but from Clarke personally, tribal sovereign immunity did not bar this suit. See id. Clarke disagreed with the Superior Court’s holding and so journeyed onward via appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court. See id.\nOn appeal, the Connecticut Supreme Court reversed course. See Lewis, 135 A.3d at 685–86. As the U.S. Supreme Court had yet to chart the boundaries of tribal sovereign immunity, the Connecticut Supreme Court relied on guidance from lower federal courts. See Brief for Respondent, William Clarke at 8. Based on the decisions of those courts, the Connecticut Supreme Court concluded that tribal sovereign immunity bars Lewis’s suit, solely because Clarke was an employee of the Mohegan Tribe and was performing an official duty. See id. Lewis was not content with ending this legal journey there and petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which the Court granted on September 29, 2016. See id. With this case, the Supreme Court must now demarcate the boundaries of tribal sovereign immunity.\nDOES SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY APPLY WHEN AN INJURED PARTY SUES A TRIBAL EMPLOYEE IN HIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY?\nLewis maintains that applicability of sovereign immunity is based upon whose assets are at risk in a suit, as determined by state and federal law. See Brief for Petitioners, Brian Lewis et al. at 9, 24. For example, if an injured party chooses to sue a government employee in his official capacity, then the government’s assets are at risk in the suit, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity would bar the suit. See id. at 8–9. If, on the other hand, an injured party chooses to sue a government employee in his individual capacity, then it is the employee’s own assets that are at risk, and the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar the suit. See id. Lewis illustrates this distinction by noting that, despite sovereign immunity protecting the federal and state governments from suit, federal and state employees can still be sued in their individual capacities in actions such as Bivens claims and Section 1983 suits. See id. at 13–14, 18–19. Lewis argues that the sovereign immunity doctrine should apply in the same manner for tribal sovereign immunity cases. See id. at 21. Additionally, Lewis states that a tribe cannot alter the sovereign immunity doctrine of state and federal courts by covering any damages held against tribal employees acting within their scope of employment. See id. at 24. Thus, despite the Mohegan Tribal Code’s indemnification of its employees for damage awards, Lewis argues a suit should be allowed so long as the injured party sues the employee in his individual capacity. See id.\nClarke counters with a different interpretation of the sovereign immunity doctrine. See Brief for Respondent, William Clarke at 14. He states that the analysis for the immunity of a tribal employee takes a different path from the analysis for a state or federal government employee, noting that previous lower court tribal immunity cases have applied sovereign immunity and official immunity almost interchangeably. See id. at 12–14. Further, Clarke argues that in the tribal immunity context, the relevant inquiry for immunity is not whether an employee is being sued in an official or individual capacity, but whether he was acting in his official capacity at the time he caused an injury. See id. at 14. If a tribal employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the injury, Clarke argues that the inquiry then turns to whose assets are at risk in the suit. See id. According to Clarke, if a tribe’s assets are at risk, then the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars the suit in State or Federal court. See id. Clarke maintains that this suit should be barred on grounds of sovereign immunity because the Mohegan Tribal Code indemnifies damages against its employees for actions performed within the scope of their employment. See id. at 15–16, 20. Clarke argues that it should make no legal difference whether the tribe is obligated to pay damages based on state law or tribal law, because Supreme Court precedent has indicated that sovereign immunity applies to cases in which the sovereign is not formally held liable but is held liable “in effect” because it is ultimately responsible for paying the damages. See id. at 16–17. Further, Clarke states that the Court has treated the application of sovereign immunity to state and tribal instrumentalities as a functional question of who is ultimately responsible for paying the damages, based on state or tribal indemnity laws. See id. 17–18, 21.\nDOES OFFICIAL IMMUNITY APPLY WHEN AN INJURED PARTY SUES A TRIBAL EMPLOYEE IN HIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY?\nLewis argues that the Court should not explore whether official immunity applies in this case. See Brief for Petitioners at 16, 22. Lewis states that Clarke did not make the official immunity argument and that the argument goes beyond the question before the Court. See id. at 22. Further, Lewis notes that the Court has never extended official immunity to tribal officials. See id. According to Lewis, the official immunity doctrine is ill-suited to the context of tribal employment because the tribal context does not implicate the supremacy concerns present in the federal context. See id. at 22–23. Lewis also notes that official immunity is typically only applied in cases in which a government employee was acting within their discretion, which would not apply in this case. See id. at 17, 19–20, 23.\nClarke responds that the Court should extend the common-law doctrine of official immunity that covers federal employees to the context of tribal employees. See Brief for Respondent at 26–28. First, he argues that the Court can consider official immunity in this case because it has been treated as interchangeable with sovereign immunity in tribal immunity cases and played a critical role in the outcome of the decision below. See id. at 27–28. Clarke maintains that tribal officials, like government officials, require official immunity in order to effectively carry out their duties. See id. at 29. In fact, he argues that the need for protection in carrying out official duties is even stronger in the context of an Indian Tribe. See id. at 42. Further, Clarke states that this immunity should not be limited to cases in which the tribal official was acting within his discretion, because Congress has rejected such a distinction for government employees in immunity cases. See id. at 30–32, 36–37. Clarke notes that a tribe’s sovereignty is most akin to that of foreign sovereigns, whose officials are granted complete official immunity. See id. at 43. Clarke also argues that refusing to extend immunity in this context would uniquely disadvantage tribal employees because they would not be eligible for the same protections as are afforded to the employees of all other governments. See id. at 45–46.\nSTATE’S POWER TO REGULATE VS. TRIBE’S POWER TO GOVERN\nClarke asserts that a narrow interpretation of tribal sovereign immunity will hinder effective tribal governance. See Brief for Respondent, William Clarke at 42. According to Clarke, if a tribe’s employees are not afforded sovereign immunity, they may become paralyzed by the fear of a lawsuit and avoid discretionary action. See id. Clarke posits that such a result would cripple a tribe’s ability to govern effectively. See id. Additionally, Clarke asserts that prospective employees would steer clear from tribal employment if potentially bankrupting liability was at stake. See id. Clarke thus cautions the Supreme Court to weigh the tribe’s ability to effectively govern when charting the boundaries of tribal sovereign immunity. See id.\nThe United States, as amicus in favor of reversal, agrees with Clarke’s conclusion but disagrees as to the method. See Brief of Amicus Curiae the United States, in Support of Reversal at 26. According to the United States, the common law doctrine of official qualified immunity is more appropriate in this context. See id. The United States urges the Court to send the case back to the Connecticut Supreme Court to reconsider it under the doctrine of qualified immunity. See id.\nLewis foresees an alternate problem, asserting that broadly delineated tribal sovereign immunity intrudes upon States’ regulatory authority. See Brief for Petitioners, Brian Lewis et al. at 6, 20. According to Lewis, states utilize tort actions as a tool to advance their regulatory scheme. See id. at 27–28. Lewis cautions that should Clarke prevail, the result would weaken the regulatory power of the States. See id.\nClarke disagrees, asserting that the State of Connecticut’s regulatory powers are adequately preserved. See Brief for Respondent at 53–54. According to Clarke, Connecticut had an opportunity to negotiate for a waiver of sovereign immunity with the tribe, but chose not to do so. See id. Clarke thus argues that Connecticut’s power to regulate would not be diminished. See id.\nTRESPASSING ON THE DIGNITY OF SEMI-SOVEREIGN TRIBES\nAccording to Clarke, establishing narrow boundaries on tribal sovereign would constitute a trespass on the dignity of the tribes as “separate sovereigns pre-existing the Constitution.” Brief for Respondent at 43–44. Clarke asserts that inasmuch as law treats foreign dignitaries and officials with sovereign immunity, so it must afford the same to the tribes, which have long been recognized as “‘retain[ing] their historic sovereign authority’ unless Congress abrogates it.” Id. at 44.\nLewis, however, finds no such concern. See Brief for Petitioners at 23. According to Lewis, the framers of the Constitution devised sovereign immunity to ensure that States would not suffer the humiliation of appearing as parties in federal courts. See id. Lewis concludes that as the present lawsuit was filed against an individual, it would not force the tribe itself to appear in American courts. See id. Thus, according to Lewis, sovereign immunity concerns are not implicated here. See id.\nTHREATENING THE WEALTH OF THE TRIBES\nClarke also asserts that a narrow delineation of tribal sovereign immunity would threaten the financial integrity of a tribe. See Brief for Respondent at 50. According to Clarke, with sovereign immunity, tribes would be allowed to set their own rules of recovery, allowing them to avoid potentially ruinous liability. See id.\nIn response, Lewis asserts that the present lawsuit poses no danger to the financial security of the tribe. See Brief for Petitioners at 23–24. According to Lewis, the only reason the Mohegan tribe may suffer is because it agreed to cover the damages awarded against Clarke. See id. Lewis thus concludes that the tribe could avoid any potential liability by simply refusing to indemnify its employees. See id.\nINJUSTICE TO THE VICTIMS\nIn support of Lewis, the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association and American Association for Justice (“Associations”) assert a verdict for Clarke could leave many injured parties without a remedy. See Brief for Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association et al., in Support of Petitioner at 5. Specifically, the Associations assert that barring Lewis’s suit would foreclose individuals injured by other tribal employees from having an opportunity to be heard in state and federal courts. See id. at 15. Lewis likewise repeats this concern, noting that it is inherently unfair to bar injured parties from American courts solely because of the employment status of their assailant. See Brief for Petitioners at 28–29.\nClarke challenges the Associations’ concerns as inconsistent with the facts of the case. See Brief for Respondent at 54–55. Clarke notes that the Lewis family would not be left without a remedy even if tribal sovereign immunity barred their suit in Connecticut courts. See id. According to Clarke, the Lewis family could have sued in the Gaming Disputes Tribal Court, to which other parties that were injured in the same accident appealed and received substantial compensation. See id. Thus, Clarke asserts that injured parties would not be left without a remedy even if the Court were to extend tribal sovereign immunity in federal courts to employees like Clarke.

Light travels at slower speeds through different materials, such as glass or air. When traveling from one medium to another, some light will be reflected at the surface of the new medium. The light that continues through the new medium will either speed up or slow down depending on how fast it can travel through each medium. For example, light travels more quickly through air than through water. The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the medium. The higher the refractive index, the more light is slowed down by the substance.\n|Index of Refraction for Some Common Substances|\n|Substance||Index of Refraction|\nIf light enters the new medium at a right angle to the surface, it will change speed, but not direction. If it enters at an angle, its speed and its direction will change. The direction the light takes depends on whether it travels faster or slower in the new medium. Imagine driving a car from smooth pavement onto a sandy beach. If you approach the beach straight on, the car will slow down, but not change direction. If the you approach the beach at an angle, one of the tires will be slowed down by the sand before the other is, and the car will turn in the direction of the tire that touched the sand first.\nLight follows the same same principle and bends towards the normal when traveling into a medium with a higher index of refraction, and away from the normal when traveling into a medium where it can go faster. In the diagram below, light is leaving air and entering glass, so it bends towards the normal on the way in, and away on the way out of the glass.\nLenses form images by refraction and are typically made of either glass or plastic. They are ground so that their surfaces are either segments of spheres or planes. If a lens is convex or converging, it takes parallel light rays from a distant object and bends them so that they converge to a single point called the focal point. The distance from the lens to the focal point is called the focal length of the lens.\nIf a lens is concave or diverging, it takes parallel rays and bends them so that they spread out. The rays will then appear to originate from a point in front of the lens. This point is also called the focal point, and its distance is measured in negative units.\nThe earliest telescopes, as well as many amateur telescopes today, use lenses to gather more light than the human eye could collect on its own. They focus the light and make distant objects appear brighter, clearer and magnified. This type of telescope is called a refracting telescope.\nMost refracting telescopes use two main lenses. The largest lens is called the objective lens, and the smaller lens used for viewing is called the eyepiece lens.\nThe size of an image produced by a lens is proportional to the focal length of the lens. The longer the focal length, the larger the image. The brightness of an image from a telescope depends partly on how much light is collected by the telescope. The light-gathering power of a telescope is directly proportional to the area of the objective lens. The larger the lens, the more light the telescope can gather. Doubling the diameter of the lens increases the light gathering power by a factor of 4. Brightness of images also depends on how big an area the image light is spread over. The smaller the area, the brighter the image.\nThe magnifying power of a telescope is the ratio of an object's angular diameter to its naked eye diameter. This depends on the focal length of both lenses.\nMagnification = focal length of objective lens/focal length of eyepiece lens\nMagnification might seem like the most important aspect of a telescope, but there are limits to how sharp an image a telescope can produce because of the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. Magnifying a blurred image makes it bigger, but not clearer, so the priority when telescopes are built is to have the greatest light-gathering power possible. Gathering more light makes brighter images, and brighter images make it easier to see faint details.\nGalileo is credited with being the first person to use a telescope to make observations of the night sky. After hearing of the invention of the telescope in 1608, he built one of his own, called a Gallilean Telescope, in 1609 using a convex objective lens and a concave eyepiece lens. His telescope could magnify objects 3 times. Telescopes he made later magnified objects up to 30 times.\nLenses create a type of image distortion known as chromatic aberration. This occurs because as light passes through a lens, different colors are bent through different angles (like in a prism) and brought to a focus at different points. Because of this, stars viewed through a simple lens are surrounded by rainbow colored halos. This can be corrected for by adding a thin lens of a different kind of glass behind the objective lens.\nLenses present other optical problems including how difficult and expensive it is to make large lenses completely free of defects. Glass also absorbs most ultraviolet light, and visible light is substantially dimmed as it passes through a lens. In addition, lenses in telescopes can only be supported around the outside, so large lenses can sag and distort under their own weight.

{"question":"best colors for crappie lures in clear vs dark water?","answer":"In darker and murkier waters, darker colored lures work best, while in clearer waters, lighter and brighter colors that stand out more are most effective. For example, when fishing stained water like in Grenada Lake, black sparkle colored lures like the VIE Shiner are particularly productive. However, it's important to carry a variety of colors and combinations since crappie preferences can change daily, with chartreuse, pink and electric blue soft baits generally yielding good results across different water conditions.","context":["Editor’s Note: Brad Whitehead of Muscle Shoals, Alabama and John Harrison of Calhoun City, Mississippi, are both crappie guides and tournament crappie fisherman. All year long they have to take crappie fishermen to places where they can catch crappie and use tactics and lures that have a proven history of producing crappie at specific times of year. Outdoor Hub has asked these two crappie guides to give us productive fall crappie-fishing tactics and recommend lures to produce crappie in October. Whitehead primarily fishes deep clear lakes on the Tennessee River, and Harrison fishes stained-water shallow lakes in north Mississippi. These articles will give you a head start on finding and catching crappie, whether, you’re fishing deep, clear lakes or shallow, stained-water lakes.\nI guide primarily on Grenada Lake in northern Mississippi and like to vertical jig fish with the VIE Shiner made by Mister Twister. My favorite color is black sparkle and I like this color because it’s productive for crappie when you’re fishing stained water. Grenada Lake and some other northern Mississippi crappie lakes will be stained most of the year. I use an 11-foot VBull Bottom Reel Seat Pole made by B’n’M and a 6-pound test Capps & Coleman lines. Sometimes, I’ll fish with a 4-pound test line.\nIf I’m fishing in 8- or 10-foot-deep water in the fall, I’ll pull 9 feet of line off my reel. If I am fishing Grenada, Enid, Arkabutla or Sardis lakes, all in north Mississippi, I’ll primarily be fishing stick-ups: poles, stumps or other types of brush that come up off the bottom and stick up above the water. I pitch my jig past the stick-up, and let the VIE Shiner swim from the back side of the stick-ups past it and in front of the stick-up. Each time I cast to the same stick-up, I’ll run my jig through different depths of water, from as shallow as 3 feet deep to almost on the bottom. I’ll make two casts to the same depth, before I move deeper. The first cast the jig will swim by the stick-up, as I’ve mentioned earlier. On the second cast, I’ll stop my jig right by the stick-up and hold the jig as still as I possibly can. On one day, the crappie only may be 3 or 4 feet deep during October. On other days, they may be hugging the bottom. So, you need to bring your jig through all depths of the water, until you determine the depth where the crappie are holding.\nI use two different types of retrieve: swimming the jig by the stick-up or stopping the jig by the stick-up to try and determine what mood the crappie are in on that day. If the crappie are actively feeding, they‘ll take the jigs while they’re moving. If the crappie are in a bad mood (don’t want to feed), I’ll stop the jig beside the stick-up and hold it as still as possible. Sometimes, I’ll slow-count up to 10, with the jig sitting dead in the water, before the crappie bite. The crappie often will just look at the baits for awhile, before they decide to eat then.\nAlthough crappie may be concentrating on a spot, they may be in a bad mood. By holding the bait still, you often can get those bad-mood crappie to eat the baits. Fish in an aquarium often will stay in one spot without ever moving. However, if you look, more closely, you’ll see that the aquarium fish are using their tails to stabilize their bodies in that spot by barely moving their tails to maintain their body position. The VIE Shiner has such a sensitive tail and is so flexible that regardless of how still you try to hold it, the lure still will wiggle just a little, either from the sensitivity of the pole’s transferring the slightest movement to the jig or from the current underwater causing the jig’s tail to move. Even though you’re holding the jig still, it may move slightly like that aquarium fish that you see. Sometimes, if you think the crappie aren’t biting, the reason may be that you’re fishing too fast, and the fish are in a bad mood. Holding that jig still by the cover can help solve that problem.\nSo, even though you think you’re not moving the VIE Shiner, the jig is actually vibrating. Sometimes, crappie want active jigs, and at other times they want inactive jigs. By making two casts to each stick-up at each water depth that I fish the jig through, I can tell what water depth the fish are holding at and determine whether the crappie are feeding actively or are inactive. In the fall at Grenada Lake and many other lakes, you’ll see a current coming around the stick-ups. You can catch the crappie as soon as the jig hits the water or if by letting the jig fall all the way to the bottom. Most crappie we catch using this technique will be 13 to 16 inches long, with the 13-inch fish weighing about 1-1/4 pounds, the 14-inch fish weighing about 1-1/2 pounds, the 15-inch crappie weighing about 2 pounds and the 16-inch fish weighing 2.9 or possibly even,3 pounds. This pattern usually holds up best for me during October and November. I’ll start using this tactic again in February through April.\nYou can contact Harrison at 662-983-5999.\nFor more information on Mister Twister lures, visit http://www.mistertwister.com/\nTo learn more about crappie and how to fish for them from the masters of the sport, click here for “Crappie: How to Catch Them Spring and Summer,” a new eBook from Amazon’s Kindle by John E.

This is largely due to their spawning, which makes the entire fishing experience fun with lots of action. However, it is a lot like shooting fish in a barrel, which makes it not challenging at all.\nIf you love a challenge, you will probably get bored in no time at all. You need to brush up on your deep-water crappie techniques and try to get them when they are in the deep. That means fishing for crappie during Fall, Summer and Winter!\nWhen temperatures hit the extremes, for example during summer or late fall, crappie tend to go deep. This is because conditions in deeper waters are much more stable than that of the waters above. Temperatures deep down tend to stay the same, whether it is cold, windy or rainy above, or even when outside temperatures are high.\nThis article I wrote covers the subject of the best time to catch crappie in-depth!\nThis unique behavior of crappie makes late Fall, Summer and Winter great times to fish, as long as you know how to fish deep. Here is the ultimate collection of deep water crappie techniques to help you catch like a pro in any season.\nAs always, please be a responsible angler and follow all state regulations. Here are the crappie size and bag limits for Texas. Make sure to look up your local regulations before heading out.\nLOCATE THE CRAPPIE\nThis is the first and most essential step. Locating the crappie can be quite difficult, especially when they are deep in the water. However, if you know what you are doing, you should be up to the challenge. You can locate the crappie using various methods, depending on your situation.\nIf you are on a boat, consider using electronics. It will make the entire process much faster and more efficient. Look for channels and drop-offs. You need to particularly look out for channels that are going from deeper to shallower, and look at around 30 feet. You should also look for brush and weed beds. Finally, keep in mind that during the fall, crappies school in huge numbers. This will look like a Christmas tree on your fish finder.\nIt is also important to note that during the high summer heat, they will go deep but not all the way to the bottom. Expect to find them just over the thermocline, generally at around 8 to 20 feet deep. The water is cooler above the thermocline, but it also has enough oxygen to sustain bait and other fish.\nCrappie tend to also spread out during very warm summers, making them harder to locate, especially in large lakes. A good trick to use is to search for them near sunken or submerged structures like trees and brush piles. Once you make a single catch, keep fishing at that depth because more crappie are definitely around there somewhere.\nDuring winter, use your fish finder and search for them at the deepest parts of the lake. The deep is warmer than the top, so they are attracted there. It may be a little difficult to find them at first, but because they are huddled together due to the cold, finding one will definitely mean you are going to reel in a huge catch. Just remember to fish slowly and pay 100% attention to the bites. Crappie bites, especially in winter, are very subtle and easy to miss if you look away.\nIf you are fishing from a barge, dock or from a bank, you need to look for structure. For the best results, fish close to piers and pylons. You should go to the bottom then reel up a couple of turns. Keep reeling up a few turns every 3 to 5 minutes until you locate the school. Check out this article I wrote, there is a section on finding the right depth.\nWhenever you can, bring a good updated topographical map of the area you are fishing in. Not only is this good practice, it is also just smart fishing. A good topographical map will have some indications of water depth and terrain altitude.\nSince finding the right depth is an essential part of crappie fishing, this information will go a long way in helping you figure out where to start your search. It will likely cut in half the time you would spend in finding the right place to fish. As far as maps are concerned, they can easily be found online. In fact, it is possible to stumble upon some really good topographical maps with local depths and indications of sunken structures, all for free. Download the ones of your fishing location and print them out before heading out. If you have a large sporting goods store, they will have excellent topo maps of all the lakes in your area. I know that Dick’s Sporting goods and Academy both carry them.\nAn understanding of crappie feeding styles is essential if you want to be even more effective in your fishing. Crappie only feed up, so this tells you that your bait must always be slightly above them. With the help of electronics, you can easily achieve this. However, if you are bank fishing or fishing from a pier, you need not worry. Click here for a proven technique that will help you find the right depth every time you fish.\nDuring the Fall and Summer months when crappie are deep, I have found that a 1/16 or a 1/32 jig head dressed with a 1 to 1.5-inch soft lure works best. You will realize that the crappie will start attacking the bait while it is still sinking.\nWhen you fish for deep water crappie, do not use an aggressive presentation style. All you need to do is drop the tip and let it rest for a while, repeating this process every once in a while. The important thing is to keep your trigger finger on the line, carefully watching for any slack or slight movement. It is possible to never feel a bite, which is why you need to pay close attention to the line. This is where High-Viz fishing line comes in handy! You can see it much more easily.\nHere is a video that I found on YouTube. The guy is not using a soft plastic but it shows vertical jigging pretty good. He is a bit too aggressive in his presentation to my taste but it works for him! This is really just to show you what vertical jigging looks like:\nMINNOWS – THE SECRET WEAPON\nThey should not be a secret weapon at all. They are an absolute all year round favorite of crappie. However, many people completely disregard minnows in the Summer and Fall months. This is especially true for the deep winter months because minnows do not last very long in the cold.\nAs a smart angler, you cannot disregard minnows, even during the fall, winter and summer months. Keep them alive in an insulated minnow bucket with an aerator. Here is the one I use:\nWhen you hook them, be careful to do it through the upper lip or behind the dorsal fin to prevent killing them. Then drop to the bottom and crank up the reel a few turns. This is how I hook them:\nPersonally, I usually have 2 or 3 poles tight-lined when I fish for crappie. However, this changes during Fall and Winter. During these months I only fish with one pole in hand. I make sure my trigger finger is on the line and my 100% attention is on the line. If you do not do this, you will likely walk away empty-handed time and time again.\nFinally, when it comes to minnows, there is one technique that I do not see used very much. The guys at the barge where I fish call it the “pinch-head”. It is actually quite simple; you need to take the head off a minnow and hook the minnow body to a 1/16 jig head, then fish it like you would a jig. When plastics and live minnows are not working, experience has proven that Jigheads can be surprisingly effective.\nWHICH PLASTICS WORK BEST?\nThis is a question that many people would like to know the answer to. I get asked about it all the time. However, it is quite difficult to answer. Crappies change their preferences almost daily. It is not uncommon to find that what worked yesterday no longer works today.\nHere is an article about crappie jigs\nGenerally, I have found that smaller plastics work pretty good in the fall. You will need to pair them with a small jig head for a slow fall. If you are fishing in darker and murkier waters, use darker colors. In clearer waters, use lighter colors that are brighter and stand out more. However, take this as a simple rule of thumb. It is always best to carry a variety of colors and color combinations to test what works and what does not. It will change daily!\nAnother pro tip here is to always make sure that you have Chartreuse, Pink and electric blue soft baits with you. I always start testing with those first, because they tend to yield the best results.\nCrappie fishing is amazing. You do not need to limit yourself to only fishing in the spring. You will be missing out in a massive way. Deep water crappie fishing is extremely fun and rewarding. Plus, if you want to catch your biggest crappie, you can only get them by fishing in the deep. The biggest slabs I have caught have been in deep waters in the cold October-Dec weather.\nDo not limit yourself. You need to set yourself free and explore the opportunities other seasons have to offer. With the techniques listed here, you will be well on your way to enjoy fishing all year round. I fish year round and I love it!\nI found some very unusual tips and tricks while scouring the internet for crappie fishing tips.\nLet me know below if you have some awesomely effective deep water crappie techniques.\nGood fishin’ to you"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:30dd046c-0722-4d2b-99ec-cc4670d29146>","<urn:uuid:9b6510be-00c1-4762-9db2-3779f204578a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What safety inspections are conducted both at naval bases and commercial ports, and how do they evaluate emergency response systems?","answer":"At naval bases, Ready For Sea Assessments evaluate ships through a two-day process examining administrative items and at-sea capabilities including emergency response systems. In commercial ports, the Paris and Tokyo MoUs conduct Concentrated Inspection Campaigns focusing on fire safety systems. Both types of inspections assess critical safety areas - naval assessments check damage control and emergency procedures, while port inspections verify fire detection systems, emergency escape routes, fire doors, and ventilation controls. Both require demonstration of crew competency through drills and evaluate the operational status of emergency equipment and control systems.","context":["Naval Surface Forces assessing if ships ready for sea\nSAN DIEGO - Vice Adm. Tom Rowden, commander of Naval Surface Forces has ordered Ready For Sea Assessments (RFSA) for all surface warships. Surface combatants forward deployed to Japan are being assessed first through a review of critical mission areas for each ship.\nThe RFSAs began last month with a focus on evaluating the foundational skills necessary to operate surface warships safely, as well as assess the critical mission areas of navigation, propulsion, steering, communications and damage control. The intent is to evaluate the ship’s readiness, and if necessary, develop a remedial plan to fix any gaps.\n“I have absolute confidence that our crews are working very hard to care for their ships and to meet operational requirements. These assessments are about taking an honest, hard look at how we do business and adjusting, as required, to remain the world’s preeminent naval force, uniquely capable of operating in the waters of the world’s oceans,” said Rowden.\nSeven ships have already completed RFSA, and two other forward deployed ships are currently undergoing assessment. The initial focus is on the cruisers and destroyers forward deployed to Japan and then expanding to other ships operating in the Western Pacific, followed by the rest of the force.\n“Every day, we owe it to our Sailors and their families to explore opportunities to mitigate risk where we can – from immediate daily fundamentals to instituting complex organizational change,” said Rowden.\nAssessments will be conducted over a period of two days. The first day will be conducted in port and focus on administrative items, including proper manning, qualifications, watchbills, training plans, and equipment checks. The second day consists of an at-sea assessment on propulsion and navigations drills, watchteam proficiency, and other critical at-sea evolutions. Ships that do not pass the administrative review on day one will not be allowed to go to sea for the second part of the evaluation.\nThe assessments aim to accurately determine the readiness of each ship and deliver improved confidence in the surface fleet's ability to execute its core competencies.\nThe RFSA guidance was included as a part of a series of messages, known as “Warfighting Serials”, that Rowden has released providing guidance on improving the readiness of the Surface Force.\nRowden is taking a steadfast stance on ensuring ships receive the appropriate amount of time to conduct training and certifications prior to deployment, increase ownership of the processes in place, and create a culture of standardization across the surface community, and the fleet as a whole.\nFollowing an operational pause which allowed for reviews of procedures and processes, Rowden recognized the need to shore up the confidence and competence in the Surface Navy. He promulgated guidance in Warfighting Serial #13, Confidence and Competence, to the Surface Force directing a concerted focus on the basics upon which safe navigation rests. Commanders were directed to take specific actions, like taking greater heed of the manning, maintenance, training, and certification pillars to ensure increased safety and readiness of their units and ships – at sea and in port.\n\"As professionals, there comes a time when we must pause, self-reflect, assess, and determine if course corrections are required. For surface warriors at all individual command levels, that time is now,” Rowden wrote in Confidence and Competence.\nLearn more about efforts to improve readiness on the Naval Surface Force website.","Paris and Tokyo MoUs have jointly announced a new Concentrated Inspections Campaign (CIC) that will take place from September 1st to November 30rd, 2023 with a focus on Fire Safety implementation on board ships, since high levels of deficiencies were found in recent years in this specific area. Other MoUs may also participate in the campaign which will be an additional inspection campaign to the regular PSC inspections.\nAim of CICThe purpose of the Inspection Campaign is to determine the level of compliance with the requirements on Fire safety. Fire Safety is a key area of concern during PSC inspections. It is widely known that fire is one of the worst-case scenarios for an onboard emergency. PSC data analysis from the last five years shows that there is a lot of concern for onboard fire safety while ships have still several issues to address in this area. The PSCOs will expand their focus on the evaluation of competences of crew when performing fire drill or related emergency scenarios.\nQuestionnaireThe CIC questionnaire will be released in early August 2023. However, in accordance with released information, there will be a 10-question checklist covering the functionality of fire safety systems and related drills.See Appendix A for CIC Questionnaire.\nManagers, manning offices, Officers and crew onboard should be prepared to address the PSC CiC successfully. Fire training manuals on board to be reviewed to be ship specific. Company’s superintendents to focus on onboard training during visits.

Has the fixed fire detection and fire alarm systems, been periodically tested in accordance with the requirements of the Administration?\nAll related alarms to be checked for functioning. Bridge/Engine room/fire station alarm panels to be tested as required for auditable alarms. Maintenance and test records to be available for demonstration. SMS / PMS to include testing procedure for fixed fire detection systems and alarms. Blocked fire or smoke detectors in ship’s compartments are very dangerous and in case PSCO spots them, the ship will be detained.\n4. Are ventilation closing appliances capable of being closed?\nCheck all fire dampers and ventilators to work as required. Appropriate marking to be colored to show open and close position. Remove rust from dampers so they can close tightly. Means to close the ventilation to be checked as per ships maintenance / inspection System.\n5. Are the means of control for power ventilation of machinery spaces operable from two grouped positions?\nCheck operational status of control for power ventilation of machinery spaces. Both position systems to be checked. Apart of functionality check that there are not any closing prevention means to ventilation systems.\n6. Can each fire pump deliver at least the two required jets of water?\nCheck equipment condition for leakages. The piping system supporting fire pumps should not have any soft patches. Check fire pumps (including emergency fire pump) for pressure. When operating in low temperature areas check fire main for icing. During fire drills check the water jet availability with one hose on the bridge and one hose in the aft deck.\n7. Are the means of control provided in a position outside the machinery space for stopping ventilation and oil transfer equipment operational?\nCheck the operational status of means stopping ventilation and oil transfer. Quick closing valves to be free from closing preventive means. Crew to be trained to activate the stopping procedure and then reset the system to open position as required. Permanent means preventive closing vales to operate usually lead to detention. Prior entering a port these items should be checked for functionality.\n8. Is the room for the fixed gas fire extinguishing medium used only for this purpose?\nCheck access control in the fixed gas extinguishing room. Operational step by step activation guidance should be posted next to activation control panel (for local activation). All items irrelevant to fire extinguishing system to be removed from the area.\n9. Are the valves used in the fire main line operational?\nCheck operational status of the valves. Maintenance and inspection records to be available for review. Prior entering a port these valves should be checked for functionality.\n10. Where a fire drill was witnessed, was it found to be satisfactory?\nFireman outfits and related equipment to be checked in detailed and crew should be familiar in use of them. A step-by-step drill to be performed under the supervision of Safety Officer and used as training session in order explain the reason of each step of the drill. Each crew member should know the duties and actions expected from him/her during the drill but mostly during a real time event."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:14ffcace-f3e0-4cfa-a7b0-3678e0d976de>","<urn:uuid:d169bf23-7ddf-406e-a2d9-281061deeda5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Studying space physics - what's the relationship between cloud density and distance in R Aquarii's jet system?","answer":"There is a very well defined correlation between cloud density and distance to the central binary in R Aquarii, following the relationship Ne ∝ r-1.3. The densities are remarkably high, with typical values of approximately 3 × 105 cm-3 for outer clouds around 300 AU, and about 3 × 106 cm-3 for inner clouds around 50 AU, with even higher densities for the central jet source.","context":["SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii. I. Imaging of the stellar binary and the innermost jet clouds\nContext. R Aqr is a symbiotic binary system consisting of a mira variable, a hot companion with a spectacular jet outflow, and an extended emission line nebula. Because of its proximity to the Sun, this object has been studied in much detail with many types of high resolution imaging and interferometric techniques. We have used R Aqr as test target for the visual camera subsystem ZIMPOL, which is part of the new extreme adaptive optics (AO) instrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope (VLT).\nAims: We describe SPHERE/ZIMPOL test observations of the R Aqr system taken in Hα and other filters in order to demonstrate the exceptional performance of this high resolution instrument. We compare our observations with data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and illustrate the complementarity of the two instruments. We use our data for a detailed characterization of the inner jet region of R Aqr.\nMethods: We analyze the high resolution ≈ 25 mas images from SPHERE/ZIMPOL and determine from the Hα emission the position, size, geometric structure, and line fluxes of the jet source and the clouds in the innermost region <2'' (<400 AU) of R Aqr. The data are compared to simultaneous HST line filter observations. The Hα fluxes and the measured sizes of the clouds yield Hα emissivities for many clouds from which one can derive the mean density, mass, recombination time scale, and other cloud parameters.\nResults: Our Hα data resolve for the first time the R Aqr binary and we measure for the jet source a relative position 45 mas West (position angle -89.5°) of the mira. The central jet source is the strongest Hα component with a flux of about 2.5 × 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1. North east and south west from the central source there are many clouds with very diverse structures. Within 0.5'' (100 AU) we see in the SW a string of bright clouds arranged in a zig-zag pattern and, further out, at 1''-2'', fainter and more extended bubbles. In the N and NE we see a bright, very elongated filamentary structure between 0.2''-0.7'' and faint perpendicular \"wisps\" further out. Some jet clouds are also detected in the ZIMPOL [O I] and He I filters, as well as in the HST-WFC3 line filters for Hα, [O III], [N II], and [O I]. We determine jet cloud parameters and find a very well defined correlation Ne ∝ r-1.3 between cloud density and distance to the central binary. Densities are very high with typical values of Ne ≈ 3 × 105 cm-3 for the \"outer\" clouds around 300 AU, Ne ≈ 3 × 106 cm-3 for the \"inner\" clouds around 50 AU, and even higher for the central jet source. The high Ne of the clouds implies short recombination or variability timescales of a year or shorter.\nConclusions: Hα high resolution data provide a lot of diagnostic information for the ionized jet gas in R Aqr. Future Hα observations will provide the orientation of the orbital plane of the binary and allow detailed hydrodynamical investigations of this jet outflow and its interaction with the wind of the red giant companion.\nAstronomy and Astrophysics\n- Pub Date:\n- June 2017\n- stars: individual: R Aqr;\n- binaries: symbiotic;\n- stars: winds;\n- circumstellar matter;\n- instrumentation: adaptive optics;\n- Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics\n- 24 pages, 14 figures (accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1cd12870-7e5b-4423-8967-ef72999432f9>"],"error":null}

Although matter wave interference of BECs relies on the de Broglie wavelength of the individual atoms, our massive molecules always appear as single entities.\nIn our experiment, the superposition consists of having all atoms simultaneously 'in the left arm' and 'in the right arm' of our interferometer, that is, two possibilities that are macroscopically distinct.\nThe path separation is about two orders of magnitude larger than the size of the molecules. Such a mechanism is not needed to create the molecular superposition state in our experiment. Entanglement between a molecule and a microscopic probe particle does, however, occur in decoherence processes in which the quantum interaction with the environment reveals which-path information 14 , 15 and destroys the interference pattern.\nCollisions with residual gas molecules 31 , the emission of heat radiation 32 and the absorption of blackbody radiation are among the most important decoherence mechanisms for interferometry with massive particles. In conclusion, our experiments reveal the quantum wave nature of tailor-made organic molecules in an unprecedented mass and size domain. They open a new window for quantum experiments with nanoparticles in a complexity class comparable to that of small proteins, and they demonstrate that it is feasible to create and maintain high quantum coherence with initially thermal systems consisting of more than 1, internal degrees of freedom.\nQuantum interference of large organic molecules | Nature Communications\nThe porphyrin derivatives were synthesized by the attachment of a highly fluorous thiol to meso-tetra pentafluorophenyl porphyrin in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction by applying a modified literature procedure To assemble TPPF84, the commercially available 1 H ,1 H ,2 H ,2 H -perfluorododecanethiol as nucleophilic fluorous part was introduced to the porphyrin unit.\nThe branched thiol building block for TPPF was synthesized in three reaction steps. A reaction sequence including mono-functionalization of tris bromomethyl benzene with a protected thiol, introduction of two fluorous ponytails and a final deprotection of the thiol functionality yielded the desired fluorous thiol suitable for the envisaged substitution reaction. All target structures were purified by column chromatography and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry Supplementory Methods. The functional dependence of the interference fringe visibility on the laser power is qualitatively similar in both a classical and a full quantum treatment.\nAs observed from the treatment described in ref. The experimental data are in clear agreement with the quantum model.

All authors discussed the results and commented on the manuscript. If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates.\nFor example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x 0 neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum. When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result x , the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x. During a measurement , on the other hand, the change of the initial wave function into another, later wave function is not deterministic, it is unpredictable i.\nA time-evolution simulation can be seen here. Wave functions change as time progresses.\nHowever, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a definite, certain position eigenstate. Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such \"static\" wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus , whereas in quantum mechanics, it is described by a static, spherically symmetric wave function surrounding the nucleus Fig.\nRelated Quantum Mathematical Physics: Atoms, Molecules and Large Systems\nCopyright 2019 - All Right Reserved","This is a summary of the talk “Quantum Computers vs. Computers Security”, given at the DEF CON 23 Hacking Conference in Las Vegas in August 2015 by Kudelski Security Principal Cryptographer, Jean-Philippe Aumasson.\nIncreasing numbers of cybersecurity experts and stakeholders are watching developments closely in the field of quantum computing. A quantum computer is a model of a computer that works completely differently from a classical one. It’s based on phenomena of quantum mechanics that facilitate the resolution of certain problems that classical computers cannot solve, e.g. breaking the crypto used for e-commerce transactions. How does a quantum computer work? Although it leverages complex quantum mechanical phenomena, the core concepts are pretty simple:\n- Whereas a classical computer works on bits that are either 0 or 1, a quantum computer works on qubits, which can be 0 and 1 simultaneously. In quantum physics, this is called superposition.\n- Superposition is characterized by some probabilities, but not the usual ones: a quantum computer relies on negative probabilities, which are called amplitudes.\n- The actual computation is not performed with usual computer operations such as addition or bitwise logic, but uses basic linear algebra transformations, similar to operations between vectors and matrices like in high school physics.\nThe good (or bad) news is that quantum computers don’t exist yet. Building a quantum computer is a gigantic and fascinating engineering challenge, and we don’t know for sure if it’s even doable. There’s been some progress over the last decade, and some large companies are investing in quantum computing research – but don’t expect a useful quantum computer within the next decade! Cryptographers obviously pay special attention to quantum computing research. A large enough quantum computer could totally break the RSA and Diffie-Hellman cryptographic algorithms, and more generally, all cryptography based on the mathematical problems of factoring integers (such as RSA) and of solving discrete logarithms (such as Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve cryptography). In short, if a quantum computer is created today, we’re doomed! But there’s hope: the field of post-quantum cryptography is about creating cryptographic systems that can resist quantum computers. These experimental systems are based on different mathematical problems that are expected to be hard for both classical and quantum computers to solve. One such family of hard problems is that of NP-complete problems, which occurs in many contexts. For example, the problem of finding the optimal scheduling of a group of events is NP-complete. And quantum computers cannot solve NP-complete problems. Quantum physics has more potential applications to cybersecurity than of just breaking crypto:\n- Quantum key distribution establishes a secure link between two systems, leveraging quantum physics laws to prevent eavesdropping. Such systems are practical and are being deployed, though their actual added value in terms of security is sometimes disputed.\n- Quantum money uses the physical “no-cloning” principle to prevent counterfeiting. Quantum money is only a theoretical idea, and seems difficult to put in practice.\n- Quantum machine learning is an emerging field that attempts to leverage quantum computers to improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:96fc3503-7375-4c8e-a260-742c001826fe>","<urn:uuid:032ff763-3a89-4778-b161-4c41b62c5f7e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should I handle teething pain in puppies vs babies? Need advice for both.","answer":"For puppies, you can help by providing safe, durable but soft chew toys, frozen treats to soothe inflamed gums, and puzzle toys like Kong products filled with treats. Exercise and keeping them active can also help distract from teething discomfort. For babies, recommendations include using frozen washcloths, frozen teething rings, and if needed, Motrin or Advil for comfort. Both puppies and babies may show signs of discomfort before teeth break through - puppies may chew excessively and rarely might be reluctant to eat, while babies may experience some discomfort and show a drop in appetite. It's important to ensure both stay well hydrated during teething.","context":["What is Teething in Puppies?\nTeething is a term that refers to the process of permanent teeth coming in to your puppies’ mouth. Permanent teeth will replace the baby teeth.\nTell me More About Puppy Teeth\nThe teeth are located on both sides of the mouth with two rows of upper teeth that are anchored in the maxilla bone of the face. Two rows of lower teeth are anchored in the jaw bones (mandibular bone).\nDogs generally have 28 baby teeth, also referred to as deciduous teeth, and 42 adult or permanent teeth.\nWhen Does Puppy Teething Typically Start?\nPuppies, like human babies, are born without teeth. Only the gum surface is visible. This allows them to nurse without hurting the mother.\nThere are two stages to teething. The first is when the puppy gets in his baby teeth and the second is when the baby teeth fall out and your puppy gets his adult teeth. Things happen quickly in puppies as compared to humans.\nWhen a puppy reaches 21 to 30 days of age, their deciduous or temporary (baby) teeth start to break through the gums. This is referred to as “erupting.” The exact age for this will differ amongst breeds and can even vary within puppies of the same litter.\nPuppies have a total of 28 deciduous teeth by the time they reach 45 days of age (just over 6 weeks of age). The first teeth to break through are the incisors which are at the top front of the upper and lower jaws. These can begin as early as 14 – 21 days but often are closer to 30 days. After this – the needle like canine teeth (often called the fang teeth) appear between days 30 and 45. The teeth behind them in the back of the mouth are the premolars and molars and come in between days 21 and 45.\nThe second phase of teething is when the adult teeth start coming in which generally starts around 8 weeks of age and most breeds show permanent teeth at 6 to 7 months of age.\nTeething is often worst between 12 and 20 weeks of age.\nWhen Do the Adult Teeth Start to Come in?\nThe permanent teeth include six pairs of sharp incisor teeth, which are in the front of the mouth, surrounded by two pairs of large canine teeth. The premolar teeth are located just behind the canine teeth. The molars sit behind the premolars and are located towards the back of the mouth.\nEruption of the permanent teeth is as follows:\n- Central: 2-5 months\n- Intermediate: 2-5 months\n- Corner: 4-5 months\n- 5 months\n- First: 4-5 months\n- Second: 6 months\n- Third: 6 months\n- Fourth: 4-5 months\n- First: 5-6 months\n- Second: 6-7 months\n- Third: 6-7 months\nWhat are Signs of Teething?\nSome puppies are more bothered by teething than others. This may be because of soreness and swelling in the gums before a tooth comes through.\nSymptoms associated with teething usually begin about 1 to 3 days before the tooth shows, and signs generally disappear as soon as the tooth breaks the skin. Many puppies don’t seem to be affected by teething at all.\nPuppies often chew to help relieve the pressure in their gums. In rare cases, puppies may be reluctant to eat and drink because their mouths hurt.\nHow Can You Help Your Puppy While Teething?\nTeething is worst between 12 and 20 weeks of age but is noticed by most puppy owners around 8 weeks which is a common time to acquire a new puppy. By the time your puppy is about 6 months old – they will have all of their adult teeth. Here are some tips to help your puppy feel better while teething:\n- Provide safe chew toys. Toys ideal to use during teething should be durable (can’t be chewed and swallowed) but are soft in texture so they don’t damage the teeth coming in.\n- Plush toys are great but have the risk of being shredded and eaten causing a life-threatening foreign body so they are not recommended.\n- Some treats can be frozen which can soothe inflamed gums while chewing.\n- Puzzle toys are often great ways to keep your puppy busy and occupied (and keep their mind off their teething). Examples of good puzzle toys include the Kong products and Buster Cube. You can often fill these toys with treats such as a kibble of food, soft food, or peanut butter. Many puppies will spend minutes to hours trying to get the treat out.\n- Rawhide type chews are popular but can be dangerous as large chucks are chewed and eaten. Rawhides are not recommended as chew toys.\n- Encourage exercise. Keep your puppy active and busy so they aren’t just focused on their mouths. Encourage them to run and play such as fetch. Take a walk. Do some training such as teach your dog to sit, stay, roll-over.\n- Rotate toys. Puppies can be bored by playing with the same toy day after day. Rotate toys after you notice your puppy isn’t playing with it like he used to then rotate it back in when he or she is bored again. Or if the toy is a puzzle toy – refill it with a treat.","When should my child first visit the dentist?\nThe American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Dental Association recommend that your child’s first pediatric dental visit should be scheduled once the first tooth erupts or by age one. At your child’s first dental visit, your pediatric dentist will perform a comprehensive exam to ensure your little one’s teeth are erupting properly. Your dentist will also review important oral health and diet practices that will minimize decay. After your initial visit, your little one should continue to see the dentist every six months.\nWhy are baby teeth so important?\nOne of the most common questions we get is, “Why are baby teeth important? They are going to fall out anyway.” Primary teeth are vital for your child’s overall health and play an important role in facial growth and development. They also act as natural space maintainers and guide the eruption of the adult teeth. Decay in primary teeth can cause pain, swelling, infection and early loss of primary teeth.\nWhen will my child’s teeth begin to grow in?\nTeeth development in general begins before birth for baby teeth and around birth for permanent teeth. Typically, the lower front teeth will begin to erupt at approximately 6 months on average.\nThe permanent teeth typically begin to erupt at age 6 with the lower front teeth and the adult molars and will end around age 12.\nWhat is teething?\nTeething occurs when baby teeth begin to grow in. While this is relatively problem-free for most children, others may experience some discomfort. We recommend frozen washcloths, frozen teething rings and if needed, some Motrin or Advil to provide comfort through this process. You may notice a drop in appetite, but it’s important to ensure that your little one is well hydrated.\nIt is always wise to contact your dentist or health professional if you have additional questions or concerns about teething.\nHow can I clean my little one’s teeth?\nFor infants, you can use a washcloth and water to clean the gums, but once the teeth begin to erupt, a soft bristled toothbrush can be introduced. The current ADA and AAPD guidelines recommend that a rice size amount of fluoridated toothpaste can be used for this age group.\nBottle use or nursing at bedtime\nPutting a baby to sleep with a bottle of milk or juice, or nursing a baby to sleep can be harmful to the teeth. The normal mechanisms that help keep teeth clean during the day, like salivary flow, are much lower at night. Meanwhile the teeth are bathed in sugar from the drinking or nursing, which provides a perfect environment for decay.\nChildren who frequently bottle- or breastfeed while napping, sleeping, or between meals, run the risk of developing extensive tooth decay. Fruit / citrus juices, and sweetened beverages cause the most damage. You can brush your baby’s teeth after the last feed at night with a soft-bristled toothbrush and use a washcloth to wipe the teeth if your infant has multiple feeds throughout the night.\nPreventing early–childhood caries\nEarly-childhood caries is formerly known as baby-bottle tooth decay or nursing caries. The condition occurs when a child is overexposed to sugary liquids. Severe early childhood caries usually occurs when the child is routinely put to bed with a bottle containing juice, soda, or milk. It can also occur as a result of “grazing” with a sippy cup.\nEarly-childhood caries can destroy teeth, require major dental treatment, and even potentially damage your child’s adult teeth if left untreated. To prevent this condition:\n- Help your child start learning to drink from a regular cup by their first birthday.\n- If your child “grazes,” only allow water in any bottles or sippy cups used.\n- Clean your baby’s gums with a fresh gauze pad after each feeding.\n- Begin brushing as soon as you see the first tooth.\n- Never give your child a pacifier coated in sugar or dipped in honey.\n- The bacteria that causes caries is transmissible, avoid sharing drinks or kissing your baby close to the mouth, especially if you have not seen your dentist for regular appointments.\nThumb sucking or pacifier use\nSucking is a normal reflex for infants and is present even before birth. It helps infants to self soothe. Most children stop sucking fingers, thumbs, or pacifiers on their own; but some children may continue beyond toddlerhood. Every effort should be made to help your child move on from thumbs or paci’s by age 4 or 5. Prolonged thumb sucking or pacifier use can result in orthodontic changes such as a narrowed arch. As the adult front teeth begin to come in, if the habit persists, the teeth can be flared.\nDental emergencies are common as toddlers become more mobile and active. Precautionary measures such as childproofing your home are a great first step. It is, however, impossible to watch your toddler every moment of the day, and emergencies can happen even under the most watchful eyes!\nEstablishing a good dental home for your little one where they can be evaluated as quickly as possible is important. And of course if a fall or trauma goes beyond dental, call 911 or take your toddler to the ER to be evaluated for more serious head or neck injuries."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:47db2749-e416-49ed-804f-70c817e560ae>","<urn:uuid:66fa5d3b-b7bb-4b3f-ae9d-d66610bfaed7>"],"error":null}
