{"question":"How do sex determination mechanisms differ between mammals and birds?","answer":"In mammals, sex determination is based on XX/XY chromosomes where XX develops as females and XY as males, with SRY gene on the Y chromosome acting as a switch for male development. In birds, while they also have chromosomal sex determination, they use a ZZ/ZW system without an analogous sex determining gene like SRY driving sex development, and females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) while males are homogametic (ZZ).","context":["No, we haven’t gone all Carrie Bradshaw on all of y’all. Last evening’s enthralling discussions with this week’s fantastic @RealScientists curator @turtlesatJCU about temperature-dependent sex determination in turtles – how the temperature of the sand they are surrounded by dictates the sex of the developing turtle embryo – reminded this particular RS admin just how wonderfully bizarre sex determination is in an evolutionary sense.\nIt’s generally the case that if something’s important, it’s important to make sure that the instructions for making it aren’t easy to lose. Anyone who’s tried to assemble a flat pack Ikea wardwobe without the cartoon diagrams or the Allen key would attest to this. So it is with vertebrate development. The developmental pathways – the basic blueprints, floorplan, instructions, Lego pieces, however you want to think of them – which underpin key developmental structures are, in general, strongly conserved (that is, they’ve not changed much through evolution.) The genes which are expressed and the cell types which are involved in directing the making of a limb – in particular its outgrowth and its ‘patterning’ (a developmental biology term for how future adult structures are laid out in the developing embryo) – are the same between all vertebrates. All there is, really, is a little tweaking in terms of expression domains (i.e. the precise timing of when key developmental regulators are switched on and off, and in what cells of the developing limb) to produce a whale flipper from the same basic genetic ‘blueprints’ as the bat wing. This idea that if it’s important, it’s conserved, runs right through evolution (and particularly ‘evo devo’, the research field at the intersection of evolution and development). One of the most important genes in human heart development is the analogue of one which directs development of the heart in the fruit fly Drosophila, called Tinman.*\nExcept you can chuck all that out the window with sex determination. You’d think that since sex was such an important evolutionary construct – the ability to reshuffle the genes of your offspring to create the potential for evolutionary advantage is clearly crucial to the success of the majority of animal species, since so many have it – that the instructions for how to create different genders which can make with the bunga-bunga in order to recombine chromosomes and create new genotypes would go right back in the evolutionary lineage.\nMammals like us (assuming you are a human, which I feel is a reasonable leap of confidence) have a system based on the inheritance of the sex chromosomes X and Y, where embryos with two Xs develop as females and those who inherit an X and a Y develop as males. This was pinned down in the late 80s/early 90s to a particular gene on the Y chromosome called SRY (sex determining region on the Y chromosome – mouse and human researchers aren’t as interesting with their gene names as Drossie peeps) which acts as a ‘switch’ midway through gestation. If it’s there, its expression is switched on briefly in the embryonic precursor tissue of the gonad (which, uniquely in development, is a developmental structure that can go on to form two completely different organs from the same origin tissue) and the testis development pathway is kicked off – if it’s not, i.e. if you’re XX, SRY isn’t expressed, and the pathway ‘defaults’ to female (and yes this is a slightly patriarchal view which has been challenged but we’ll set that aside for the moment). But SRY and XX/XY is by-and-large a mammalian deal. Reptiles, as discussed on @RealScientists last night, have temperature-dependent sex determination; it’s thought a reptile with TSD may have been the evolutionary precursor of vertebrate species with chromosomal sex determination. Birds such as chickens have chromosomal sex determination, a bit like XX/XY (it’s ZZ/ZW) but there’s no analogous sex determining gene driving the development of one sex or the other. Some fish have sex determining chromosomes or genes a bit like an SRY in broad function, but nothing like it in terms of molecular or genetic similarity; other fish have TSD. Drosophila have an inheritable sex chromosome (XX/X0) but again the molecular ‘bits of Lego’ involved are nothing alike other species. Nematode worms (C. elegans, another invertebrate ‘model organism’) have an unrelated XX/XO system which directs development of males, females and hermaphrodites. What we have here then is a critical developmental process, central to the survival of the majority of successful animal species on Earth, which has bugger-all in common at the level of how that process is switched on between those species. It looks like case after case of evolutionary novelty – that is, nearly each species has evolved a completely different way of determining sex, and has run with it.\nWhat’s interesting though is the ‘downstream’ stuff often IS conserved, even in species with very different means of reproduction, or gonad structures. Hormones like aromatase, and key regulatory genes such as DAX1, DMRT1 and SOX9 which are critical in mammalian sex determination and gonad development keep turning up in the pathways of other species, even those without ‘genetic’ sex determination like reptiles with TSD. In an evo-devo sense, pretty much the same genetic players and partners are deployed in the process of making boy and girl bits – they’ve just been co-opted into the process by completely different switch mechanisms, which are evolved and selected for with no apparent commonality.\nFor further reading on this, have a search for ‘evolution of sex determination’ on Google Scholar. Or look it up on Wikipedia, which is generally pretty good for SCIENTS stuff.\nAnd to finish, BABBY TURTLES.\n*Drosophila researchers have always been big on the quasi-amusing gene names, usually named for some characteristic of a ‘mutant’ strain generated with that gene ‘knocked out’. They go a bit weird cooped up in fly rooms counting and classifying wing variants on tiny fruit flies. Many of which have a habit of flying up the noses of the investigators, if not anaesthatised correctly. Apparently they taste like sesame seeds. Don’t ask.","Sex Determination between Two Individuals of Same Species!\nThe sex is hereditary difference between two individuals of same species. Sex is one of the most conspicuous and interesting kinds of hereditary differences observed among individuals of same species.\nDetermination of sex is determined at the time of fertilization, when the male and female gametes fuse together.\nA. Male heterogamy:\nMales form two types of gametes. One gamete possesses X chromosome and other lacks it. In some cases male may possess a Y chromosome. Such males are known as heterogametic. Females in such cases form only one type of gamete which contain X chromosome.\nMale heterogamy is of two types:\n1. ‘XX — XY’ type:\nBy 1900, when microscope techniques had become quite well developed and chromosome behaviour was understood, it was noticed that there was one pair of chromosomes that differed from others. In females, the members of this pair were similar, but differ in appearance in other sex (males).\nThe two chromosomes, that were alike (in female) were the same as one of the members of the unlike pair in male. The chromosome which was present in pair in female and single in male was identified as X chromosome. In males, the other chromosome was called as Y. So, the two sexes can be characterized as under (Fig. 5.32).\nFemale = XX\nMale = XY\nX-chromosomes were first identified by Wilson and Stevens in 1905. The so called XY system occurs in wide variety of animals including Drosophila and mammals, as well as at least in some plants (e.g. Lychnis — an angiosperm).\nX and Y chromosomes are called sex chromosomes (allosomes), the remaining ones of a given complement, which are same in both sexes are called autosomes. The type of system discussed above is called XX-XY system.\n2. ‘XX —XO’ type:\nAnother system reported is XX-XO. In 1902 an American McClung reported that the somatic cells of female grasshopper bears 24 chromosomes, whereas those of males had only 23. Thus in many insects there is a chromosomal difference between the sexes, female being referred to as XX having two X chromosomes and males as XO (“X – Oh” with one X chromosome).\nAs a result of meiosis all the eggs of such species carry on X chromosome, whereas only half of the sperms have one, the other half having none. Since the males produce two types of gametes X or O in XO type and X and Y in XY type, they are called heterogametic. Females are homogametic producing only one type of gamete with X chromosome.\nB. Female heterogamy:\nIn such cases females produce two types of gametes. One egg contains X and other lacking it (X) or containing Y chromosome. Thus the male is AAXX and female is AAXO or AAXY. For the sake of convenience and to avoid confusion the standard practice is that in these organisms X is denoted to as Z and Y as W.\nFemale heterogamy is also of two types.\n1. ZZ—ZW type:\nAnother interesting ZZ-ZW system has been found in some birds including domestic .fowl, butterflies and some fishes. In this case females are heterogametic and males are homogametic. Sex chromosomes here have been designated as Z and W to avoid confusion with instances where female is homogametic. Females here are ZW and males ZZ (Fig. 5.34).\n2. ZO—ZZ’ type:\nIn ZO-ZZ type of sex determination which occurs in some butterflies and moths. It is opposite to that found in Cockroaches and Grasshoppers. Here females have odd sex chromosome (AA+Z) while the males have two homomorphic sex chromosomes (AA+ZZ).\nThe females are heterogametic. They produce two types of eggs, male forming with one sex chromosome (A + Z) and female forming without the sex chromosome (A + O). The males are homographic, forming similar types of sperms (A + Z). The two sexes are obtained in the progeny in equal ratio (Fig. 5.35) as both the types of eggs are produced in equal ratio.\nSex determination in man:\nA human male has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome and 22 pairs of autosomes, making a total of 46. The females have a pair of X chromosomes and 22 pairs of autosomes, again making a total of 46. The sex chromosomes segregate at meiosis just as the other chromosomes do, s6 this means that each sperm cell will receive only one sex chromosome.\nHence at the time of spermatogenesis, there will be two types of sperm cells produced in equal numbers, those containing an X chromosome and those containing a Y chromosome. Each of the eggs produced by female will contain one X chromosome. Therefore, the sex of progeny is determined at the time of fertilization of egg.\nIf the egg is fertilized by a sperm bearing a Y chromosome (along with 22 ordinary chromosomes in man), the zygote will have an X and Y and will develop male. If egg is fertilized by an X sperm, the zygote will have two X chromosomes and will develop into female (Fig. 5.36).\nFew Drosophila individuals were found to be having half of the body as male and other half as female. They are called as gynandromorphs.\nThree types of gynanders or gynandromorphs can be differentiated:\n1. Bilateral gynanders:\nHere the half lateral side is of male and other half is of female.\n2. Antero-posterior gynanders:\nHere the anterior end of the animal is of one sex and posterior of other.\n3. Sex piebalds:\nIn this case, female fly bears irregularly scattered spots of male tissue. Morgan and Bridges (1919) explained that in Drosophila, zygote developing into female has two X-chromosomes. Due to loss or disappearance of one X-chromosome during cleavage of fertilized egg, a gynandromorph is formed.\nSex Determination in Plants:\nAllen (1940) gave a list of plant species where sex chromosomes had been reported. Wastergard (1950) prepared a list of plant species where the presence of a pair of heteromorphic sex chromosomes was well established and also of those where it was not established.\nOne of the methods for determining heterogametic sex in plants has been studied in plants like Cannabis and Melandrium. If sex ratios in the progenies from sparse vs. excess pollen differ, it suggests that male sex is heterogametic.\nFor example, in hemp (Cannabis), sparse pollination gave excess males while in Melandrium, sparse pollination gave excess females, suggesting that the male sex is heterogametic in both the cases. If female is heterogametic sparse pollination should give male and females in equal proportion.\nIn Melandrium album, diploids, triploids and tetraploids having different doses of X and Y chromosomes were noticed by Warmeke (1946). It was found that plant is male when one or more Y chromosomes are present and in females Y chromosome is absent.\nThe number of autosome did not visibly affect sex expression. In Melandrium, Y chromosome is longer than X chromosome and they form a heteromorphic bivalve at meiosis.\nGenetic balance theory of sex-determination:\nGenie balance theory of sex determination was proposed by Bridges (1923) who believed that “interaction of genes present in Sex chromosome and autosomes, which governs female and male potency respectively, determines the sex of an offspring. In Drosophila Genie Balance Theory Operates (Y-has no role)\ni.e. X/A = 1 = Female\nX/A = 0.5 = Male\nX/A = between 0.5 to 1 = Inter sex\nMore than 1 = Super female\nLess than 0.5 = Super male\nThe mechanisms of sex determination in plants are similar to those found in animals. Mostly plants are hermaphrodite and it is only in Dioecious plants separate male and female plants are found in papaya, spinach, Vitis, Asparagus etc. It is governed by single gene.\nIn papaya, single, gene with Bires alleles (m, M1, and M2) is suggested to control sex differentiation. Female plants are homozygous (mm.) The males are heterozygous (M1m) and heterozygous (M2m) produces hermaphrodite. In plants, sex is determined by Y chromosome. If Y chromosome is present, the plant is male, otherwise female.\nMorgan and Drosophila:\nDrosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) meaning “black- bellied dew lover” was first investigated intensively in the laboratories of Columbia University in New York City, where Walter Sutton had earlier been a graduate student. Here Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1910 discovered a fruit fly with white eyes in a vial of flies with normal red eyes.\nThomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945). Morgan’s discovery of sex-linked traits in Drosophila led to experiments that collectively yielded chromosome “maps”—identification of the genes carried by each chromosome, and the approximate location of each gene on a chromosome.\nHe was raising thousands of red eyed flies in bottles, supplying mashed bananas as food. What was the basis for this variation? The gene for white eyes arose as a mutation of a gene which is on the X-chromosome and which is involved in the production of eye pigment.\nMounting evidence for the chromosome theory of heredity, came mostly from the study of Drosophila. Mutations ought to involve changes in chromosome structure because genes were present on chromosome as discussed in chromosomal theory of heredity.\nT. H. Morgan mainly studied the inheritance of mutant traits in Drosophila because for him, they were less expensive to rear than other animals like mice and rabbit. However, his study to work on Drosophila proved most rewarding for the investigations in genetics.\nDrosophila is a suitable material for the genetical experiments due to the following reasons:\n(a) Its generation time is 12-14 days, which is helpful in rapid study and analysis of results in laboratory.\n(b) It can be multiplied in large number under laboratory conditions.\n(c) A large number of flies are produced in each progeny. A pair of flies in a small milk is able to produce hundreds of progeny in a single mating.\n(d) Fly breeding could be done throughout the year in a laboratory with inexpensive material.\n(e) Each cell of Drosophila melanogaster has four pairs of chromosomes. Out of which three pairs of chromosomes are similar in male and female and are called autosomes. The males possess one X chromosome and one Y chromosome producing two kinds of sperms; half with X chromosome and half with Y chromosome.\nThe Y chromosome is typically J shaped. Female possesses two homomorphic X chromosomes in their body cells, hence referred as XX. Being homogametic, females produce only one kind of eggs, each with one X chromosome.\nMorgan with his breeding experiments on Drosophila (later extended by A.H. Sturtevant, C.B. Bridges and H.J. Muller), concluded that genes (units of heredity) are located on chromosome in a linear fashion.\nSome of them lie close to each other and tendency to have linked together. C.B. Bridges (1916), one of the Morgan’s graduate students at Columbia University published a paper entitled “Non-disjunction as proof of chromosome theory of heredity” and gave detailed evidence that established beyond question the conclusion that the genes are physically associated with chromosomes.\nMorgan’s discovery of sex linked traits in Drosophila led to experiments that collectively yielded chromosome maps i.e. identification of the genes carried by each chromosome and the approximate location of each gene on a chromosome. Morgan was awarded with Nobel Prize (for physiology or medicine) in 1933 for his pioneering work in genetics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fd6b7782-aaa1-44b2-b071-c3489830ceb5>","<urn:uuid:cc20ad06-b776-42fb-8574-0026c2433827>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a parent, I'm wondering: what's the difference between how pediatricians and autism specialists assess developmental delays in young children?","answer":"Pediatricians and autism specialists use different approaches to assess developmental delays. Pediatricians primarily interview parents and briefly observe children to ensure they're on a healthy developmental trajectory. In contrast, autism specialists conduct more comprehensive assessments using specific tools like the Infant-Toddler Developmental Assessment (IDA), which includes multiple components: parent interviews, physician reports, observations, and hands-on activities assessment. While pediatricians focus on general developmental progress, autism specialists look for specific behaviors such as problems with social skills, communication, repetitive behaviors, and difficulties with change in daily activities. Both professionals can identify developmental delays, but autism specialists provide more detailed evaluation focusing on ASD-specific characteristics like difficulties with eye contact, understanding feelings, or adapting to routine changes.","context":["Determining if a child has a developmental delay\nThere are steps you can take if you suspect that our child’s development is off-track.\nIt can be one of the most frightening and confusing moments in a parent’s life – the moment when we suspect there might be something atypical about our child. Maybe you’ve noticed that everyone else’s toddler is talking way more than your child or that your child is still creeping when others his age are walking. We have all heard that little voice in the backs of our minds telling us to “watch carefully” at one time or another. However, according to Michigan State University Extension, there are other steps we can take if we suspect that our child’s development is off-track.\nFirst, it’s helpful to become familiar with the jargon or vocabulary of development. Early childhood education and medical professionals organize development into domains. Briefly, these domains include physical development, language development, intellectual (sometimes called cognitive) development and social-emotional development. A developmental milestone is a skill or benchmark that most children are capable of doing at a particular age. A developmental milestone for a newborn is turning her head toward her mother or father when they are speaking, for example.\nA developmental delay is a condition which slows down or delays the typical growth and development process in a child. Some developmental delays are indicators of future learning disabilities. Early detection and intervention can significantly reduce or reverse a developmental delay and most communities have educational professionals who can assess a child’s skills in all domains of development.\nMany parents talk to their pediatrician about their concerns. Pediatricians are knowledgeable about child development and they see children in many stages of development so they have a broad range of experience. Pediatricians interview parents and briefly observe children to make sure that they are on a healthy developmental trajectory.\nParents also may consult their local early childhood special education agency. In Michigan, these agencies are associated with the regional intermediate school districts. The program for children from birth to three years old is Early On. Families with children who are 3 to kindergarten age are served by their local school district.\nA third resource for families who attended an early care and education program would be their child’s teacher or caregiver. Most early childhood educators are familiar with skills of typical development and many programs do regular assessments of children in all domains of development. Teachers see a wide range of development in their classrooms and this experience lends practical knowledge to their formal training. The added bonus is that your child should be well-known by his/her teacher or caregiver.\nThere are many tools pediatricians, education specialists and teachers may use to assess developmental progress. One that is commonly used is the “Ages and Stages Questionnaire” published by Brookes Publishing. For this assessment, parents or a child’s teacher complete a comprehensive set of questions about the child’s observable behavior and skills and can be used with children birth to five years old. Another tool completed by parents is the Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status.\nOne screening test that is used by education specialists is the Infant-Toddler Developmental Assessment (IDA) published by ProEd Publishing. This is a multi-dimensional assessment which includes a parent interview, physicians report, observation and hands-on activities assessment, and report. It, too, covers all domains of development and can be used for children birth through five years old. The Denver Developmental Screening Test is also widely used by education specialists and teachers. As is the IDA, it is a screening tool which is designed to identify the need for further assessment rather than a tool to identify specific developmental delays. It is intended for use by professionals rather than parents.\nThe model that puts professionals and families into a partnership for the process of assessment is generally considered the best model for children. The Council for Exceptional Children has published a document which addresses best practices for professionals and families with children at risk for developmental delays. Families can access this document online to learn more about how assessments can be done appropriately and with less stress on the family. You can also learn more about developmental delays and assessment practices, by reading the MSU Extension article, “What are developmental delays?”","Learn About Autism\nWhat Is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental disability with signs typically appear during early childhood and affect a person’s ability to communicate, and interact with others. ASD is defined by a certain set of behaviors and is a “spectrum condition” that affects individuals differently and to varying degrees. There is no known single cause of autism, but increased awareness, early diagnosis/intervention, and access to appropriate services/supports lead to significantly improved outcomes.\nSome of the behaviors associated with autism include delayed learning of language; difficulty making eye contact or holding a conversation; difficulty with executive functioning, which relates to reasoning and planning; narrow, intense interests; poor motor skills and sensory sensitivities. A person on the spectrum might exhibit many of these behaviors or just a few, and/or many others besides.\nNew to Autism\nThe Autism Society of Wisconsin is here to help guide families who have a child newly diagnosed with autism. Our Next Program can help your family understand what this new diagnosis means, find community resources, and find emotional support. Call our office today to receive a free resource package and/or to connect with other parents who have been down a similar path.\nA printed copy of our Next Step booklet is included in the resource package but is also available electronically.\nTrack Your Child's Developmental Milestones\nThe journey of your child's early years includes many developmental milestones for how he or she plays, learns, speaks, and acts.\nUse this map to learn what to look for in your child. Talk with your child's doctor about these milestones.\nNot reaching these milestones, or reaching them much later than other children, could be a sign on a developmental delay.\nWhat are some of the characteristics of ASDs?\nPeople with ASDs may have problems with social, emotional, and communication skills. They might repeat certain behaviors and might not want change in their daily activities. Many people with ASDs also have different ways of learning, paying attention, or reacting to things.\nMay not understand imagination or play “pretend” games (pretend to “feed” a doll)\nMay not point at objects to show interest (point at an airplane flying over)\nMay spin objects or themselves\nMay have trouble turning attention when directed to\nMay have trouble relating to others or not have an interest in other people at all\nMay avoid eye contact or prefer to be alone\nMay have trouble understanding other people’s feelings or talking about their own feelings\nMay avoid physical contact\nMay not imitate others\nMay appear to be unaware when other people talk to them but respond to other sounds\nMight be very interested in people, but not know how to talk, play, or relate to them\nMight repeat or echo words or phrases in place of normal language (echolalia)\nMay have trouble expressing their needs using typical words or motions\nMay have trouble adapting when a routine changes\nMight have unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel\nMay have difficulty entering conversations and taking turns within conversations\nMay interpret language in the literal sense (may not understand figurative language such as “Let’s hit the road”)\nIf you are concerned about your child’s development, don’t wait – contact your health care provider for an evaluation.\nAutism Across the Lifespan\nLike everyone else, people with autism move through significant life changes. Their quality of life depends not only on the foundation provided in childhood, but also on ongoing supports that are specific to their educational, medical, social, recreational, family, and employment needs.

It should not be just the basic facts about education, family, and death. A biography essay should also involve the information concerning some life experiences and events. The subject of this assignment is someone`s life with the highlight on its different aspects.\nTo put it simply, you have to tell the story of a person`s life. However, while writing you have to be sure you are able to present everything in the correct perspective. Your paper has to be interesting for readers, as well as engaging and memorable.\nAll in all, writing a biography essay can be a fun experience. In order to succeed with this task, you should also be aware of some rules and peculiarities. By learning how to complete a good biography essay, you will manage to make a headway with it.\nStep-by-step Guide for Biography Essay Writing\n- Research your subject\nThe first thing you have to do is to ask a permission from a person whose biography you want to write. It is very important. You have to make sure that the subject of your paper agrees. Getting this permission will facilitate the writing process, and the person will be willing to talk to you directly by providing more valuable information. The next thing to do is to find some information about the subject. You can use some books, letters, pictures, newspapers and newspaper clippings, magazines, internet articles, videos, interviews, existing biographies. All these sources will surely help you. Also, think why this subject is worth to be discussed and whether it will be interesting for people to get to know this information.\n- Interview with the subject and people close to them. It will make your essay more exciting. By interviewing a person, you have a chance to get a story no one else has heard before. It is also a good idea to talk a little to a person`s peers, family members, and friends. They also can have something interesting to tell. You may conduct these interviews by phone or email. However, in person meeting is the best option here.\n- To create a perfect biography essay, it would also be nice to visit some locations that are closely connected with the subject. It can be either a school or a place where he/she spent a childhood. You can also visit some places where some important decisions were made. Take into account the time period in which a person was born and grew up. Do a little research on culture and politics of those times. Not to miss some important facts and events, try to make a timeline of the person’s life. It will help you to organize your work in a proper way.\n- Write the biography. Here you should follow the chronological structure. Start your story from the subject`s birth to the later life. First of all, describe the birth and childhood. Then, the young adulthood and adulthood follow. If a person is still alive, continue telling a story of his/her later life. If not alive, write about death. While writing, do not forget to create a good and effective thesis statement. This will be a sentence with the main idea of your whole biography essay. The thesis statement will help you to organize and structure your essay correctly.\n- Use some flashbacks. It is when you move from the present to the past when telling a story. You can start writing about the present thing and then describe a person`s experience in it in the past. It will make your essay more interesting and engaging.\n- Focus on some important events. These major events may include births, marriages, deaths and great achievements. Try to highlight such moments to show their importance and which changes they have brought to the person`s life. Here you should also identify a major patter in the person`s life.\n- Include your own thoughts about the person. If you are writing a biography of someone`s life, you play a significant role then in making a person`s life story. Do not hesitate whether you should put your own thoughts and opinions about the subject in your essay or not. You should, and it will only add to your paper. Take into account your research and comment on your own views about the person.\n- Polish your work. It is a good idea to show your completed biography to peers, family members or friends. They will provide you with trustworthy feedback. Maybe it will help you to improve the essay and make it really perfect.\nAlso, when you are done with writing, you should check your work for spelling, punctuation and grammar mistakes. Poor quality can turn off the readers.\n- Do not forget to cite all sources used in the biography. While writing biographies, the information from books, articles, magazines, and interviews are usually used. Make sure you cited all sources correctly in accordance with your instructor`s requirements."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:385bfb8a-2996-417a-aed4-e514f56aacbc>","<urn:uuid:3fb4e93e-d809-49d7-b166-206c5422fbdd>"],"error":null}

This article will show how to calculate the volume of a solid and the volume of regular and irregular solids.\nThe method for determining the volume of solid depends on its shape. The volume of a solid is measured in cubic units, i.e., cubic centimeter, cubic meter, cubic feet, etc.\nVolume of a Solid Formula\nHere are the volume formulas for different regular solids:\n- Rectangular prism\nThe volume of a rectangular prism is equal to the product of base area (length times width) and the height of the prism:\nVolume of a solid rectangular prism = l x w x h\nSince we know all sides or edges of a cube are equal in length, then a cube’s volume is equal to any side, or edge cubed.\nVolume of a cube = a³\nThe volume of a prism is equal to the base area’s product and the height of a prism.\nVolume of a prism = Base area x height\n= B x h\nThe volume of a cylinder is equal to the area of its circular base and a cylinder’s height.\nVolume of a cylinder = πr²h\nThe volume of a pyramid is equal to one -third the product of its base area and its height.\nVolume of a pyramid = 1/3Bh\n- Square pyramid\nFor a square pyramid, the volume is given as:\nWhere s is the side length of the base and h is the height of the pyramid.\n- Rectangular pyramid\nThe volume of a rectangular pyramid = 1/3 l w h\nFor a sphere, the volume is given as:\nVolume of a sphere = 4/3 πr³\nSince a cone is a pyramid whose base is circular, therefore, the volume of a cone is:\nVolume = 1/3 πr²h\nThe volume of irregular solids\nSince not all solids are regular in shape, their volumes cannot be determined using a volume formula.\nIn this case, the volume of irregular shaped solids can be found by water displacement method:\nAn irregular-shaped solid is dropped into a graduated cylinder filled with water.\nThe volume of the solid is then found by determining the difference between the initial and final readings of the graduated cylinder.\nThe water displacement method of finding the volume of irregular shaped solids is only suitable if: a solid does not absorb water and also if a solid does not react with water.\nAlternatively, you can find the volume of an irregular shaped object by applying the following steps:\n- First, break down the irregular solid into regular shapes whose volume can be calculated.\n- Calculate the partial volumes of the small shapes\n- Add up the partial volumes to get the total volume of the irregular-shaped solid.\nCompare the volume of a solid sphere with a radius of 2 cm and a solid square pyramid with a base length of 2.5 cm and a height of 10 cm.\nBy the formula, volume of a sphere = 4/3 πr³\n= 4/3 x 3.14 x 2 x 2 x 2\n= 33.49 cm3\nAnd the volume of a square pyramid = 1/3s²h\n= 1/3 x 2.5 x 2.5 x 10\n= 20.83 cm3\nTherefore, the sphere is larger by volume than the pyramid.\nA cylindrical tank of radius 3 m and height 10 has a hemispherical lid of radius 3 m on the top. Find the volume of the tank.\nFirst, calculate the volume of the cylindrical part of the tank.\nVolume of a cylinder = π r² h\n= 3.14 x 3 x 3 x 10\n= 282.6 m3\nVolume of the hemisphere = 2/3 πr³\n= 2/3 x 3.14 x 3 x 3 x 3\n= 56.52 m3\nThe total volume of the tank = volume of the cylinder + volume of the hemisphere\n= 282.6 m3 + 56.52 m3\n= 339.12 m3\nA truncated square pyramid has a height of 15 cm. Suppose the truncated pyramid’s base length and top lengths are 8 cm and 4 cm, respectively. Find the volume of the truncated pyramid.\nA truncated pyramid is an example of a frustum.\nLet the initial height of the pyramid = x\nBy similar triangles\nx/ x – 15 = 8/4\n4x = 8x – 120\n–4x = –120\nx = 30\nTherefore, the height of the pyramid before truncation was 30 cm\nNow, find the volume of the full pyramid\nVolume = 1/ 3 x 8 x 8 x 30\n= 640 cm3\nVolume of the chopped off part of the pyramid = 1/3 x 4 x 4 x (30 – 15)\n= 1/3 x 16 x 15\n= 80 cm3\nSo, the volume of the truncated pyramid = (640 – 80) cm3\n= 560 cm3.\n- A juice carton has the measurements: 5 units by 4 units by 3 units.

Focusing on key turning points in the 20th century, this course examines changes in definitions of identity, modernist thought, nationalism, and views of the West in the Arab world. Students will analyze representative samples of these trends, including social and literary debates, novels, memoirs, poetry, the media, films, and popular music. These texts depict Arab society in a state of transition and change.\nThe course will include key forms of modern Arabic literary genres (i.e. poetry, novels, theatre, short stories), providing a glimpse at Arab society and culture. Readings include literary works written by prominent authors, dealing with dominant cultural topics such as nationalism, religion, gender and women issues, the role of the family and kinship, and social concepts and taboos. Selected texts help delineate the cultural uniqueness of the Arab world, and will include certain major works by authors such as prominent cultural critic and poet Adonis, and leading intellectuals George Tarabishi and Mohammed Abed Al Jabari. Representative samples of poetry and short stories will be covered from throughout the contemporary Arab world.\nAdvanced Arabic: Modern Arabic Poetry in Translation – ARBC 110\nThe course “Modern Arabic Poetry in Translation” offers a window into the richness and sophistication of modern Arabic poetry. It focuses on major themes in Arabic poetry, and will cover the most important poetic texts and works written by the leading Arab poets in contemporary times. It begins with providing a necessary overview of classical Arabic poetic traditions, including pre-Islamic poetry. The course also offers insights into critical aspects of modern Arab culture. It examines the influence of Western literature on modern Arabic poetry and discusses the significant role of modern Arab poets within Arab society. Modern Arabic Poetry in Translation will be taught in English.\nThe Arabic Novel in Translation – ARBC 115\nThis course will focus on a close reading in translation of a number of important twentieth-century Arabic novels. These texts have been chosen both for their exceptional literary merit and for the fact that their themes and forms reflect the distinctive features of Arab modernity. The seminar’s guiding principle is that literature includes politics, history, and culture, and not vice versa.\nThese novels portray the region’s perennial problems of political tyranny, military defeat and exile, patriarchy, and the complex relationship with the West. Because Arab modernity was both accelerated in relation to its Western counterparts and profoundly influenced by the West’s wars and technology, the Arabic novel offers new insights into the manner in which the novel is related to Western narrative and literary theory.\nReadings in Modern Arabic Poetry – ARBC 120\nThe course will provide students with a broad theoretical background and representation of the diversity and richness of modern Arabic poetry. This course will explore and analyze the poetic scene of the Arab world by reading the poetry of leading Arab poets in the Arabic language. The selected poems will focus on major themes in contemporary Arab life. The course will discuss the trends and movements of modern Arabic poetry and talk about the artistic, political and cultural dimensions as reflected in the writings of the best Arab poets.\nThis course will not only be taught in Arabic, but all discussions and presentations will be conducted in Arabic, as well as all written work. After reading and understanding the poems, their vocabulary, idioms, and expressions, we will discuss their artistic and ideological semantics. By the end of the semester, students will be able to place major Arab poets into the correct theoretical and historical context and their place and role in the modern poetic movement.\nPrerequisite: Readings in Modern Arabic Poetry 120 will be taught in Arabic and is open to all students who have successfully completed Arabic 44 or equivalent.\nReadings in Modern Arabic Prose - ARBC 130\nThis course explores Arabic prose, and how it depicts the relationship between the East and the West, and creates and fosters debate on the relationship.

{"question":"What role did ancient oceans play in the emergence of life, and how is modern ocean chemistry changing due to CO2 emissions?","answer":"Ancient oceans were the cradle of life, beginning in shallow continental shelves where stromatolites first appeared. These early bacterial colonies created the conditions necessary for life by producing oxygen and forming the basis for more complex organisms. In modern times, these same oceans are being fundamentally altered by CO2 emissions. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which releases hydrogen ions and reduces pH. This process has already increased dissolved CO2 in oceans by more than 30% since pre-industrial times, making it increasingly difficult for marine organisms to form calcium carbonate shells and skeletons. Even if carbon emissions stopped today, ocean pH is expected to drop by another 0.1 units due to existing CO2 levels.","context":["by Anja Semanco\nLet us think about life at the beginning. Not the false beginning in which we picture some kind of wicked finned fish or terrible trilobite rolling around in the primeval waves of ancient oceans. Not the Devonian period in which we consider the brachiopods and ammonites, the slinking swimmers pushing their way through a burgeoning ocean. No, let us think back further. Only a slim billion years after the earth’s formation, as it hurled through the universe like a pebble of rain in a fierce storm. Just moments after the surface finally firmed a semi-stable crust on which life could begin to take hold.\nImagine then an ocean, stretching down to inky black depths, and filled with a profound emptiness. Barely more than water filling rock, like a great sterile cup holding the potential for eternity. The expansive water world replete with nothing more than the lifeless stones and minerals that have pieced this new creation together. The only deep-sea movement arising from magmatic ocean vents, sending roiling flumes of shimmering, searing water bursting from the ocean floor. Rising through the curls of ocean currents as a ritual. And not a creature paddles through the soup to notice.\nFloat back now to the surface and follow the hull of this primordial ocean, in all its vastness to a clear, warm continental shelf, where the ecotone of empty rock and empty sea meet. This gently sloping mantle of tepid sea water, filled with piercing sun is where it all begins. It starts where everything starts, on the bottom of the ocean.\nHere, the sea is not so empty. Here, rising from the shallow bottom like Grecian pillars, stand the slimy mounds of stromatolites. Wadded into gummy black and green piles that hold firm in the shallow pools as sentinels, watching for the molecules of creation to begin. Geologists believe they are earth’s first life form. And although the stromatolites do not know it, they will serve as the assembled platform, the great heaving crust that will eventually breathe all life into the world.\nThese columnar mounds of archea and cyanobacteria are weaved together in perfect fibrous stoicism on the new earth, in the shallow shelf of the new ocean. As nothing greater than a collection of single celled organisms, they are stitching together the fabric that will support multicellular life.\nBy day, the photosynthetic cyanobacteria take in the sunlight, while producing a layer of sticky mucus. As the sediment of this early sea settles over them, they migrate upward, forever upward, toward the sun, leaving behind a mound of calcium carbonate and other minerals they no longer require. Tumbled upward and forming a spongy scalp, they accept new light into their wriggling single-celled bodies.\nOne expelled puff at a time, these simple bacteria let out a breath of oxygen, like the plants we know today. A super organism hauling the breath of life into an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide. Each exhalation brings the prehistoric world one step closer to cells with a nucleus, cells that gather together to create skin, and gills, and eyes. An insufflation that eventually leads to a nervous system, a brain. To us.\nAnd it all starts here, beneath the waves, in what has long been referred to as the primordial soup, where these simple creatures know nothing more than the ocean waves and themselves. And over time, over the next few billion years, they continue this slow gentle breathing, until the atmosphere begins to take on a different tone. Suddenly an infantile world awakens one morning to find itself filled with a gas unlike any it has ever known. Oxygen. The DNA floating freely in the liquid bacterial bodies notice too. And so they modulate. A helical double twist churns, turning one base pair to another, mutating one letter here and there, until something inconceivable begins.\nLife diversifies, accumulates, multiplies, until the liquid oceans are teeming with it. So much so that they burst forth onto land and overflow over the rocks, rocks that for so long knew nothing more than the wind and the rain. And here they are now, feeling the claws and scales and scuttles of this new life wordlessly plowing onto their shores.\nThe incredible unraveling mystery begins. And so we can look back to our early oceans as a space where the dregs of life accumulated into a deeply textured biota, and know that this is what we are made of. Our blood is saline, we are pumped full of the early oceans. Our cells turn over the molecular oxygen, this universal currency produced by our photosynthetic hosts billions of years ago in the salty shallows. Some of us still regard it as sacred.\nSome of us still stand along the coastlines while the stuff of life washes over the pink soles of our feet and we know that it is all one thing. The tenderness of a milky warm tidal pool, the rapture of gale ripping over the shore, it is all intertwined like rope and we are clinging to it for dear life.\nAnd still the stromatolites breathe on. Changing little over a few billion years, but nothing beyond their wrinkled microbial mats stretching up to the sky. They are still recognizable off the coasts of Australia and Mexico today. And still they breathe and breathe and breathe, letting their oxygen bubble up in the sloshing waves, standing in as living fossils, showing the world as it might have been back at the beginning.\nThe beginning is what I’m searching for. At the top of a mountain in the Snowy Range in Wyoming, I am looking for that baptismal creature, the invigorating confrontation of what is left from the rush of early life. These mountaintops were once the sea level beaches and shallow ocean shelves, clustered with marine life. But geology is a swift river, scarcely waiting a single second before shifting, adjusting to new intricacies. And all of a sudden, wham, the ocean floor is solidified and sitting atop a mountain, and the stromatolites glued like cement to that floor are 12,000 feet up in the air, mineralized, preserved as altars to the past.\nThe little fragile bodies of the bacteria are of course long gone, but the mounds of sediment they left behind fill with minerals and remain. The act of fossilization operates much like a treasure map, leaving behind just enough bits and clues that you can begin to piece together what might be truth, but equally could be wild postulation that later collapses under the weight of new information.\nThe ocean erases, but it also preserves and I am seeking the lone survivors that travelled all this way for all this time. The impulse to see the old world is inexplicable and I am overwhelmed by the thought of these husks of life perched on the mountaintop like fierce gargoyles. I know few who are immune to the thoughts of the light and wild wandering of the cosmos. And these oceanic fossils bring me there, bring me back to the beginning of it all.\nI am weightless as I hurry over the dirt trails and past glacial lakes. There is a sense of urgency looming over me, that I might miss it. That somehow these fossils will pick up and dissolve just before I crest the final lip of the mountain. I know right where they are. I was here three years ago on a field study and my feet pass over the rocks like fingers over braille. It is all familiar.\nI crash through bushes and tree branches along the banks of a glassy glacial pool, and there in the distance, at the far end of the lake, I see it like a cliff, jutting into the water. From here, from the edge of the trail, it might be nothing more than glacial till, a remnant of the mountains past. But I can see its circular brim, the laminations streaking it, waving to me in incomprehensible gestures.\nI descend, through alpine buttercups, sunflowers and lupine. Down the bank, and then it begins. The rocks suddenly change and I notice the wave-like striations, folded into one another. Melting together in a pillowy cluster, these are the footprints of creation. The hillside is strewn with bits of stromatolites. But I am racing towards the largest one, the ‘big daddy,’ resting in the water much like it would have done during its biotic years.\nI tumble down the alpine grass and come to rest on the stromatolite’s surface. Lying down with my belly against it, I don’t even come close to stretching all the way across. I trace my fingers through the valleys and ridges and if I close my eyes I can hear the ocean waves from billions of years ago. I am lying on our origination. I am lying on the beginning of time. So much of who we are began right here, in this collection of preserved ocean life.\nIt is here in this glacial lake, lying on this ancient life that I am reminded just how new we humans are. We are soft lanugo on the head of a baby while the earth grumbles as an old man below us. My hand dips into the chilly lake and I imagine an ocean lapping against my fingertips. I can taste salt in my mouth.\nI sit like that on the edge of the stromatolite for a long time, letting the cool water run over my hands. We are born from the mesmerizing ocean, with the power to create or destroy in the same swift wave. This is the very stuff of life. This is our inheritance.\nAnd as our inheritance we must recognize that just as the cyanobacteria of stromatolites changed the atmosphere drastically, so we too are changing our atmosphere in extreme ways. Rachel Carson pondered this sentiment as well in her famous book, The Sea Around Us.\n“It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose, should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.”\nWe must believe that if a tiny speck of bacteria can alter the course of the earth, then we can do significantly worse. Carson was referring to the testing of nuclear weapons and dumping of nuclear waste in the 1950s. But now we must look to the carbon dioxide we emit. We must look to the acidification of our mother oceans, our earthly wombs. We must watch shelled creatures dissolve before our eyes, and coral turn white as cotton, while we continue to emit, emit, emit.\nCarson’s words hold true more than 60 years later, that regardless of when and how life crumples, the oceans will always be there. And perhaps those oceans, after sitting in perfect silence for billions of years when all other life has been obliterated, will begin the living world again as mounds in a shallow sea. A blob of bacteria gathering to create something new.\nWe are just one more life form jetting our waste into the world. The difference is that we are cursed by the knowledge of our actions and therefore cursed by responsibility.\nThe sea is our creation story. The sea is our mythology. We arose from it just as mysteriously as any other miracle.\nWe can look to stromatolites as the irrevocable truth that no matter how small the life, no matter how seemingly insignificant, as a collection, any organism can change the world. As a collection, we are changing the world in one way, but I believe as a collection we can also change it back.\nLike the tides, we flow, but we can also ebb. We can pull back our impact.\nGeology speaks in time and through our need for consumption, production, progress, we humans are speaking over it. We are yelling louder than geology by speeding up processes that take thousands and millions of years. We are yelling over geology, we are yelling over nature, and we are yelling over ourselves. We are hoarse with all there is to say.\nThe oceans hear us. They are harboring our toddler like tantrums in the form of depleted fisheries, ocean acidification, miles of slick spilled oil. Yet they are silent. Or so we believe they’re silent. We never stop shouting long enough to listen.\nI thought all these thoughts as I lay belly to stromatolite, breathing my own breath of life. The glacial lake became a silent, waveless ocean. The glacial lake was a stilled mind. I was back at the beginning but I was also at the end. From rise to fall it all cycles through whether we want it to or not. We have the choice to show up for it, or wait crouched in the water with our eyes shut tight.\nThere is something primordial about the silence. I watch the little fishes peak out from beneath the fossil and wondered how much more it knew than I, if only I could hear it.\nWe are on the cusp of the beginning. We are on the cusp of the end. We are standing on the edge of the oceanic shelf, peering out over what is held below in black water. We cannot know what it contains. We are stromatolites piling up. If we listen, we might hear the depths calling to us, telling us something new.\nThe sea is our mother, our womb. I leave the stromatolite believing we are kin.\nRachel Carson said, “Eventually man, too, found his way back to the sea. Standing on its shores, he must have looked out upon it with wonder and curiosity, compounded with an unconscious recognition of his lineage.”\nAnja Semanco is a Boulder, Colorado based writer.

Last December, the respected journal “Oceanography” published projections (see graphic below) for this rising acidity, measured by falling pH [i], through to the end of the century [ii].\nThe current debate on the connection between CO2 emissions and climate change has largely overlooked an independent and equally serious problem, the increasing acidity of our oceans. Last December, the respected journal “Oceanography” published projections (see graphic below) for this rising acidity, measured by falling pH [i], through to the end of the century [ii]. In 2095, the projected average ocean surface pH is 7.8, and lower still in the Arctic Ocean.\nFig 1: Ocean surface pH - historical values and projected future values based on current emission projections.\nCO2 in the atmosphere has increased from 278 ppm in pre-industrial times to 390 ppm today. During this time, the amount of CO2 dissolved in the ocean has risen by more than 30% [iii], decreasing the pH of the ocean by 0.11 units. As with CO2 and global warming, there is some lag between cause and effect. That means that, even if all carbon emissions stopped today, we are committed to a further drop of up to 0.1 units.\nThe close relationship between CO2 in the atmosphere, CO2 dissolved in the ocean, and the effect of the latter in falling pH, is illustrated by the graph [iv] below:\nFig 2: Annual variations in atmospheric CO2, oceanic CO2, and ocean surface pH. Strong trend lines for rising CO2 and falling pH.\nCO2 dissolves in waterto form carbonic acid. (It is worth noting that carbonic acid is what eats out limestone caves from our mountains.) In the oceans, carbonic acid releases hydrogen ions (H+), reducing pH, and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).\nCO2 + H2O => H+ +HCO3- (1)\nThe additional hydrogen ions released by carbonic acid bind to carbonate ions (CO32-), forming additional HCO3-.\nH+ + CO32- => HCO3- (2)\nThis reduces the concentration of CO32-, making it harder for marine creatures to take up CO32- to form the calcium carbonate needed to build their exoskeletons.\nCa2+ + CO32- => CaCO3 (3)\nThe two main forms of calcium carbonate used by marine creatures are calcite and aragonite. Decreasing the amount of carbonate ions in the water makes conditions more difficult for both calcite users (phytoplankton, foraminifera and coccolithophore algae), and aragonite users (corals, shellfish, pteropods and heteropods).\nThe photo below left shows healthy specimens of calcifying phytoplankton Gephyrocapsa oceanica. The photo below right shows the damage to the same creature under conditions expected by the end of the century.\nFig 3: Healthy phytoplankton; same species with malformed shell plates as a result of damage by seawater with simulated end of century chemistry.\nSource: Nature, Reduced Calcification of Marine Phytoplankton in Response to Increased Atmospheric CO2, Issue 407 p.364 -367\nIt is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words.\nResearch in the Southern Ocean provides evidence that the formation of foraminifera shells is already being affected. Even though these creatures use calcite, which is less soluble than aragonite, there are already clear signs of physical damage. According to Dr. Will Howard of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre in Hobart, shells of one species of foraminifera (Globigerina bulloides) are 30 to 35 percent thinner than shells formed prior to the industrial period.[vi]. The photo below left shows a pre-industrial exoskeleton of this species obtained from sea-floor sediment. The photo below right shows a exoskeleton of a live specimen of the same species obtained from the water column in the same area in 2007. These stunning images were obtained using an electron microscope. (An interview with Dr. Howard was broadcast on the Catalyst television program). [vii] What is staggering is the amount of erosion in the right image compared to the left. The right sample look porous with larger holes and a 10-fold increase in their number. These and creatures like them are at the base of an ocean food chain, and they are already seriously damaged. If they are lost, it is not just biodiversity we are losing, but our food supply as well.\nFig 4. Pre-industrial and current samples of Globigerina bulloides from same location. Latter shows extensive erosion with a ten-fold increase in holes.\nSource: Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Ocean Acidification – The Big Global Warming Story, 13 September 2007\nThe implications of all of this are disturbing. For corals to absorb aragonite from seawater, the latter needs to be saturated in this mineral.\nNow a report from NOAA scientists found large quantities of water undersaturated in aragoniteare already upwelling close to the Pacific continental shelf from Vancouver to northern California [v]. Although the study only dealt with the area, the authors suggest that other shelf areas may be experiencing similar effects.\nFor corals like those in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the outlook is grim. They are threatened with destruction on two fronts, both caused by CO2 emissions. Not only do increased ocean temperatures bleach coral by forcing them to expel the algae which supplies them with energy (see photo at left) [viii], but increased ocean CO2 reduces the availability of aragonite from which reefs are made.\nIt is time to wake up. Our planet is dying. I urge you to find the time to view a 20 minute documentary on the problem of ocean acidification produced by the international Natural Resource Defence Council.

{"question":"how do docs treat achalasia??","answer":"The main treatments for achalasia include: pneumatic dilation (stretching the LES muscle with an inflated balloon), Heller myotomy surgery (making small incisions in the LES), botulinum toxin type A injections into the LES (causing temporary relaxation), and medications for those who cannot tolerate surgery or botulinum therapy.","context":["Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey\n195 Little Albany Street\nNew Brunswick, NJ 08903-2681\nAchalasia is a relatively rare disorder of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular tube that carries food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. Achalasia makes it difficult for food and liquid to pass into the stomach from the esophagus.\nThere is a muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This is where the esophagus meets the stomach. When not swallowing, the LES remains closed to keep food, liquid, and stomach acid from moving back into the esophageal tube. When swallowing, nerve signals tell muscles to contract to push food down the esophagus (an action called peristalsis). This allows the LES to open.\nIn people with achalasia, the nerve cells in the lower esophageal tube and the LES do not work correctly. This results in:\nWhile achalasia is associated with the loss of nerve cells in the esophagus, the cause of this process is unknown.\nThere are no known risk factors for achalasia.\nSymptoms of achalasia can occur between the ages of 25 and 60. Symptoms rarely develop in children. Symptoms tend to be mild at first, and then grow worse over months or years. The main symptom is difficulty swallowing solids and, as the disorder progresses, liquids. Nearly all people with achalasia have difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids.\nOther symptoms may include:\nCopyright © Nucleus Medical Media, Inc.\nThe doctor will ask about your symptoms and medical history. A physical exam will be done. Tests may include:\nThe goal of treatment is to make it easier for the LES to open. Treatment may include:\nThis treatment stretches the LES muscle. A thin tube is inserted into the throat. At the end of this tube is an uninflated balloon. When the tube reaches the LES muscle, the balloon is inflated. Pneumatic dilation has a high success rate. It is the primary treatment in most people, although the procedure may need to be repeated.\nSmall incisions are made in the LES to help it relax. This is called Heller myotomy surgery. This can usually be performed via laparoscopy, making it a relatively minor surgical procedure. Because the LES is partially cut, about some people experience gastroesophageal reflux symptoms after this surgery.\nTiny amounts of botulinum toxin type A are injected into the LES. Botulinum causes the LES to relax, which makes it easier to open. Since the effect is temporary, repeat injections are almost always needed. The response decreases with successive injections.\nCertain medications may help those that cannot tolerate surgery and do not have success with botulinum therapy. The symptom relief is temporary.\nThere are no current guidelines to prevent achalasia because the cause is not known.\nAmerican Gastroenterological Association\nFamily Doctor—American Academy of Family Physicians\nCanadian Association of Gastroenterology\nAchalasia.

{"question":"Hey! I need to know how cybernetics and industrial psychology evolved during World War periods - what's the connection?","answer":"Both fields significantly evolved during World Wars. Cybernetics saw major developments during WWII, with early applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits being used to control gun mounts and radar antenna. At MIT's Servomechanisms Laboratory, Jay Forrester worked on electronic control systems for the U.S. Navy. Similarly, Industrial Psychology flourished during both World Wars. In WWI, psychologists led by Robert Yerkes developed the Army Alpha and Army Beta group tests for mental ability and personnel selection. During WWII, the field expanded further due to growing military demands, leading to the creation of Division 14 (Industrial and Business Psychology) within the American Psychological Association, which later evolved into the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.","context":["Individual differences |\nMethods | Statistics | Clinical | Educational | Industrial | Professional items | World psychology |\nCybernetics is the interdisciplinary study of the structure of complex systems, especially communication processes, control mechanisms and feedback principles. Cybernetics is closely related to control theory and systems theory.\nContemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology and neuroscience in the 1940s. Other fields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include game theory; system theory (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics); psychology, especially neuropsychology, behavioral psychology,cognitive psychology; philosophy and even architecture.[How to reference and link to summary or text]\nThe term cybernetics stems from the Greek Κυβερνήτης (kybernetes, steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder — the same root as government). Cybernetics is a broad field of study, but the essential goal of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems. Studies of this field are all ultimately means of examining different forms of systems and applying what is known to make artificial systems, such as business management, more efficient and effective.\nCybernetic was defined by Norbert Wiener, in his book of that title, as the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine. Stafford Beer called it the science of effective organization and Gordon Pask extended it to include information flows \"in all media\" from stars to brains. It includes the study of feedback, black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms, machines and organizations including self-organization. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks . A more philosophical definition, suggested in 1956 by Louis Couffignal, one of the pioneers of cybernetics, characterizes cybernetics as \"the art of ensuring the efficacy of action\" . The most recent definition has been proposed by Louis Kauffman, President of the American Society for Cybernetics, \"Cybernetics is the study of systems and processes that interact with themselves and produce themselves from themselves\" .\nConcepts studied by cyberneticists include, but are not limited to: learning, cognition, adaption, social control, emergence, communication, efficiency, efficacy and interconnectivity. These concepts are studied by other subjects such as engineering and biology, but in cybernetics these are removed from the context of the individual organism or device.\nOther fields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include game theory; system theory (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics); psychology, especially neuropsychology, behavioral psychology,cognitive psychology; philosophy; anthropology and even architecture.[How to reference and link to summary or text]\nThe Roots of Cybernetic theoryEdit\nThe word cybernetics was first used in the context of \"the study of self-governance\" by Plato in The Laws to signify the governance of people. The words govern and governor are related to the same Greek root through the Latin cognates gubernare and gubernator. The word \"cybernétique\" was also used in 1834 by the physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836) to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge.\nThe first artificial automatic regulatory system, a water clock, was invented by the mechanician Ktesibios. In his water clocks, water flowed from a source such as a holding tank into a reservoir, then from the reservoir to the mechanisms of the clock. Ktesibios's device used a cone-shaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir, so that it neither overflowed nor was allowed to run dry. This was the first artificial truly automatic self-regulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism. Although they did not refer to this concept by the name of Cybernetics (they considered it a field of engineering), Ktesibios and others such as Heron and Su Song are considered to be some of the first to study cybernetic principles.\nThe study of teleological mechanisms (from the Greek τέλος or telos for end, goal, or purpose) in machines with corrective feedback dates from as far back as the late 1700s when James Watt's steam engine was equipped with a governor, a centripetal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine. Alfred Russel Wallace identified this as the principle of evolution in his famous 1858 paper. In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell published a theoretical article on governors, one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self-regulating devices.\nThe Early 20th centuryEdit\nContemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology and neuroscience in the 1940s. Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer Harold S. Black on using negative feedback to control amplifiers. The ideas are also related to the biological work of Ludwig von Bertalanffy in General Systems Theory.\nEarly applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits included the control of gun mounts and radar antenna during World War Two. Jay Forrester, a graduate student at the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT during WWII working with Gordon S. Brown to develop electronic control systems for the U.S. Navy, later applied these ideas to social organizations such as corporations and cities as an original organizer of the MIT School of Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Forrester is known as the founder of System Dynamics.\nW. Edwards Deming, the Total Quality Management guru for whom Japan named its top post-WWII industrial prize, was an intern at Bell Telephone Labs in 1927 and may have been influenced by network theory. Deming made \"Understanding Systems\" one of the four pillars of what he described as \"Profound Knowledge\" in his book \"The New Economics.\"\nNumerous papers spearheaded the coalescing of the field. In 1935 Russian physiologist P.K. Anokhin published a book in which the concept of feedback (\"back afferentation\") was studied. The Romanian scientist Ştefan Odobleja published Psychologie consonantiste (Paris, 1938), describing many cybernetic principles. The study and mathematical modelling of regulatory processes became a continuing research effort and two key articles were published in 1943. These papers were \"Behavior, Purpose and Teleology\" by Arturo Rosenblueth, Norbert Wiener, and Julian Bigelow; and the paper \"A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\" by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts.\nIn the spring of 1947, Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis, held in Nancy, France. The event was organized by the Bourbaki, a French scientific society, and mathematician Szolem Mandelbrojt (1899-1983), uncle of the world-famous mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot.\nDuring this stay in France, Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics, which is found in the study of Brownian motion and in telecommunication engineering. The following summer, back in the United States, Wiener decided to introduce the neologism cybernetics into his scientific theory. The name cybernetics was coined to denote the study of \"teleological mechanisms\" and was popularized through his book Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and Machine (1948). In the UK this became the focus for the Ratio Club.\nIn the early 1940's John von Neumann, although better known for his work in mathematics and computer science, did contribute a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics: Von Neumann cellular automata, and their logical follow up the Von Neumann Universal Constructor. The result of these deceptively simple thought-experiments was the concept of self replication which cybernetics adopted as a core concept. The concept that the same properties of genetic reproduction applied to social memes, living cells, and even computer viruses is further proof of the somewhat surprising universality of cybernetic study.\nWiener popularized the social implications of cybernetics, drawing analogies between automatic systems (such as a regulated steam engine) and human institutions in his best-selling The Human Use of Human Beings : Cybernetics and Society (Houghton-Mifflin, 1950).\nWhile not the only instance of a research organization focused on cybernetics, the Biological Computer Lab at the University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign, under the direction of Heinz von Foerster, was a major center of cybernetic research for almost 20 years, beginning in 1958.\nThe Fall and Rebirth of CyberneticsEdit\nFor a time during the past 20 years, the field of cybernetics followed a boom-bust cycle of becoming more and more dominated by the subfields of artificial intelligence and machine-biological interfaces (ie. cyborgs) and when this research fell out of favor, the field as a whole fell from grace. Recent endeavors into the true focus of cybernetics, systems of control and emergent behavior, by such related fields as Game Theory (the analysis of group interaction), systems of feedback in evolution, and Metamaterials (the study of materials with properties beyond the newtonian properties of their constituent atoms), have lead to a revived interest in this increasingly relevant field.\nSubdivisions of the fieldEdit\nCybernetics is an earlier but still-used generic term for many subject matters. These subjects also extend into many others areas of science, but are united in their study of control of systems.\nPure Cybernetics Edit\nPure cybernetics studies systems of control as a concept, attempting to discover the basic principles underlying such things as\n- Artificial intelligence\n- Control systems\n- Learning organization\n- New Cybernetics\n- Second-order cybernetics\n- Interactions of Actors Theory\n- Conversation Theory\nIn Biology Edit\nCybernetics in biology is the study of cybernetic systems present in biological organisms, primarily focusing on how animals adapt to their environment, and how information in the form of genes is passed from generation to generation. There is also a secondary focus on cyborgs.\nIn Complexity Science Edit\nComplexity Science attempts to analyze the nature of complex systems, and the reasons behind their unusual properties.\nIn Computer Science Edit\nComputer science directly applies the concepts of cybernetics to the control of devices and the analysis of information.\nIn Engineering Edit\nIn Management Edit\n- Entrepreneurial cybernetics\n- Management cybernetics\n- Organizational cybernetics\n- Operations research\n- Systems engineering\nIn Mathematics Edit\nMathematical Cybernetics focuses on the factors of information, interaction of parts in systems, and the structure of systems.\nIn Psychology Edit\nIn Sociology Edit\nBy examining group behavior through the lens of cybernetics, sociology seeks the reasons for such spontaneous events as smart mobs and riots, as well as how communities develop rules, such as etiquette, by consensus without formal discussion. Affect Control Theory explains role behavior, emotions, and labeling theory in terms of homeostatic maintenance of sentiments associated with cultural categories. These and other cybernetic models in sociology are reviewed in a book edited by McClelland and Fararo.\nFurther reading Edit\n- W. Ross Ashby (1956), Introduction to Cybernetics. Methuen, London, UK.

Each discipline shares commonalities in that they each seek an improve understanding of human nature, behavior, and mental functions. Within some fields, it is enough to gain insight into these subjects through study and research. In other fields, it is desired to use the knowledge that has been gained for the purpose of creating change. When most people think of psychology, they think of the fields of clinical and abnormal psychology where the practitioners within the field seek to assist individuals who may have mental disorders and to create change by helping those individuals to improve their own lives. While this is what most people think of concerning psychology, it is not the only discipline of the field. The field of industrial and organizational psychology seeks to apply the principles of psychology to create change within the business world and in doing so improve the way organizations function as well as improving the quality of the working experience of individuals.\nHow Do We Define Industrial and Organizational Psychology?\nIndustrial and organizational psychology is defined as the study of people working and the application of the principles of psychology to the organizational and work environment (Spector, 2008; Jex, 2002). Industrial and organizational psychology is a field of psychology which is concerned with both the study of psychological principles as a science and the application of those principles (Spector, 2008; Jex, 2002).\nThe Industrial Side\nIndustrial and organizational psychology is like a coin with two sides. Industrial psychology is the first side of that coin. The main focus of the industrial side of the coin is understanding human behavior in order to improve organizational efficiency, employee selection, employee training and to more efficiently design jobs (Spector, 2008; Jex, 2002).The industrial side of industrial and organizational psychology is a top down perspective which views human behavior to assess ways in which the organization can benefit from the application of psychological principles (Spector, 2008; Jex, 2002).\nThe Organizational Side\nThe organizational side of the coin is the inverse of this. The organizational side focuses on understanding behavior in order to enhance employee satisfaction and well-being within the work place (Spector, 2008; Jex, 2002). Spector (2008) explains that “organizational topics include employee attitudes, employee behavior, job stress, and supervisory practices” (p. 5). Judging by the focus of organizational topics it can be stated that the organizational side of the field is a bottom up perspective which focuses on behavior in order to improve the quality and satisfaction of the individuals within an organization rather than the organization as a whole.\nThe Two Sides Together\nThough each of these two sides is focused from a different perspective they are not mutually exclusive in their goals, their applications or their topics of interest. Spector (2008) uses the example of motivation to explain the dual nature of subjects studied by industrial and organizational psychologists, stating that motivation “is relevant to the [industrial] concerns of employee efficiency and performance, but it is also relevant to the [organizational] concern with the happiness and well-being of employees” (p. 5).\nThe Early Years Of I/O Psychology\nThe field of industrial and organizational psychology was spawned in the 1800s out of experimental psychology (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). Hugo Münsterberg, Walter Dill Scott and James Mckeen Cattel were early pioneers of the field of industrial and organizational psychology (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). Münsterberg and Cattel both trained under Wilhelm Wundt graduating from his doctoral program in Germany before relocating to the United States (Koppes, 2007). These pioneers brought the study and application of psychological principles into the world of business and industry (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). According to Koppes (2007) “In the beginning the objective of an industrial psychology was to improve organizational goals (productivity and efficiency) primarily by applying psychology with an emphasis on individual differences, through selection and training” (p. 314). The early years of this branch of psychology focused on the industrial side of the field (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). During this time there was a marriage within the field of industrial psychology between the principles of psychology and the field of engineering (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). Many of the individuals who helped to influence the field of industrial psychology had backgrounds in engineering, some had backgrounds in history and law (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002).\nIndustrial Psychology and the First World War\nIndustrial psychology prospered due to World War I (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). When the United States entered the first World War psychologist were called upon to develop a program for psychological evaluation or recruits as well as a means for selecting personnel for specific jobs within the military (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). The group of psychologist working with the military were led by Robert Yerkes (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). According to Spector (2008) “the best-known accomplishment of the group was the development of the Army Alpha and Army Beta group tests for mental ability” (p. 12). Koppes (2007) explains that these mental ability test “paved the way for large-scale intelligence testing and for later expansion of psychological testing into government, industry, and education” (p. 315). Between the first and second World War the field of industrial and organizational psychology expanded rapidly (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002).\nThe Hawthorne Studies\nAccording to Spector (2008) “One of the most important events of this period was the Hawthorne studies, which continued for more than 10 years at the Western Electric Company” (p. 12). The Hawthorne studies became a pivotal point in the evolution of industrial and organizational psychology because it was primarily responsible for the development of the organizational side of the field (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002). The Hawthorne studies inadvertently revealed the human side of organizations. In another attempt to study methods of increasing efficiency and productivity it was learned that social aspects of an organization, such as work groups and the worker's knowledge that they are being watched, affected the workers behavior and performance (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002). The understanding that social aspects of the work environment had an effect on behavior led to psychologists examining the work environment from the perspective of the individual employees (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002).\nWorld War II and Division 14 of the APA\nThe emergence of World War II again allowed the field of industrial and organizational psychology to expand due to the growing demands of the military (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002). World War II not only widened the scope of the field of industrial and organizational psychology, it also opened doors professionally for industrial and organizational psychologists. Before the second World War the American Psychological Association was not concerned with experimental or applied fields within psychology (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007). In response to the changes occurring in psychology at the time the APA created Division 14, Industrial and Business Psychology (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002). This arm of the APA went through a couple of changes and eventually evolved into the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (Spector, 2008; Koppes, 2007; Jex, 2002).\n- Koppes, L (2007). \"History of Industrial/Organizational Psychology in North America.\" Encyclopedia of Industrial and Organizational Psychology.

{"question":"Need to know quick - did William of Rubruck and Chekhov share the same approach to accuracy in their travel accounts? What's the key difference in how they reported their observations?","answer":"While both were travel writers, they had different approaches to accuracy. William of Rubruck's account was known for being very grounded in realism, often acknowledging questions he couldn't answer, avoiding embellishment. In contrast, while Chekhov was thorough in his documentation with precise data (collecting over 10,000 individual data cards and transcribing parish death records), his work combined scientific observation with literary touches and empathetic understanding, as evidenced by his sardonic observations and dramatic descriptions, such as his portrayal of bug-infested walls as 'funeral crape, moving as if in a wind.'","context":["In the nineteenth century the Czarist Government wanted to create an Artic Australia by establishing a penal colony on Sakhalin Island, off the eastern coast of Siberia some five thousand miles from European Russia. There convicts who had served out their sentences would be obliged to stay as settlers, albeit in a very different new home from that found in Australia’s Botany Bay. In 1890, to the amazement of his family and friends, Dr Anton Chekhov (1860 – 1904) resolved to travel to the island to conduct what nowadays would be called a community medicine research project, for a MD thesis at the University of Moscow.\nHis motivation remains obscure. Middle-class Russians of Chekhov’s generation had an honourable tradition of civic responsibility, and the success of his plays and short stories had already earned him enough money to support his family and finance his journey. But Chekhov was already ill from tuberculosis and the ten-week journey to Sakhalin would be very arduous (there was as yet no Trans-Siberian Railway). The climate of the island was hardly salubrious; and it was said that Sakhalin had no climate, just bad weather. The survey work he undertook entailed travel to remote settlements and sometimes staying in very primitive accommodation. Sakhalin is an enigmatic episode in an enigmatic life.\nThe account he wrote of Sakhalin, published as a book because the censor banned its serialisation in a journal (Chekhov, 2013 ), is quite unlike any of his other writings. In its barest outline, it is a community survey. Within three months he completed over ten thousand individual data cards (still extant in Moscow’s Lenin Library) on the convicts and exiled settlers whom he had interviewed, he transcribed and aggregated all the parish death records, visited all the island prisons, went underground into the coal-mine worked by four hundred prisoners, visited all the island medical facilities, worked briefly in the outpatient clinic, and gathered what anthropological information he could on the Gilyaks and the Aino – the remnant native populations of the island.\nBut his Sakhalin Island study is much more than a pioneer community medicine study. Chekhov’s masterly plays are performed more often than any other dramatist except Shakespeare; and his short stories – many of them on medical themes – have been translated and admired across the globe. The Sakhalin study is the work of a great writer who consciously chose to be a social scientist and investigative journalist – a writer whose gifts of description and empathetic understanding shine through the journalism and the science.\nHis descriptions of living conditions on the island have a stark elegance, as when he writes about the bugs and cockroaches in one house: “the walls and ceilings seemed to be covered in funeral crape, moving as if in a wind.” He had a dramatist’s ear for dialogue:\n‘Why are your dog and your cockerel tied up?’ I would ask a householder. ‘Here on Sakhalin everything’s chained up,’ he’d reply, ‘It’s that sort of place.’\nHis sardonic observations convey the life of the penal colony more pointedly than his statistics: one of the new settlements was named after a prisoner governor who had been assassinated by a prisoner because of his cruelty – Chekhov merely observed that the prisoner’s fellow-convicts managed to collect sixty roubles in small change as a thank-you gift to his murderer.\nHe was coruscating in his description of the penal medical services – the prison dispensary with no medicines, wounds bound with dirty rags, mentally ill patients housed along with syphilitic patients, the outpatient clinic in which he practiced with “no washbasin, no balls of cotton wool, no decent scissors, […] not even water of sufficient quantity,” and scalpels too blunt to lance a patient’s boil. “The local hospital system has fallen behind civilization by at least two hundred years.” But he also writes with great sensitivity and understanding of human suffering, for example when mentioning a convict who was formerly a priest:\n“I do not know why he had been sent to Sakhalin, and I did not ask him about it either; when a man who, not so very long ago, was called ‘Father’ and ‘the Reverend Gentleman,’ and whose hand was kissed by everyone, is standing to attention in front of you dressed in a pitiful threadbare coat, it’s not his offence you think about.”\nAs the critic and fellow short story writer V S Pritchett observed, such silences and reticences were characteristic of both Chekhov’s literary style and his personality: a gregarious man who was entirely self-sufficient.\nThese literary touches were evidently unappreciated by the examiners of his MD thesis; and he failed. But there was more than sufficient factual detail in Chekhov’s study to rouse the public conscience. He documented the overcrowding and the insanitary conditions of the various island prisons. Prisoner accommodation would comprise large common halls, with a long plank sleeping platform down the middle of the hall, where the prisoners slept cheek by jowl, the healthy beside the infected. No wonder that when Chekhov compiled mortality tables for the island he found that tuberculosis was “the most common and most dangerous element” – a finding that must have affected him deeply as a fellow-sufferer. The system of communal halls (with seventy to a hundred and seventy convicts per hall) meant that it was impossible to keep the cells clean and tidy, so they were covered in filth. Bugs and lice were everywhere. The latrines were poor, and in the Kosov prison there were no latrines at all, the prisoners being let out in batches to relieve themselves in the street.\nHe documented the abuses of the administration: the co-option of prisoners by officials to act as unpaid servants and of women prisoners as paramours. Chekhov, himself the grandson of a serf, described this as “serfdom.” The coal mine where many prisoners were set to work was owned by a private company contracted to pay the government for the convicts’ labour, but Chekhov discovered that no payments were ever made. Punishments were severe. In one prison, the most hardened criminals were kept chained to wheelbarrows. Chekhov, who never forgave or forgot the savage beatings of his own childhood, steeled himself to witness the punishment of a failed escapee, but could not stomach the sight of the full ninety lashes that were administered.\nThe administration of the settlements of the ex-convicts was also found wanting. Many of the chosen sites for settlement were unsuitable for cultivation because of poor soil or vulnerability to flooding. Too many settlers were sent to the settlements, resulting in demoralising overcrowding and epidemics. Basic sanitary precautions were not followed and settlers got their water from ditches. The children of both settlers and of convicts (families were allowed to accompany prisoners transported to the island) were a particular concern of Chekhov’s, as they were neglected by the administration. On his return to Europe, Chekhov organised the dispatch of thousands of books to the Sakhalin schools.\nChekhov’s book on Sakhalin was published in 1895 and immediately generated great public interest and newspaper comment. A government commission was dispatched to Sakhalin to investigate matters the following year. Any resulting ameliorations on the island would however have been short-lived. Chekhov died at the age of forty-four in 1904, a year before Japan seized the southern part of Sakhalin in the Russo-Japanese War. The Japanese were soon importing tens of thousands of Koreans as forced labourers in Sakhalin’s coal mines, and somewhat later, across mainland Siberia and the northern wastes, Stalin created the gulags – a regime of penal colonies that made Chekhov’s Sakhalin look like a summer camp. Elsewhere, in 1895 (the same year as the publication of Chekhov’s book), Captain Dreyfus was convicted on a trumped-up charge of spying and sent to the Devil’s Island penal colony, which the French Government did not finally close this until 1953.\nThe Victorian novelist Elizabeth Gaskell wrote that “an evil once recognised is halfway to its solution,” but she lived in a more optimistic age. Nevertheless, Chekhov’s only work of non-fiction is much more than an interesting early community medicine survey: it is a quiet, determined and skilfully reported testimony to the need of human decency. Chekhov tried to be objective, but he never claimed to be detached.\nChekhov, Anton (2013 ) Sakhalin Island, Harmondsworth: Penguin.\nMichael Bloor is a retired sociologist who worked for more than twenty years as a research scientist for the UK’s Medical Research Council. Latterly, he was a professorial fellow at Cardiff University’s Seafarers International Research Centre, where his research field was seafarers’ health and safety.","Asia very much represented the first frontier of European exploration due to both its geographical proximity and the fact that it was the only other similarly developed continent in the world. Iconic explorer Marco Polo and his famous travelogue inspired generations of merchants, explorers and statesmen to explore the lucrative opportunities in Asia, the natural resources of which such as spices proving to be immensely popular in Western European countries.\nPerhaps the most iconic and certainly the most influential of the great European explorers, Marco Polo played a highly significant role in encouraging the Age of Discovery. Perhaps most importantly, he played a major role in opening up trade between Europe and Asia. Hailing from a Venetian mercantile family, Marco Polo took after his father Nicole and uncle Maffeo, who had strong trading relations with the Middle East. As a result, the family was immensely wealthy. His father and uncle travelled through Central Asia and came into contact with Kublai Khan, the leader of Mongol-ruled China. They embarked on a second journey with Marco in tow, which lasted nearly 25 years. Marco endeared himself to Kublai Kahi and lived within his domain for nearly 20 years, carrying out a number of diplomatic missions on his behalf throughout China, India and Persia. Eventually, he returned home to Venice with his relatives through Iran, Constantinople and finally home. By the time of Polo’s return, Venice was ensnared in a war with Genoa. Marco Polo was quickly captured by the Genoese. His stories of exotic kingdoms entranced his fellow inmates, and a writer eventually started composing them into text. The resulting book – ‘The Travels of Marco Polo’, whilst embellished significantly, was a massive success and in the centuries to come inspired new generations of explorers, such as Christopher Columbus, many entranced by the exotic and lucrative Asian lands. This in turn was a major factor in the inadvertent discovery of the New World.\nVasco De Gama\nA Portuguese explorer, De Gama has the distinction of being the first European to arrive in India through the sea. His discovery of this aquatic route from Europe to Asia was a considerable development in the onset of European imperialism and colonialism of the Asian continent. His successful voyage was the culmination of years of unsuccessful European attempts to access Asia by the sea. He significantly bolstered the Portuguese Empire’s economy due to the monopoly on access to Indian spice routes. His expeditions were eventful and sometimes fraught with conflict. He notably clashed with Muslim traders in the Arabian Peninsula. Despite this, he established a positive relationship with the Hindu population of Calicut, his first point of arrival He played a major role in diplomacy between Portugal and India, eventually returning later in life to curb festering Portuguese corruption in India. He died there of a short illness.\nOne of the most under appreciated yet accomplished explorers of all time, Ibn Battuta was a Moroccan icon who travelled throughout the Islamic world and well into East Asia. Active during the 14th Century, Ibn Battuta spent the majority of his life encountering new lands and civilisations. His first pilgrimage, he travelled throughout Persia, Arabia and Somalia, stopping off at major pilgrimage points such as Mecca. His second tourney saw him go even further afield through Central Asia where he encountered the Golden Horde. He then travelled extensively throughout India and Southeast Asia before arriving in China, where he spent a great deal of time. His account of his life ‘The Travels’ is one of the most iconic travelogues of all time, an insightful text into the Medieval world.\nWilliam of Rubruck\nAnother explorer often drawn into comparison with Marco Polo, William of Rubrucck was a Flemish missionary during the 13th Century who travelled throughout the Middle East. During his adventures, he came into contact with the Khanate and travelled throughout the Mongol Empire. William of Rubruck is known for the detailed and insightful account he composed following the conclusion of his travels. Unlike the heavily embellished and much more popular account of Marco Polo, it is very grounded in realism and often poses a number of questions he himself was incapable of answering.\nAfonso de Albuquerque\nOne of Portugal’s most iconic and successful explorers and statesmen. Afonso du Albuquerque led a number of military incursions in the Middle East and Asia. He laid the groundwork for Portugal’s lucrative Empire in the Middle East and Asia. He was known for his brilliant aptitude as a military commander and challenged dominant powers such as the Ottoman Empire as Portugal became a significant world power. His major accomplishments included the conquest of Goa in 1510 and the capture of Malacca in 1511. Like many figures in colonialism, he has divided opinion with modern observers both condemning and lionising his actions.\nNiccolo de Conti\nA successful Italian merchant best known for his travels to Southeast Asia and India. Fluent in Arabic due to years being based in Damascus, De Conti utilised this skill as well as his interest in Arab cultures to forge strong relationships with Muslim traders, allowing him widespread access throughout the Middle East. He was the first major Italian trader to establish links with Asia. He travelled throughout Persia, becoming fluent in Farsi before eventually arriving in India. De Conti’s account of his travels is considered to be amongst the finest of its kind, playing an important role in encouraging further European exploration as well as innovations in cartography."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5605e3bd-3903-4f76-ac67-76ab7123a655>","<urn:uuid:5337074c-b1d7-4b1b-9db6-52132493c21a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Does Marx's critique of religion as maintaining social inequality align with Jung's view of religion as a path to psychological wholeness?","answer":"No, Marx and Jung's views on religion fundamentally diverge. Marx criticized religion as a tool of the bourgeoisie that maintained social inequality by keeping the proletariat content with an unjust status quo through promises of afterlife rewards. Jung, however, saw religion as serving a vital psychological function in helping individuals achieve inner wholeness through the process of individuation - uniting conscious and unconscious forces. While Marx called for abolishing religion to achieve real social change, Jung valued religious symbols and experiences as means for psychological transformation and achieving psychic balance.","context":["Marx viewed religion as a tool of social control used by the bourgeoisie to keep the proletariat content with an unequal status quo.\nEvaluate Karl Marx’s critical approach to religion\nThe social-conflict approach to religion highlights how religion, as a phenomenon of human behavior, maintains social inequality by advancing a worldview that justifies oppression.\nKarl Marx’s critical approach demanded that action be taken to resolve social inequalities. This was in stark contrast to his scholarly peers, many of whom pursued scholarship for the sake of knowledge, and did not attach to these academic projects overt political goals.\nKarl Marx viewed religion as a social control used to maintain the status quo in a given society.\nstatus quo: the current state of things; the way things are, as opposed to the way they could be; the existing state of affairs.\nMarxist Theory of Religion\nThe social-conflict approach is rooted in Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism. According to Marx, in a capitalist society, religion plays a critical role in maintaining an unequal status quo, in which certain groups of people have radically more resources and power than other groups of people. Marx argued that the bourgeoise used religion as a tool to keep the less powerful proletariat pacified. Marx argued that religion was able to do this by promising rewards in the after-life, instead of in this life. It was in this sense that Marx asserted the following. “Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the feeling of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless circumstances. It is the opium of the people…The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness” (p.72). In this passage, Marx is calling for the proletariat to discard religion and its deceit about other-worldly events. Only then would this class of people be able to rise up against the bourgeoisie and gain control of the means of production, and only then would they achieve real rewards, in this life. Thus, the social-conflict approach to religion highlights how religion, as a phenomenon of human behavior, functions to maintain social inequality by providing a worldview that justifies oppression.\nIt should be reiterated here that Marx’s approach to sociology was critical in the sense that it advocated for change in the world. This is in stark contrast to other scholars, many of whom pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake, and lack overt political aims. Because Marx was committed to criticizing the prevailing organization of society during his time, he took a particularly aggressive stance towards religion. He believed that it was a tool of social control used to maintain an unequal status quo, and that it should be abolished.\nLICENSES AND ATTRIBUTIONS\nCC LICENSED CONTENT, SHARED PREVIOUSLY\nCuration and Revision.

Both seek wholeness and unity of the Self.\n2. Both require the acceptance of a transcendent realm or higher\npower with which the individual must be recognized--a personal\n3. Both are personal and inner experiences that refuse to accept\nconformity, preset meanings, or codification in dogmas.\nCarl Jung: Religion and Archetypes\nReligion and Individuation = Synonyms\nWhy is Religion so helpful?\nExample 1: Christianity: Father, Son, Spirit\n\"Individuation = process of uniting conscious and unconscious forces of one's Self.\nArchetypes provide structure to different parts of the psyche and the psyche functions optimally when there exists a harmonious balance between these parts. Unfortunately, according to Jung, few people function in an optimal manner. Rather most suffer from imbalances where some parts of their personality suffer from inflation, or over-expression in consciousness, while other parts suffer from deflation or underdevelopment whereby they lack proper expression in consciousness. Imbalances, Jung believed, often lead to the development of neuroses and a lack of vitality in life.\"\n\"Working to bring about proper expression of the various archetypally structured elements of one’s personality by confronting contents of the unconscious and thus obtaining self-knowledge, is the purpose of the individuation process. It is important to note that this process occurs spontaneously if unimpeded as contents of the unconscious naturally strive for outward expression in the world, or as Jung put it “Everything in the unconscious seeks outward manifestation”. (Academy of Ideas)\nIndividuation has an inherently \"religious\" quality because it involves accepting and becoming aware of archetypal forces. It is akin to surrender, trust, and obedience in religion (Forsyth 68).\nIndividuation begins with awareness of separation and the desire for unity with one's Self. Religious symbols offer powerful means for tapping into the unconscious in order to undertake this process.\nReligion: Psychological over Metaphysical\nLiterature, Fairy Tales, and Myths provide great symbols for inner transformation.\nReligion: for Jung, has a focus on unity and rebirth. It causes people to go on journeys of self-discovery and inner reflection that is unique.\nWhereas movies and stories might illustrate certain archetypes to which one is drawn, religion causes one to have an \"archetypal\" experience wherein they personally experience affinity for and unity with a certain archetype.\nSO, ACCORDING TO JUNG, WHY DO PEOPLE DO RELIGION?\nFor Jung, religion is always personal and subjective. It is a process\nwherein the unique unconscious energies of the person are united with\nits conscious Ego.\nThus, people do religion--or should do religion--in order to achieve\npsychic balance and harmony.\nIn essence, he interprets religion as an individual journey to Selfhood.\n\"Religion has value to the extent that its dogmas, rituals, and symbols correlate with the archetypal motifs and energies of the unconscious and direct our growth toward assimilation of this archetypal material into our conscious life and, then toward greater psychic wholeness.\" (Forsyth 72)\nFather: \"represents God as one nad indivisible and, accordingly, reflects the first stage of human growth--infancy--which, because it is anterior to the growth of consciousness, is characterized as a state of unconscious unity.\" (Forsyth 77)\nSon: \"The growing child learns to differentiate himself from and become gradually independent of parents. With this development of individuality he or she begins to make conscious differentiations between self and others, masculine and feminine, good and evil.\" (Forsyth 78)\nSpirit: \"represents the higher state of consciousness brought about through uniting and reconciling those opposites which consciousness has differentiated.\"\nCrucifixion: The death and rebirth of Christ is a death of the conflict of the opposites and its rebirth through unity with the unconscious. It is the crucifixion of the separate Ego and birth of the unified Self.\nExample 2: The Buddhist Mandala\n\"The symbolism of meditation Mandalas has a rich tradition. The outer form of these so-called holy circles is a geometrical diagram, a Yantra, and each detail of its construction has symbolic meaning. The essence or purpose of the Mandala is concerned with the process of invocation, the calling in and realization of the spiritual force within the contemplator himself. All these different picture-tools have essentially the same inner meaning and purpose, but there are mandalas to suit all levels of consciousness: for the spiritually highly developed, for average people and for people not yet developed.\" (http://www.buddhanet.net/mandalas.htm)\nJungian interpretation of the Mandala: from Jung and Eastern Thought by J.J. Clarke\n\"The mandala image is not only a symbol of wholeness and healing, but can be actively employed as a means towards that end. Jung first discovered this in his own case and later confirmed this discovery through the spontaneous production of similar images by his patients. The mandalas drawn by his patients suggested to Jung, not just a representation of a state of psychic wholeness, but rather the striving to overcome inner chaos, and the search for some form of integration. Just as, for the yogi, the mandala offers a means of overcoming the opposites of spirit and matter, so, for his patients, the use of mandala drawings expressed a need to resolve psychological tensions, and acted as ‘an antidote for chaotic states of mind’ (CW9i.16).\"\nJung: \"The fact that images of this kind have under certain circumstances a considerable therapeutic effect on their authors is empirically proved and also readily understandable, in that they often represent very bold attempts to see and put together apparently irreconcilable opposites and bridge over apparently hopeless splits.\" (CW9i.718)\nLook at your sheet: Write the name of the character next to the archetype you think they represent:\nGreat stories often include a main character trying to come to grips with aspects of themselves, confronting barriers and opponents in the process.\nHow does this happen in?\n1. Harry Potter\n2. Star Wars\n3.

{"question":"What is the relationship between nuclear size and cell mechanics in both X. tropicalis and mesenchymal stem cells? ¿Cómo se comparan estos dos sistemas celulares?","answer":"In X. tropicalis, nuclear size is controlled by cytoplasmic factors, particularly through nuclear import mechanisms involving importin-α and Ntf2, which regulate the transport of materials into the nucleus. For mesenchymal stem cells, cell mechanics are influenced by water efflux, which reduces cell volume and increases cell stiffness. This mechanical change affects both cytoplasmic and nuclear processes, including chromatin structure and transcription patterns. Both systems demonstrate that nuclear size and cellular mechanics are interconnected, though they operate through distinct regulatory mechanisms.","context":["You are hereNovember 6, 2017 | Mesenchymal Stem Cells\nCell Volume modulates Mesenchymal Stem Cell Fate\nReview of “Cell volume change through water efflux impacts cell stiffness and stem cell fate” from PNAS by Stuart P. Atkinson\nMultiple studies have established that external osmotic pressure prompts a reduction in cell volume via the efflux of water, leading to higher cell stiffness and altered cell mechanics/behavior [1-3]. With this knowledge in hand, researchers from the laboratory of Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Virginia, USA) and David A. Weitz (Harvard University, Massachusetts, USA) asked whether cells alter their volume to modify cell behavior in response to additional stimuli. In their new study, Guo et al. describe their new findings, and report a striking link between cell volume and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate .\nThe authors discovered that cell growth on a stiff growth substrate also leads to a reduction in cell volume and an increase in cell stiffness mediated by water efflux - a similar behavior to cells cultured under external osmotic pressure. Substrate stiffness, cell spread area, and external osmotic pressure all correlated to decreased cell volume and increased stiffness mediated by water efflux. This reduction in cell volume leads to an increased concentration of intracellular material and a phenomenon known as “molecular crowding” and an overall modification of cell mechanics and cell behavior.\nInterestingly, the study then established that cellular water efflux, accompanied by a decrease in cell volume and an increase in stiffness, prompted alterations to MSC differentiation propensity, specifically towards an osteogenic or adipogenic fate. This all suggests that the consequences of reduced cell volume influences stem cell fate, a hypothesis strengthened by the finding that MSCs undergoing multilineage differentiation exhibit alterations to their cell volume.\nThe reduction in cell volume and increase in cell stiffness can affect processes occurring both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus that influence stem cell fate. These include protein folding and binding kinetics, cell structure, in-cell transport, protein expression, and, importantly, chromatin structure, and, therefore, transcription and gene expression patterns [3, 5]. The next quest is to understand how MSCs control this phenomenon and to discover whether this means of fate determination exists in other stem cell types.\nTo hear more about cell volume and stem cell fate, keep the Stem Cells Portal bookmarked!\n- Zhou EH, Trepat X, Park CY, et al., Universal behavior of the osmotically compressed cell and its analogy to the colloidal glass transition.

The answer lies, at least in part, in the import of one or more cytoplasmic cargoes into the nucleus.\nIt is rare to come across a basic question in cell biology that is almost entirely unresolved, but what determines the size of a cell or of an organelle is one such question1. Does the cell use a ‘molecular ruler’ to directly assess the size of its compartments, or does it use a surrogate, such as protein concentration, to determine how big its structures are? Reporting in Cell, Levy and Heald2 provide evidence that at least partly answers these questions in regard to the size of the cell nucleus.\nRegulation of nuclear size is perhaps one of the most striking, and enigmatic, examples of organelle-size control, because it is tightly linked to cell size3. Indeed, there is a constant ratio between nuclear and cell volumes (the N/C volume ratio), and deviations from it are associated with disease4. But how is this ratio regulated? To address this question, researchers have attempted5,6 to perturb the N/C volume ratio in yeast, but to no avail: neither nuclear-DNA content, nor varied growth conditions, nor drug treatments, could alter the ratio.\nAnother question is what aspect of cell volume affects nuclear size: is it the cell’s entire volume; the volume of only the cytoplasm; or perhaps that of another organelle? In multinucleated fission yeast, the size of each nucleus is proportional to its surrounding cytoplasm6, but how the cytoplasm affects nuclear size, if at all, has remained unknown.\nLevy and Heald2 study regulation of nuclear size in two related frog species — Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis — that differ in both body size and the number of chromosome copies per cell (ploidy). Xenopus laevis is larger and its cells are tetraploid, whereas X. tropicalis is smaller and its cells are diploid. The two species also differ in another aspect: the cells and nuclei of X. laevis are larger.\nAn advantage of Xenopus as an experimental model is that its nuclei can be assembled in a test tube using the chromatin (DNA–protein complexes) and extracts of its egg cytoplasm. This allowed Levy and Heald2 to ask, what is the main determinant of nuclear size in Xenopus: the DNA or a cytoplasmic factor?\nThe authors added sperm chromatin from either X. laevis or X. tropicalis to egg extracts from either X. laevis or X. tropicalis (Fig. 1a). They found that, although both extracts can trigger assembly of the nuclear envelope around the chromatin, the X. laevis extract forms larger nuclei than the X. tropicalis extract, regardless of the DNA used. This indicates that one or more cytoplasmic factors determine nuclear size.\nA hint of the underlying difference between the extracts from the two frog species came from the authors’ analyses of nuclear import — the process by which proteins are transported into the nucleus7. Both the rate of nuclear import and the maximum size of the imported cargo were greater in the nuclei reconstituted with X. laevis extracts. The capacity for nuclear import therefore might be a regulator of nuclear size.\nThe two extracts differed in two proteins that mediate nuclear import — importin-α and Ntf2. In X. laevis extracts, the levels of importin-α were higher and those of Ntf2 lower than in X. tropicalis extracts. Indeed, when Levy and Heald added active (phosphorylated) importin-α to X. tropicalis extracts they observed an increase in nuclear size. The role of Ntf2 in regulating nuclear size is less straightforward. Nonetheless, X. tropicalis extracts supplemented with both active importin-α and an inhibitor of Ntf2 activity form nuclei that are similar in size to those formed in X. laevis extracts2 (Fig. 1b).\nThat nuclear import affects nuclear size is perhaps not surprising, as a previous paper8 showed that, in the absence of import, the nuclear envelope — which forms around the chromosomes at the end of mitotic cell division — fails to expand. But in showing that, at least in vitro, import is a limiting factor for nuclear growth, Levy and Heald’s report provides a specific step that could be targeted for regulating nuclear size in vivo.\nWhich of the cargoes carried by importin-α are crucial for controlling nuclear size? From an engineering standpoint, enlarging a structure could require an extension of its underlying framework. Whether the nucleus has an internal framework — the ‘nuclear matrix’ — is debatable, but there is no doubt that the nuclear lamina serves as a framework supporting the nuclear envelope. Indeed, Levy and Heald found that the addition of lamin B3, a component of the nuclear lamina, to X. tropicalis extracts resulted in increased nuclear size. Thus, nuclear import may regulate nuclear size through controlling the availability of nuclear-lamina components.\nNeither yeast nor plants have lamins, which raises the question of how general is regulation of nuclear size by lamin import. Whether nuclear import itself affects nuclear size in yeast is unresolved5,6, although at least one study6 found that a prolonged inhibition of nuclear export increases nuclear volume by 50%. It could be, therefore, that nuclear size in yeast and plants also depends on nuclear import, not of lamin but of some other cargo.\nThe cell-free system Levy and Heald describe is remarkably useful for identifying proteins and processes that affect nuclear size. The next step will be to determine how such processes affect nuclear size within the cell, and whether they contribute to the N/C volume ratio. Levy and Heald did address this question by injecting importin-α into developing X. laevis embryos. They observed a transient increase in nuclear size in early stages of development, but whether cell volume is affected in any way remains unknown.\nWhen considering the scaling of nuclear size with cell size, one must take into account the increase not only in volume, but also in surface area4. An influx of material through nuclear import could lead to physical stress that signals for an increase in the surface area of the nuclear envelope. Alternatively, because the nuclear membrane is continuous with that of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum, the cell might regulate nuclear size by controlling the amount of endoplasmic-reticulum membrane that is allocated to the nucleus.\nNevertheless, geometry tells us that surface area increases at a slower rate than volume (surface area is a function of the radius squared, whereas volume is a function of the radius cubed). Intriguingly, a recent study9 on the scaling of transcription with cell size in yeast revealed that, whereas expression of most genes increases in proportion to the increase in cell size, the expression of genes encoding cell-surface proteins lags behind. How this size-sensing mechanism works isn’t clear, but it would be interesting to examine whether the abundance of proteins associated with nuclear-envelope expansion is also ‘size-sensitive’.\nLevy and Heald’s results2 uncover a process that affects nuclear size, providing a glimpse into a mechanism that may couple nuclear volume to cell volume. To fully understand the N/C volume ratio, researchers need biological tools — mutants and/or RNAi knockdowns — that perturb this ratio. So to anyone who thinks that all the interesting basic cell-biologi cal questions have been answered, here is one that is still wide open."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a8206997-7a01-4b8b-9297-fb8b6d606d4e>","<urn:uuid:771f9af9-44fa-4476-b88c-bf6a09f7e7cd>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What are the practical challenges of shooting archery in hunting situations, and how does arrow safety statistics compare to other recreational activities?","answer":"In hunting situations, archers face challenges like taking shots from awkward angles, shooting while kneeling in snow-covered fields, managing seated positions where bottom cams might kick up dirt or bump kneecaps, and dealing with unscripted scenarios unlike controlled practice conditions. Regarding safety statistics, archery is actually twice as safe as golf and fishing according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. Archery ranks just above Ping-Pong and Bowling in terms of annual injuries, maintaining this safety record despite having participants ranging from grade-school children to senior citizens, many being newcomers to the sport.","context":["We all know that practice makes perfect—but taking your archery skills to a higher level takes perfect practice.\nThere’s no telling what situation or scenario you’ll find yourself against while in the forest or field. The ‘unscripted’ is truly nature’s beauty and beast. Hunters have fantasized the idea of grunting a mature buck into a broadside position ten yards from their perch countless times – in reality, it’s the immediate quartering away shot before he bolts or the white knuckled, nail biting, last second prayer we encounter before our buck-of-a-lifetime vanishes behind brush. There is no storyline to this fairy-tale other than expecting the unexpected.\nSimulating unique scenarios and injecting a hint of realism into your archery practice will morph your talent, enhance your confidence, and prepare you for the dynamics you will encounter on judgment day. Maximize your shooting capabilities by raising your ‘pin’ to a new level and shrinking your bull’s-eye to laser point focus.\nSplicing arrows into my Big Green Target may elevate my archery mechanics, but it won’t make me any better of a hunter. Do you remember the last time you shot archery outside? If I were to guess, I’d say that you were practicing somewhere around the 15-yard mark, standing straight up, feet perfectly squared to the target, and you held back your bow until the last gust of wind mellowed before your easy release. Now ask yourself, when was the last time you killed an animal that came into chip shot range, by himself, and stood broadside waiting for you to release? It just doesn’t work that way often enough.\nTaking your archery practice to a higher-level is an essential building block step in your killing abilities. Dedicate time to create your very own mock-hunting experiences that you can share with your friends and family. You may want to implement tree stands, ground blind stations, and moving targets. There are endless opportunities and a mixture of fun situations to mock. It is a great way to increase your accuracy and boost your overall shooting confidence.\nBelow you will find a few tips that help increase lifelike hunting situations in your practice regimen.\nIf you plan on hunting from an elevated position, practice from treestand level. Shooting your bow from a deck or a gentle sloped rooftop will mock your average treestand shot. This will give you a firsthand perspective of what angles you’ll be shooting from once season begins.\nPlace your archery target in an assortment of positions. Tweak your angles broadside or quartering away to create natural challenges. This will give you the opportunity to slip your arrows into the correct crease and kill pocket during crunch time.\nTake a Knee…or Two:\nI never thought of practicing shooting from my knees until I ventured to eastern Colorado last fall and stalked monster mule deer with my bow. This tree-less praire of muley paradise was my wakeup call and proved impossible to take a simple standing shot. Belly crawling hundreds of yards, inching through tall wheat fields en route to a nearly hidden tine was an experience never to be forgotten. There was not one time we stood up and walked toward deer – neither will you.\nOnce we got within range, it was time to forget how cold and wet your hands felt from the snow, or how much your knees ached from clomping through bumpy fields. It was time to make the kill.\nIt takes a smooth and silent draw cycle and an immediate decision to align your pin on the buck’s vitals and let carbon fly before he busts you. Always be sure to carry a trusty rangefinder when hunting open fields or vast landscapes; objects in view may be closer than what they actually appear. My Halo rangefinder is always strung around my neck to give me the confidence that I’ll need when analyzing distance.\nTake a seat:\nShooting a bow from a seated position can be difficult. You are against several variables that may deter your shot. The bottom cam kicking up dirt, weeds, or bumping your kneecap will toss an arrow off course and out of bounds – not to mention the extra strength it takes to crank the string back and hold the bow steady. Sitting against a tree and using it as a natural blind while turkey or elk hunting is a must when using string and string.\nLast spring I shot a turkey using my bow while playing peek-a-boo with a gobbler behind a huge oak tree. As the gobbler walked into my decoys, all I had to do was draw and quickly slink an arrow into the back of his tail fan. He pompously strutted into my setup and once he turned away, I killed him.\nLike many of us, I’ve had just as many good hunts go bad and some just plain raw, but you’ll never know when you have to take an awkward shot at an animal.\nCreating the most realistic practice will ultimately build enough confidence and experience to make your shot count when the moment of truth surfaces. Practice these different kinds of shooting forms and key in on perfect practice to help you on your adventure.\nArticle and Photos by Brandon Wikman of Providence Marketing Group.","No matter what type, size, brand, or style of arrow you choose to shoot, you must always inspect each arrow for damage before each shot. Proper care of your new arrows can ensure years of quality performance. However, shafts can become damaged, and shooting a damaged arrow is extremely unsafe! Never assume ANY arrow is safe -- not even a BRAND NEW arrow --until you have verified it yourself. It is your responsibility to check your equipment and be sure your arrows are always in good condition.\nTo inspect the arrow for defects, hold it on both ends and flex it away from yourself (and others) while visibly and audibly checking for splinters, cracks, nicks, or dents. Rotate and repeat this inspection several times to make certain the arrow shaft is not damaged in any way. If you find the arrow to be damaged - destroy it immediately. Shooting damaged arrows can result in arrow failure and possible bodily injury.\nIronically, the reason most arrows get damaged is because modern equipment is simply too good. In years past, the recreational archer was often happy with paper plate accuracy and groups of 4-8\" within a typical bowhunting range. But those days are long gone. With modern equipment, even a novice archer can practically pile arrows into the same hole at 20 or 30 yards. Unfortunately, shooting tight groups means there is a chance that an incoming arrow can strike and damage an arrow that's already in the target. If one arrow strikes another, the force of the impact can cause lateral cracks or dents on the arrow shaft. This dramatically weakens the arrow shaft. AND IF YOU DON'T FLEX-TEST all your arrows before shooting the arrows again, you may not detect the damage. So when you fire the arrow again later, it can buckle and snap upon release. This will put your bow hand (the hand holding the bow) at great risk of making contact with the moving segments of the broken arrow. Unfortunately, in a toughness contest between your hand and an arrow shaft, the arrow shaft always wins.\nIt is very important your graphite arrows are trimmed to the correct length to match your equipment. Arrows that are too short can become lodged in the arrow rest or behind the riser of the bow (obstructed path). Shooting an arrow that is lodged in a bow or arrow rest in this manner will almost certainly result in arrow failure, damage to your equipment, and/or personal injury. The end of your arrow shaft (not including the tip) should sit approximately 1 inch (2.4 cm) in front of the arrow rest (or more) when you are at full draw. An arrow that is “just” long enough is too short! Please note that changing your bow’s draw length and/or draw stop peg setting (for bows equipped with this feature), will likely change your arrow length requirements. Also, as your bowstring ages and stretches (as all bowstrings do) your bow's effective draw length will slowly increase - particularly if the string set is left in service for an extended period. If you choose not to have your string serviced and replaced at regular intervals, be advised that your bow's arrow length requirements may change over time.\nBefore firing your arrow, make sure the nock is properly seated all the way against the string. Be advised that some nocks use a “2-click” procedure, where the nock isn’t fully seated until you hear the second click. Failure to properly nock your arrow on the string may cause the arrow to fall (or partially fall) from the string during the drawstroke. This could result in a dry-fire or an obstructed path shot which could damage your equipment and/or cause bodily injury.\nTake a look at the painful photograph at right, provided by fellow archer P. Giblin from Houston, TX. THIS IS A WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU FIRE A DAMAGED ARROW. While statistically this type of injury qualifies as a \"freak accident,\" it does happen to a number of archers each season. And while it may be intuitive to \"blame the arrow,\" the reality is that all brands, all types, all models, and all sizes of arrows can fail upon release if they are damaged prior to the shot.\nDon't assume that expensive arrows are any less susceptible. They are not. Any arrow, aluminum or carbon, small diameter or large diameter, camo finish or black finish, light or heavy, cheap or expensive, popular or obscure, WILL BREAK IF THE ARROW IS DAMAGED PRIOR TO THE SHOT.\nIf you ignore flex-test safety procedures, your damaged arrow shaft can buckle and snap when you shoot it again. Unfortunately, some of the broken pieces will likely continue accelerating, often with unpredictable direction. If you're lucky, the broken pieces will fly away from you and your bow hand (the hand holding the grip). If it's not your lucky day, you'll be making a trip to the emergency room. So don't risk it. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR EQUIPMENT FIRST!\nIf you have other questions about arrow safety or any other concerns about your new arrows, please call our pro-shop for further assistance. We hope you get years of safe and trouble-free enjoyment from your new custom arrows.\nNo, Statistically, Archery is twice as safe as Golf and Fishing. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) operates the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)1, which is a database used to track hospital injuries for more than 15,000 kinds of consumer products used in sports and recreational activities in and around homes and schools. Their study confirms that archery is among the safest of all sports, ranking just above Ping-Pong and Bowling in number of injured participants per year.\nEspecially impressive is the fact that archery maintains a consistently high safety record despite the fact that participants range from grade-school children to senior citizens, many of whom have never before picked up a bow and arrow. Nonetheless, periodic archery injuries are a reality of our sport -- most often because archers simply forget to follow safety procedures. So don't be the 1 in 1,000 archers who end up in the ER. FLEX-TEST YOUR ARROWS EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU SHOOT! We sincerely hope you have a safe and enjoyable archery experience and we strongly encourage you to practice and share this information with other archers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ec88e385-a9b4-42ad-968d-8f1cce726874>","<urn:uuid:1a6a0b11-5227-4cb6-9bfa-62cb5ed1bf4d>"],"error":null}

As for the Navy's role, they were crucial in spacecraft recovery operations. The Navy had extensive experience in recovering NASA spacecraft, starting eight years before with Freedom 7.

Thousands of miles but only minutes away, the crew of Princeton (CV-37) and others on board were waiting on the flight deck for the spacecraft to appear. When they caught sight of the parachutes and Apollo, having slowed into a graceful descent, Navy personnel got right to work. The sequence of operations after splashdown determined life or death for astronauts rendered helpless and vulnerable upon their return to Earth.\nBy Apollo 10’s splashdown on 26 May 1969, the Navy could rely on a wealth of experience in the recovery of NASA spacecraft. The first such Navy-NASA collaboration had occurred almost exactly eight years prior with the splashdown of Freedom 7 upon its return from the United States’ first manned spaceflight. The Navy’s competencies and technologies made it possible for astronauts to survive the aftermath of an ocean landing.\nIn the case of Apollo 10, recovery happened in record time, the product of good weather conditions, a precise reentry, and highly skilled Navy personnel. Splashdown occurred in calm waters of the South Pacific less than three miles from Princeton, the amphibious assault ship tasked with recovering the astronauts and their spacecraft. From Princeton’s deck, Navy helicopters carried some of the Navy’s best swimmers, detached from Underwater Demolition Team 11, to Apollo 10’s command module.\nThe swimmers had trained extensively for their role in helping NASA, and they must have known that their performance could easily determine the outcome of this kind of search and recovery operation. They had to reach the spacecraft right away in order to help the astronauts get away from what could soon turn into a deadly sinking.\nThe men aboard Apollo 10’s command module were all test pilots and veteran astronauts: U.S. Air Force colonel and mission commander Thomas P. Stafford, U.S. Navy commander and lunar module pilot Eugene A. Cernan, and U.S. Navy commander and command module pilot John W. Young. He and Cernan joined a long line of naval-aviators-turned-astronauts all the way back to Captain Alan B. Shepard Jr. (USN), the first American to go to space.\nThe three men had lifted off at 12:49 p.m. EST and had a bumpy escape from the atmosphere, after which point the mission settled into routine but highly complex maneuvers that saw the lunar module and the command service module undocked, then docked, undocked, docked, and undocked again in the course of the journey to and from the moon.\nBuilding on successes of past missions, including Apollo 8, which orbited the moon on 24 and 25 December 1968, Stafford, Cernan, and Young became the first astronauts to orbit the moon in a spacecraft fully capable of landing a person on the moon. From just 15 kilometers above the moon’s surface, Stafford and Cernan were able to identify the landing area for future missions — a relatively flat strip which they called “U.S. 1” after the north-south highway connecting Fort Kent, Maine, to Key West.\nHaving viewed the landing sites, overseen the production of lunar maps by robotic probes, and fulfilled all the other primary mission objectives, Cernan, Stafford, and Young wrapped up the final dress rehearsal for landing a person on the moon. As historian Greg Tomko-Pavia observes, the success of Apollo 10 “gave NASA planners the final bit of confidence they needed” in order to launch Apollo 11 in July of the same year.\nTo help ensure the success of this next mission, the astronauts of Apollo 10 debriefed NASA and Navy officials and scientists on board Princeton. According to Glynn S. Lunney, chief of the Flight Director’s Office at NASA, the mission “went well, everything behaved well, and basically the whole system, hardware, and people, passed the clearance test that we needed to pass to be sure that we could go land on the moon on the next one.”\nFor their efforts, the astronauts also enjoyed sumptuous meals organized by Princeton’s crew. In addition to eggs, any style, and crispy bacon for breakfast, there was filet mignon and passionfruit juice. Dinner featured a variety of delicacies: shrimp cocktail, broiled rock lobster tails, Southern fried chicken, potatoes lyonnaise, broccoli hollandaise, and — for dessert — baked Alaska, ice cream sundaes, strawberry shortcake, and apple pie à la mode.\nPrinceton next returned to her homeport of Long Beach, California, where the recovery ship (Hornet) for the next mission (Apollo 11) lay waiting. And it was aboard Hornet (CV-12) that NASA and Navy planners met to review Princeton’s after-action report and apply lessons learned to the search and rescue procedures for Apollo 11’s splashdown the following month.\n––Adam Bisno, Ph.D., Communication and Outreach Division, Naval History and Heritage Command, April 2019\n Scott W.

{"question":"Working on a conservation assessment, I need to understand how human development affects both prairie dog colonies and grassland-forest boundaries. What are the main changes observed in both cases?","answer":"Both systems show significant human-driven changes. Prairie dog colonies have dramatically declined from their historical extent, with only 2% remaining of an estimated 100 million acres, primarily due to urban development, poisoning programs, and bubonic plague. This decline threatens dependent species like black-footed ferrets and burrowing owls. Similarly, significant changes have occurred in grassland-forest boundaries, where woody plants have expanded into long-standing grasslands on nearly every continent except Antarctica over the last 150 years. This expansion, driven by global change factors, has led to decreased plant diversity and in some cases desertification, fundamentally altering these ecosystems' structure and function.","context":["Growth and flux responses to environmental gradients in tallgrass prairie\nKonza Prairie Biological Station: Photo credit: Judd Patterson\nGenerally, ecologists have environmental data at the leaf scale, at the scale of the watershed using eddy covariance towers (100s of meters), and at regional scales (using satellite imagery).

To assess this missing scale of water and energy flux, we have operated landscape sensor networks that can obtain continuous measurements of key environmental variables (including VPD, soil moisture, air/soil/canopy temperature, windspeed / direction, and irradiance) since 2008.\nWorking with Nate Brunsell (Geography - KU), our goals for this project are: (1) Increase our ability to predict the environmental drivers of energy / water flux in the community (dominant grasses and forbs) (2) document environmental variability and drivers of biological responses along topographic gradients, and (3) scale the physiological responses of these plant communities to the landscape energy and water balance\nWatershed 4B on Konza (Sept. 2011). Reddish patches are 'shrub islands' of Cornus drummondii\nOver the last 150 years, and the last 50 years in particular, woody plants have expanded into long-standing grasslands and savannas on every continent except Antarctica—a phenomenon known as woody encroachment. Woody encroachment has a negative impact on plant diversity in North America and in some cases, leads to desertification. We’re studying how internal dynamics of shrub-grass competition interact with the external forcing of global change, in order to understand tree-grass competition in general, and how the balance of trees vs. grasses will change in the future.\nTo guide our research, we use a conceptual framework built from aspects of theoretical savanna ecology, stable-state theory, and coexistence theory. We’re applying these perspectives to a diverse group of data-types, including long-term data-sets of grass/shrub cover, physiological measurements of plant form and function, and vital rates of shrubs (i.e. demography). Our first goal is to test whether the spatial and temporal patterns of woody encroachment fit the construct of bi-stability. If woody encroachment is governed by stable-state dynamics, what mechanisms (i.e. positive/negative feedbacks) result in bi-stability? Where and when do tipping points occur (i.e. what is the resilience to press and pulse pressures, solo and in tandem)? By answering these questions, we hope to develop generalizable models of shrub-grass bi-stability, which can be used to answer theoretical and applied questions.\nA few years ago, our own Teall Culbertson initiated a project on Konza Prairie to determine the drinking water sources of the captive bison herd. Her results showed a reliance by this herd on ephemeral water sources (puddles, wallows) and water from forage [published in Ecosphere in Feb. 2013]. Using this novel isotopic approach, we are now working with Tony Swemmer (SAEON - Ndlovu Node) and Michelle Henley (Save the Elephants .ORG). Michelle is one of the foremost experts of elephant ecology, and has many GPS-collared individuals. Working together, we hope to collect data for the next several years (2013-15) to create a detailed picture of resource availability, use, and patterns of movements for elephants in northeast South Africa.\nThe most under-studied aspect of ecology is the below-ground world of plant roots. While we all acknowledge the sweeping significance of roots on ecosystem processes, quantifying root abundance, form, and function is extremely difficult. Thus, we tend to ignore everything going on belowground!\nSince the research of Weaver in the 1930's-50's, we have known about the occurrence of deep roots in the mesic tallgrass prairies of North America. However, we now know that most of these grasses rely heavily on surface roots (0-10cm) for water uptake, regardless of deep roots. Thus, why do tallgrass species have deep roots, what is the distribution of roots across the soil profile, and how does root class (length / width) change by depth and according to managment activities (burning / grazing)?\nIn addition to asking questions of root type and distribution, we want to know how the types of roots produced impacts the potential hydraulic capacity of the whole plant. For example, what is the capacity of roots produced at great depths (over a meter deep) to deliver water to the surface plant? Our preliminary data suggests that deep roots have severely reduced stele / cortex ratio. Coupled with the fact that there is exponentionally less root biomass at depth than surface soils, most grasses in this system functionally cannot rely on deep soil moisture to support the aboveground plant water demand.\nIn Mapungubwe National Park, in northern South Africa, riparian forests along the Limpopo River have contracted, and extensive stands of closed-canopy forest once dominated by Acacia xanthophloea, Faidherbia albida, Ficus sycomorus have been replaced by savanna. Water availability for these forests has changed over time, with altered flow in the Limpopo River. Since 2012, we have worked with Tony Swemmer (SAEON - Ndlovu Node) and Tim O'Connor (SAEON) to understand the spatial and temporal patterns of water-use among these trees.\nOur results to date show that species most suseptible to mortality have a greater reliance on water from unsaturated soils and /or are more suseptible to elephant damage. In addition, we have preliminary data that suggests that expansion of the sub-canopy / small tree Croton megalobotrys (feverberry) may have a novel source-water strategy compared to coexisting tree species. Thus, multiple interacting factors are having species-specific impacts in the Mapungubwe riparian forests, with consequences for habitat availability, hydrology, and biodiversity in this system.\nClimate change, atmospheric chemistry changes, and invasive species are altering plant communities in natural areas of the Colorado Front Range, but more rapid and dramatic community transformations are believed underway as a result of native consumer activities interacting with these other change factors. Research proposed here addresses two important questions: 1) What are the mechanisms that allow for winter annual species to become a dominant life form along the Colorado Front Range, and 2) do these new plant species alter the role of prairie dogs from that of a keystone species to one of an ecosystem transformer?\nWorking with Tim Seastedt (CU- Boulder) and Laurel Hartley (CU-Denver), we are examining if if the combination of expanded growing season and wetter winter conditions favors the emergence of a ‘new’ group of dominant plants on the Front Range, the winter annuals, and manipulations will document the consequences and feedbacks of these plants on the native perennial species. The emergence of a new temporal niche, occupied by species new to the region, is hypothesized to cause a cascade of biogeochemical feedbacks that sustain the abundance of this new group.Thus, global changes result in a ‘keystone species’ functioning as an ‘ecosystem transformer’, with grasslands being converted to shrublands or other novel ecosystems. While effects to date appear strongest along the urban-wildlands corridor, the expansion of global change factors into the shortgrass steppe and mixed grass prairies may expand the region where ‘desertification effects’ of prairie dogs are anticipated.\nA fundamental challenge for ecology is to explain the apparently stable coexistence of trees and grasses in savannas and woodlands, which are poised in the continuum between forests (which are completely tree-dominated) and grasslands (which lack trees). Why do trees not displace grasses in these environments? Water availability is the likely factor constraining tree cover, but the mechanisms driving this constraint are still unknown. The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively tackle this problem from an ecohydrological perspective. This requires that we resolve how trees and grasses a) use and b) partition soil moisture as a function of depth across a wide range of environmental conditions.\nWe are working with Ricardo Holdo at the University of Missouri to address three primary research objectives: (1) characterize the spatiotemporal partitioning of soil moisture by trees and grasses across climatic and edaphic gradients, (2) quantify the strength of tree-grass competition in tropical savannas, and (3) identify key interspecific ecohydrological tradeoffs of tree and grass rooting niches.","Why all the fuss over a bunch of ground squirrels? The answer lies in the farmer and rancher's view of prairie dogs' impact to their livelihood. Prairie dogs compete with livestock for forage. They clip vegetation to maintain a view of their surroundings and eat the same grasses that would otherwise be available for cattle and horses. Over long periods of prairie dog activity grass species which ranchers find most desirable can disappear. They are often replaced with less palatable grass species with lower nutritional value. In farmed ground prairie dogs can decimate or destroy a crop of alfalfa, grains or hay.\nPeople also compete with prairie dogs for shelter. Expanding urban areas, especially the rapidly growing Front Range in Colorado, has seen the conversion of prairie dog towns into people towns-as housing and commercial development replaces grasslands. No government-sponsored campaign against the prairie dogs has been necessary to insure the dominance of human uses in our towns and cities. Once prairie dogs are removed, the habitat is changed to such a degree prairie dogs usually don't have the opportunity or ability to reestablish themselves.\nTheir burrow system has been studied well enough so that we know today one might find the following: (I) a \"listening post room\" just under the surface and set offfrom their main burrow, (2) a separate \"room\" which they use as a toilet and which may be emptied periodically, (3) a nesting/sleeping chamber lined with dried grass. The nesting chambers are often elevated from the bottom of their tunnels so they remain dry when water flows into the burrow entrance.\nThe social life of black-tailed prairie dogs has been the topic of much study and interest by field naturalists and ecologists. For example, prairie dogs have a vocabulary of about 11 distinct calls and a host of postures and displays. When detecting danger, prairie dogs alert other members of the colony. They make a loud \"chirk\" while standing, on two or four legs, or lying prostrate in a burrow entrance. This anti- predator call has been given a variety of names including the \"squit-tuck\", the warning bark, and the \"tik-uhl\". It is something of an evolutionary puzzle why prairie dogs would risk their own skin by drawing the attention of a predator in order to save other members of their town. Some scientists believe that prairie dogs only mean to warn their close kin.\nAnother call given by prairie dogs has also attracted the naturalists' attention. From time to time a prairie dog will stand on its hind legs, stretch the body as vertical as possible and throw its front feet high into the air. While doing all this it begins a very loud call, described variously as a yelp, cry, song and a yip. While it is amusing to watch one prairie dog do this, jump-yipping soon spreads through the colony creating a contagious and wild dance. Naturalists believe that jump-yips probably help family groups maintain their territories, and may possibly be an \"all-clear\" signal once a predator has left the vicinity.\nA certain prairie dog behavior has been described as kin recognition, family member identification or brood discrimination. But what they are doing is kissing. Black-tailed prairie dogs kiss when they meet within a family's territory. It typically goes something like this: a prairie dog, uncertain about the identity of a neighbor in her territory, cautiously creeps toward the other. She opens her mouth showing her teeth. If the other prairie dog is a family member, they will touch their mouths for an instant or for several seconds. Once they have kissed, prairie dogs may groom each other, nibble at one another's fur or wrestle around in mock battle. As with jump-yipping when two prairie dogs kiss a chain reaction often follows with a colony full of kissing prairie dogs.\nWhile the social life of prairie dogs is interesting and much studied, their role in grassland ecology is equally fascinating. Historically, bison grazed patches of mixed grass prairie short enough for prairie dogs to colonize. As prairie dogs fed upon and trimmed the vegetation, it shifted from a mature prairie to a more disturbed state with more weedy broadleaf plants. Under initial pressure of prairie dog grazing, the grass grew more rapidly and was richer in nutrients. Increased abundance of the weedy broadleaf plants attracted pronghorn antelope. Bison, mule deer and elk also visited prairie dog colonies to feed upon the nutrient rich grasses. Although elk and bison are gone from most of the grasslands of the Great Plains, prairie dog colonies continue to support the biodiversity of the great plains by attracting a variety of animal species. These include fairly common and widespread species such as meadowlarks, horned larks, cottontail rabbits, and deermice as well as species with closer ties to the prairie dog colonies such as burrowing owls. Burrowing owls feed upon insects and small mammals around prairie dog towns and depend upon prairie dog or badger holes for their nests. Many other uncommon or rare species of grassland animals in the Boulder Valley frequent prairie dog colonies. These include golden and bald eagles, ferruginous hawks, badgers, prairie falcons. Black-footed ferrets, an endangered species now extirpated from most of their range depend almost entirely upon prairie dogs for food and shelter.\nNot only do they have far reaching impacts like people do, but they live in family groups, and have an elaborate system of communication (well the yipjump is not quite the Internet, but it meets the prairie dogs' needs). They kiss, wrestle, and defend the boundaries of their territories. When the landscape does not suit them, they change it to be safer and more comfortable in their homes. The prairie dog modified landscape attracts a distinct group of animals just as our cities and towns attract pigeons, racoons, house sparrows and fox squirrels.\nHowever, unlike human populations which continue to grow and spread out over the landscape, the extent and numbers of prairie dogs are shrinking. Out of an estimated 100 million acres of active black-tailed prairie dog colonies, about 2 percent remains. While poisoning programs aimed at preserving agricultural productivity have been responsible for most of this decline, urban development and bubonic plague are becoming significant concerns in the last few decades. The black-footed ferret has been driven to verge of extinction by the reduction of prairie dog colonies. Burrowing owls have been extirpated from the Boulder Valley. Conservation biologists are concerned that other species dependent upon prairie dogs may follow in what has been described as an \"ecological train wreck.\"\nThe Open Space Department has begun work on a grassland management plan in an attempt to head off such a train wreck in the Boulder Valley. The Department has worked over the past three years with a committee of farmers, rural residents, environmentalists, animal rights advocates, land managers and interested citizens to develop a set of goals for prairie dog management on Open Space. The initial phase of the plan concentrates on prairie dog management and seeks to reduce the conflicts between prairie dogs and adjacent land uses by establishing a system of prairie dog habitat conservation areas throughout the Open Space land system.\nIn order to develop the preserve system, the Open Space land system has been broken down into several categories. The first category is \"ecological suitability.\" Most grasslands on Open Space were considered to be ecologically suitable for prairie dogs. Coniferous forests, wetlands, tallgrass prairie, and riparian areas are ecologically unsuitable.\nEcologically suitable lands were then considered for their \"cultural suitability.\" Irrigated crops and pasture were considered to be culturally unsuitable because the Open Space Department has a part of its mission, the preservation of agricultural land uses in the Boulder Valley. Areas being reclaimed from a previous land use (for example, the gravel mine along Coal Creek or the strip farming on Gunbarrel Hill) were also considered culturally unsuitable-at least until a healthy native grassland is restored. As part of the cultural suitability analysis, the Open Space Department also wanted to insure that there would be prairie dog colonies in places where people could enjoy observing them and where educational activities could be focused.\nThe remaining suitable habitat was then examined more closely, using generally accepted principles of preserve design. For example, large, contiguous blocks of habitat usually make better preserves than small, isolated blocks. The preserve design was then modified for the specific requirements of prairie dogs such as soil type, slope, vulnerability to plague and barriers to dispersal. The requirements of those species which depend upon prairie dog colonies (burrowing owls, raptors and badgers) were also taken into consideration when developing the preserve design.\nThe resulting preserve system includes approximately 4,600 acres in seven habitat conservation areas. Prairie dogs will exist essentially undisturbed in habitat conservation areas where management activities will focus upon encouraging prairie dogs to create and maintain habitats for a variety of plant and animal species. The first phase of the grassland management plan also contains a set of policies describing in greater detail the Open Space Department's control and monitoring programs, educational initiatives, and public process as it relates to prairie dog management."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fc8691a4-f3a2-4d17-a049-386942746621>","<urn:uuid:03e9119b-3cce-44b2-a874-e6efb71076d9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a sports enthusiast, I'd love to know more about Cornwall's traditional sports. What are the unique characteristics of Cornish hurling, and how do environmental factors affect the preservation of Cornwall's sporting heritage?","answer":"Cornish hurling, also known as Hurling the Silver Ball, is a thousand-year-old traditional sport where teams compete to maintain possession of a silver ball until the game ends. It's currently played in only two locations in Cornwall: St Columb Major on Shrove Tuesday and St Ives on the first Monday after February 3rd, with occasional games in Bodmin every five years. Despite its limited modern presence, it's considered Cornwall's national sport alongside Cornish wrestling. The preservation of such sporting heritage, like other cultural elements, faces environmental challenges. Natural changes in the coastal environment can affect historical sites and artifacts, while human impacts like vandalism and theft of artifacts can also threaten cultural heritage. These threats require careful management and documentation, with organizations working to educate the public about heritage preservation and implementing specific Conservation Management Plans to protect historical sites and traditions.","context":["Whether you’ve only recently settled in Cornwall, have been here a while, or indeed lived here your entire life, you may not know about some of the distinctively unique Cornish sports. So, if someone asks if you want to go and play some shinty, or take part in some Cornish wrestling, with the help of this guide, you might just have an idea of what they are talking about.\nEasing you in, let’s start with the familiar.\nRugby is largely more popular than football across Cornwall, though football is building more of a following. If you are looking for a local club to follow then Truro City Football Club, founded in 1889, may be the team for you. They are currently playing in the Southern League Premier South and won away to Yate Town on 15 September. Truro City FC are the highest-ranked football club in Cornwall.\nThe Bottle match between csm and rsm is the second oldest rugby varsity match in the world\nIf rugby is what you prefer, then the Cornish Pirates are the side to follow. The RFU Championship kicked off on 17 September with the Pirates’ first match against Richmond being played at home on Saturday 18th. With the championship’s start coinciding with the start of the academic year, and Truro City’s campaign not beginning too long ago, it is a perfect time to become acquainted with your local teams.\nEven closer to home than Truro and Penzance are the university teams that play and complete regularly in football and rugby as well as hockey, netball, lacrosse, badminton, and more. The Bottle Match between CSM (Cambourne School of Mines) and RSM (Royal School of Mines) is the second-oldest rugby varsity in the world and will certainly be one to go and watch.\nCornwall and surfing go hand in hand for good reason; Cornwall is the UK’s surf capital and attracts surfers from all across the world. Both the north and south coasts boast magnetising and varied waves in locations such as Newquay, Praa Sands, Towan, and St Ives. If the actual surfing does not appeal to you, then there are plenty of competitions hosted on Cornish beaches that you can spectate at. Coming up at Perranporth beach from 16-17 October is the English Interclub Surfing Championships that have been eagerly anticipated. It’s certainly a date to remember, and the surfing is guaranteed to be spectacular!\nNow, let’s turn our attention to lesser-known side of Cornish sport.\nShinty, which is Celtic in origin, was popular nationwide since approximately the 16th century and was one of the most favoured games in Cornwall. Shinty is in some ways akin to field hockey, but importantly, both sides of the stick (called a caman) can be used, and the ball can be played in the air. Naturally, the aim is to get the ball in the opposition’s goal. Shinty’s popularity has unfortunately dwindled since the 19th century onwards. However, clubs do still exist. The Cornwall Shinty Club, aptly named The Pasties, have their home ground at the Dracaena Centre, Falmouth, and recently won their first trophy of the season in Bristol. They are one of the few shinty clubs outside of Scotland, competing with shinty teams nationwide and training regularly.\nA BANNER DEPICTING CORNISH WRESTLERS WAS CARRIED AT THE BATTLE OF AGINCOURT IN 1415\nPerhaps the most exclusively Cornish sport is Hurling the Silver Ball, which is also known as Cornish hurling. Despite being of unknown origin, Cornish hurling dates back at least one thousand years. Though it shares its name with Irish hurling, the two sports are entirely different. The aim of the sport is for a side to keep possession of the silver ball until the game concludes. As such an aim suggests, it’s a very physical sport. It is now only played in two locations in Cornwall: St Columb Major and St Ives. In St Columb Major, the games occur on Shrove Tuesday, and in St Ives, Hurling the Silver Ball occurs on the first Monday after the third of February as part of the St Ives Feast. Less regularly, Cornish is played at Bodmin every five years. Despite its decline, it is still considered Cornwall’s national sport, and it’s my opinion that any sports fan living in Cornwall should be aware of its cultural importance!\nCornish wrestling is the other sport considered to be Cornwall’s national sport, alongside Cornish hurling. The sport has a rich and incredibly interesting history. For example, at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, Cornwall’s fighting men carried symbols showing wrestlers as described in the poem “Poly-Olbion”. The objective of Cornish wrestling is to throw the opponent on the ground and make them land as flat as possible on their back. The wrestlers typically wear canvas jackets to make grappling onto each other easier. You cannot hold your opponent down on the floor as you must be standing for it to be considered a victory. Cornish wrestling, unlike Cornish hurling, is still played regularly, with clubs across Cornwall. Maybe you could try your hand at some Cornish wrasslin’?\nThere’s a whole world of Cornish sport out there that I have only scratched the surface of. It is wonderfully varied and holds possibilities for both land and sea lovers. So, get involved and immersed, and enjoy the delights that Cornish sport can provide you!","Opportunities and Threats to the Maritime Environment\nThis section discusses how natural changes to the maritime environment and changes in human exploitation and understanding of the sea, allow greater opportunities to understand and study maritime heritage than ever before, but by the same token also pose greater threats to its integrity.\nThe marine and inter-tidal zones are dynamic and have always undergone natural environmental change and changing patterns of use and exploitation which are nothing new.\nThe coastline has always been subject to change, whether settlements and harbours have been eroded and lost to the sea, as at Dunwich in Suffolk, or have silted up and are now located inland, for example on the Sussex coast.\nThis process is continuous and is also affected by patterns of extreme weather which can reveal new wreck archaeology, result in damage to known wreck sites, or even create new forms of wreck.\nCoastal surveys and the techniques of marine archaeology lead to a greater understanding of the character of the local marine historic environment and how it is affected by these processes.\nResponding to the unexpected\nThe patterns of changing exploitation of the seabed create new opportunities for discovery. For example, the wreck of the London (1665) was located and identified through archaeological assessment in advance of the London Gateway project which deepened the navigational channels in the Thames, resulting in the designation of the wreck and its continuing investigation.\nIn the marine planning system, new forms of construction at sea in the form of offshore renewables (windfarms) have the potential to impact on archaeology, but by the same token, can bring to light new archaeology and increase our understanding of what lies beneath the sea.\nIn a similar vein, individual climate events such as continuing storms of early 2014 can have an impact on local beaches, revealing wrecks that have rarely or never been seen before. These are often reported by members of the public, allowing us to enhance our records and identify wrecks for further research or potential protection.\nSuch wrecks, or other historic seabed or shoreline features such as submerged forests, can also come under threat. These threats may be environmental, for example, the erosion of a protective sand cover also exposes ship timbers on a wreck to the same forces of erosion.\nDespite the positive impacts of public enthusiasm for maritime heritage, there are negative sides to human interest in shipwreck. Human impacts, from vandalism to theft of artefacts or the non-disclosure of removed artefacts from a shipwreck, are also a threat.\nIf objects are removed from shipwrecks without proper archaeological recording their context is lost and this lessens our understanding of these wrecks, while less is left for visiting divers to enjoy. These constitute heritage crimes and Historic England works closely with the Receiver of Wreck in order to educate and inform the public on maritime heritage issues.\nWhat we can do\nWe can care for maritime archaeology in a number of ways. At Historic England we vary our approach according to the needs of each site that are clearly identified in a site- specific Conservation Management Plan.\nBesides coastal survey and marine environmental assessments, photographic and documentary recording allows us to monitor changes to local archaeology and to identify individual sites or forms of archaeology which might need further investigation, research, recording, or protection, including an in situ approach.\nThis includes continual enhancement of the National Record of the Historic Environment (NRHE) database or commissioning strategic reviews that prioritise particular types of vessel for investigation and protection, such as the Ships and Boats pre-1840 review. As a result a number of vessels such as the Daresbury, a rare survival of an 18th century Mersey flat, have been protected.\nArchaeological protocols for commercial activity mean that finds from the dredging, fishing and offshore renewables industries are now routinely reported and recorded in the NRHE database and also reveal new patterns from the past such as clusters of cannonballs which may indicate concentrations of naval or privateering activity and may potentially be matched with particular battles.\nWe are also looking at new ways of engaging the public through developing dive trails, by community engagement and raising awareness through the latest technology, allowing non-divers and non-specialists to access information on maritime heritage.\nWe also welcome reports from members of the public and leisure divers of anything they have seen or researched, which in turn is recorded and made accessible to the public through the NRHE database or through formal archaeological investigation.\nIt becomes a dynamic ‘virtuous circle’ of increasing understanding of the maritime heritage environment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0eaebb1d-a88c-4d48-9941-a3dbe74a8cfe>","<urn:uuid:9ba8f652-91fb-4554-96ad-8fda81dc210c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hi, I'm interested in understanding how Dimensions uses AI in research classification. What does Dimensions specifically use AI for? 📚","answer":"Dimensions uses AI to categorize documents into previously defined topic areas in an automated way. The platform has been doing this for many years, and it's one example of how organizations are using AI to categorize data in different ways, such as fitting articles into the UN Sustainable Development Goals framework or categorizing research by geography.","context":["Whether you are a medical researcher or practicing health professional, it is a daily battle to fight through the tonnes of information that seem to pour in from all directions. Academic articles, preprints, clinical trials and media reports can all add to the confusion where they should help optimize decision-making.\nWith the need to ensure the wealth of knowledge out there is fully utilized, AI is increasingly becoming the tool of choice to solve this conundrum. Recognising this need, publishers and information providers are pushing AI’s capabilities to streamline workflows and optimize researchers’ time and effectiveness. For example, a number of organizations are using AI to categorize data in different ways, whether it be in terms of where articles fit in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, or in terms of the geography of where research has been undertaken. Indeed, Dimensions is one platform in which AI has been used to categorise documents into previously defined topic areas in an automated way for many years now.\nThere is perhaps no other area where the impact of research is being felt more keenly than in cancer research, where according to the National Cancer Institute in the US it will spend nearly $7bn in 2022. On a smaller scale, AI should be able to be put to good use extracting the maximum value of these dollars, and one example of this has been explored in the recent article Application of artificial intelligence to overcome clinical information overload in urological cancer by Arnulf Strenzl et al in BJUI International.\nIn the article, the authors look at how the use of AI can help researchers – specifically in the field of uro-oncology – set up more sophisticated queries than traditional methods. The benefits of this approach can provide what the authors call a “synthesis of raw data and complex outputs into more actionable and personalized results”.\nThe study examined a number of tools, including Dimensions from Digital Science, and the use of AI within them. The advantages that AI offers beyond traditional search methods are clear when it comes to looking at evidential support for treatment choices or sequencing decisions. A straight search in relation to a specific disease in the PubMed database, for example, will yield thousands of results, with much more work required to filter those results on article or journal performance before the most relevant sources appear, and even then there may be dozens or even hundreds of possibilities.\nWhat AI can produce – and in the article Pfizer’s dashboard on prostate cancer built with Dimensions is used as a prime example – is the ability to quickly cross-reference dozens of treatments and identify where studies have taken place. The article does also highlight some limitations in the dashboard – we are still some way from simply feeding documents into a machine with decisions made for us, and so research still requires an element of expert interpretation. However, with constant improvements being made using technological advances and feedback, future enhancements are never very far away.\nFor researchers and practitioners in this space, the article concludes that the Dimensions platform, “demonstrated how AI can assist urologists and oncologists to readily obtain focussed information on a specific topic of interest from rich datasets”, for example by gaining insights into published articles and clinical trials on specific combinations or sequences of therapeutic agents. It further states that AI, “exhibits the potential to support more tailored, accurate, and reliable clinical decision-making from the multiple sources of information available”. While AI may never get close to delivering perfect answers to researchers’ questions every time, it can certainly succeed in delivering better answers more quickly than ever before."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a1fb90ec-f0f8-4769-a1f7-bf6127416b6b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the focus on achieving specific mechanical properties compare between blade manufacturing with 5160 steel and precipitation hardening stainless steels? What testing methods and performance criteria are emphasized for each type?","answer":"For 5160 steel blades, the mechanical properties are optimized specifically for passing the ABS JS performance tests, with emphasis on achieving proper hardness through triple quenching and triple tempering cycles, while maintaining flexibility for the 90-degree bend test. The process requires careful attention to grain structure and edge properties through multiple heat treatment stages. In contrast, precipitation hardening stainless steels are designed to achieve specific yield strengths (515-1415 MPa) and tensile strengths (860-1520 MPa) through a more standardized process, with properties verified through standard mechanical testing. These steels are optimized for industrial applications like aerospace components and high-strength shafts, focusing on combining strength with corrosion resistance similar to grade 304 stainless steel.","context":["CREATING A BLADE THAT WILL PASS THE ABS JS PERFORMANCE TESTS\nChoosing the proper steel is a must in order to pass the ABS JS test. I highly recommend 5160. Don't be fooled by it only having 60% carbon. With proper heat treating it will easily pass all phases of the test. I will take you through step by step, explaining the manner in which I would produce a blade to pass the ABS Journeyman Smith test with 5160 steel.\nFORGING: Either 1 ¼” or 1 ½” X ¼” is the best size to start with for a test blade. Begin forging with the highest heats you intend to use. Then progressively reduce the heats throughout the forging process. Pay close attention, and do not let yourself be distracted from the forge! This is where most people let their mind wonder and without realizing it, let the blade overheat, which causes the grain to grow dramatically. The reducing heats are intended to refine grain structure as you go through the forging process. Ensure you leave extra “meat” at the edge as “sacrificial” material that will be ground away after the heat treat process. Remember that you may use either a full or hidden tang blade for the JS test, but for safety sake, I recommend forging a full tang unless you feel supremely confident that you can make a hidden tang that will pass the bend test.\nNORMALIZING: This is a critical step in a high performance blade. Once forging to shape is complete, heat the blade to just critical temp, and allow it to COMPLETELY cool in still air. This has the effect of relaxing all the internal stresses that have been built up during the forging process, and will eliminate 90% of warpage problems. Multiple cycles are of great benefit, and should be experimented with to achieve optimum results in your shop.\nTHERMAL CYCLING: This is basically an \"insurance\" step. This step CAN be used in conjunction with, OR in place of the Normalizing step. This step involves heating the forged blade to NOT MORE than 1350F, and then allowing it to cool to BELOW 900F. If necessary, turn your forge down (provides better control), and then DO NOT BE DISTRACTED BY ANYTHING. Bring the entire blade/tang to an even heat that is NOT MORE THAN 1350F. (visually this will be a VERY dull red, where the red color is just visually perceptible). If your judging by eye, place the blade in a shadowed area near your forge to better see the actual color. Once the blade/tang is evenly heated to the temp/color indicated, place it on a rack of some type to cool. DO NOT lay it on it's side on the anvil or any other heat sink! Allow the blade to cool to at least 900F (there will be no color in the blade, but it will still be too hot to handle with welding gloves...allowing it to cool more is not an issue...not allowing it to cool enough is!) Repeat for a total of three times, then proceed to the annealing step. Proper thermal cycling will \"repair\" any grain enlargement that occurred during the forging step, and will ensure a fine, tight grain structure for the remaining operations.\nANNEALING: Once the blade has completely cooled, it is time to anneal. Bring the blade to a little past non-magnetic, and place in a slow cooling media. I recommend vermiculite. Sand is not a good insulator, and ashes draw moisture, which can result in hard spots (something you certainly DO NOT want at this point). I usually do my annealing in the evening, and allow the blade to cool overnight. Routinely it takes a test blade sized piece of steel 6-10 hours to fully cool in vermiculite. This step reduces grain size within the steel, and may be accomplished multiple times for added benefit. Like normalizing, multiple annealing cycles are of added benefit to both 5160 and 52100.\nROUGH GRINDING: This is simply where the blade is profiled and refined prior to the heat treatment. Distal tapers can be refined or added at this point. Ensure you leave enough extra material in the edge so as not to overheat it during hardening. I recommend about the thickness of a nickel. I choose to call this extra material “sacrificial”, as it acts like a protective shroud to what will be the working edge of the blade. After rough grinding is complete, ensure you go over the entire blade with at least 120 grit to eliminate the possibility of stress risers that may be caused by large scratches that are left from the course grit belts.\nHARDENING: Keep in mind that we are talking about 5160 steel. I recommend edge quenching ONLY on a blade that will be used for something as important as the ABS JS test. I DO NOT endorse fully hardening a blade, and \"soft back\" drawing... because most people do not do it correctly, and very often it will end with the blade breaking during the bending portion of the performance test.\nIf you don’t already have one, make a “limiter plate” for your quench tank. This is nothing more than a ¼” to 3/8” thick piece of aluminum that is choked full of 3/8” holes. At each corner drill and tap a ¼” X 20 hole and use carriage bolts with the heads facing the bottom of the quench tank, and screwed into the holes at each corner of the plate. This will allow you to raise and lower the quench depth to fit any blade. Once the limiter plate is set to the proper depth (about 1/3 of the blades width), pre-heat the quenching oil (if you are using vet grade mineral oil, pre-heat the oil to approx. 130F. Be careful here; DO NOT quench in mineral oil if the oil is 180F or higher. At this temp the oil will not cool the steel fast enough to achieve full hardness and your blade will not pass the chopping portion of the ABS JS test.\nIf you are using a fast quench oil such as Parks 50, I recommend using it at room temp (50-70F).\nUsing approx. a #3 welding tip on an Oxy/Acty torch, and with a SOFT flame (a flame that does not roar, but has a very mild hiss.), start heating the ricasso area near the edge, and as soon as it starts to turn color, then work the blade back and forth until it is just past non-magnetic (I recommend going slightly past non-magnetic because the actual critical temp for most steels is approx 150F beyond non-magnetic).. you also must consider that there will be a certain amount of heat lost between removing the torch and getting the blade INTO the quench oil. This heating step may also be performed with a salt tank, or even the forge, but be fore warned....the chances for mistakes are much greater than if you have practiced with the torch....remember, we are seeking to create a blade to pass a given set of circumstances (the ABS performance tests), not an everyday user. Although I am an advocate of differential heat treating, and believe with experience and correct application, it creates an outstanding \"user\", it is certianly not the only way to create a blade.....but in my expereince it is the best way IF you're goal is to pass the ABS Performance tests.\nOnce the entire edge is an even heat, quench by placing the tip into the oil first, for a count of 7, and then rock the rest of edge into the oil for another count of 7. Continue rocking the blade back and forth in this manner until all the “fumes” have ceased. At this point slide the blade off the limiter plate, and allow it to cool COMPLETELY in the oil, to room temp. Repeat the process twice more for a triple quench.\nOnce the final quench/cool cycle is complete, grind off the scale with a 120 or 220 grit, and get ready to temper.\nTEMPERING: Pre-heat your oven to 350F. If you are using a kitchen oven, don’t trust the dial! I also strongly suggest an oven thermometer (I use two just to make sure). Let the oven cycle for 20-30 min to achieve a level, even heat, and place the blade on the middle rack for AT LEAST TWO HOURS. Allow the blade to cool to room temp between tempering cycles, and repeat for a total of three tempering cycles.\nFINAL GRINDING: This is where the rubber meets the road. To this point you have set everything else up for a fine convex grind, and a nice flowing, distal taper. This can be a slow process since your dealing with a blade that has been heat-treated, and you should be grinding bare handed. If the blade gets too hot to hold, then it is too hot period! I start with a fresh 50-grit belt, cleaning up the tapers and then remove excess material from the flats of the blade. I usually will flat grind with the 50 and then a 120 which will reduce weight and thin down the area just above the edge. Once I hit 220 I go to a convex grind. I do this through a modification I made to the grinder platen, where there is approx. a 2” area that is slack just below the platen, and above the lower contact wheel. Your goal at this point should be for the edge to be very close to \"sharp\" by the time you finish with a 400-grit belt, as well as having the spine rounded and all sharp corners removed. (sharp corners can, and often do cause blades to fail in the 90-degree bend test).\nJust to make things easier when hand sanding, I often go over the blade with a 600 grit belt to get as many 400 grit scratches out as possible. Once you have completed with the belt grinder, go to the bench and hand sand out all the scratches with 400 grit paper. (I prefer the final finish to be lengthwise...the scratch pattern following the blade's length) Even though the ABS rules state that the blade need not be highly finished, DO IT! I can usually tell when a potential JS walks into my shop to test, as to whether or not they will pass, based on the outward appearance of their test blade. This is an outward and immediate indication of how careful an individual has been with the overall process… Especially if I have not met with the person before. To date, my initial predictions have not been proven wrong.\nHANDLES/GUARDS/BOLSTERS: The test blade is not required to be a highly finished piece, and therefore guard and bolster are not necessary. A couple of tips that will help with the bending test are..…….\n1. Choose some type of micarta or phenolic for the handle slabs. Both of these materials are very tough, and will lend support to the tang area during the bending phase of the test.\n2. DO NOT use large handle bolts that force you to drill large holes in the tang! This will only serve to weaken the tang, and could cost you dearly during the test. I suggest holding the handle material in place with epoxy, and at the maximum, a couple of 1/8” pins. Maybe even just a couple of 1/8” brass pins that are piened to hold the handles.\nNOTE: The thing that will get you through the test easily is paying close attention to details! Superior heat treatment, proper distal tapers to distribute the bending stresses, a fine convex grind, and rounding all sharp corners. I personally like to see a test blade that has been etched lightly in ferric chloride to reveal the temper line and the grain structure. This is also key, in that if the blade is not finished to the point where a light etch will show the temper line and grain structure, I believe it is not finished enough for the test.\nMany may insist on using another type of steel, and that is fine. As long as enough experimentation/experience has taken place to ensure all the desired characteristics are there. In the past, individuals have passed the JS test with other types of steel such as O-1 or 1095. However, these individuals had taken the time and effort to work out the \"kinks\". More aspiring JS applicants have passed the test with 5160 than with any other steel..................that should speak volumes!\nThis article is intended as a general guide to creating a blade that will pass the ABS JS tests, and is in no way a guarantee of success. Much depends on the individual Bladesmith's understanding of proper blade design in relation to function, and applying the concentration necessary throughout the ENTIRE process of creating a test blade. These are proven methods from 25+ years of bladesmithing experience, and should be of much value to anyone interested in achieving their ABS Journeyman Smith rating.\nCopyright 2019: \"The Montana Bladesmith\"","Precipitation hardening stainless steels are chromium and nickel containing steels that provide an optimum combination of the properties of martensitic and austenitic grades. Like martensitic grades, they are known for their ability to gain high strength through heat treatment and they also have the corrosion resistance of austenitic stainless steel.\nThe high tensile strengths of precipitation hardening stainless steels come after a heat treatment process that leads to precipitation hardening of a martensitic or austenitic matrix. Hardening is achieved through the addition of one or more of the elements Copper, Aluminium, Titanium, Niobium, and Molybdenum.\nThe most well known precipitation hardening steel is 17-4 PH. The name comes from the additions 17% Chromium and 4% Nickel. It also contains 4% Copper and 0.3% Niobium. 17-4 PH is also known as stainless steel grade 630.\nThe advantage of precipitation hardening steels is that they can be supplied in a “solution treated” condition, which is readily machinable. After machining or another fabrication method, a single, low temperature heat treatment can be applied to increase the strength of the steel. This is known as ageing or age-hardening. As it is carried out at low temperature, the component undergoes no distortion.\nPrecipitation hardening steels are characterised into one of three groups based on their final microstructures after heat treatment. The three types are: martensitic (e.g. 17-4 PH), semi-austenitic (e.g. 17-7 PH) and austenitic (e.g. A-286).\nMartensitic precipitation hardening stainless steels have a predominantly austenitic structure at annealing temperatures of around 1040 to 1065°C. Upon cooling to room temperature, they undergo a transformation that changes the austenite to martensite.\nUnlike martensitic precipitation hardening steels, annealed semi-austenitic precipitation hardening steels are soft enough to be cold worked. Semi-austenitc steels retain their austenitic structure at room temperature but will form martensite at very low temperatures.\nAustenitic precipitation hardening steels retain their austenitic structure after annealing and hardening by ageing. At the annealing temperature of 1095 to 1120°C the precipitation hardening phase is soluble. It remains in solution during rapid cooling. When reheated to 650 to 760°C, precipitation occurs. This increases the hardness and strength of the material. Hardness remains lower than that for martensitic or semi-austenitic precipitation hardening steels. Austenitic alloys remain nonmagnetic.\nYield strengths for precipitation-hardening stainless steels are 515 to 1415 MPa. Tensile strengths range from 860 to 1520 MPa. Elongations are 1 to 25%. Cold working before ageing can be used to facilitate even higher strengths.\nThis is a bar specification, typically available in round and hexagon\nDue to the high strength of precipitation hardening stainless steels, most applications are in aerospace and other high-technology industries.\n~ Valves and other engine components\n~ High strength shafts\n~ Turbine blades\n~ Moulding dies\n~ Nuclear waste casks\nPrecipitation hardening stainless steels have moderate to good corrosion resistance in a range of environments. They have a better combination of strength and corrosion resistance than when compared with the heat treatable 400 series martensitic alloys. Corrosion resistance is similar to that found in grade 304 stainless steel.\nThis grade has good forming characteristics\nThis grade has reasonable machinability\nThe key to the properties of precipitation hardening stainless steels lies in heat treatment.\nAfter solution treatment or annealing of precipitation hardening stainless steels, a single low temperature “age hardening” stage is employed to achieve the required properties. As this treatment is carried out at a low temperature, no distortion occurs and there is only superficial discolouration. During the hardening process a slight decrease in size takes place. This shrinking is approximately 0.05% for condition H900 and 0.10% for H1150.\nTypical mechanical properties achieved for 15-5 PH after solution treating and age hardening are given in the table on the attached page.\nPrecipitation hardening steels can be readily welded using procedures similar to those used for the 300 series of stainless steels."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a02a39e8-58cf-46f7-91f2-58eeba5e05ed>","<urn:uuid:e9451488-d758-4e37-9c03-a85207180598>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between physical space planning in office relocations and commercial area zoning requirements?","answer":"Physical space planning in office relocations focuses on internal optimization, such as assessing desk sharing opportunities, storage needs, desk sizes, and meeting room requirements to maximize efficiency and potentially reduce space needs. In contrast, commercial area zoning requirements focus on external factors and broader city planning, including the separation of commercial areas from residential zones, placement along busier streets and downtown areas, and specific designations like mixed usage permissions. While office space planning aims at internal efficiency and cost savings, zoning requirements ensure appropriate business placement within the city's overall structure and prevent conflicts between different land uses.","context":["By David Laws, national business space expert at commercial property consultancy, Matthews & Goodman\nBecause relocating offices is not most companies’ core activity, the whole process can seem daunting, disruptive and be a huge burden on senior executives’ time, rather than an opportunity.\nHowever, when planned and executed properly, an office move can prove highly beneficial – think what the space you occupy could mean to your brand and corporate persona, and how it could enhance the efficiency of your team’s working practices. Dovetailing the marriage of brand and building can make a profound corporate statement when recruiting talent and customers, as well as retaining them.\nBut the process is often rushed, which leads to poor choices being made and unnecessary hidden costs being incurred and/or spiralling out of control.\nCompanies move for a variety of reasons, not just for growth or contraction. It might be for strategic reasons (to be closer to customers or potential partners), because of a merger/acquisition, a lease expiry or it might simply be a cost-saving exercise.\nIrrespective of the reason, the cost of moving can be broadly split into two categories: physical expenditure and unanticipated costs.\nPhysical spaceBusiness space is the second biggest outgoing for any business. Therefore, a potential move allows the management team to assess how much space is actually needed and ascertain whether a saving can be made. Of course a move can be disruptive – according to E.ON, companies lose on average 7.5 working days as a result of moving. So smart planning and deep knowledge of the ‘process’ is critical.\nStart by considering how much space you really need, instead of what you think you need. One hundred employees does not necessarily equal 100 desks: part-time staff, job-sharers and remote workers means desk-sharing is a smart option. Do you really need acres of storage in a paperless office? What size are your desks? Are laptops a better option than desktops? Are multiple physical meeting rooms necessary, or would break-out spaces be more efficient and allow for territory free working?\nThese ‘occupational planning’ issues are critical when calculating your actual space requirements. Get it right and significant savings could be made.\nUnanticipated costsIn addition to expected costs (such as price per sq ft), there can also be several unknowns, so it’s worth seeking the advice of experts to minimise your moving and ongoing occupational costs.\nIt is easy to assess the aesthetic qualities of a potential office, but you must think beyond the cosmetics. A pre-acquisition survey, for example, is a smart investment, as it will highlight both the true condition of the space, as well as the performance and potential liabilities of ‘un-seens’ - such as mechanical and electrical systems.\nSecondly, ensure the contract is clear and unambiguous. Again, seek counsel from a property expert who understands the implications of issues such as potentially problematical break clauses, rent reviews and dilapidation agreements. Inappropriate wording of these clauses could result in expensive property costs.\nPeople usually consider that moving costs only apply to moving into new premises. The costs of leaving an office should also be factored in. Typically, tenants tend to fall out with their landlords when they receive a service charge invoice, or at the end of a lease when they receive the dilapidations claim. These costs can be significant and are often unexpected, which is why consulting a qualified building surveyor is critical – it can help you navigate the tricky ‘lease breach’ minefield, rectify the issue and reduce the claim.\nAlthough moving can be a major and quite daunting task, it is also an opportunity to secure new premises which mirror your company’s personality and ambitions, improve workplace efficiency and ultimately become a tool for growth.","Commercial areas in a city are areas, districts, or neighbourhoods primarily composed of commercial buildings, such as a downtown, central business district, financial district, \"Main Street\", commercial strip, or shopping centre. Commercial activity within cities includes the buying and selling of goods and services in retail businesses, wholesale buying and selling, financial establishments, and a wide variety of uses that are broadly classified as \"business.\" While commercial activities typically take up a relatively small amount of land, they are extremely important to a community’s economy. They provide employment, facilitate the circulation of money, and often serve many other roles important to the community, such as public gathering and cultural events.\nA commercial area is real estate intended for use by for-profit businesses, such as office complexes, shopping malls, service stations and restaurants. It may be purchased outright by a developer for future projects or leased through a real estate broker. This type of property falls somewhere between residential and industrial property. Practically every incomer must grant permission to build a new office complex or other profit-making business, the city government must determine that the chosen area is indeed commercial area. The zones which separate commercial, industrial, and residential area are clearly markeoned for commercial use, then the city will allow the sale to proceed for the stated use. If any part of the property extends into a residential or industrial zone, however, then the buyer must seek a 'variance', special permission to cross over a zone boundary.\nA commercial area can be held by real estate agents who treat it the same as residential areas. Signs advertising the availability and size of the real estate can be erected, and arrangements can be made to buy or lease smaller lots. Sellers may also agree to make improvements to the land, such as grading off uneven spots or clearing out unwanted trees. A professional developer may purchase huge swatches of this type of property simply to guarantee its availability for later projects.\nCities often use zoning laws to prevent conflicts between residential homeowners and businesses. Land designated as a commercial area is rarely located in the middle of residential zones. City planners encourage businesses to congregate along busier streets and central downtown areas. This helps to keep traffic to these sites manageable. Some areas of the city may be designated for 'mixed usage', which means some commercial areas may be used for residential purposes. A quaint downtown shopping area with apartments would be an example of mixed usage. Commercial areas definition may include industrial usage as well, although zoning laws still regulate the level of industry permitted. Heavier industries often purchase property on the fringes of cities or in unincorporated areas. Some commercial zones in the city do allow for light industrial usage, usually smaller factories with minimal emissions and transportation needs.\nSome examples of commercial area buildings are:\nDifferent kinds of commercial areas\nThe Neighborhood Commercial 1 (CN1) zone is intended for small sites in or near dense residential neighborhoods. The zone encourages the provision of small-scale retail and service uses for nearby residential areas. Some uses which are not retail or service in nature are also allowed so a variety of uses may locate in existing buildings. Uses are restricted in size to promote a local orientation and to limit adverse impacts on nearby residential areas. Development is intended to be pedestrian-oriented and compatible with the scale of surrounding residential areas. Parking areas are restricted, since their appearance is generally out of character with the surrounding residential development and the desired orientation of the uses.\nThe Neighborhood Commercial 2 (CN2) zone is intended for small commercial sites and areas in or near less dense or developing residential neighborhoods. The emphasis of the zone is on uses which will provide services for the nearby residential areas, and on other uses which are small-scale and have little impact. Uses are limited in intensity to promote their local orientation and to limit adverse impacts on nearby residential areas. Development is expected to be predominantly auto accommodating, except where the site is adjacent to a transit street or in a Pedestrian District. The development standards reflect that the site will generally be surrounded by more spread out residential development.\nThe Office Commercial 1 (CO1) zone is used on small sites in or near residential areas or between residential and commercial areas. The zone is intended to be a low intensity office zone that allows for small-scale offices in or adjacent to residential neighborhoods. The allowed uses are intended to serve nearby neighborhoods and/or have few detrimental impacts on the neighborhood. Development is intended to be of a scale and character similar to nearby residential development to promote compatibility with the surrounding area. Development should be oriented to pedestrians along transit streets and in Pedestrian Districts.\nLeasing commercial areas\nLeasing commercial office space is one of the largest expenses incurred by new and expanding businesses, so it is important to do your due diligence. Here are some tips for negotiating a commercial lease for your small business.\nLease term and rent are your first negotiation points. It is generally recommended that small businesses negotiate one- to two-year leases with the option to renew. You will also want to factor in rent increases over the term and renewal options so you are not charged with an unexpected rent increase without warning.\nConsider working with a broker to help you negotiate with the landlord. It is also important to consult a knowledgeable real estate lawyer; they can often recommend the right choice for you and protect your interests as you negotiate your lease through the broker.\n- (WiseGeek, 2012)\n- Planning and Sustainability Innovation.

{"question":"Hey! Can you explain how the operating cycle works for a lawn-and-garden products company? 📋","answer":"The operating cycle for a lawn-and-garden products company starts in fall when customers place orders, nine months before peak selling season. The company begins accumulating product in fall and reduces operations in winter. Product accumulation continues in late February, with most shipments going out in April. While operating expenses flow out during this period, cash doesn't start flowing in until around June when customers pay their bills. The company's strategic selling window is just eight weeks long.","context":["What do pumpkin patches, ski resorts, ice cream shops and accounting firms have in common? They’re all seasonal businesses that experience a surge in revenues during their busy seasons that tapers off in the slow season. Seasonal peaks and troughs present challenges that require creative planning and fiscal prudence.\nUnderstand the Cash Flow Cycle\nEvery business has some degree of ups and downs during the year. But cash flow fluctuations are much more intense for seasonal businesses. So, it’s important to understand a seasonal business’s operating cycle to anticipate and minimize shortfalls.\nTo illustrate, consider a manufacturer and distributor of lawn-and-garden products like topsoil, potting soil and ground cover. Its customers are lawn-and-garden retailers, hardware stores and mass merchants.\nThe company’s operating cycle starts when customers place orders in the fall — nine months ahead of its peak selling season. The company begins amassing product in the fall but curtails operations in the winter. In late February, when the thaw begins for most of the country, product accumulation continues, with most shipments going out in April.\nAt this point, a lot of cash has flowed out of the company to pay operating expenses, such as utilities, salaries, raw materials costs and shipping expenses. But cash doesn’t start flowing into the company’s checking account until customers pay their bills around June. Then, the company counts inventory, pays all remaining expenses and starts preparing for the next year. Its strategic selling window — which will determine whether the business succeeds or fails — lasts a mere eight weeks.\nMaximize the Selling Window\nSeasonal businesses put substantial pressure on their marketing and sales teams. They have a limited amount of time to attract customers and little opportunity to take corrective actions. Successful seasonal businesses use targeted, tailored marketing programs that address these questions:\n- Who’s the company’s typical customer?\n- What’s the best way to reach that customer base?\n- When are customers making their buying decisions?\nIn the example of the lawn-and-garden distributor, customers place orders in the fall. So, an end-of-summer “early bird” discount program, communicated via an email campaign in September and paper inserts with customer invoices in May, might entice customers to place orders early — and choose that company over its competitors.\nSeasonal businesses that market to consumers increasingly turn to social media to generate sales. Customers who follow a business on Facebook or LinkedIn provide a narrow target audience, and social media posts can be cheap and relatively simple to generate. For example, a summer camp sent personalized “Happy Birthday” messages to last year’s campers throughout the year. These posts were viewed by all of the campers’ Facebook friends, many of whom could be potential new campers next summer.\nRamp Up for Busy Season\nIdeally, a seasonal business should stockpile cash received at the end of its operating cycle, and then use those cash reserves to finance the next operating cycle. But cash reserves may not be enough, especially for a high-growth company.\nMany seasonal businesses apply for a line of credit to avert potential shortfalls. However, banks tend to be leery of such enterprises, particularly those with limited history. To increase the chances that a loan application will be approved, business owners should compile a comprehensive loan package, including historic financial statements and tax returns, as well as marketing materials and supplier affidavits (if available).\nMore important, the company’s owner should draft a formal business plan that includes financial projections for the next year. Some companies even project financial results for three to five years into the future. Seasonal business owners can’t rely on gut instinct. They need to develop budgets, systems, processes and procedures ahead of the peak season.\nWithout a line of credit, a business that has severe fluctuations might not have enough working capital to make it through the operating cycle. If there’s insufficient money to pay suppliers, they could stop delivering materials. If the employees aren’t paid, they’re unlikely to report for work. If the weather doesn’t cooperate, revenues might fall short of the business plan. The line of credit is a solid backup plan. If one lender turns down an application for a line of credit, a smart business owner will find out why, remedy any shortcomings and try again.\nPlan for the Off-Season\nSome companies, such as a local ice cream or golf pro shop, may decide to close during the off-season. Others, such as a hotel or accounting firm, are open year-round, offer promotional discounts or cut operating hours to weather the slow times.\nCreative seasonal businesses try to find ways to operate two (or more) seasonal businesses with opposite busy cycles using the same resources. Examples include a midwestern landscaping company that plows snow in the winter, a ski resort that offers hiking and rafting packages in the summer, and costume stores that sell outdoor furniture in the spring.\nAnother off-season survival strategy is hiring part-time seasonal workers. Salaries and employee benefits quickly drain savings. Using part-timers converts a fixed expense (full-time salaries) into a variable expense that ebbs and flows with the operating cycle. But recruiting reliable, skilled part-timers — who are available to work on demand — is often harder than it seems.\nSo it’s a good strategy for an employer to build a pool of part-time workers that it can draw on year after year, such as an ice cream shop or a day camp that hires teachers to work during the summer. Also, part-timers should be treated with the same respect as full-timers. A positive work environment will lower turnover, improve morale and increase the likelihood that people will come back to work for the business again. Employers may want to consider offering financial incentives to employees who refer friends and family members for part-time positions.\nRemember, most of the same labor laws regarding such issues as harassment, discrimination, child labor, minimum wages, and workplace health and safety apply to all workers, both seasonal and full-time. It’s still necessary to withhold taxes just as for regular employees and pay overtime for nonexempt employees.\nSeasonal workers also may affect a company’s headcount under the Affordable Care Act. And, if a seasonal worker exceeds an average of 30 hours per week, large businesses may be required to provide health insurance coverage for them and their children during the months they’re employed. Typically, full-time employment is measured month-to-month. But some large companies avoid providing health insurance benefits for part-timers by electing a measurement period longer than one month or adopting a 90-day waiting period for eligibility.\nMany seasonal businesses struggle during the operating cycle, and some owners can’t resist the urge to spend their windfall, rather than saving it for the next operating cycle. Financial advisors can help manage seasonal fluctuations and the unique challenges they present.\nConsider a Fiscal Year End\nMost businesses operate on a calendar year basis that begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. It’s straightforward, matches the owner’s personal record keeping, and may be required by the IRS under certain circumstances.\nBut seasonal businesses may have good reasons to elect to use a fiscal year. (A fiscal year is 12 consecutive months ending on the last day of any month except December.) For example, reporting income by calendar year could split up the peak season between two years and give a distorted view of income and expenses. This also happens when a seasonal business reports most of its expenses in one calendar year and income in another.\nA company that wants to adopt a fiscal year for a seasonal business will need to consistently maintain its books and records and report income and expenses using the time period adopted. But first and foremost, it’s important to consult a tax advisor to determine if the business is allowed to switch its year end under the tax rules and whether doing so is worth the extra effort.\n© Copyright 2016.

{"question":"How do the processes of creating an electronic signature through a mobile app compare to adding a signature in Microsoft Word in terms of steps and customization options?","answer":"Creating signatures through mobile apps and Microsoft Word involve different processes and options. With mobile apps, users must first choose a device, install a signature app (like Adobe Sign or DocuSign), create an account, and then can sign using their finger or stylus. These apps allow customization of signature color, size, and font, and often include features for tracking document status. In Microsoft Word, users typically follow a more structured process: they can either insert a signature line through the Insert tab, add a scanned handwritten signature as a picture, or create an AutoText signature block combining the signature with typed information like job title and contact details. Word also offers the option to add digital certificates and allows signers to include comments and signing dates. Both methods allow saving signatures for future use, but mobile apps generally offer more real-time tracking and collaborative features.","context":["Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you need to sign a document but don’t have access to a printer, scanner or fax machine?

If you are using a stylus, ensure that it is calibrated and that your signature is not too big or too small.\n3.

Creditors compare this information to the credit information of other consumers. A credit scoring system awards points to predict how creditworthy you are. Or how likely you are to repay loans and make the payments on time. People who are good credit risks have higher credit scores.\nWhat goes into a credit score?\nData from your credit report goes into five major categories that make up a FICO score. The scoring model weighs some factors more heavily, such as payment history and debt owed.\nPayment history: (35 percent) — Your account payment information, including any delinquencies and public records.\nAmounts owed: (30 percent) — How much you owe on your accounts. The amount of available credit you’re using on revolving accounts is heavily weighted.\nLength of credit history: (15 percent) — How long ago you opened accounts and time since account activity.\nTypes of credit used: (10 percent) — The mix of accounts you have, such as revolving and installment.\nNew credit: (10 percent) — Your pursuit of new credit, including credit inquiries and number of recently opened accounts.\n- Superprime 740 and above.\n- Prime 680-739.\n- Non-prime 620-679.\n- Sub prime 550-619.\n- Deep sub prime, below 550\nImprove Your Credit Report\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires credit reporting companies and information providers (person, company, or organization providing information about your credit) are responsible for correcting inaccurate or incomplete information in your report. To take advantage of all your rights under the FCRA, contact the credit reporting company and the information provider if you see inaccurate or incomplete information.\n- Notify the credit reporting company in writing what information is inaccurate. Include copies, not originals of documents. Provide your complete name and address. Your letter should clearly identify each item in your report that you dispute. State the facts and explain what you dispute. Request the information be deleted or corrected. Send your letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, so you can document what the credit reporting company received. Keep copies of your dispute letter and enclosures.\nCredit reporting companies must investigate the items in question usually within 30 days unless they consider your dispute frivolous. They forward your information to the information provider. The information must investigate and report their results to the credit reporting company. If the information provider finds the disputed information is inaccurate they must notify all three nationwide credit reporting companies so they can correct the information in your file.\nWhen the investigation is complete, the credit reporting company must give you the written results and a free copy of your report if the dispute results in a change. (This free report does not count as your annual free report under the FACT Act.) Again, see our Credit Reports page to obtain your free credit report.\nIf an item is changed or deleted, the credit reporting company cannot put the disputed information back in your file unless the information provider verifies that the information is, indeed, accurate and complete. The credit reporting company also must send you written notice that includes the name, address, and phone number of the information provider.\nUpon your request credit reporting company must send notices of any correction to anyone who received your report in the past six months. A corrected copy of your report can be sent to anyone who received a copy during the past two years for employment purposes.\nIf an investigation doesn’t resolve your dispute with the credit reporting company, you can ask that a statement of the dispute be included in your file and in future reports. You also can ask the credit reporting company to provide your statement to anyone who received a copy of your report in the recent past.\nExpect to pay a fee for this service.\n- 2. Tell the creditor or other information provider, in writing, that you dispute an item. Be sure to include copies (NOT originals) of documents that support your position. Many providers specify an address for disputes. If the provider reports the item to a credit reporting company, it must include a notice of your dispute. And if you are correct — that is, if the information is found to be inaccurate — the information provider may not report it again.\nAccurate Negative Information\nWhen negative information in your report is accurate, only the passage of time can assure its removal. A credit reporting company can report most accurate negative information for seven years and bankruptcy information for 10 years. Information about an unpaid judgment against you can be reported for seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out, whichever is longer. There is no time limit on reporting information about criminal convictions; information reported in response to your application for a job that pays more than $75,000 a year; and information reported because you’ve applied for more than $150,000 worth of credit or life insurance. There is a standard method for calculating the seven-year reporting period. Generally, the period runs from the date that the event took place.

Still, there are several ways you can improve the security and success of your online transactions. Here are the top ten tips for safer shopping online:\nTip #1: Trust your instincts. If you're uncomfortable shopping at a particular website, don't. Determine your own level of risk, and be your own best judge.\nTip #2: Shop with merchants you know. If it's a retailer you've heard of, it's probably legitimate.\nTip #3: See what other customers have to say. When available, read what others have to say and check the site's ratings before you buy.\nTip #4: Check for customer complaints. Complaints.com is the perfect place to find out a retailer's reputation with the Better Business Bureau.\nTip #5: Look for a secure site. You'll know you're using a secure stte when the little lock icon appears in the lower part of your browser, or next to the address bar.\nTip #6: Look for real-world contact info. Beware of sites that don't include an email contact address, or list their phone number, fax number, or street address for post-sale support.\nTip #7: Check the return policy. Before you place your order, find out what you have to do if you're dissatisfied with a purchase at this site.\nTip #8: Don't provide more information than necessary. Online retailers really only need your name, address, email address, and maybe your phone number to do business with you - along with your credit card number, or course, for payment purposes.\nTip #9: Safeguard your password. Create a password that can't easily be guessed by increasing length (eight characters are better than six) and include both letters and numbers.\nTip #10: Pay with plastic. When you pay by credit card, you're protected by the Fair Credit Billing Act, which gives you the right to dispute certain charges and limits your liability for unauthorized transactions.\n- Know the PIN for your Check Card - As the prevalence of fraud increases, signature based transactions are somtimes blocked in foreign countries. By knowing your PIN you can be assured of access to your account no matter where you are traveling.\n- If your ATM / VISa Check CArd doesn't work, try again at another time of day. With time differences, you may be trying to access funds during mandatory maintenance times.\n- Make two photocopies of your passports, traveler's checks, and other travel documents. Leave one at home and the other in a safe place at your travel destination.\n- Don't bring items you don't need with you.

The new threat of \"phishing\" tricks unsuspecting people into revealing personal information to commit a crime. The threat scenario plays out by you receiving a deceptively legitimate looking email from what appears to a reputable company (such as your credit card company or a retailer) requesting you to provide personal infromation such as your social security number, account number, etc. and providing you a link to a web site. The link to the web site is really a link to a fraudulant site that has been designed to capture your personal information as you type it in and provide it to the scam artist.\nHere are some important tips on how you can protect yourself from phishing while online:\n- Be suspicious of any email, mobile text, or voicemail message with urgent requests for personal financial information. Reputable companies will not send you these types of communication asking you to \"verify\" of update your personal information.\n- Avoid filling out forms in email messages. You don't know where the data will be sent. You should only communicate information such as credit card numbers or account information via a secured website or telephone.\n- Don't use the links in an email to get to any webpage if you suspect the message might not be authentic. Instead, call the company on the telephone, or log onto the website directly by typing in the web address in your browser.\n- If you go to a link offered in an unsolicited email, check to see if there is an \"s\" after the http in the address (example: https://www.ftc.gov) and a picture of a padlock at the bottom of the screen or next to the address bar that indicates the is secure and encrypts data. Though this is not an indication that the site is legitimate, an online form that asks for personal information should always be encrypted. Scam artists are less likely to have encrypted forms, but if they are trying to elicit personal information, they may take every precaution to make consumers believe their site is secure and therefore, legitimate. Due to this, it is important to still be wary of links in unsolicited, information gathering email.\n- Regularly log into your online accounts to verify transactions and balances.

{"question":"What is the relationship between medieval Death imagery and modern end-of-life psychological preparation, and how do they each approach the human experience of mortality?","answer":"Medieval Death imagery, as seen in the Dance of Death copper plates, depicted death as a universal tyrant interrupting life across all social stations through dramatic visual representations. Modern end-of-life psychological preparation, however, approaches mortality through the lens of anticipatory grief, which allows both the dying and survivors to process loss through specific relationship completion tasks like expressing forgiveness, love, and gratitude. While medieval imagery emphasized death's power and inevitability through artistic depiction, contemporary approaches focus on facilitating emotional healing and peace through structured conversations and psychological preparation. This evolution shows a shift from depicting death as an external force to treating it as a process requiring emotional and psychological work.","context":["Published 1811 by Printed for B.

When loss means death, the term applies to both the survivors and the person who is dying. The lost love object may be a pet or other animal, not necessarily a human being. Loss may refer to non-death-related events as well, such as impending divorce, planned mastectomy, or a company downsizing.\nThe individual’s sense of loss takes place not only in the emotional, psychosocial and cognitive spheres but also in biological, cultural, and spiritual spheres.1\nIn important respects, anticipatory grief is different from the grief experienced by a survivor after the death of a loved one. It is not just the early onset of “normal” grief. Anticipation may draw the survivor closer to the dying person, in an effort to comfort, control the dying process, and even to stave off death itself. Attachment is intensified.\nAnticipation brings to the survivor a strong concentration on the shape of his life after the loved one’s death. He questions the consequences to himself of the loved one’s death. With this sharp self-focus comes somewhat lessened attention to the dying person and a degree of associated guilt for the requisite withdrawal. Guilt is usually a springboard for anger. Wherever directed, anger can then produce further guilt – the so-called vicious circle.\nAdditionally, “the threat of loss arouses anxiety and actual loss gives rise to sorrow…Each situation is likely to arouse anger.”2\nAnticipatory grief gives both the survivors and the dying an opportunity to resolve unfinished business, to speak what needs to be spoken, and to say goodbye. Noted specialist, Dr. Ira Byock, proposed that we think in terms of these five parameters or talking-tasks: I forgive you, please forgive me, thank you, I love you, and goodbye. He called these “the five things of relationship completion.”3\nDeath and dying expert and emergency medicine physician, Dr. Monica Williams-Murphy, suggests that we add one more item to this list of five tasks: “it’s OK to die.”4\nAccordingly, these six tasks would appear on the death-and-dying To-Do list:\n- I forgive you;\n- Please forgive me;\n- Thank you;\n- I love you;\n- It’s OK to die;\nThese tasks could also be seen as a rehearsal of the death. Not easy but well worth the effort. They benefit the survivors in avoiding regrets later on, after the death. They help the dying to reach emotional balance and peace.\nFor the survivors, applying the six tasks bears some resemblance to the concept of prehabilitation. In prehab, targeted physical and psychosocial exercises plus nutrition guidance before surgery often improve post-surgical outcomes – including reduced morbidity and preventing hospital readmissions.5\nNot every listed item might actually occur. Also, the tasks are not expected to be accomplished in the precise order shown here. Moreover, they may be repeated many times, especially for confirmation.\nThe key concept in this configuration is talking about it, having the open conversations about death…and the future. For virtually every one of us, there exists a future…and a past.\nAll told, this work can lead to a greater sense of healing and peace at the end of life. It represents strength and growth. Psychiatrist and authority on death, Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, wrote that death is the final stage of growth.6 The ultimate goal of growth is the search for our own Self. We never stop searching, even to the very end. It is a moral mission of deepest significance and meaning.\nScientific research indicates that we are still unclear about the optimum general value of anticipatory grief in the aftermath of a loved one’s death. Does anticipatory grief help the post-death bereavement? Does it make grief easier to bear? Is grief easier to manage? Does it shorten the acute mourning period? There is practical evidence that anticipatory grief is helpful in the time after the death.\nPreparation seems frequently beneficial. “People who had some advance warning of an impending death did better [than those without advance warning] when assessed at 13 months post-death…”7 Yet, everyone is unique and different, and anticipatory grief is only one variable in a mosaic of the individual survivor’s lifetime of experiences. Empirically, the sum of these experiences form an important factor in determining the usefulness of anticipatory grief.\n∞ ∞ ∞\nThe story of Dr. Morris Schwartz is a good example of anticipatory grief, both for the dying and for the surviving. Morrie was a prominent professor of sociology. He was also an unwilling ALS patient. Mitch was one of his most devoted students. During the last months of Morrie’s life, they met and talked on Tuesdays. Morrie taught his student many profound lessons in dying – and living. Both men were intent on anticipation of loss. Here is one of Morrie’s numerous wise remarks:\nALS is horrible only if you see it that way. It’s horrible to watch my body slowly wilt away to nothing. But it’s also wonderful because of all the time I get to say goodbye. Not everyone is so lucky.8\nOn another occasion, Morrie was interviewed by Ted Koppel, formerly with ABC-TV’s “Nightline:”\nTed, when all this started, I asked myself, “Am I going to withdraw from the world, like most people do, or am I going to live?” I decided I’m going to live – or at least try to live – the way I want, with dignity, with courage, with humor, with composure. There are some mornings when I cry and cry and mourn for myself. Some mornings, I’m so angry and bitter. But it doesn’t last too long. Then I get up and say, “I want to live…” So far, I’ve been able to do it. Will I be able to continue? I don’t know. But I’m betting on myself that I will.”9\nMitch still grows from Morrie’s life lessons:\nThe last class of my old professor’s life took place once a week, in his home, by a window in his study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink flowers. The class met on Tuesdays. [It had only one student. I was the student.] No books were required. The subject was the meaning of life. It was taught from experience. — The teaching goes on.10\nMorrie’s story is filled with dignity, grace and hope. The honest telling of a life story is a continuous process of self-discovery and therefore growth. Someone he loved was listening. Really listening – with eager interest, patience, and love. To listen is exceedingly supportive.11 He could still teach; this was one of his special and treasured abilities. He believed his story would live on. The bonds would survive and grow because death ends a life but not a relationship. Mitch wrote a very long paper for his last class with Morrie. He completed the writing after Morrie died. It demonstrates the power of connection and ongoing attachment. Its title is Tuesdays with Morrie. This book is a sterling gift to all of us.\n∞ ∞ ∞\nAnticipatory grief – an end note from one little boy:\nIn one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing…Only you – you alone – will have stars that can laugh. And when your sorrow is comforted…you will be content that you have known me…You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window for that pleasure…And your friends will be properly astonished to see you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, “Yes, the stars always make me laugh!” And they will think you are crazy.\n~~ Antoine de Saint-Exupery,\nThe Little Prince12\n∞ ∞ ∞\n- National Cancer Institute (NCI), “About Cancer: Advanced Cancer & Caregivers: Planning for the Caregiver: Grief, Bereavement, and Coping with Loss,” https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/bereavement-hp-pdq#section/_164 .\n- John Bowlby, Loss: Sadness and Depression, vol.

{"question":"What's the difference between how mainstream fashion retailers and sustainable brands approach clothing repair and longevity?","answer":"Mainstream fashion retailers typically focus on quick turnover, with shoppers buying more clothing but keeping items half as long as they did decades ago. They prioritize getting trendy products from design to shop floor as quickly as possible. In contrast, sustainable brands emphasize longevity and repair. For example, H&M's Paris flagship store has dedicated an entire floor to clothing repair, complete with sewing machines and eco-friendly cleaning supplies, where customers can repair and restyle both H&M and non-H&M clothing. Similarly, brands like No Nasties and Patagonia focus on quality products that can be repaired rather than replaced. This shift toward repair and longevity is particularly relevant in countries like India, where handmade repair skills are traditionally valued and can help reduce the environmental impact of fashion consumption.","context":["It’s payday. You get off work, head over to your favorite store at the mall or your favorite online retailer, and use your latest check to overindulge in some retail therapy. You spend hours poring over shelves and racks (or web pages), considering styles and looking for the perfect bargain in your size. It’s extremely easy to get caught up in the excitement of the hunt for that perfect outfit. When you find it, the rush you get (especially when it’s a financial steal) is part of the appeal. You’re thinking about when and where you’re going to wear it, rather than the environmental implications of its production, purchase, and disposal.\nIt’s easy to see that the how of clothing production is less well understood and publicized than the marketing of the clothes themselves. Fashion retailers want you to find that consumer high and spend your money, not think about how the clothes are made or what happens to them when they go out of style.\nSome people would classify that as a blissful ignorance, but I think it has more to do with a general lack of mainstream media promotion of sustainable fashion as a real, attainable thing. How are people supposed to know about something they’ve never heard of? On the surface, sustainability and fashion are two completely unrelated things, so it’s not surprising that people don’t see how production and consumption influence one another. But the relationship between these two are very much intertwined. It’s important for the public to start taking note.\nPhoto Courtesy of GreenEarth Cleaning\nThe issue with the fashion industry as a whole, specifically regarding environmental sustainability, is its determination to keep up with quickly changing trends. The average shopper buys much more clothing than did a few decades ago, but keep items half as long. They want trendy, stylish clothing in an accessible location at a reasonable price and they want it NOW. Fast fashion refers to the production of clothing at high speed and low cost to meet increasingly impatient consumer demand. Fast fashion companies are most concerned with lowering costs and getting the product from design to shop floor as quickly as possible. While fast fashion is economically attractive to retailers, the fast-paced production expectations have an enormous environmental impact.\nAccording to the United Nations Economic Commission of Europe, the fashion industry is responsible for producing 20% of global wastewater and 10% of global carbon emissions. That’s more than the emissions of international flights and maritime shipping combined. Creating vibrant and colorful textiles is a critical part of the industry, yet the toxic chemicals associated with textile dyeing are the second largest polluter of clean water globally. Fast fashion has also led to oceans getting bombarded with over a half million tons of plastic microfibers per year due to the washing of plastic-based textiles (polyester, nylon, or acrylic). Textile waste may be an unintended consequence of fast fashion, but that doesn’t mean the industry shouldn’t be held accountable. The problem has now reached a global level. Wardrobes in developed nations are oversaturated. Retailers want to sell as many products as possible and to do that they must stay ahead of the curve, convincing shoppers that their brand is a “must-have” and the items already in their closet are no longer fashionable.\nSustainability and Fashion\nWhile eco-friendly fashion is a trend on the rise, no environmental organization had decided on a concrete definition for what sustainable fashion truly means and stands for. The Ellen Macarthur Foundation recently published a report titled, A New Textiles Economy: Redesigning Fashion’s Future, which establishes sustainability goals for the fashion industry. This report includes four recommendations:\nPhase out substances of concern and microfibre release\nA. Align industry efforts and coordinate innovation to create safe material cycles.\nB. Drastically reduce plastic microfibre release\nTransform the way clothes are designed, sold, and used to break free from their increasingly disposable nature\nA. Scale-up short-term clothing rental\nB. Make durability more attractive\nC. Increase clothing utilization further through brand commitments and policy\nRadically improve recycling by transforming clothing design, collection, and reprocessing\nA. Align clothing design and recycling processes\nB. Pursue technological innovation to improve the economics and quality of recycling.\nC. Stimulate demand for recycled materials.\nD. Implement clothing collection at scale.\nMake effective use of resources and move to renewable inputs\nThe report was written in consultation with many major fashion design companies. Its underlying message is that fashion that should be produced and sold in the most eco-friendly way possible during all stages of production, including design, raw material production, manufacturing, transport, storage, marketing, and final sale. Sustainable fashion can be achieved by ensuring efficient and careful use of natural resources, selecting renewable energy sources (wind, solar, etc.) at every stage, and maximizing repair, remake reuse, and recycling of the product and its components. It even uses sustainability storytelling by highlighting how environmentally conscious fashion can significantly lower costs to businesses and create positive long-term customer relationships.\nIdeally, the rules of A New Textiles Economy would be incorporated into every fashion and lifestyle brand’s business model and production processes. Some companies have done so, but there is more work to be done. These standards help raise awareness of sustainability practices, as well as show manufacturers that considering the environment doesn’t have to be expensive or overly complicated.\nPhoto Courtesy of Fashionista\nSo with A New Textile Economy’s standards in mind, here are some examples of companies that are incorporating sustainability into their brands.\n- Organic by John Patrick created the world’s first organic oxford cotton shirt and uses other eco-friendly materials such as vegetable-tanned leather, organic wool, and recycled cotton.\n- People Tree, partners with Fair Trade artisans and farmers to produce a wide collection of ethical and eco-wear for over 20 years.\n- Patagonia’s mission statement incorporates sustainability by making quality products that can be repaired, supporting grassroots activists by paying an Earth Tax, and supporting regenerative practices in ranching and agriculture.\n- Adidas partners with Parley Plastics to incorporate plastics recovered from the ocean in their shoes, clothing, and plastic hangers. On some of their product lines, they’ve also debuted ZeroDye, which features undyed polyester. Finally, they’re partnering with Fashion for Good to green the apparel supply chain. Read more about Adidas’ sustainability initiatives here.\n- Nike incorporates recycled polyester into 75% of their shoes and apparel. The dye process used for soles in the Nike Air line allows 99% of recoverable dye water to be recycled. All Air sole innovations designed since 2008 are composed of at least 50% recycled manufacturing waste. Nike also transforms used product into Nike Grind, which is created from recycled athletic footwear and surplus manufacturing scraps to make performance products, ranging from new footwear and apparel to sports surfaces. Read more about Nike’s sustainability efforts here.\n- H&M’s new Paris flagship store includes an entire floor dedicated to clothing repair. It includes a fleet of sewing machines, bottles of natural detergents, and eco-friendly stain removing sprays, along with bins of patches and embroideries. The idea is to invite customers to bring in clothing, both H&M and other brands, to be repaired and made new again. Customers can restyle their old clothing to update and upcycle their looks. The floor also includes a recycling station where customers can recycled their old clothes (not just H&M) in exchange for a store discount.\nPhoto Courtesy of Patagonia\nFor more info on sustainable brands visit http://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/fair-trade-clothing and https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/a22237305/sustainable-closet-guide/.\nThe Bottom Line\nTurning the fashion industry into something noticeably more sustainable won’t happen overnight. Some brands will continue to pursue short-term economic gains over longer-term environmental costs. That’s why it’s so important for consumers to understand the impact of their choices on the industry. Fast fashion is preventable. If we take a second to slow down and pay attention to how much our desire for the latest styles at the lowest prices encourages companies to cut environmental corners, real progress can happen. The more we become informed about these issues and use that information to change our daily routines, the more the fashion industry will be pressured to think more sustainably. Next time it’s payday and you go on your shopping binge, shop with a conscience. Or don’t shop at all.","CLIMATE CHANGE ISN’T WAITING FOR YOUR SIESTA: Making better bets on Indian wardrobes\nLOOK WHAT WE’VE DONE\nThere is a final verdict on climate change that is cast in iron. It’s called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its Special Report. The report is special in more way than one—for starters, it is absolutely terrifying. It asserts that unless net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are brought down to zero by 2050, warming above 1.5°C is practically inevitable.\nTo get a quick picture, imagine an ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, mass desertification, and coastal cities being flooded into inhabitability. Mind you, this minor change in temperature is our worst best-case scenario. It means that 1.5 degrees is the difference between a world we can adapt to or a life-threatening planet. And it is a huge ask of humanity in such a short window of time.\nCHANGE BEGINS AT HOME\nIndia, the seventh largest country in the world by area and the second most populous in the world, emits 6% of all the world’s CO2 emissions and houses the top seven worst cities in terms of particulate matter pollution (according to World Health Organization).\nIn India, we already know that. It's an agenda that's often blasted by news channels as a means for propaganda during election seasons. But the real action is far from taking place.\nAccording to a report by the Indian Institute of Sciences in Bengaluru, the average per capita CO2 emissions from Delhi, Greater Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Greater Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, and Hyderabad is almost double that of the entire country’s national average CO2 emissions. India's rapid economic growth, has created a larger consumer base with a growing demand for materials. It has one of the highest densities of economic activity in the world, and a very large population heavily dependent on natural resources for its livelihood. By 2020, pressure on India’s water, air, soil, and forests is expected to become the highest in the world. India, hence, is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change.\nCLEANING OUT YOUR CLOSET\nEven though the fashion industry is moving towards environmental responsibility, the ecological impact and carbon footprint of the sector remains a cause of concern. Cumulatively, the fashion industry produces about 20% of global waste water. Furthermore, 85% of textiles end up in landfills or are incinerated when most of these materials could be reused. Also, about 10% of global carbon emissions are contributed by the fashion industry. In addition, the textile industry has been identified in recent years as a major contributor to plastic entering the ocean.\nAll the pollution already in the atmosphere will keep trapping heat for years, no matter what we do. But on their own, current greenhouse gas levels are unlikely to raise temperatures another half degree or more. Which is to say, how much global warming continues from now is basically in our hands. Starting now.\nWhat is the world you want to fight for? And more importantly, how can you get there?\n1. Ask your brands #WhoMadeMyClothes.\nTraceability is defined as supply chain visibility that enables the tracking of the social and environmental impact of production. And it is a prerequisite for identifying and improving the environmental, social, ethical, and financial impact of fashion production.\nSince the early 2000s, fast fashion retailers such as ASOS, H&M, and Inditex have profited off of their ability to generate, at a vast scale, rapid translations of runway fashions into low-priced clothing and accessories. Asking brands this question creates an external pressure for them to be transparent and sets new standards for a cleaner supply chain. Incorporated as one of Fashion Revolution’s primary agendas, #WhoMadeMyClothes made over 2M impressions globally last year and led to multiple brands coming out with their supply chain details to share with their shoppers!\n2. Switch to better brands.\nBrands who are conscious about their production and social economic factors are aplenty now. According to analytics from the UN Comtrade, India is the top importer of used clothes—clothes that would have otherwise ended up in landfill—that are broken down into yarn and then re-woven into fabric used to make blankets. There are several homegrown brands that have utilized concepts of the circular economy to utilize raw materials, or they have just switched to better raw materials altogether and designed out wastage.\nNo Nasties is a 100% organic, 100% fair trade, 100% vegan clothing brand based in Goa, India. They work with a cotton farmers' co-op and a sustainable factory for sourcing all of their products. It's the real deal. Global brands like Adidas are already working on closing the loop on wastage. In 2016, they launched three new versions of its UltraBoost shoe made out of plastic found in the ocean. They teamed up with an environmental initiative, Parley for the Oceans, to create the shoe and within a year sold over one million pairs. Closer home, brands like Doodlage and Chindi recycle textile waste into garments and accessories. ‘I was a Sari’, the winner of Circular Design Challenge conducted by IMG Reliance earlier this year (the challenge tested the shortlisted designers on circular fashion—a concept that aims to reduce landfill waste and increase the longevity of clothes), places pre-loved Indian saris at the heart of a new style, and empowers female artisans from Mumbai to become the designers of their own future. Korra, a denim brand based in Delhi, chooses natural or recycled raw materials with an emphasis on sourcing each element locally. They also ensure that the design, materials, processes and equipment make their products purposeful and durable. There is an assurance of quality end-to-end as each piece is made by a single individual who remains accountable for the full product.\n3. Repair, repair, repair.\nThink of your family heirloom or a hand-me-down and the time it got damaged or looked worn out. What did you do? You looked for ways to keep it longer since it meant something to you. We’ve obviously lost the emotional connection with our clothing over the years. The availability of fast fashion and the coming of e-commerce means that we can get a new outfit delivered straight to our homes ahead of an event. Oftentimes buying a new piece of clothing is more accessible than repairing. But the beauty of repairing is that it can be learnt and can be done at home. In a country like India that prides itself in handmade skills, it is often easy to repair at home. Many corporations such as Dell are working closely with designers to create circular systems (opposite of a take, make, dispose system) for waste such as electronic gadgets that are no longer in use.\n4. Find ethical ways to acquire a new wardrobe.\nThe resale industry is going to be valued at 59 billion dollars by 2020 and the apparel industry is going to make up 49% of that whopping number.\nThe ways to acquire a new wardrobe have certainly become more innovative, while simultaneously being good for the environment. Swapping exchanges are now popping up everywhere in the country. In fact, now you can do it over an app. This for That helps you raid other fashion forward closets, by simply allowing you to give up on some of your pieces for swapping online. While they are primarily online, they’ve conducted several successful on-ground swap meets across major cities in India.\nOrganizations such as Seams for Dreams aims to provide appropriate clothing to the less privileged members of society in India by collecting second-hand clothing and raising funds and awareness through various fashion events. The Global Fashion Exchange has a fairly active events calendar across metropolitan cities and is looking to expand within India at a rapid rate.\nSo, what are you going to do? Let's work together to shift these negative impacts one day at a time.\nRini is a culture vulture and marketing communications expert who moonlights as a storyteller.

{"question":"What is the key difference between a category A and category B inspection organization according to ISO 17020?","answer":"According to ISO 17020, a category A inspection organization is an independent third-party inspection agency that must remain impartial and can only provide inspection services. In contrast, a category B inspection organization is an inspection department within a large-scale company that provides inspection services to its own company while being involved in design, procurement, construction, and installation activities.","context":["Industrial Third Party Inspection refers to independent inspection services that are provided by inspection agencies. This article supplies you with information about TPI definition, TPI companies and also supplies you with third party independent inspection procedures for different fix, rotary, electrical and instrumental equipment.\nIn purchasing and procurement projects the sellers and vendors are first parties. The second parties are purchasers or buyers.\nFirst party inspection refers to quality control activities that are done by equipment vendors or sellers.\nSecond party inspection refers to inspection activities that are done by equipment buyers or purchasers.\nIn fact first party is seller and second party is buyer. So when you say second party inspection, it means that an inspection and quality control activities that are done by a buyer and when you say first party inspection, it means that an inspection and quality check that are done by a vendor in its construction shop.\nThese quality controls and inspections are done based on Proforma Invoice, Purchase Order and International standards.\nThe Third Party Inspection refers to independent inspection activities that are done by a Third Party Inspection Agency either hired by a buyer or seller.\nThe ISO 1720; - Requirements for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection- specifies characteristic of these kinds of inspection agencies.\nBased on these requirements, these agencies must be impartial and independent in their inspection activities and in their inspection reports and results.\nAll interested companies such as traders, buyers, sellers, engineering companies, construction companies must have access to the services of these inspection agencies.\nThe impartial and independence conditions are very important factors for third party Inspection agencies. In this direction ISO 17020 does not allow these companies to be participated or involved in any procurement, purchasing, construction, installation and even design activities.\nThey must only provide third party inspection services and not anything else.\nBased definition of the ISO 17020, these inspection companies are category A inspection organization. Based on this standard there are two more inspection organizations that are not independent.\nA category B inspection organization is an inspection department in a large-scale company that is involved in the design, procurement, construction, installation, etc. and this inspection department provides inspection services to its own company.\nNormally a category B inspection organization is a quality control department in an engineering or EPC company. This department assists company in procurement and purchasing projects and makes inspections on the equipment and materials that are purchased by own company.\nSuggest an EPC company has a contract with an oil company for design, procurement, and construction of a desalting plant. Then the quality control department of this EPC Company makes inspection on the equipment and material that have been ordered by EPC contractor for this desalting plant. So this is what we name second party inspection and based the ISO 17020 is category B type inspection.\nThis inspection will not be enough by end-user or in this example oil company. The oil company will hire an independent inspection agency or in other word a category A inspection company to conduct inspection on the procured equipment and material by EPC company.\nSometimes the end-user or “oil company in this example” ignores to hire an independent inspection company by itself but mandates that the EPC Company to hire an independent inspection agency that is in their approved list.\nDifferent projects have different procedures for handling inspection activities in their procurement projects. Sometimes the procured equipment is inspected by both parties i.e. by EPC contractor quality control as well as by end-user third party inspection agency. In other word equipment are inspected by category A and category B inspection organizations.\nBased on ISO 17020 definition, there is also category C inspection organizations. These inspection organizations are not too much. It refer to an inspection department of engineering company that provide services to its own procurement and purchasing projects as well as to other engineering companies. Similar to the category B inspection organizations these companies also cannot be independent.\nThere are lots of scopes of work for Category A inspection agencies or in other word in third party inspection companies. One of them is Third Party Quality Inspection that refers to quality part of work. In this part an inspection agency checks and makes sure that the quality of the commodity is as the same of purchase order specification.\nThe scope of work is determined by buyers and purchasers. Some of them require only a pre-shipment inspection and some other may mandate more stringent scope and ask their third party inspection agency to witness important tests and inspections such as material certificate review, material identification, welding inspection, NDE test review, dimensional control, hydro-static testing, mechanical running testing, performance testing, painting inspection, packing and marking inspection and loading inspection.\nThe scope of work for inspection and testing is defined through inspection and test plan (ITP). This is very important document in purchasing and procurement projects. This document identifies duty and task of each parties regarding inspection during manufacturing and construction process.\nIn giant project it is necessary that an inspection company or a category A inspection organization to expedite inspection activities. It is duty of inspection agency to check that to see if all inspections and tests are done with satisfactory results before issuing of inspection release notes. But in no case an inspection agency must expedite procurement work such as reporting to client about percentage of manufacturing progress or etc. These are not task of inspection agency; this must be done by EPC contractor expeditor engineer or technician.\nThis checking must be done based approved inspection and test plan. The inspection agency can use the ITP as check list to see if all inspection completed and their inspection visit reports are available.\nIt is best practice that an inspection releases note to be referred to the purchase order number as well as to the inspection and test plan document number. The quantity also must be stated in release note if the commodity is going to be shipped partially.\nIt is responsibility of the category A inspection organization or inspection agency to issue an inspection visit report after each visit in manufacturer shop. The inspection date must be notified to inspection agency normally 7 working days in advance. It is responsibility of the vendor to notify the inspector agency. The quality control team of a manufacturer must check inspection and test plan frequently and when they see they have reached to specific stage of construction that need an inspection, then must notify inspector for its visit.\nThe communication channel between inspection agency, vendor and client must be set-up. This normally is done in Pre-Inspection meeting or Pre-Production meeting. In this meeting that is conducted before commencement of project, all parties will be attended in the meeting and discuss about project coordination and communication.\nAll parties are responsible to act and communicate based what is agreed and confirmed in the meeting and Minute of Meeting (MOM) will be based for coming actions.\nRaw material inspection must be done based purchase order specification. The third party material stamp inspection is another important task of inspection agencies. They check material conformity based on BSEN 10204 requirements for 3.1 and 3.2 certifications.\nA 3.1 material certificate refers to the certificate that is issued by a material manufacturer but a 3.2 certificate is material certificate that is issued by material manufacturer but confirmed and approved by independent inspection agency. It is necessary that inspection agency to witness important test during of manufacturing process for confirming such certificates.\nThird Party Inspection Instruction for Fix Equipment:\nThird Party Inspection Instruction for Rotary Equipment:\nReciprocating Compressor, Centrifugal Pump, Gas Turbine, Steam Turbine, Fan and Blower, Centrifugal Compressor, Screw Compressor Testing, Centrifugal Pump Performance Test, Centrifugal Compressor Testing, Reciprocating Compressor Testing, Fan Mechanical Running test, Fan Performance Test\nTPI Inspection Instruction for Electrical Equipment:\nDid you find this article useful?

{"question":"How can I avoid legal trouble when writing about real people in my book?","answer":"To avoid legal issues when writing about real people, you should: 1) List all people involved and determine if they're living/dead and public/private figures, 2) Document objectionable facts and scenes that might need closer legal inspection, 3) Verify facts and keep records of research, including interviews and sources, 4) Distance characters from real people by changing multiple identifying details or creating composite characters, 5) Use common sense and avoid using writing as revenge, 6) Include appropriate disclaimers, and 7) Consult a lawyer to review the manuscript and draft necessary agreements. Remember that even with these precautions, you may need to secure life story rights or permissions from individuals involved.","context":["PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 2017\nby Matt Knight, Author, THE GENE POOL —\nTruth is stranger than fiction. It is an old adage that, for writers, equals entertainment. Maybe the story is uplifting or heroic, sad or horrific. Maybe the story is a retelling of noteworthy events, a glimpse into the private lives of public figures, or a compelling dramatization of a private citizen’s life. Whatever the subject matter, choosing to write about facts and events involving others brings with it significant legal risks that must be analyzed for legal clearance and the necessary permissions and acquisitions of life story rights (regardless of whether the literary work is a biography, memoir, screenplay, or fictionalized true story from the writer’s own life or someone else’s). If not, the writer and publisher might find themselves the recipients of a cease-and-desist letter, or worse, the defendants in a lawsuit.\nWhat Are Life Story Rights?\nLife story rights are a collection of legal rights held by an individual regarding a story about someone’s life. The purpose for securing these rights or the permission to use the facts of someone’s life is to protect the writer and publisher from being sued for defamation, invasion of privacy, or the misappropriation of the right to publicity. Life story rights agreements, depending on the breadth of the contract language, allows the writer to use and potentially change or dramatize the life story for entertainment purposes (whether in print or on screen).\nThe Legal Principles of Life Story Rights\nWe usually hear the legal term “defamation” when a gossip rag damages a celebrity’s reputation by printing false rumors of a derogatory nature like a sexual escapade, or an ex-paramour’s heroine addiction. But defamation in literary work happens too, usually in memoirs and nonfiction. Thankfully, for writers and publishers, the success rate for defamation suits tends to be low. Even so, no one wants to spend time and resources in court.\nDefamation covers two torts: libel and slander. Libel is the publication of a false statement that injures a person’s reputation (as opposed to slander, which covers the verbal form of defamation). A libelous statement must be false and factual. The defamed person must be living and need not be identified by name. The real person need only be identifiable to readers via the information provided. Business entities and small identifiable groups (like a lacrosse team) can be defamed too.\nIf you find yourself subject to a claim of defamation, your best defenses would be truth, opinion, or parody/satire.\n- Truth is a complete defense to a defamation claim. No false statement equals no libelous statement. Even if minor inconsequential facts are incorrect, libel does not exist if the overall statement is true.\n- Opinions are protected (because opinions are neither true nor false). This defense, however, can be tricky to navigate. Just because you say it is your opinion will not keep the statement from being defamatory. Merely implying a false statement can be enough. “In my opinion, she is an alcoholic” is just as defamatory as “she is an alcoholic.” These issues often arise with memoirs and biographical works. The best way to utilize this defense is for the writer to provide in their work the underlying facts on which the opinion is based, like, “She was convicted of a DUI, and then went to rehab.”\n- Parody and satire genres exaggerate material for comic effect, which is not considered to be true or a statement of fact.\nThese are defenses, which means you use them after you have been sued. Instead of relying on a defense, do your best to avoid a libel claim before you publish.\n2. The Right of Privacy\nPeople have the right to be left alone. Privacy is invaded when private facts not in the public’s interest are publicly disclosed. While the truth can deflect a defamation claim, often the truth when disclosed can be the basis for an invasion of privacy claim.\nUsually, invasion of privacy occurs when:\n- Private facts that are not of public interest are disclosed;\n- There has been intrusion into a person’s private life; and\n- Someone is portrayed or misrepresented in a false light, i.e. highly offensive to a reasonable person.\nThe injured person must be living (unless you want to dig up the casket, which is an invasion of another kind). The disclosure of private facts must cause harm to the person’s reputation (personal or professional). Mere embarrassment usually is not enough. The injured person must have a reasonable expectation the disclosed fact was to remain private. So, if facts occurred in a public setting, then most likely there is no expectation of privacy.\nOften the most crucial point in a right to privacy claim is whether the disclosure was of public interest. Fortunately, writers have had luck in persuading courts that the disclosure of private facts is of public interest when it illuminates the human condition. Likewise, a memoirist is given leniency for disclosure of facts in their own story, even though it might be private facts inextricably intertwined with a third party. But a third party telling someone else’s story about a child born from an incestuous relationship that was never made public and the crime never reported has been held to violate the right of privacy. The facts were newsworthy, yet revealing the identity of the victim was not a matter of public interest.\n3. The Right of Publicity\nMisappropriation of the right of publicity is using someone’s name, likeness, or identifying characteristics for advertising, merchandising, endorsements, promotional, or commercial purposes without permission. The law normally applies to the living, although some states will extend the right of publicity posthumously. And it only applies to a person who makes money from who they are (i.e. famous people).\nIf you do not have permission, do not use someone’s name or likeness for commercial purposes. Just because you spilled a cocktail on Liza Minnelli once at a party, you would not put her picture on the cover of your memoir to boost sales. But, if you have written a biography, screenplay, or news article about a famous person, permission is not required because the right of publicity yields to the First Amendment.\nLikewise, you would not add Lee Child’s endorsement on your book if he has not given one. Nor would you claim an unauthorized biography of Madonna was authorized. Use common sense—no taking advantage of their reputation for commercial purposes without permission.\nAnd, of course, a real person, famous or not, can make cameo appearances if you stick to the facts that are in the public domain.\nWhen to Secure Life Story Rights\nDepending on whose story is the subject of the literary work, a writer may need to own or seek permission to use those life story rights or the story rights of any ancillary individuals involved, even if they only figure marginally in the story.\nHere are a few questions to consider when making that determination.\nIs the life story yours or someone else’s?\nIf it is your story, the First Amendment allows you great latitude in telling it. But be cognizant of not invading the privacy of others involved in your life story. You may need permission to use facts involving third parties like lovers, siblings, or friends if the private facts would be highly offensive. If you are writing about someone else’s life story and the person is not a public figure, you may need to secure a life story agreement unless the story can be told using facts from the public domain, like news articles and court transcripts.\nIs the subject of the life story dead?\nIf so, you are in luck. As noted above, the right to sue for defamation or invasion of privacy stops at the grave (feel free to spread as many lies or reveal as many secrets as you like). While the dead cannot suffer reputational harm, however, the right of publicity may extend to one’s heirs depending on the state. Be careful not to defame someone related to the dead; the wife of the dead man you claimed was head of a family-run meth lab may bring her own defamation suit.\nIs the subject well-known?\nPublic figures and celebrities usually have trouble proving invasion of privacy because their lives are of public interest and there is less expectation of privacy. That is life in the spotlight. For example, Elizabeth Taylor failed to stop an unauthorized television biography of her life because the court held the biography was of interest to the public.\nIs the event newsworthy?\nAgain, public interest tends to yield to the First Amendment, meaning courts typically give latitude to stories that are newsworthy. However, a person still might sue if they can prove they have been defamed. If the event or facts are not newsworthy, consider fictionalizing the true story.\nHow to Avoid Being Sued for Violating Someone’s Story Rights\n- List the people who are living or dead, who are famous, public, or private individuals. Are your characterizations of these people, or the story events involving these people, negative or favorable? If favorable, your chances of being sued are fewer. Remember, your idea of what is considered favorable may differ from what others consider to be favorable. If negative, then these will need closer legal inspection.\n- List the facts and scenes that might be objectionable. Are the facts or events you are writing about private, public, or newsworthy? Again, what you believe to be public or newsworthy may be different from what others believe to be public or newsworthy. Private facts demand closer scrutiny.\n- List the facts that need verification, the people who need interviewed, and the people who must sign permissions and releases.\n- Keep records of your research. Record interviews. If you are writing a memoir or a biography, document your fact-finding and keep copies for proof that you have not made negligently false statements. Tape recordings are the best when interviewing. Next to that, contemporaneous notes are helpful (all of which should be dated and signed, and the place and source identified).\n- If you think readers will recognize the real person in your literary work who might have a legal claim, reduce your risk by layering in as many fictional details as possible to distance the character from the real person. Change the person’s sex, ethnicity, name, residence, age, physical traits, odd quirks, personal background, familial connections, profession, friends, time, setting, etc. Or create a composite character molded from a variety of people or events. The problem arises when the writer does not disguise enough so the connection between character and real person is easily linked, or they wrongly assume the real person will not consider their statements defamatory or disclosures an invasion of privacy. Just be aware that changes will not always shield a writer from liability.\n- Use common sense. As tempting as it might be, do not use your novel as revenge. That is asking for legal trouble.\n- Use a disclaimer or a nicely written acknowledgement. But remember, disclaimers are not full proof. In 2007, Augustine Burroughs settled a defamation suit filed by a family depicted in his memoir Running with Scissors. He agreed to call his literary work a book instead of a memoir, and acknowledge that certain real families portrayed in his book might have memories of the events that differ from his. While disclaimers that acknowledge certain names and places have been changed can help, it may not prevent readers from identifying the real person who is the subject of the defamatory statement, and often will not shield a writer from liability.\n- Retractions can be useful under the right circumstances, but do not rely on these. Some states have retraction statutes, but these generally apply to newspapers, radio stations, and magazines. There are a few cases that involve online defamatory statements and the use of retractions to minimize damages. Retraction statutes do not generally apply to book publishers and could, if used, be considered an admission that the statement was false and defamatory.\n- Consult a lawyer to vet the manuscript and provide advice on how to minimize risk. If you are traditionally publishing, use your publisher’s legal department; if self-publishing, hire your own publishing lawyer. A lawyer will explain what is acceptable and what is not, and will draft an agreement with the appropriate provisions to secure ownership of life story rights.\nUnderstand that negotiating these agreements involves competing interests between you and the subject of the story. The biggest item you are hoping to secure is a release from being sued for defamation, invasion of privacy, or misappropriation of the right of publicity. Depending on your project, you may want the subject’s or a third party’s cooperation. You may want access to personal materials, like photos or journals. Some projects demand the need for exclusive rights to the material so others cannot produce or create competing literary works. Other projects require more flexibility in how the real person is portrayed and the story embellished and dramatized.\nRunning with Scissors, by Augusten Burroughs\nIf your literary project is based on real-life events or someone’s life story, a little upfront organization and legal scouring will save you hassles in the long run. The last thing you want is for your creative work to meet an untimely death from not securing the proper permissions and life story rights prior to publication or release.\nLegal Disclaimer: This information is provided for educational purposes only.

{"question":"What are the decorative features of antique mantel clocks, and where were they traditionally placed?","answer":"Antique mantel clocks were ornately decorated pieces, adorned with figurines, sculptures, and pearls. They were typically heavy, encased in thick wood, and sometimes finished with moldings. From the mid-1800s onwards, these clocks commonly featured matching decorative elements on both sides, such as lions, flowers, or columns. As their name suggests, they were traditionally placed on fireplace mantelpieces, though they could also be placed on shelves. These clocks were originally made with gilt metal, wood, and porcelain, serving as both practical timepieces and breathtaking ornamental pieces.","context":["Antique mantel clocks have been around for over two centuries, and for good reasons. They not only tell time. Also known as shelf clocks, they are breathtaking ornamental pieces that have graced all styles and sizes of homes since the 17th century. Moreover, they are prevailing pieces of the past that are unlike anything else.\nFor collectors and enthusiasts alike, owning an antique mantel clock is like owning a slice of history. If you’re starting to appreciate the beauty of such timeless décor, then you’ve come to the right place.\nToday, we’re going to tell you more about the history of antique mantel clocks, what their defining features are and how to care for them. After all, they are a unique investment worth passing from one generation to the next.\nHistory of Antique Mantel Clocks\nThe earliest clocks were built by the Egyptians thousands of years ago. However, mantel clocks surfaced during the mid-17th century in France, as descendants of the French Regency bracket clocks. They were initially invented with practicality and beauty in mind — an incredibly ornate piece that must sit somewhere visible and small enough to be placed by the fireplace, shelf or mantel. Here, most mantel clocks were made with gilt metal, wood and porcelain.\nIt was ten years after that the English clockmakers picked up on mantel clocks. Compared to the French shelf clocks, the English concentrated more on the intricate mechanism and quality of movement. It comes as no surprise that the common folk couldn’t afford such clocks considering the level of craftsmanship that goes with each piece. It wasn’t until the turn of the 19th century that these antique mantel clocks would become affordable and be seen in more homes.\nIn the forerunners of American mantel clock-making were Connecticut clockmaker Eli Terry, along with Silas Hoadley and Seth Thomas. It didn’t take long until these beautiful ornaments went into mass production, only to become rarity once again in the modern times.\nFamous Mantel Clock Manufacturers\nBelow are the some of the popular mantel clock manufacturers:\n- Seth Thomas\n- Simon Willard\n- Eli Terry\nDistinguishing Antique Mantel Clocks\nAntique and vintage clocks are different. Antique mantel clocks are at least 100 years old. Anything younger than that is considered vintage. Moreover, antique mantel clocks shouldn’t be confused with “second hand” or “used”. Buyers and collectors must also be vigilant with replicas made from originals, which are prevalent today.\nAs for the defining features of an antique mantel clock, it is capable of telling time and sounding off without the influence of outside forces. They are completely mechanical and are wound regularly. Furthermore, the integrity of its mainspring distinguishes it from the rest, as well as the access of the movement found in the back panel.\nThese antique mantel clocks were adorned with figurines, sculptures and pearls. They were heavy, encased in thick wood and at times finished with moldings and sealed with a gold plate at the back that identify the maker’s mark. Furthermore, the components of these clocks are as antique as the rest of itself. This means the rarity of its parts and the need for professional maintenance account for the clock’s authenticity.\nSome of the most common types of mantel antique clocks are carriage, atmos, steeple, tambour, torsion, skeleton and decorative clocks.\nCaring for Antique Mantel Clocks\nAntique mantel clocks are fragile and require a whole new level of care and maintenance. They withstand the years but that doesn’t mean they are invincible. That’s why owning one is not just earning bragging rights. It’s a responsibility to ensure the clock’s longer life span.\nHere are important things you need to keep in mind when caring for mantel antique clocks.\n- Inspect the parts\nFirst, inspect all the parts upon receiving your clock. Open the back panel and examine the gears and inner pivots. Also check if the movement and mechanism are all working properly. Next, check the mainspring and suspension spring. See if they are working and if not, replace them with the right components. Do this right and you’ll see that the movement is restored once you replace the spring. Keep in mind that it should be aligned into the correct grooves within the clock.\nIf you have experience cleaning the clock, go ahead and give it an overhaul with the proper cleaning solution and re-lubricate with clock oil. Ideally, antique mantel clocks need to be oiled every 3 years. Otherwise, bring it to a professional so s/he can do the work for you.\n- Prevent careless and unexpected movements\nCarriage clocks have handles. However, we strongly suggest not to hold on to the handles if you need to carry or transport it. Considering how delicate your clock is now, you must hold it under the base. Otherwise, such careless and unnecessary movement can ultimately damage the inner makings of the clock.\nMake sure the pendulum is secured with the clip provided or the spring clamp most English antique mantel clocks come with. Otherwise, carefully unhook the pendulum and wedge it in scrunched paper.\n- Protect it from direct heat\nWhen exposed directly to a working fireplace or under the sunlight, the clock’s components are bound to warp. Plus, the heat will damage the exterior. When this happens, you’ve ultimately compromised the quality and functionality of the piece.\nEnsure that they are displayed and stored somewhere safe and secure. Occasionally check to see if everything is working fine, ensuring external elements won’t damage it.\n- Level your clock\nExperts will tell you to put your mantel clock on a level surface. Sure, this does the trick. However, not all antique mantel clocks withstand the test of time and other external factors quite easily. Their cases warp, which means some adjustments may be made.\nYou can do so by relying on the pendulum. Place your clock on the surface and listen to the tic-toc sound. Tilt your clock slightly to the left or right side. Does it sound more balanced? Once there’s a more balanced ticking, shim the bottom of the clock at that angle and let it stay there.\n- Always with gentleness\nAntique mantel clocks have hundreds of years weighing down their backs. They’ve experienced a lot to get to this point, now in your hands and ready to be cared for. The best you can do is to always be gentle with it. Whether you’re positioning, transporting or showing it off, think of it as a newborn baby.\nThese clocks are priced incredibly high. The last thing you want is spoiling it with carelessness. Do what you can to ensure its longevity and you’ll be passing on an unmatched family heirloom soon enough.","The word mantel clock came into being because the clocks sat on fireplace mantelpieces. It is common to see mantel clocks with matching decorations, such as lions, flowers or columns, on both of its sides. Those mantel clocks were popular in the mid-1800s and beyond, while earlier styles lacked matching decorations. Mantel clocks are similar to bracket clocks, except without a handle on the top. The movements of a clock are the parts that make the hands move and the pendulum swing. Use specific pieces of information to identify mantel clock movements.\nAntique mantel clocks use mechanical movements, while newer mantel clocks use quartz movements run on a battery. The movements include all moving parts of the clock, except the hands and pendulum. The movements in clocks keep time and have several parts, including a set of connected gears called the train. The clock companies did not make the movement parts, but purchased them from other companies and installed them in the clock bodies.\nThe clock manufacturer and movement manufacturer are generally two different companies. To determine the movement manufacturer, take the back off the clock to get to the movement inside. Locate numbers or symbols on the back of the movement. Not all clocks have numbers that are easy to see and thus require some hunting with a flashlight. Some mantel clocks have movements that sit on the bottom of the clock, while others are found against the front right behind the face. It might be necessary to remove the weights and pendulum before removing the outer body of the clock if the movement is on the bottom.\nThe numbers or symbols on the movement help identify the manufacturer. For example, one of the most common movement manufacturers is Hermle, also known by Welby, Buliva and Talley Industries. Movements made by Hermle have six or seven numbers with a dash in the middle and list the pendulum length if the clock has one. Urgos places a \"UW\" before numbers, Kieninger places the last two digits of the year of manufacturer at the beginning, and Seth Thomas places an \"A\" before six numbers with a dash in the middle. Many other companies make movements. It is best to use a antique clock book with a list of manufacturers and their codes.\nWorth and Repair\nTake antique clocks to a legitimate appraiser to determine its value or check online auction sites to see how much collectors are willing to pay for them. The sale price is often close to the actual worth. There are many antique clock books chock full of helpful information. When replacing clock movements, do not rely on basic knowledge found in a book. Take the clock to a professional. You might damage the clock if you replace the movement by hand unless you have clockwork knowledge. It is not always possible to find movements from the same manufacturer, because not all of them still make parts. The cost is always higher for antique parts.\n- Photo Credit Hemera Technologies/PhotoObjects.net/Getty Images"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e1d085b6-cdf2-4dba-a615-6edec15e9375>","<urn:uuid:74bce016-f8ef-4348-b6f2-57823bed13dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between Cheviot and Southdown wool in terms of their fiber characteristics?","answer":"Cheviot and Southdown wool have different characteristics. Cheviot wool has a 4-5 inch staple length with a 3D crimp that makes it bouncy and hard-wearing, while Southdown wool is shorter at 1.5-2.5 inches with a fine to medium grade and micron count of 23-29. Both wools are known for their bounce, but Cheviot is more coarse and chalky, while Southdown is one of the finest wools among British breeds.","context":["Lots of people enter the world of spinning with the aim of spinning for socks...\nThen they fall down the rabbit hole and discover just how many things go in to making a good sock yarn. Before you even get in to fibre choice, there's the issue of number of plies (more is better), wether to go classic 3-ply, or modern chain ply (tests seem to show there's very little difference), or even to use opposing plies.\nA good sock yarn needs to have bounce and memory. Otherwise the ribbing at the top bags out, and your socks fall down. It needs to withstand lots of friction, and needs to be able to put up with getting warm and damp. Those are of course conditions for felting. Some people are ok with their socks felting, which is fine providing that doesn't make them shrink. It also removes some of that elasticity. So I prefer a fibre that resists felting.\nIf you want to go pure wool, then Southdown is a really good bet. It resists felting, and has great elasticity. However, it's not great at resisting abrasion. If you have rough feet, or rough patches in your footwear you will get holes.\nAs well as Southdown I always used to offer a Superwash BFL & Nylon blend. This was great, because the superwash treatment resists felting, and it was hardwearing from the nylon. However, it was actually very similar to the Superwash BFL & Ramie base that I adore. So last summer I started experimenting. I still wanted a really machine-washable option (you can put Southdown in the machine, but I wanted a superwash treated fibre, that people could also use for garments). It also needed to be resist to abrasion, and have more bounce than the Superwash BFL.\nAnd the final result... Two swatches. One went through a machine wash pinned to my jeans pocket. The other was unwashed. The stitches still move, and the size remained un-changed. It's a delight to dye as well.\nI'm still using British wool, which was important to me. But it's slightly more coarse than BFL (but for your feet that's really not an issue), and is lovely and bouncy. You could still use this fibre for jumpers, cardigans, gloves and hats, it's definitely not Herdwick!\nThe Cheviot Hills are in the border area between Scotland and England, and remind me so much of my own bit of Wales.\nBy Cheviot_ewe_with_lamb.jpg: Donald Macleod from Stornoway, Scotlandderivative work: Coycan (Cheviot_ewe_with_lamb.jpg) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\nThe sheep that live in the area are hardy, living on the hills all year round. They have a lovely bulky fleece, with a 3D crimp that makes the fibre bouncey, and hard wearing. The staple length is 4-5 inches, which makes it excellent for worsted spinning, just what you want from a sock yarn.\nTo add to the strength I've kept the nylon component. It really does help stop holes developing. To help with the dyeing, because Cheviot is a chalky fibre that can be a bit of a pain to hand dye, and to allow me to dye the eye-socking colours some love in their socks I've added some tussah silk.\nI did a small batch for the online shop a few weeks ago, and also had some for sale at Wonderwool. Thos braids flew off the shelves, so I've dyed another batch that will be in the shop at the start of next week.\nHilltop Cloud- Spin Different\nBeautiful fibre you'll love to work with.\nVAT Reg- 209 4066 19\nDugoed Bach, Mallwyd, Machynlleth,\nPowys, SY20 9HR","They are a great breed that are docile and easy to manage.

{"question":"What's the main difference between metadata in the head section versus the body section of a webpage's HTML, and how does this affect accessibility?","answer":"The key difference is that metadata in the head section (like title and description tags) is entirely invisible to human visitors but readable by search engines, while metadata in the body section (like alt attributes) serves both search engines and human users, particularly those using assistive technologies. Head section metadata provides information about the overall page content, while body section metadata like alt tags provides specific information about individual elements like images, which is crucial for accessibility. This body section metadata helps both search engine indexing and assists users with screen readers in understanding the content.","context":["The question “what is Metadata” is a very common one, and it is important that you understand the meaning of the term and its importance. Whether you refer to it as ‘Metadata’ or ‘Meta data’ is immaterial. The Google search engine sees the two as being the same term. So, what exactly is Metadata, and how does it affect you?\nFirst, let’s establish one definition – we shall henceforth use the term ‘blog’ to include a blog or a traditional website. The two are the same when it comes to discussing Metadata and most other SEO fundamentals.\nWhat is Metadata in General Terms?\nWhat is the meaning of the prefix ‘Meta’? It has a Greek root, meaning ‘after’ and ‘beyond’ but has also been extended to mean ‘about’. That last definition is the one that is used in relation to web page or blog data. Fundamentally, Metadata offers information about the data that is contained on the web page or blog post.\nThat information can take many different forms:\n- The purpose of the data, or a description of the purpose of the page;\n- A description of individual elements within a page;\n- How the data were created, for example the HTML format;\n- The date of creation of the data;\n- Who created it – details of the author;\n- Where on the computer network the data were created\n- The standards used to create the data\nWhen discussing the way you create your website or blog content, we can narrow this meaning down to how you use Metadata for SEO. A more accurate definition of the term for you would be that:\nMetadata is the information you provide to search engines that is not visible to website or blog visitors. In other words, you have two sets of text on your blog. One that is visible to search engine algorithms, and a subset of that which is visible to humans. Humans cannot see the Metadata, other than by viewing the source code for the page.\nMetadata is used by webmasters to describe the various elements of each blog page or post so that search engine algorithms can more easily establish the relevance of the content of that page to the search term used by anyone using that search engine to find information.\nWebsite Source Code – Head and Body Areas\nIf you place your cursor anywhere in the body your website or blog post, and then right click, you will find a menu of options. Click on ‘View Page Source’ and you will find the HTML source code for that page. This code is converted by your browser into a blog page.\nIf you check out the top of the page source code, you will see ‘HTML’ telling the browser that you page is in HTML, and then ‘Head’ that tells your browser that this should not be made visible to humans. It is, however, visible to search engine spiders that crawl your site and use the Metadata in the Head section to calculate its relevance to any search term being used.\nThe ‘Body’ section comes below the ‘Head’. Everything in the body section is viewable to humans, apart from some other ‘Metadata’ used for SEO purposes that is not visible to you – again only by search engines.\nExamples of Metadata\nMetadata takes many forms. A large proportion is generated by software use by your web hosting service. It is advisable not to change any of this other than the elements below. There are four fundamental forms of Metadata that is important to your SEO and that can affect your search engine ranking.\nSome of these are common, while others may not be familiar to you according to your experience in blogging and operating websites. It should be noted here, that while many of these tags attributes can be automated by means of plugins, it is important that you check the content of Meta tags, and make sure they match up with the focus of your blog post or the keywords for which you are seeking rankings.\nPage Title Tag:\nThe Meta title tag appears in the ‘Head’ section of the HTML for each web page. It makes no difference if that is a regular web page, a blog page or a post. You must use your principal keyword or phrase in the title tag because that is what the Google indexing and ranking algorithms will look at first. (From now we shall use ‘Google’ as meaning the relevant algorithms).\nWhen you view the Google search engine results pages (SERPS) on Google for any search term, the heading or title you see for any listing is copied from the Title tag. Google will truncate this to some fixed width. So make sure that your title is no more than that fixed width. Check it out for yourself using this tool.\nYour Title tag should appear in this format:\n<title>This is the Title of My Page - and it Must Not Exceed a Fixed Width.</title>\nTrouble is, this is limited to a fixed width, so will be shown in Google’s listing as:\nThis is the Title of My Page – and it is limited to a fixed width …\nGoogle seems to display the ellipsis (…) in place of any final full word that would be over its permitted fixed width. You can use WordPress SEO plugin to check if it exceeds that fixed width.\nIf you fail to provide a Title tag for a page Google has decided to list, then Google itself will take a snippet from the text on your page. This might not necessarily be reader-friendly, so make sure you choose your own.\nDescription Meta Tag:\nThe description Meta tag should explain clearly the main theme of the contact of the blog post or page, and must also include you main theme keyword/phrase. This is the content that you see below your heading on your SERPS listing on Google.\nJust as with the title, if you do not provide a Description Meta tag, Google will take a snippet from your page – usually the first few words that seem relevant to the searcher. Obviously, it is best not to leave this to Google but to state what description you wish to use. You do this by using the following format in the Head section of your page HTML:\n<meta name=\"Description\" content=\"This is a description of my website. You can write this description any way you wish, within reason, but use no more than 159 characters - including spaces.\" />\nAccording to some SEO ‘experts’, complying with these suggestions might make no difference to your search engine ranking. However, if you check out the Google SERPS for any keyword, you will probably find that keyword is contained in both the title and description in the listing.\nMaybe there are listings that do not contain the keyword, and it is possible to attain such listings, but they are not common. The vast majority of Google listing for a keyword or phrase contains your search term in the listing somewhere. Check it out for yourself with a search using any search term you like – how many listings do not contain at least part of your search term?\nYou might find some, but that is Google’s LSI and Hummingbird algorithms at work. You cannot go wrong if you use your main keywords in your Title and Description tags. Anybody who tells you different knows little about SEO and the way that Google search, indexing and ranking algorithms operate.\nListen to what Matt Cutts has to say about the Description Meta tag here:\nMetadata Within the Body of Your Page\nMany people are under the misapprehension that Metadata appears only in the Head section of your HTML. There is other ‘data about data’ that many tend to ignore. The most common is the ‘Alt’ attribute that is metadata in the purer sense of the word- ‘data about data.’\nThe ‘Alt’ attribute is used within the HTML for an image, audio or video file. It is used to provide information for such a file should it fail to resolve in a web browser – it informs the reader what this space should be.\n<img alt=\"Hummingbird on flower\" src=hummingbid.jpeg>\nIn the event that the image of the hummingbird does not resolve on a particular browser, the ‘alt’ attribute explains to the reader that there should be image of a hummingbird and a flower. Google looks on this as providing an additional service to the reader, and so uses it as a ranking factor.\nNot only that, but many audio browsers that read the page content for blind users will read the contents of the alt attribute, so the blind user understands that there is an image present and what it portrays. This is better than the image being skipped altogether, particularly if further reference is then made to it.\nAnother benefit of using such tags is that Universal Search uses ‘alt’ tags in order to display images of your website in ‘blended results’. ‘Blended Results’ is a relatively new concept in the display of search results, where news, video, audio, blogs, web pages and images are displayed together in the SERPS for a particular search term. Alt tags are taken into account by indexing and ranking algorithms when displaying these results.\nRobots Meta Tag\nThe Robots Meta tag is another form of metadata of which you should be aware. This form of metadata enables you to control how each page on your blog or website is indexed by search engines. For example, if you do not want a page included in Google’s search engine index, place the Meta tag within the head section of your HTML like this:\n<html><head> <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\" /> (rest of head data) </head>\nIf you have no restrictions then you need not use the attribute, although Google would prefer you to include a robots.txt file in the root directory of the site containing this information:\nUser-agent: * Disallow:\nThis enables Googlebot to visit every page on your website, other than those with the specific noindex instruction shown above.\nTo generate the robots.txt file, open Notepad, copy the above text into a file and name it robots.txt. Now save and upload that file into the root directory of your blog.\nIf you have specific files within your blog you do not want indexed, such as pricing or sales pages that are more or less duplicates of each other, choose one to be indexed and state the URLs of the others after ‘Disallow’ in the Robots.txt file.\nYou can use the Robots Meta tag in many different ways – check our blog post on this topic for more information.\nIf you are wondering why the Keywords Meta data does not appear here it is because Google does not use it – not at all. You can forget it, or add about six important keywords if you feel the need – but it will not affect your ranking one little bit. However, do not confuse that with tags in your blog – these can be important for those searching blogs using specific keywords, but they will not help improve your ranking.\nWhat is Metadata – Summary\nThat is fundamentally how to use Metadata with your blog. Some forms of Metadata appear in the Head section of your HTML while others are included within tags and attributes in the body of the page itself. Wherever it appears, Metadata is very important information, and Google will take particular care to carry out the instructions you provide with it.\nMetadata is directed to the search engine, and Google is very particular in the way it carries out your instructions and applies such data. Make sure your instructions are clear, but if you get it right then you have a useful way of directing search engines to the important areas of your website and explaining very clearly what each web page is about.","Part 2: How to Conduct a Basic Accessibility Audit on Your Site\nIn case you missed it, catch up on Part 1 of How to Conduct a Basic Accessibility Audit on Your Site. In this post, we are going to learn how to do keyboard, screen reader and automated code testing.\nTesting with a keyboard\nUnderstanding how people might be using your site with assistive technology is a great way to gain empathy and insight into the impacts of poor accessibility.\nRemember that some people may not be able (or not want to!) use a mouse, due to motor impairments or personal preferences. Navigating by keyboard takes some practice. The basics are:\n- The tab key moves forward through interactive elements on the page and shift tab moves backwards.\n- Using the enter key should select a link or button.\n- The arrow keys should navigate within dropdowns.\n- The space bar works with form controls for example checking or unchecking a checkbox.\nTo run a keyboard test on your site:\n- Go to your site.\n- Unplug your mouse – you are not allowed to use it. No cheating!\n- Hit the tab key to get started.\n- Is there a skip to main content link? This allows users to skip the navigation or repetitive elements across pages.\n- Is it visually clear which element of the page you are on (this is called the focus state)?\n- Do interactive elements have the same functionality as they do when using a mouse?\n- Is the order of the focus states logical?\nAs you get the hang of keyboard navigation, you will learn how important the order of focus states is, as well as discovering interactive elements which don’t function well. A common problem is a ‘keyboard trap’ – where you cannot move away from an interactive element using the keyboard alone.\nScreen Reader testing\nYou can get a sense of how people use screen readers by watching demo videos on YouTube. Here, someone is using NVDA on Firefox.\nScreen readers do what the name suggests – they read the content on screen aloud. This allows a visually impaired person to use a computer and browse the web, using a keyboard and screen reader software. There are many different screen readers available. Mac products have built in accessibility features, including a screen reader called VoiceOver. A popular free one for Windows is NVDA. Popular paid options include Jaws and ZoomText.\nWhen you are starting out, you will likely want to use free screen readers rather than investing in a paid option. The first thing to do it to get familiar with how it works. VoiceOver on Mac and iPhone have practice tutorials you can use to familiarise yourself. Windows users can download NVDA and access tutorials.\nWhen you are somewhat comfortable using the screen reader software and your keyboard to navigate, you are ready to try out your site.\n- Have screenreader software turned on\n- Go to your site\n- Close your eyes and start using the site, using keyboard and audio only\n- Listen carefully for anything that does not make sense\n- Can you move around the page and understand the content?\n- Does the tabbing order make sense?\nIt’s ok to find this process challenging – it takes time and practice. It is a great way to build empathy and understanding for a range of users. Some things to look out for include the way the screen reader reads abbreviations or date ranges, or punctuation marks. When you feel lost on a page, it can be helpful to refresh the page and start again to orient yourself.\nBest practice is to test with a couple of screen readers on a few browsers, and on several devices, as different browsers can product different results. When you are starting out however, you may want to focus on one browser and screen reader combination as you get comfortable.\nAutomated Code Checks\nThere are several tools available which are designed to automatically check website code for accessibility compliance. These can be really helpful for conducting accessibility audits, however, it is strongly recommended that you do this as the last step of your process. Code checker results need human interpretation by someone who understands accessibility – they often show false positives, for example flagging the lack of an alt tag for a decorative image that doesn’t need one. Doing this last will reduce the number of errors you see as well as make you confident that you have examined issues like color contrast.\n- Install the HTML CodeSniffer bookmarklet\n- Go to your site and open the bookmarklet\n- Select the WCAG standard you will test against (2.0 Level AA is a good rule of thumb)\n- Toggle the types of issues you wish to see in the report\n- Review the report and interpret the errors and warnings\nRemember that an automated code checker has limitations and cannot assess whether alt tags or links make sense. With practice you will learn to understand the results and warnings of an automated test and whether they need to be actioned.\nBasic accessibility audits can go a long way\nAccessibility is multi-faceted, and improves UX for everyone. There are many aspects, including using plain language, designing with visual impairments in mind, and creating compliant code.\nThroughout this post and in part one, you have learned the steps to assessing the accessibility of the websites you are involved in designing and developing. By taking the time to do these basic audits you can start to build your understanding and skill, and make huge improvements to the accessibility of your site. Remember to start small, build your knowledge and work step by step.

{"question":"What are some ways to exercise and save money at the same time?","answer":"You can combine exercise and saving money by walking or biking instead of driving to destinations, doing your own yard work or house cleaning instead of hiring help, and choosing activities like hiking or playing ball with kids rather than going to movies or amusement parks. These activities help meet the recommended 2½ hours of moderate physical activity per week while reducing expenses.","context":["If you made a New Year’s Resolution to get healthy, you may get more bang for your resolution buck than you bargained for. That’s because healthy habits can benefit your wallet as well as your body.\nThe link between health and money\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic conditions–including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer–account for more than 75% of all health-care costs nationwide. Nearly half of all Americans have a chronic disease, which can lead to other problems that are devastating not just to health but also to a family’s finances.\nPeople with a chronic condition pay five times more for health care each year, on average, as those without a chronic disease.*\nMany chronic diseases can be linked to four behaviors: tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, poor eating habits, and inactivity.* A closer look at each of these behaviors demonstrates the health-money connection.\nTobacco and alcohol\nThe American Cancer Society (ACS) reports that the average price of a pack of cigarettes in the United States is $6.36. That means the average annual cost for a pack-a-day smoker is more than $2,300. However, the average health-related cost to a smoker, says the ACS, is $35 per pack–or $12,775 per year for someone who smokes a pack a day.\nThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines moderate drinking as one drink per day for women and two for men.\nDrinking more than that can lead to health problems, including various forms of cancer as well as impairment of your brain, heart, liver, and pancreas. Such outcomes have economic costs. The CDC reports that in 2006, the national cost of excessive alcohol consumption was $223.5 billion, 42% of which was shouldered by excessive drinkers and their families.\nEating habits and activity level\nProper nutrition and regular exercise are vital to staying healthy, but they can also save you money. For example, reducing the amount of high-in-saturated-fat products, processed foods, and red meat in your diet can result in benefits to your heart and wallet. Replacing high-fat ingredients in some recipes with healthier, low-cost options–such as using beans instead of ground beef–can help trim your grocery bills. And replacing high-calorie meals eaten at restaurants with meals made at home using fresh, in-season ingredients can benefit both body and bank account.\nCurrent guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend at least 2½ hours of moderate physical activity per week. Many opportunities exist in everyday life to both accumulate active minutes and save money. Instead of driving to your destination, walk or ride a bike. Do your own yard work or house cleaning instead of hiring help. Go for a hike or play ball with your kids rather than going to the movies or visiting an amusement park.\nChronic disease also has indirect long-term costs. Leaving the workforce for extended periods–or having to retire early–means fewer paychecks, less chance to benefit from workplace-provided retirement plans and health-care benefits, and lower earnings to apply toward Social Security benefits. In addition, chronic diseases often necessitate home renovations, the hiring of specialized care providers, or even permanent nursing care.\nWhen viewed over the long term, taking steps today to reduce your risks of getting sick down the road may make good health and financial sense. *Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f93d97b1-45ee-4aef-b5d6-80f3d4c16121>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the diff between historical thinking vs historical info in teaching, and how's it applied in restoration surveys?","answer":"Historical thinking emphasizes discovering relationships between events, abstracting patterns, and extracting historical rules, while mere information transfer is considered less effective in teaching history. In restoration surveys, this approach is practically applied through a comprehensive knowledge-based process where students must demonstrate theoretical understanding through laboratory exercises, analyze building pathologies, and interpret structural behavior. The restoration project is viewed as a project of knowledge, requiring both analytical skills and operational practice.","context":["عنوان مقاله [English]\nThis paper aims to have an inquiry about why and how to teach architectural history and to suggest a practical framework in this regard. The research method is based on logical argumentation. The results have been investigated in some architectural cases. Since the logical argumentation methods vary from formal/mathematical argumentations to cultural/discursive argumentations, this research can be positioned in between as a mathematical/ cultural argumentation.\nThe research literature review proposes two different areas of subject, ‘philosophy of history’ and ‘historical narrations’. Studying the ‘philosophy of history’ literature, the first studies go back to Kant’s ‘the idea of universal history from a cosmopolitan point of view’ and Hegel’s ‘lectures on the philosophy of world history’. New theories are aroused by Popper’ ideas about positivism causality in historical events. On the other hand, reviewing the ‘historical narrations’ literature, Danto proposes the idea of history as constructed of narrative sentences. Gallie emphasizes on the literal metaphors for historical narratives and Collingwood believes in the role of imagination and comprehension in historical narratives.\nRegarding history education, this paper believes that emphasis on transferring insight is more important than the transference of information. Analyzing the negative effects of the informational approach in this regard, the paper proposes the importance of ‘historical thinking’. In this regard, titles such as ‘the meaning of historical thinking’ and ‘achievement of historical thinking’ are described. With these considerations, different types of historical analysis are categorized according to ‘evolutional process’ and ‘the substance of repeating experiences’. So the appropriate quality of teaching architectural history can be attained through ‘arousing the power of discovering, interpretation and analysis of the relationships of historical events’, ‘abstraction and simplification of historical events’ and ‘extraction of historical rules and traditions’. ‘Arousing the power of discovering, interpretation and analysis of the relationships of historical events’ means emphasizes on the relations between the events. Whatever the power of discovering connections between events strengthens, historical literacy may improve. ‘Abstraction and simplification of historical events’ means standing back and observing the totality of events, main relations and omitting unnecessary issues. ‘Extraction of historical rules and traditions’ means having a belief in repeating rules about historical experiences and events. Moving toward extracting such rules may lead to comprehension of ‘durability ‘in history. Since the progress, evolution and change in history do not make paradox with repeating principles and patterns in history, it can be said that ‘durability and ‘dynamism’ have a simultaneous attendance in the history concept. At the same time, discovering such rules provides the power of predicting future events. This may lead to a timeless knowledge of history.\nIn such a process, the multiplicity of historical information can be simplified as convergent rules and comprehensive insight. Learning history will be more easy and deciding about contemporary issues and forecasting the effects of decisions would be possible. These characteristics can lead to what can be called ‘live history’. This method of teaching may convert the class space from a passive state to an active and interactive state.","Survey & Restoration Course\nThe course (in English) provides the basics of theory and history of restoration; it provides architectural survey, decays detection and conservative intervention capabilities and informs on the legislative framework; it defines the design drawings needed for restoration.\nRegarding Survey knowledge, the course deepens the knowledge of laser scanners and photogrammetry methodologies, for the construction of technical drawings for the drafting of restoration and heritage conservation projects.\nBased on the skills gained during the course, the student will have to demonstrate, through laboratory exercises, the assimilation of theoretical notions by transforming them into operational practice.\nThe purpose of the course is to implement critical skills and operational tools to improve the care process towards the existing building.

{"question":"Which PCB making method is faster: chemical etching with toner transfer or CNC milling?","answer":"CNC milling is faster than chemical etching with toner transfer. Chemical etching involves multiple steps including printing the design, transferring toner, immersing the board in etchant solution, agitating, and removing the mask with fingernail polish remover. In contrast, CNC milling can take a circuit board from design to functional board in just a few minutes, with the added benefit of automatically drilling holes for through-hole components without manual drilling.","context":["If you start tinkering with electronics, eventually you will want to make your own printed circuit board, or PCB as it is generally called. In the olden days, this subject was pretty straightforward. You went down to your local RadioShack, and bought an etching kit. You drew your single sided design using a marking pen and some supplied stickers. The board was fairly big, and it had only a few simple through-hole components.\nThose days are now pretty much gone. Now most electronic projects are much more complex, the boards are much smaller, and you need to deal with 2 layers, surface mount components and vias. In this overview, I will tackle the different problems you may encounter and the methods available. I won’t cover PCB layout software or commercially made boards. I’ll deal with those topics in separate articles.\nMaking a PCB involves several steps. Today’s PCBs require a lot more steps than they used to, but for your own use, these later amenities can be omitted. The steps involved are:\n- Imaging your design onto a blank PCB\n- Amenities – solder mask, silk screen, tin plating\nAs I mentioned before, simple circuits can be drawn with a sharpie marker, but these days, you will need to print out something called a mask using CAD software. There are several ways to transferring this mask to your blank PCB. Commercially, this process is done using a photo transfer process, which is also one of the ways available to you at home. The point of this process is to add a coating to your PCB in the shape of your circuit. This coating will permit the copper to be etched away from the blank board everywhere except where you want it. The coating that prevents parts of the board from being etched is called a mask. Because of the fine pitch features often required, this step is not as easy as it would seem.\nPhoto transfer is the most accurate way to image your design and is used commercially. It will easily provide the fine pitches needed for modern designs. It is also the most expensive method for home use. You must buy specially photo-sensitive coated boards and print your image onto clear plastic sheets. After printing the negative of your design, you lay it on your PCB and expose it to ultra-violet light to develop the coating which now becomes your mask.\nBecause of the extra expense and special boards required, I have never used this method. If you need fine features, using a commercial PCB service is really the way to go. If you would like to know more here are a few articles that describe the process:\nThe toner transfer method involves printing out a positive image of your circuit using a laser printer, and then using heat to transfer that image to your board. The pros including being quick, cheap and produces fairly good results. It is the method I prefer to use. The downside is that it is a little tricky to get good results and you often have some areas that need touching up with a sharpie. It can handle fairly fine features, but is definitely limited as compared to the photo transfer method.\nToner transfer uses the same basic process as the laser printer does. When a laser printer prints, it deposits the toner particles onto your paper and uses heat to fuse them to the paper. When you want to transfer this image to your PCB, you again use heat to lift the toner particles and fuse them to your board.\nThere are two ways to make the transfer – using an iron (like you iron clothes with) or a laminate machine. I have found the iron works well enough for occasional use. If you start making a lot of PCBs, then you should invest in a laminate machine. This company sells a laminator specifically for PCBs. You can also buy a cheap laminator from amazon for $35 and modify it as specified in this article.\nThe main problem encountered with this process is getting all the toner off the paper and onto the PCB. The type of paper you print on is the most critical part of the process. There are several resources available for buying (here or here)or making this paper. It seems to me that buying or making special transfer paper would be just as involved as photo imaging. If I were to need to make that many PCBs, I would go with the latter route instead.\nFor the quick, occasional home PCB, there is a surprisingly simple and cheap alternative to special papers – glossy, magazine pages. To use them, just tear out a page that is light on the printing and print your PCB onto it. The existing printing doesn’t transfer, so it is not a problem (the lightly printed pages are needed for YOU to see your design). The toner tends to not stick very well to the glossy pages which makes it ideal for toner transfer.\nFor more details, I have not found a better article on the subject than this one.\nOne last detail on this method involves registering double-sided boards. The problem is that the mask on both sides of the board much align with each other. The easiest way to do this is to hold the two masks up to the light (using thin magazine paper here helps) and aligning them together. Once aligned, tape them together. Then slip the board in between them and transfer using an iron or laminator. This article describes the technique in perfect detail.\nWhile I was writing this article, a new how-to article appeared that uses parchment paper from the grocery store for the toner transfer paper. It sounds like a winner to me – I will be trying it on my next board.\nA third way to get your design onto a board is to print directly onto the board. This method sounds like the ideal one for home use, but it is not quite mainstream yet. The basic method uses a modified ink-jet printer. This website gives a lot of useful information on how to do it. There is also an instructable on doing it.\nAn alternative to etching PCBs also exists with ink jet printing – skip the copper clad board altogether, and print conductive traces directly onto a substrate. A new conductive ink that is a true solution as opposed to particles in suspension has now been developed making it ideal for this method. If you want to experiment yourself with either of this techniques, you should head over and join the yahoo group dedicated to making PCBs with inkjets.\nThe last way to transfer your design to a board actually eliminates the next step as well – direct milling of the copper using a CNC machine. While formerly the only available to wealthy corporations, with the advent of cheap 3D printers and DIY CNC machines, this method is now cheap enough to be available to everyone.\nYou can check out some of these popular designs and kits (here and here) if you want to explore more. I don’t have a desktop CNC machine myself yet, but I plan to get one eventually. When I do, direct milling PCBs will be my preferred method.\nEtching MethodsEtching is fairly simple in its most basic form – you immerse the copper clad board into an etchant solution, agitate some and when you see the exposed copper dissolved, you remove the board and rinse. As with most things worth doing, there are many techniques to try to obtain a faster, better etch. The basic principles involved are temperature and agitation. The etchant needs to be warm and flowing across the copper. If it isn’t, the etching takes a long time and is more uneven.\nThere are two great tank construction articles I have found for making a really good etching tank. The first describes a thin vertical tank using an airstone for agitation. It looks simple and inexpensive. The second describes a spray technique that is really effective. While the build is more involved, it seems like a really great way to do it.\nFor the quick and dirty method that saves etching solution, I use the sponge technique. While wearing rubber gloves, rub the etchant solution onto the board with a sponge. It takes a bit of labor, but works quickly and well.\nAfter you have successfully etched your board, you must remove your mask. The best way to do this is to use fingernail polish remover. The toner or photo resist comes off easily with a little bit of rubbing.\nThe traditional etching solution is Ferric Chloride. It is available from most electronics suppliers. For many people, they do not like working with this chemical. Apart from its ability to stain, I don’t have much problem with it. While I wouldn’t want to touch it, it doesn’t burn or emit noxious fumes.\nThere are some who favor using Cupric Chloride which begins as a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid. The raw ingredients are cheap and readily available. Hydrochloric acid is available where pool supplies are sold under the name muriatic acid. I don’t know if this solution is any safer than the traditional one, but I like the fact that the ingredients can often be found either at home or in a nearby store. Here is a great article on the subject if you want to learn more.\nYou are now armed with the knowledge necessary to successfully image and etch your PCBs. In part two of this article, we will explore the other steps to making a working PCB as well as some extra features common on commercial boards.","Figure 1: A milled circuit board\nBreadboards are fantastic for experimenting with a circuit design and testing components. Eventually, you will want to move to a more robust solution for a circuit that is intended to escape the confines of laboratory and bravely venture into the real-world.\nI have tried and used many solutions throughout my engineering career and weekend tinkering; each with their own set of tradeoffs and end results. The first solution many of us would turn to was perfboard, which is a relatively inexpensive and simple solution for a first generation off-breadboard prototype. Perfboard provided an opportunity to fine-tune one’s wire-wrapping and soldering skills.\nChemical etchant based circuit boards were the next option for someone looking for more professional looking boards. The cost would be significantly more than perfboard since there is an initial investment for a computer and CAD package to create the PCB design. You would also need a laser printer, a clothing iron, and the consumables for the printer as well as the etchant itself. The process was dirty and potentially hazardous, but the results were relatively solid.\nFast forward to today and many circuit capture and PCB design tools, such as MultiSIM BLUE, have built-in features that let you send off a design to a PCB manufacturer. For a relatively low cost and a wait of a few weeks, you can have professional boards in your hand ready to be mated with electronic components.\nAs mentioned before, each of these options has a series of tradeoffs:\n1. Cost: Perfboard being very inexpensive; chemical etchant requires significant upfront costs, and PCB manufacturers are typically somewhere in the middle.\n2. Professional Appearance / Reliability: No doubt utilizing a PCB manufacturer will yield the best results aesthetically and functionally, assuming the design is sound.\n3. Speed: Perfboard and etchant are both quick turnaround; whereas there can be significant wait times involved for professional PCBs to be delivered.\nFigure 2: An example of a desktop CNC machine\nThis has led me to begin experimenting with using a CNC machine to mill circuit boards. What is a CNC machine you ask? First, CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control which is a fancy way of saying a machine that is controlled via a computer that sends numerical commands to control the machine. You can think of a CNC as a machine that performs the inverse of the more in vogue 3D printers which employ additive manufacturing techniques which adds a small amount of material, layer-by-layer, to bring an object into existence. In contrast, CNC machines are subtractive - starting with a large block of raw material that is slowly removed by a quickly spinning router, with a milling bit tailored for the material being milled.\nI am a few board designs in, and so far the results have been surprisingly good when utilizing FR4 copper clad boards. In most applications, I limit myself to boards no larger than 4” by 6” and I am constrained by the fact that you can only build boards with two signal layers. After experimenting with a variety of design parameters such as trace widths, I have found that I can reliably mill traces down to 20 mils. This means when I am looking for parts on Mouser that I can utilize surface mount components as small as a 1206 package for resistors and capacitors. However, I seem to have better reflow results when I go a bit bigger with 1210 (3225 metric) or 2010 (5025 metric) footprints. To be sure, this is not the end-all-be-all solution. Professional PCBs still have the advantage of many more signal layers, tighter trace widths, smaller components, and silk screening for easier to understand board layouts.\nOn the other hand, milling a PCB is fast. No waiting weeks for board delivery from an overseas manufacture, and unlike chemically etching a PCB I don’t have to manually drill holes for through hole components. I can just let the CNC machine drill the holes for me after switching out the milling bit for a drill bit. In just a few minutes, I can take a circuit board from one’s and zero’s on a computer to having a functional board in my hands. For those of us who have spent years in our favorite CAD tools designing PCB, perhaps the best news is that there is little change to the workflow needed to get a milled board versus using the toner transfer method. Instead of printing the circuit you simply need to run the vectorized image of your circuit board through a tool that converts SVG image files into the gcode cutting paths that are spoken by CNC machines.\nWhile a professional design studio with capital can buy a CNC machine pre-built for a few thousand dollars, a Maker can build their own using components you can find here at Mouser, including stepper motors and an Arduino that can serve as the CNC “brains”. There is even a CNC control shield that makes wiring together the H-Bridge motor controllers very easy. Really, the electronics are really that simple. The software needed to run a homebrewed CNC machine is open source and available for free. Furthermore, I have found building a CNC machine is much more forgiving of a task than building a 3D printer that has much more sensitivity to things like bed leveling and tight Z-axis control.\nSo, for what specific use cases have I found milling a PCB useful? I am personally enamored by the notion that I can create a much more robust prototype that looks better and is more tolerant to real-world handling than a breadboard-based prototype. I am building quite a few interface boards so that I can connect many external components to a DIP package microcontroller. Another side benefit is that by actually building the board at home I can ensure that the electrical connections are correct before I send my Gerber files off to be manufactured for a final product.\nBottom line, milling your own PCBs is pretty cool. It’s not for everyone, but for those looking to find a happy middle between homebrewed and professional you might just find pretty amazing results with milled circuit boards. Of course your results will vary based on skill and tools available, thus if at first you don’t succeed, experiment with different component sizes and techniques.\nHave you ever milled circuit boards?

{"question":"Could you explain how North Korea's early nuclear program development at Yongbyon compares to the activities of Korean independence activists in the U.S. during the March 1st Movement period, in terms of their historical significance?","answer":"The Yongbyon nuclear program and the Korean independence movement represent two very different historical developments. According to CIA satellite imagery, North Korea's nuclear program at Yongbyon began construction sometime between June 1963 and July 1964, marking the start of their nuclear weapons pursuit that has continued for nearly six decades. In contrast, the Korean independence activities in the U.S. occurred much earlier, sparked by the March 1st Movement in 1919. This movement led to significant organized resistance through the Korean Congress in Philadelphia, where over 200 delegates gathered, and the formation of the League of Friends of Korea chapters across America. While Yongbyon represented North Korea's military ambitions, the independence movement focused on gaining American support for Korean sovereignty through peaceful advocacy and Christian networks.","context":["January 30, 2019—\nThis Living History features an interview with Ambassador Kathleen Stephens who served as the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Korea from 2008 to 2011.

He also discusses his role in bringing back a detained U.S. citizen, Otto Warmbier, from North Korea.\nJuly 16, 2018—\nNorth Korea’s pursuit of a nuclear weapons program is nearly six decades old. While archival documents have previously provided some evidence of North Korea’s intent to build weapons of mass destruction at an early stage in the Cold War, newly declassified satellite imagery from the Central Intelligence Agency gives us a more precise picture of how and exactly when North Korea started developing the fundamental components of its nuclear weapons program.\nMay 14, 2018—\nThe exact origins of North Korea’s nuclear program are still shrouded in mystery despite being the object of study for over twenty-five years. Contrary to common perception, early satellite imagery from the Central Intelligence Agency, taken on December 15, 1962 and June 27, 1963, shows that construction on the Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center in North Korea started sometime after June 27, 1963 and before July 16, 1964.\nApril 23, 2018—\nOn Saturday April 21, commercial satellite imagery from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station indicates minimal to no activity ahead of the inter-Korean summit. While dwindled ground activity could be attributed to the fact that images were taken during a weekend, the absence of any parked vehicular traffic and human activity suggests compliance with the leadership’s declaration, coming out of the Third Plenary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party.\nApril 23, 2018—\nDespite being the subject of intense study for almost 60 years there is remarkably little independently verifiable information concerning the development of North Korea’s nuclear infrastructure available at the unclassified level.

Construction on a new hovercraft base near Yonbong-ni could indicate a significant escalation of the navy sniper brigade threat to the ROK islands in the West Sea and ports along the coast.","The Korean Independence Movement and Boston University\nOn March 1, 1919, a group of Korean intellectuals met at a restaurant in Seoul to formally introduce the Korean Declaration of Independence to the world. This was a document inspired by President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, which he delivered in January of 1918 at the closing of World War I. Wilson’s speech was an ambitious program to reorient international affairs in the post-war period. And it was his call for the right of national self-determination from colonial powers that encouraged the leaders of the March 1st Movement, as it came to be called, to act decisively. The reading of the Korean Declaration of Independence that fateful day in the beginning of March sparked public protest against Japanese occupation. Japanese response against the countless demonstrations that broke out across Korea was quick and brutal.\nThousands of miles away, while all this was being reported in the newspapers of America, another important front in the movement for Korean independence was formed. In April, 1919, Philip Jaisohn (Seo Jae-pil), the first Korean to receive American citizenship, convened a meeting of Korean expatriates, immigrants, and Korean sympathizers in Philadelphia. Over 200 delegates gathered, with Philip Jaisohn, the president of the Korean Congress presiding, and Syngman Rhee (Seung Man Rhee), the president of the Korean Provisional Government (KPG), giving a speech. The main goal of the 1919 Philadelphia Korean Congress was to energize the Korean diaspora community in America and to mobilize American support for the Korean independence movement. The organizers of the meeting knew that they needed to win quickly the battle for the hearts and minds of Americans. That the gathering was held in Philadelphia was no coincidence, as conference leaders recognized the city as the “cradle of liberty.” After the sessions, they even went to see the signed Declaration of Independence.\nChristianity, too, would prove to be a force for independence. Many of the leaders of the Philadelphia congress were Western-educated elites and devout Christian converts. Of the thirty-three signers of the Korean Declaration of Independence, sixteen were Christians and a number of them pastors. Christian missionaries were also actively involved in the independence movement in Korea. Thus, the conference organizers consciously utilized the rhetoric of the double pillars of American society—freedom and Christian values. They were able to frame the narrative to appeal to American sensibilities of democracy while also highlighting the struggle as a moral cause, one with implications for the future of Christianity in Korea. In order to further public relations with an American audience, Philip Jaisohn and Syngman Rhee formed the League of the Friends of Korea in various parts of the country.\nThe Boston chapter of the League of Friends of Korea was founded on January 11, 1920, with ninety members. One of the founders and key leaders was Syngman Rhee’s old acquaintance from his student days at Harvard, Yang Yuchan.\nYang was from a family that had immigrated to Hawaii. At the age of twenty he won a scholarship to Boston University. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science and then went on to get an M.D. from the Boston University Medical School. In Boston, he spoke on numerous occasionsat churches, universities, and civic organizations on behalf of Korean independence. According to an article in the Korean newspaper Shin-Han-Min-Bo, there was a significant meeting of the League of Friends of Korea at Jacob Sleeper Auditorium at Boston University, where both Syngman Rhee and Yang spoke. It attracted a large number of local politicians, entrepreneurs, theological students from BU and Harvard; even some Japanese and Chinese students who supported Korean independence came. There were also some notable figures in attendance. One was Homer B. Hulbert, a famous missionary and correspondent to the Times and Associated Press and close confidant of King Kojong of Korea. Hulbert was deeply involved in many League of Friends of Korea gatherings. Another was then president of BU and acting president of the Boston League of Friends of Korea, Lemuel Murlin.\nAs an undergraduate at BU, Yang had attracted the attention of President Murlin, who when inquiring about Yang’s lodging, discovered he was living in the city’s red-light district. Murlin relocated him to a place in the School of Theology. Murlin would go on to serve as the president of the Boston League of Friends of Korea. Surely his relationship with Yang must have influenced him. But another important factor in President Murlin’s investment into the League of Friends of Korea was the number of BU alumni involved with mission work in Korea, most notably George Heber Jones, a Methodist minister who was an early missionary to Korea and one of the pioneers of academic study on Korean culture and religious history. He taught missions in the School of Theology at BU from 1915-1918.\nThe relationship between Korean missionaries and the Korean independence movement is an interesting topic worthy of further research. An article printed on April 18, 1919, by the Boston Daily Globe (later to be known as the Boston Globe), reported the arrest of one Rev. Eli Mowry who was charged with harboring Koreans involved in the propagation of rebel activities against the Japanese government. The article ended with the claim that while some missionaries seemed to be encouraging Korean independence activities, “the missionary body in Korea as a whole is not anti-Japanese.” A few months later, this diplomatic gesture of neutrality by the missionaries would no longer be the company line. A report by the commission on relations with the Orient of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America confirmed reports of Japanese atrocities against Koreans, even recounting in detail some of the gruesome acts. As reported by an article in the July 16, 1919 edition of the Boston Daily Globe on the commission’s findings:\n“In certain villages all of the Christian men were summoned to meet in the local churches where they were fired upon by Japanese troops and the buildings burned to the ground with all occupants. Native women coming to learn the fate of their husbands were also massacred. From one hill, investigators were able to see nine burned villages, most of whose inhabitants were Christians.”\nThe movement for Korean Independence benefited greatly from the relentless advocacy of the Korean diaspora community in America. Another article in the Boston Daily Globe told of Yang speaking at the Church of the Advent in Boston. His speech embodied all the elements involved in winning the hearts and minds of Americans for the cause: he told the stories of Japanese aggression against native Christians as well as tales of Christian missionaries being tortured on suspicion that they were fomenting rebellion. He broadened the scope of the plight by sounding the warning bells of increased Japanese aggression worldwide if somehow China, too, were to succumb to Japanese occupation. In making this argument, he globalized and universalized the conflict. In closing, Yang appealed to those gathered to join a Boston organization known as the “League of Friends of Korea.”  Soon, the Boston chapter would come to have over 1,500 members.\nWith the formation of the Republic of South Korea in 1951, its first president Syngman Rhee would remember his old friend and fellow diasporic leader and organizer. He appointed Boston University alumnus Dr. Yang Yuchan to be the first South Korean ambassador to the United States.\nResearched by Paul Choi and Hajung Lee\nWritten by Paul Choi\n Richard S.

{"question":"What safety concerns should one consider when using LED rope lights versus climbing safety ropes?","answer":"LED rope lights have minimal safety concerns, with a minuscule fire risk even when hot to touch, though humidity in outdoor environments may increase risk over time. In contrast, climbing ropes must be retired immediately if they show any signs of damage such as core damage, sheath wear, fraying, glazing, discoloration, or after taking a major fall approaching factor 2. Additionally, climbing ropes require careful inspection and must be retired if there's any doubt about their security.","context":["How long do LED Rope Lights last?\nIn general, LED rope lights are rated for 100,000 hours while a comparative incandescent rope light is rated for 25,000 hours.\nAlso, how long can you leave rope lights on?\nThe best way to know how long lights will last is to look at the hour rating. For example, if the LED rope lights or bulbs you're considering have a rating of 50,000 hours, that means they'll last for about five and half years. And that's if you plan to leave them on 24 hours a day.\nNext, do LED rope lights use a lot of electricity?\nHow much electricity does a rope light use? LED rope lights consume approximately 1 watt per foot of lighting.LED rope lights also have longer working lives, roughly four times the life span of their incandescent counterparts.\nNevertheless, can LED rope lights be cut to length?\nRope light spools can be cut using either sharp scissors or a knife. To cut rope light, measure the area where you plan to install the rope light and then cut the tube at the nearest cutting mark.This is the only place that LED or incandescent rope light should be cut.\nBeside this, can I leave my LED lights on overnight?\nTo put it simply, well-manufactured LED lights are extremely long-lasting and can be left on 24 hours, 7 days a week. This is because, unlike conventional types of light, LEDs produce minimal amounts of heat, which means they are unlikely to overheat or set on fire.\nMoreover, what can go wrong with LED lights?\nCommon Problems with LED Lighting\n- LED Light Flickering.\n- LED Buzzing or Humming Noise.\n- Too Bright light.\n- LED Light Too Dim.\n- LED Light Stopped Working.\n- LED Flashes on and then Goes off.\n- LED Dimming Does not work.\n- LED Strip Showing the Wrong Color.\nOn the other hand, can LED rope lights catch fire?\nThe possibility of led strip lights catching fire is minuscule, even though they are hot to touch.Incandescent bulbs have a filament that emits excessive heat, the light sources can ignite a fire on overheating, but as LED lights produce light at a lower temperature, they don't catch fire as easily.\nAnd, can rope lights start a fire?\nIf you are using LED rope lights in an outdoor environment with high levels of humidity then there is a higher chance of the rope light becoming a fire risk over a long period of time.Fortunately, most modern LED rope lights are now fitted with more secure power outlets and wiring.\nThus, does rope lighting burn out?\nThe internal wiring and components of the rope light can be damaged if you bend the light back and forth. The wiring to the poles and trees can break if you Winding your rope lights around them.\nMeanwhile, do LED lights get hot?\nDo LEDs get hot? LEDs do give off some heat, but much less than energy-saving sticks, twisters and traditional light bulbs. Just as importantly, when used in your light fittings at home, LEDs don't emit infrared (IR), only visible light.\nSimilarly, do LED lights create heat?\nAn often-quoted advantage of LEDs is that they don't produce heat, and are cool to the touch.In one sense this is true: LEDs are cool to the touch because they generally don't produce heat in the form of infrared (IR) radiation (unless of course they are IR LEDs).\nHowever, do rope lights get hot?\nDo LED rope lights get hot? No. While incandescent rope light generate light by heating a filament, LED rope light use a completely different silicon-based technology that does not produce heat under operation.","The manufacturer of your rope says:\nTime in use : The potential lifetime of BEAL PPE in use is up to a\nmaximum of 10 years.

{"question":"I'm planning my tomato garden - what's the best fertilizer ratio to use, and what causes blossom-end rot?","answer":"For fertilizer, use one that's low in nitrogen but higher in phosphorus and potassium, with suitable N-P-K ratios being 8-32-16 or 6-24-24. Excessive nitrogen produces fast green growth but inhibits fruiting. Regarding blossom-end rot, it's not an infectious disease but a physiological breakdown due to insufficient calcium uptake. It occurs when tomatoes are watered shallowly and frequently. To prevent it, mulch the soil and water deeply but infrequently.","context":["TOMATO Gold Nugget - 15+ Heirloom Seeds\nGold Nugget cherry tomato seeds produce compact determinate plants 61 cm tall. Gold Nugget's compact size makes it an ideal choice for containers and small garden spaces. This variety sets easily in cool weather and are usually the first of any tomato variety to ripen. It is a Winner of the prestigious Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Award of Garden Merit.\nEnjoy prolific early yields of lovely golden yellow globes the size of ping pong balls. The majority of Gold Nugget cherry tomatoes are seedless until the end of the season. Fruits have a sweet, flavourful and balanced taste.\nThis variety was developed specifically for cool climates by Dr. James Baggett of Oregon State University in the early 1980's. The plants are dependable producers. Provided fruits are harvested regularly, the plants will outperform most other cherry varieties.\nThis is a DETERMINATE & BUSH variety.\nTomato Growing Instructions & Care\nTomatoes are a warm season, frost tender annual plants. Seeds require a warm soil of between 18 - 28°C to germinate. Sowing at too low a temperature will cause delayed or failed germination.\nWhen to Sow\nTemperate Area: sow in early spring - either inside with extra bottom heat by using a bottom heat propagator, behind a sunny window or on top of a hot water system; if sowing outside wait until all frost danger has passed and the soil is warm. Generally, if starting tomato seeds inside then begin 6 to 8 weeks before the last expected frost date in your area. By sowing early there will be time for a good crop to be produced before the first frost in winter.\nSubtropical Area: sow March - October in frost-free areas\nTropical Area: sow late April - July.\nHot & Humid Area: On extremely hot days tomatoes can literally 'cook' on the vine and turn to mush. Tomatoes also can suffer sunburn; a white shade cloth cover can help reduce heat stress on the plants. The hardiest tomatoes for hot and humid conditions are Cherry and Roma types. For a round tomato Tropic is a good choice as it is disease resistant.\nSeed Sowing & Care\nSow 6 mm deep into seed raising mix in seedling pots or trays. Germination takes 7 - 14 days. Liquid feed the seedlings once germinated. Seedlings are ready to transplant when the 2nd set of 'true' leaves appear. During seedling development make sure the seedlings are not crowded and receive strong light. Seedlings become leggy (etiolated) with weak stems if the light is insufficient or if they are too crowded. The best seedlings have strong, stout stems.\nSeedlings should be planted out in a full sun position after all frost danger has passed.\nPlant in rows 90 cm apart with 45 - 60 cm between plants.\nTransplant by planting seedlings deeper, up to the first set of 'true' leaves, first carefully removing the seed leaves. This speed up fruit production and increases root depth.\nGrow in a fertile, well-drained garden bed with a soil pH 5.8 - 7. Prepare the soil by adding compost. If stakes are required, then put them at the same time as transplanting takes place to avoid later root disturbance. Providing support to keep fruit clear of the ground helps keep fruit clean and prevents slug and snail damage. Mulch the plants well. Keep well fertilized and evenly watered.\nFertilizer: Tomatoes are generally heavy feeders, requiring soil rich in organic matter and nutrients. Tomatoes planted in minimally fertile soils should be regularly fertilized to keep their N-P-K levels consistent. Excessive nitrogen produces fast green growth but inhibits fruiting. Keeping this in mind, choose a fertilizer that's low in nitrogen levels and higher in phosphorus and potassium.

The water can be due to rains, dews or overhead watering. In addition, both diseases overwinter on the dead infected plant material on or just below the soil surface.\"\nIn the spring, splashing rains and blowing winds carry the pathogen onto the new plants. Fall sanitation can help delay serious infection the following year since the inoculum has been removed or reduced and the pathogen causing these leaf spots may have to blow in from another garden site.\n\"If you want to determine which of these diseases is on your plants, it will require close inspection of the disease symptoms,\" he said. \"Septoria leaf spot first starts as tiny, water-soaked spots that soon enlarge to circular or angular lesions 1/8-1/4 inch across. As the spots enlarge, the lesions develop a dark margin with a grayish white center. The grayish white center usually contains tiny black spores. Leaves that are heavily infected turn yellow, wither, die and fall off in large numbers starting at the base of the plant. Septoria can infect other plant parts.\"\nEarly Blight spots are usually brown to black and develop target-like concentric rings as they enlarge to between 1/4 and 1/2 inches. Major leaf veins frequently limit the size of the lesions. The leaves yellow, wither, droop or fall off from the bottom up. This disease can and often does attack the stem, causing cankers that can kill the plant, and it can attack the tomato causing blackish, sunken and rotten spots on the fruit. Fruit lesions are often covered with a dark brown, velvety layer of spores. Schuster reports that Alternaria-caused diseases, such as early blight, can survive the winter not only on tomato debris but also on other plants.\nAnother disease, anthracnose, causes small, pale yellow or water-soaked lesions that quickly enlarge and become tan to dark brown or irregular and black. \"Spots may merge and cause a blighted appearance or kill the leaf,\" he said. \"This disease does best with frequent rains or heavy dews and temperatures between 68 and 85 degrees F. Crowding of plants and continuing warm, moist conditions favor the development and spread of anthracnose. In addition to tomatoes, other anthracnose fungi also infect and damage cucumbers, beans, peppers, and sweet corn.\"\nBlossom-end rot is not an infectious disease caused by a pathogen. Instead it is a physiological breakdown of cell wall tissue due to insufficient calcium. \"Wherever soils are very acidic, there may be insufficient calcium in the soil for the tomato to take up,\" Schuster explained. \"However on alkaline soils, there are adequate amounts of calcium for the plants.\n\"Blossom end rot occurs when tomatoes are watered shallowly and often. The rapid wetting and drying of the soil inhibits the uptake of calcium - leading to blossom-end rot. Mulch the soil area where the tomato roots are growing and water deep and infrequently to avoid blossom-end rot.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:561b3d5f-bc72-4ce3-9921-29e556ca8905>","<urn:uuid:c5d0d218-89e8-42da-b47c-c3f9f45e8bea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm curious about ancient measurement techniques. How did Romans ensure precision in their aqueduct construction, and how did Islamic calligraphers maintain accuracy in their writing?","answer":"Romans used specialized tools like the chorobate and dioptra to measure and maintain precise slopes in their aqueducts, ensuring a consistent water flow with a drop of just several inches every 100 feet over distances as long as 53 miles. Islamic calligraphers, on the other hand, achieved precision through specific writing instruments, particularly the qalam (a pen made of dried reed), and developed strictly defined geometric scripts. The ink was carefully chosen to allow for varying intensity, enabling dynamic effects in the strokes while maintaining accuracy in the letterforms according to established styles like Kufic, Naskh, and Thuluth.","context":["In the beginnings of Islam, the Quran was mostly recorded in the memory of the Huffaz. After witnessing the unreliability of such a form of transmission, mostly because of the untimely death of many of those Huffaz in battle, it was decided to record it in written form.\nGiven the sacred nature of the word of Allah, the book would be made with great attention to quality and readability. Given Islam's taboo against pictural representation, however, drawings could not be used to enjolivate the book, as was done in the Christian world. Neither was it allowed to decorate mosques, for that matter. Thus, the art of calligraphy became very important in the Muslim world, and still today it is a major art; calligraphers are held in great esteem. The aesthetic of their art, which allows for the teaching of the Quran, is an unifying aspect of Islam.\nAfter the definitive fixing of the arabic script around 786, by Khalil ibn Ahmad al Farahidi, many styles were developped, both for the writing down of the Quran and other books, and for inscriptions on monuments as decoration.\nThe first of those to gain popularity was known as the Kufic script; it was angular, made of square and short vertical strokes, long horizontals, and bold, compacts circles. It would be the main script used to copy the Quran for three centuries; its static aspect made it fit for monumental inscriptions, too. It would develop many serifs, small decorations added to each character.\nMore often used for casual writing was the cursive Naskh script, with rounder letters and thin lines; with perfectionning of its writing techniques it would come to be preferred to Kufic for copying the Quran.\nDevelopped later, the Thuluth would take on from the 13th century the ornamental role devoted to the Kufic script. Thuluth meaning one third, it is based on the principle that one third of each letter slides downward. As such it has a strong cursive aspect and is usually written in ample curves.\nAs Islam extended farther east, it converted the Persians, who took to use arabic script for their own language; and they contributed to arabic calligraphy the Taliq and Nastaliq styles. The later is extremely cursive, with exageratedly long horizontal strokes; one of its particularities is that vertical strokes lean to the right rather than the more common left, making Nastaliq writing particularly well flowing.\nFinally the most commonly used script for everyday use is Riqa, simple and easy to write, its movements are small, without much amplitude. It is the one most commonly seen.\nThe traditional instrument of the Arabic calligrapher is the qalam, a pen made of dried reed; the ink is often in color, and chosen such that its intensity can vary greatly, so that the greater strokes of the compositions can be very dynamic in their effect.\nIndeed, Arabic calligraphy hasn't fallen out of use as in the western world; the\nArabic script, cursive by nature unlike the latin alphabet, is used to write down a verse of the Quran, a Hadith, or simply a proverb, in a spectacular composition that is often undecipherable. The composition is often abstract, but sometimes the writing is shaped into an actual form such as that of an animal. One of the current masters of the genre is Hassan Massoudy.\nWeb references and examples :\nhttp://www.arabiccalligraphy.com/resources.htm - examples of arabic scripts.\nhttp://perso.wanadoo.fr/hassan.massoudy/ - Modern calligraphies.","Grade Level: 9 (9-10)\nTime Required: 45 minutes\nLesson Dependency: None\nSubject Areas: Geometry\nSummaryStudents see that geometric shapes can be found in all sorts of structures as they explore the history of the Roman Empire with a focus on how engineers 2000 years ago laid the groundwork for many structures seen today. Through a short online video, brief lecture material and their own online research directed by worksheet questions, students discover how the Romans invented a structure known today as the Roman arch that enabled them to build architecture never before seen by humankind, including the amazing aqueducts. Students calculate the slope and its total drop and angle over its entire distance for an example aqueduct. Completing this lesson prepares students for the associated activity in which teams build and test model aqueducts that meet specific constraints. This lesson serves as an introduction to many other geometry—and engineering-related lessons—including statics and trusses, scale modeling, and trigonometry.\nThe geometry and engineering employed by the Romans enabled them to create structures never before possible. The invention of the Roman arch gave them the capability to build larger and heavier structures than any other civilization up to that point. These arches were designed in such a way that the force applied down on them was directed horizontally instead of vertically. This meant that they could place larger weight on these structures without sacrificing safety. At the time, Roman engineers incorporated these arches in almost every structure they built, including the Colosseum and water aqueducts. These methods however were not only employed by the ancient Romans, but are still used today in modern structures such as bridges.\nAfter this lesson, students should be able to:\n- Explain how Roman aqueducts worked, what they were used for, and why they were so innovative and necessary for the time.\n- Describe tools and processes used by Roman engineers to build aqueducts over long distances.\n- Solve simple calculations using the Pythagorean Theorem to find the slope of an aqueduct over a long distance.\nEach TeachEngineering lesson or activity is correlated to one or more K-12 science,\ntechnology, engineering or math (STEM) educational standards.\nAll 100,000+ K-12 STEM standards covered in TeachEngineering are collected, maintained and packaged by the Achievement Standards Network (ASN),\na project of D2L (www.achievementstandards.org).\nIn the ASN, standards are hierarchically structured: first by source; e.g., by state; within source by type; e.g., science or mathematics;\nwithin type by subtype, then by grade, etc.\nEach TeachEngineering lesson or activity is correlated to one or more K-12 science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) educational standards.\nAll 100,000+ K-12 STEM standards covered in TeachEngineering are collected, maintained and packaged by the Achievement Standards Network (ASN), a project of D2L (www.achievementstandards.org).\nIn the ASN, standards are hierarchically structured: first by source; e.g., by state; within source by type; e.g., science or mathematics; within type by subtype, then by grade, etc.\nWorksheets and AttachmentsVisit [ ] to print or download.\nMore Curriculum Like This\nStudents explore in detail how the Romans built aqueducts using arches—and the geometry involved in doing so. They calculate the slope of the small-sized aqueduct based on what was typical for Roman aqueducts at the time, aiming to construct the ideal slope over a specified distance in order to achi...\nStudents are presented with a brief history of bridges as they learn about the three main bridge types: beam, arch and suspension. They are introduced to two natural forces — tension and compression — common to all bridges and structures.\nStudents must know the Pythagorean Theorem and how to solve for the length of sides of right triangles.\n(Be ready to show the class an online 10-minute video, Roman Engineering-Aqueducts. Queue up the video to start at minute 6:30; showing the first part of the video is optional. Make copies of the Arch Research Worksheet, one per student. Also have available computers with Internet access for student pairs to conduct research. Kick off the lesson by telling students the following information.)\nGeometry contributes greatly to the world of engineering. Nearly every human-made structure includes geometric shapes that compose its form. Think about it—it is difficult to find a structure without a shape! Every building structure incorporates geometrical shapes ranging from circles to complex polygons. These shapes can be found in all structures because they are fundamental to the architecture. In the rare cases when buildings are made strictly from curved features with no particular geometric shape whatsoever (maybe caves or hobbit houses!), you can imagine that it would be difficult to verify that the structure is safe to use or occupy since it would be challenging to analyze the structure from an engineering point of view.\nGeometry is a tool that can be used in many different applications and has been used to build structures for thousands of years. It has an important and impressive history.\nContinuing Teacher Instructions\nNext, show the class the last three minutes of the online video. Start at minute 6:30; the key information for this lesson begins at minute 7:00. Pause the video at 7:38 and ask students to work with one other person to calculate the slope of the aqueduct mentioned in the video. Student answers will vary, given the approximation provided by the video. If students need help, remind them that the video mentioned that the aqueduct dropped just “several inches every 100 feet,” which is about 1 meter per 1 kilometer (1 meter = 3.28 feet; 1 kilometer = 3280 feet). Thus, prompt students to convert the meter and kilometer units into feet to yield a simplified fraction with a rise of -1 foot. (Answer: rise = -1 foot; run = 1000 feet) Lead a short discussion with the class and ask a few students to share their answers; check to make sure the rest of the class arrived at the same answer. Then continue watching the video until the end.\nAfter students have finished watching the video, go back to the example that they solved previously about the slope of the aqueduct. Direct students to get back with their partners and calculate the total drop of the longest aqueduct built (approximately 53 miles, 5280 feet = 1 mile) and ask them to calculate the angle in degrees of the aqueducts relative to flat ground. (Answers: drop = 279.84 feet; angle = .057 degrees) After students have completed their calculations, lead a short discussion to review the logic of the calculations like before, to make sure all students obtained the correct answer.\nNext, direct students to do some Internet research on Roman arches. Have students work with the same partner as before. Hand out the worksheets. Suggest they search using keywords such as Roman arch, Roman aqueduct, Roman engineering. Direct them to investigate to find out the following two pieces of information and complete worksheet questions 1 and 2.\n- Determine the version of the Roman arch that was used to build the aqueducts. (A good resource for the names of arch types is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch.)\n- Identify the device the Romans used to make sure the aqueducts ran at a steady slope across the entire length. (A useful website is http://www.romanaqueducts.info/picturedictionary/pd_onderwerpen/tools.htm.)\nAfter 10 minutes, lead a class discussion about the types of arches students found. If anyone uncovered different answers, ask them to explain why they chose that arch version. Example questions: What types of arches did you find? Did anyone find different arches? Why did you choose that arch type?\nAlso discuss the device(s) the Romans used to measure slope and see if anyone was able to find the name(s) of it/them (chorobate, dioptra, groma, libella, etc.) and the similar device that is used today (level). Example questions: What did you find out about the device the Romans used to measure slope? What was it called? Did you find out about a device used now that is very similar?)\nLastly, direct students to focus on worksheet question 3, continuing to use their computers to research the Roman aqueducts and how they were engineered. A good website to get students started is https://www.history.com/news/history-lists/10-innovations-that-built-ancient-rome. Suggest that students find as many sources as possible for their information, and generally strive to be unique and creative in their searches. If they use Wikipedia, advise them to look at the Wikipedia page’s source references rather than the Wikipedia page itself.\nAfter 15 minutes, pull the groups back together for a class discussion about how the aqueducts were built. Inform them that in the upcoming associated activity Let’s Build an Aqueduct! , they will apply what they have learned to design their own mini-aqueducts to transport water from one location to another.\nLesson Background and Concepts for Teachers\nThe arch most commonly used by the Romans in their architecture is called the round or semicircle arch. Roman arches are built by using a support bridge to hold up the stones until the final stone, the keystone, is placed. The keystone spreads the downwards force and enables the arch to support large weights. The semicircle arch is built so that the arch height is exactly half of the arch width. Material must be placed on the sides of the arches because the force acting vertically is redirected horizontally by the arch.\nAlthough these arches were invented and used during Roman times, they still have relevance today. The arch was such a hugely innovative way to build stronger structures using less material that they are often used in modern designs. Arches not only add style to structures, but they also enable structures to support far more weight than other shapes.\n- Let’s Build an Aqueduct! - Students use what they learned about Roman arches from this lesson to build their own model aqueducts that transfer water from one location to another. Given a set of constraints (three-foot water channel distance, number of arches per foot, semicircular arch shape, and slope for ideal water flow), groups design small-size aqueducts and create them with hot glue and wooden cube blocks, including making trigonometric calculations and building their own temporary arch support structures. Then they test them with water.\naqueduct: A bridge structure built to transport water from a point A to a point B.\narcade: A series of adjoining rounded arches.\narch: A curved architectural structure that spans a space and supports the weight it carries.\nkeystone: The central and final stone placed in the arch, located in the top center.\nBasic Calculations: During the introductory class discussion, ask students the following questions. Then make sure all students are able to arrive at the correct answers.\n- Ask student pairs to solve the problem about the slope of the aqueduct mentioned in the video.\n- Ask student pairs to calculate the total drop and angle of the longest aqueduct built (~53 miles).\nResearch Questions 1 & 2: As student pairs are conducting online research to answer questions 1 and 2 on the Arch Research Worksheet, roam around to make sure they are on the right track. Then lead a short class discussion using the question provided in the Introduction/Motivation section to prompt students to describe what they learned online and share their findings. Also refer to the Arch Research Worksheet Answer Key.\nLesson Summary Assessment\nResearch Question 3: To answer question 3 on the Arch Research Worksheet, students continue online research about aqueducts and how they were engineered (not focusing on dates or people’s names). They collect information and then share their findings during a class discussion. Assignment tip: Assigning each student pair a single topic to research from the eight example questions provided on the worksheet often helps to focus the investigations and uncover more information in the end. Student research tip: If students plan to use Wikipedia, which is always a good source of information, tell them to use the source material for Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia page itself. Directing students to find as many sources as possible for their information results in a better discussion at the end. Challenge them to be unique and creative in their searches. You do not want the entire class getting all of its information from the same source because that limits the input and dampens the discussion.\n- Example questions: What materials did the Romans use? What was different about how the Romans held their materials together? How many types of arch designs were you able to find? How did the Romans go through mountains at a constant slope? What sort of formulas did the Romans use in their engineering? How do you apply these formulas? What sorts of other tools did the Romans use? How long would it take to build one of these arches?)\n- Example answers: The Romans typically used concrete and occasionally lead pipe for some sections. Roman concrete used volcanic ash, which made it extremely strong and why some Roman building still stand today. They used formulas to calculate the arch designs. Aqueducts took 1-2 years to finish depending on size. Devices called chorobates and dioptra were used to calculate slopes.

{"question":"I'm interested in almond milk's health benefits and potential risks. What are the main advantages of consuming almond milk as a dairy alternative, and what health concerns should people be aware of regarding allergic reactions?","answer":"Almond milk offers several health benefits as a dairy alternative. It's low in calories (30-60 calories per cup), cholesterol-free, and lacks saturated fats. It's fortified with calcium and vitamins A, D, E, and B12, making it nutritionally comparable to cow's milk. The drink aids in weight loss, strengthens bones, promotes heart health through monosaturated fats, and contains antioxidants that help remove harmful free radicals from the body. Studies have also shown its potential in cancer prevention, particularly for prostate and breast cancer. However, there are important health concerns regarding allergic reactions. Tree nut allergies, including almond allergies, can cause severe reactions known as anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. Symptoms can range from mild (tingling in mouth and lips, facial swelling, red spots) to severe (difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, unconsciousness). According to the American Public Health Association, an estimated 1.8 million Americans have tree nut allergies, and these allergies are among the leading causes of fatal and near-fatal reactions to foods. Additionally, about 90% of diagnosed tree nut allergies are lifelong conditions requiring complete avoidance of nuts.","context":["Almond milk is a drink that is prepared from ground almonds and water. Almond milk has been used for several years as a plant-based alternative to dairy milk. According to Jenny Heap, a registered dietitian with the Almond Board of California, almond milk has been around since the middle ages when noble houses used it as a substitute for dairy milk.\nThe Boston Globe released a report in 2014 indicating that almond milk had even surpassed soy milk as the most popular plant-based milk product on the market.\nIs Almond Milk Dairy?\nAlthough the plant-based drink is called milk, almond milk is not dairy. It is a tasty drink that is prepared from ground almonds and water. The drink is Dairy-free, soy-free, and lactose-free. One may choose to add salts or sweeteners to make it taste better.\nThe commercially prepared almond milk typically has added nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals. Thickening agents, such as carrageenan, which is a seaweed derivative, are added to increase the shelf-life of almond milk. Almond milk can be made at home.\nJenny Heap recommended the following recipe:\n- First, soak almonds in water for one to two days. The water should remain uncovered.\n- After the two days are over, the soaking water should be drained and discarded. The almonds should be rinsed with clean water.\n- The almonds should then be blended on high with two cups of fresh water. After blending, they should be strained well using cheesecloth, which ensures chunks of almonds do not make it into the milk.\n- Finally, one can choose to add vanilla, a sweetener, or cinnamon to taste.\nBoth homemade and commercial almond milk can go bad after some time. The commercial almond milk comes with a use-by date that is indicated on the packaging.\nAccording to Almond Breeze website, commercial almond milk should be used within seven days after opening its packaging. Experts recommend using the homemade almond milk within two days.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Almonds\nAlmond milk has the same nutritional value as super-healthy almonds. However, the almond milk's nutrient level is lower compared to almonds. According to Heap, a one-ounce serving, which needs about 23 almonds to make, provides six grams of proteins and four grams of fibers. Other nutrients include Vitamin E, magnesium, calcium, riboflavin, and potassium.\nIt is not clear the number of almonds that are used to make a quart of almond milk. The number of almonds depends on the brand or the recipe if it is homemade.\nBusiness Insider published an article indicating that the commercial almond milk recipes are similar from brand to brand. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list of ingredients on most commercial brands indicates almonds as the second or third ingredient. The top ingredients include water and sweeteners, which means there are more of those ingredients than the amount of almonds used.\nStudies have revealed that commercial almond milk has larger amounts of calcium and Vitamins A and D compared to whole almonds, as manufacturers fortify the almond milk with those nutrients. The vitamin E that is present in almond milk is also added; the vitamin E from whole almonds does not make its way into the final product.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Cow’s Milk\nThe USDA released a report that showed that almond milk has one gram of proteins per cup compared to cow milk, which has eight grams. Calcium-fortified almond milk contains high levels of calcium compared to that found in cow's milk. However, the levels of calcium found in homemade almond milk are much lower than that in cow milk. Fortified Almond milk has more Vitamins A, D, E, and B12 compared to those found in non-fortified cow’s milk.\nReports also indicate that cow’s milk has more phosphorus content than almond milk, while the plant-based milk has slightly higher sodium levels. The most notable difference between almond milk and cow milk is that almond milk is cholesterol free. It also lacks saturated fats that are present in cow milk.\nAccording to the Washington Post, the fats present in almond milk are good for human consumption. Almond milk is also said to have fewer calories than cow milk.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Soy Milk\nThe nutritional value of almond milk and soy milk tend to be very close. However, almond milk has fewer calories than soy milk. A number of carbohydrates and sugar found in almond milk is also lower than the same variety of soy milk.\nAlmond milk does not contain saturated fats, which are found in soy milk. However, soy milk has more potassium, magnesium, and folate RDA than most almond milk blends.\nAlmond Milk Vs. Coconut Milk\nThe first noticeable difference between coconut milk and almond milk is the caloric content. Unsweetened almond milk can contain a maximum of 60 calories compared to coconut milk which has 400 calories in a single serving.\nAs a result, coconut milk is not a good option for those who are interested in cutting calories consumption.\nAdvantages Of Almond Milk\nAlmond milk is the best option for those who are dairy or lactose intolerant.\nAccording to an article that was published in the Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 75 percent of the global population are at least slightly lactose intolerant, and those people affected may benefit greatly from almond milk.\nAlmond milk is also a good option for vegetarians.\nLow Caloric Content\nAlmond milk is good for calorie-watchers because it only contains between 30 and 60 calories per cup. According to a 2003 study that was published in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders, combining almonds with low-calorie meals can lead to faster weight loss.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, the monosaturated fats that are found in almond milk are good for the heart. According to a 1999 review that was published in Atherosclerosis Reports, substituting almonds for saturated fats led to a reduction in heart disease by 45 percent.\nA good amount of the riboflavin present in whole almonds makes it into almond milk. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B12, has various roles in the body. It aids in the production of new red blood cells. According to the National Institutes Health, riboflavin releases energy from carbohydrates.\nHelps In The Prevention Or Management Of Cancer\nA recent study demonstrated the ability of almond milk to prevent the growth of prostate cancer cells. The monosaturated fats that are present in almond milk may also help in the prevention of endometrial cancer. Researchers have revealed that the consumption of monosaturated fats decreases the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a rare form of cancer that affects the liver.\nResearch that was published in the International Journal of Cancer also demonstrated the ability of almond milk to prevent the development of individual breast cancer markers. The study was also published in the American Association of Cancer Research's Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention materials.\nAlmonds have been found to contain natural compounds that help in cancer prevention. Almond milk contains benzaldehyde, which has been shown to exert an anti-cancer effect. It also offers a high amount of fiber, which may help prevent the development of colon cancer. Other nutrients that help promote the body's health include Vitamin E, folate, phosphorus, and zinc.\nThe folate present in almond milk helps fight against cervical cancer. According to researchers based in Finland, almond milk may also assist in the prevention of lung cancers. According to a study that was conducted by scientists from the University of California, almond milk has a significant impact in the prevention of bowel cancer in rats.\nGood For The Skin\nAlmond milk has been shown to be beneficial for skin, nails, and hair. Although it has a few proteins, its zinc content can help keep the skin healthy and also free of blemishes. Lack of zinc can lead to various ailments such as hair loss.\nVitamin E is also required to protect the skin against damage caused by the ultraviolet rays of the sun and is one of the antioxidants found in almond milk. Vitamin E has an antioxidant property that helps remove harmful free radicals that may lead to the development of cancer.\nMay Help Strengthen The Bones\nDairy products are known to be rich in calcium. Almonds, on the other hand, are poor sources of calcium. To make almond milk more similar to dairy milk, manufacturers often enrich it with calcium.\nOne cup of commercial almond milk may contain approximately 50 percent of RDI. The calcium content in cow milk, on the other hand, ranges between 28-31 percent of the RDI. As a result, fortified almond milk is an excellent source of calcium.\nAlmond milk forms the best alternative source of calcium to individuals who do not consume dairy products, such as vegans. Those who are intolerant to lactose or allergic to cow milk can also benefit from almond milk. The calcium mineral is essential for the growth and maintenance of bones. As a result, an adequate intake of almond milk reduces the risks that are associated with the development of osteoporosis, which is more prevalent in women.\nWeak bones and fractures characterize the musculoskeletal condition.\nAids In Weight Loss\nThe low caloric content in almond milk makes it the best diet option for cutting weight. The number of calories found in almond milk range between 40 and 60, compared to goat milk, which has 168 calories per serving.\nAlmond milk is a standard component of diets that encourage the consumption of healthy fats, such as the ketogenic diet. Other low-carb diets often encourage people to include almond milk in their diet.\nBesides the low caloric content that is associated with almond milk, the plant-based milk minimally affects the blood sugar concentration. It is good for individuals who are watching their blood sugar levels. The nutrients that are present in almond milk are used by the body to create energy instead of being stored as fats.\nHelps In The Removal Of Free Radicals From The Body\nAlmond milk is rich in Vitamin E, which is known as a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants help in the fight against free radicals that are caused by chemicals present in food and sun exposure.\nIt is advisable to eat antioxidants to help prevent oxidative damage that may result from the buildup of these free radicals. Almonds are one of the common sources of Vitamin E.\nBy consuming a significant amount of almond milk, the body acquires sufficient amounts of Vitamin E, which aids the body in the fight against diseases that result from the free radicals.\nPromotes A Healthy Cardiovascular System\nAccording to observational studies, a daily consumption of nuts is linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. Nuts are rich in Vitamin E and healthy fats, which help promote a healthy heart. Almonds are also rich in Vitamin E.\nThe vitamin is believed to be responsible for various health benefits of almond milk. Vitamin E protects the lipids against oxidation, and they also reduce the levels of oxidized LDL cholesterol, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\nAlmond oil has been shown to contain one percent oil by weight. Approximately, 90 percent of the oil is unsaturated. The fatty acid profile of almond oil is 69 percent oleic acid, 17 percent linoleic acid, and 8 percent palmitic acid. The oleic acid, which is the primary fatty acid in almond milk, is associated with beneficial changes in blood lipids.\nAccording to a study that was performed on healthy adults, a daily consumption of almond milk over a period of six weeks lowered the levels of bad cholesterol in the body by six percent. The blood levels of triglycerides were also reduced by 14 percent, while the levels of good cholesterol were raised by six percent.\nSlows The Progression Of Alzheimer’s Disease\nAlthough Alzheimer's disease does not have any cure, there are natural ways that can be used to prevent or slow the progression of the disorder. Vitamin E that is found in almond milk helps slow down the degeneration that is common in Alzheimer's disease.\nAlmond milk is high in Vitamin A, which is essential for proper functioning of the eyes. Vitamin A has been shown to prevent the development of age-related macular degeneration. It also has antioxidant properties that help protect the eyes from free radical damage.\nHistory & Other Interesting Facts About Almond Milk\nAlmond milk has been in existence since the medieval times. During the Middle Ages, cow milk was not a reliable source of nutrition. One of the reasons to why cow milk was not popular was because it spoiled quickly in the absence of a refrigerator.\nMany Christians did not take cow milk during the Lenten season, which is the period of 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday. During this time, the recipes that included milk were less regarded.\nAlmonds give a more reliable amount of milk compared to cows. Another advantage of almond milk is the fact that it has a longer shelf life than cow milk. Its high-fat content made it possible to churn almond milk into plant-based butter during the Lenten period. Besides the beneficial fatty contents, many healthcare providers during the Middle Ages praised almond milk for its several health benefits.\nThe health care providers prescribed almond milk to their patients to improve their sexual health through increasing sperm production. According to folklore, the consumption of almonds a night before drinking helped to reduce drunkenness.\nDuring the modern times, the popularity of almonds declined due to their low nutritional value compared to cow milk. However, facts have shown that these claims were exaggerated. The popularity of almond milk started to rise again in the early 2000s after some of the drawbacks of soy milk became more widely understood.\nAlmond milk surpassed soy milk in the health sector in the year 2013. In 2014, the almond milk accounted for 60 percent of total sales of plant-based milk. Currently, almond milk accounts for approximately 4.1 percent of overall milk sales in the United States.\nWho Should Not Use Almond Milk?\nIndividuals Who Are Allergic To Tree Nuts\nAlthough almond milk may not contain a lot of almonds, the amount available is sufficient to set off an allergic reaction for those who are allergic to almonds. An almond allergy is categorized as a tree nut allergy, including walnuts, cashew nuts, and Brazil nuts.\nAccording to the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, tree nut allergies may lead to anaphylaxis, which is a severe allergic reaction.\nSymptoms that may present with an almond allergic reaction include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nasal congestion. The patient may also present with other symptoms such as nausea, shortness of breath, and itching.\nAs the popularity of almond grows, more parents are tempted to give it to their infants. Research studies have revealed that this can actually have toxic effects.\nAccording to a study that is found in the French Journal, infants who were given the plant-based milk presented with the signs of edema, hypoalbuminemia, and protein-calorie malnutrition.\nOther effects include iron-deficiency anemia, Vitamin D deficiency, and low growth rate. The article discourages the administration of the plant-based milk to infants.\nRisks Associated With Almond Milk\nSome almond milk products contain carrageenan, which is a controversial thickener that is derived from seaweed. It is commonly included in many products to provide texture, such as in ice-cream.\nAccording to a study that was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, carrageenan is a leading cause of inflammation and inflammatory bowel diseases. The natural compound is also associated with colorectal malignancy.\nIt is advisable to check the labels on the almond milk packaging to confirm that the brand chosen does not contain carrageenan.\nBecause nut allergies are common, an individual who is susceptible to almond allergies should not drink almond milk.\nThere have been reports of children developing kidney stones due to excessive consumption of almond milk. The kidney stones are as a result of oxalate compounds, which are found in almonds.\nIt is advisable to give children almond milk in moderation. Almond milk can be substituted with coconut milk or goat milk to prevent the buildup of oxalate compounds in the body.\nNutritional Benefits Of Almond Milk Conclusion\nAlmond milk is easy to make at home. It is derived from soaked and blended almonds. However, the plant-based milk contains fewer nutrients compared to whole almonds. But still, there are other factors that make almond milk a desirable component of a diet.\nAlmond milk is the best alternative to dairy milk when one intends to eat a low-carb diet. The nutrients that are found in almond milk are associated with several health benefits. Almond milk contains natural compounds that help prevent the development of cancer.\nStudies have shown that the consumption of the plant-based milk can help avoid the development of prostate and breast cancer. Other health benefits of almond milk include the provision of healthy bones and muscles.\nAlmond milk may also aide in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disorder. The consumption of almond milk is also associated with faster weight loss, as its low calorie and carbohydrates count per serving make it suitable for weight loss.\nAlmond milk has been used since the ancient times as an ingredient in recipes. The popularity of almond milk has grown due to the desire of many individuals to find an alternative to cow milk.\nIt is advisable to try a homemade almond milk before going for the commercial ones. One can also choose start with the organic, unsweetened almond milk that is free from carrageenan.","- Food and Cooking»\n- Food Safety»\n- Food Allergies\nNut Allergy - What is Nut Allergy and What Causes Nut Allergy\nNuts are classified as fruits, in their appearance they are hard shelled and contain seeds, even though the seeds are not exposed as the nuts are opened or cracked. Biologically they are described as indehiscent fruit of plants. Botany describes nuts as dry fruits which contain one and sometimes two, seeds. When a nut becomes mature, its outermost area is said to be stony or hard. These fruits are high in oil content which makes them a great source of energy, they are said to be a nutrition powerhouse.\n“They are low in sodium and rich in fiber; contain a significant amount of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids and provide the minerals magnesium, potassium and calcium; and contain antioxidants, foliate, vitamin E and plant sterols.” (Nuts: Anti-atherogenic Food? By Alexiadou Kleopatra)\nSome common types of nuts are:\n6. Pine nuts\n9. Macadamia nuts\n10. Brazil nuts\n12. Gingko nuts\n13. Hickory nuts\nWhat is a Nut allergy?\nNut allergy or tree nut allergy is a common type of food allergy in which there is an overreaction of the immune system due to the consumption of the nuts. The body’s immune system usually fights infection, but its overreaction to a substance called allergen, causes this problem. This form of allergy is most common and affects millions of people worldwide. The most allergic reaction is caused by Walnuts and cashews in the nut family. Statistics say that at least 90 percent of children (or people) diagnosed with tree nut allergies will have them for life, and this will require them to zero the consumption of those nuts in their lifetime.\nAccording to American Public Health Association (APHA), “An estimated 1.8 million Americans have an allergy to tree nuts. Allergic reactions to tree nuts are among the leading causes of fatal and near-fatal reactions to foods.”\nCauses of Nut allergy\nThe main cause of nut allergy is simply the exposure of the dry fruit to a person who has the allergy to begin with. Some people feel a reaction coming on when they have been exposed to just one nut, and sometimes people do not feel the reaction coming on until they have exposed to two or more nuts. Whereas some people have an reaction just by standing next to a tree nut which is being consumed by another person. As we will discuss below (see Nut allergy reaction), the severity of the reaction depends upon an individual.\nTechnically speaking, when we consume a tree nut (or nut), there are proteins that are present in nuts that trigger a release of histamine. Histamine is the chemical (neuron-transmitter) your body produces when you're having an allergic reaction. So, we can say Histamine is released to counteract the effect. Even though the protein that is being consumed is not necessarily bad for us, our body perceives it to be bad and so allergic reaction to nuts is what we are actually having as a reaction to the histamine that is being released.\nSymptoms of Nut allergy\nSymptoms of the nut allergy can be divided in to symptoms of mild reaction and symptoms of severe reaction.\nOf mild reaction:\n· Mouth and lips begin to tingle.\n· Swelling of the face\n· Red spots\n· Stomachache or diarrhea\n· Urticaria (nettle rash or hives).\n· A feeling of tightness around your throat. (like throat closing up)\n· Itchy, watery, red or swollen eyes.\nOf severe reaction\nMild reaction symptoms prevail but they are also accompanied by the following:\n· Difficulty breathing like an asthma-like attack would feel like, or swelling around your throat, trouble breathing\n· “A sense of impending doom.”\nMedically there is a dilation (opening up) of the blood vessels in the body, which can cause:\n· Redness of your skin\n· A fast heart rate\n· Low blood pressure.\nWhich is why it is important to immediately to go the emergency room as soon as these symptoms begin to show.\nNut allergy reaction\nA severe reaction to nuts is called anaphylaxis, and it can be life threatening. Though the reaction to the nut allergy varies from person to person, this reaction is very dangerous and if the person experiencing it does not get medical attention right away, they can become faint or unconscious or may get even worse, some people even die. It is also important to remember that nut allergic reaction may come back a second time after few hours, so doctors recommend for patients to remain in hospital after the first reaction.\nAnaphylaxis can start off as completely mild symptoms but quickly progress in to symptoms like; having trouble breathing or feeling lightheaded like you are going to pass out or swelling all over the body. There are also gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping)\nHow to prevent nut allergy?\nNut allergy can be prevented by taking an active role in determining the ingredients of the type of food one eats. For example, by checking the labels of different foods before buying or consuming is a good idea.\nEducating oneself about the different types of nuts and foods containing them is always handy; make sure one is aware of the hidden ingredients in different cuisines. Family and friends always play a big role in one’s life, make sure they are aware of the allergies and know what to do in case of a reaction, like carry injectable epinephrine at all times.\nIs coconut a nut?\nSince October 2006, the FDA identifies coconut as a tree nut (for labeling purposes), even though there are very little incidents of coconut allergic reactions every year in people with allergies to tree nuts. Coconut contains the seed of a drupaceous fruit and doctors do not restrict their intake for tree nuts allergies.\n“Coconut allergies are exceedingly rare, with fewer than 10 reported cases” (Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network)\nThe Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) does not recognize coconut as a nut. There is controversy to whether coconut is a fruit, seed or a nut. Botanists, doctors and people with tree nut allergies each have their own opinions whether it is safe to consume coconut for a person with tree nut allergies.\nAccording to (FAAN),”Coconut is difficult to classify, and even botanists frequently disagree on its classification. The most accepted theory is that coconuts are classified as dry drupes. While it is possible to be allergic to coconut, the cross reactivity for those with tree nut allergies is very rare.”\nSome insect bites can be mistaken as nut allergy. You should be well aware of your local habitat and carry out precautionary measures accordingly. Nut allergies can be life threatening so make sure that you are fully aware of people around you that are sensitive to any kind of nuts."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1f15e4a7-bff9-4377-84e3-043a083a9f03>","<urn:uuid:4125e889-f9ce-4af0-9216-d248cc9bdc69>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my research paper necesito comparar the therapeutic approach of virus-based cancer treatments versus CAR T-cell therapy - how do these two immunotherapy methods differ in their mechanism of action?","answer":"These treatments work through fundamentally different mechanisms. Virus-based therapy (like RP2) works in two ways: it directly invades and bursts cancer cells, while also activating the immune system. In contrast, CAR T-cell therapy involves removing T cells from a patient, genetically modifying them in the lab to target specific cancers, and then infusing them back into the patient. The virus therapy is an off-the-shelf treatment that can be administered directly, while CAR T-cell therapy must be customized for each patient. CAR T-cell therapy is primarily tested for leukemia and lymphoma, while virus therapy has shown promise across various advanced cancers including esophageal cancer and eye cancer.","context":["By Michelle Roberts\nDigital wellness editor\nA caller benignant of crab therapy that uses a communal microorganism to infect and destruct harmful cells is showing large committedness successful aboriginal quality trials, accidental UK scientists.\nOne patient's crab vanished, portion others saw their tumours shrink.\nThe cause is simply a weakened signifier of the acold sore microorganism - herpes simplex - that has been modified to termination tumours.\nLarger and longer studies volition beryllium needed, but experts accidental the injection mightiness yet connection a lifeline to much radical with precocious cancers.\nKrzysztof Wojkowski, a 39-year-old builder from westbound London, is 1 of the patients who took portion successful the ongoing signifier 1 information trial, tally by the Institute of Cancer Research astatine the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.\nHe was diagnosed successful 2017 with crab of the salivary glands, adjacent the mouth.

Advances are spawning hundreds of clinical trials nationwide and generating intense interest from patients, physicians and investors. Yet researchers say the treatments, for now, help only a minority of patients. And they remember the past anti-cancer efforts that fizzled after initially showing promise — which explains why they say daunting hurdles and years of perseverance are still ahead.\nHere’s a primer about the new treatments and how they work:\nWhat is cancer immunotherapy?\nImmunotherapy is a significantly different approach from conventional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. The latter attack the malignancy itself, while immunotherapy aims to empower the immune system to kill it.\nBecause of the immune system’s unique power, says the nonprofit Cancer Research Institute, this therapy could prove a formidable weapon against many kinds of cancer and offer long-term protection with reduced side effects.\nWhich immunotherapies are sparking excitement?\nTwo types of immunotherapy are drawing most of the interest: checkpoint inhibitors, which remove “brakes” from the immune system, allowing it to see and go after cancer; and CAR T-cell therapy, which involves a more personalized attack.\n“Checkpoint” inhibitors are designed to block the ability of certain proteins to weaken the response of the immune system so it can’t recognize and go after abnormal cells. In normal times, such checkpoint proteins keep the immune system from being too aggressive and damaging the body. But cancer sometimes hijacks them and uses them to suppress the immune system’s response to disease.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has cleared four checkpoint inhibitors for adults: Yervoy, also known as ipilimumab; Keytruda, or pembrolizumab; Opdivo, or nivolumab, and Tecentriq, or atezolizumab. The drugs are approved for malignancies including melanoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as lung, kidney and bladder cancer. The treatments also are being tested in a wide range of other cancers.\nFormer president Jimmy Carter was treated with Keytruda, surgery and radiation for advanced melanoma last year. He announced in December that all signs of his cancer had disappeared.\nIn CAR T-cell therapy, T cells — a key part of the immune system — are removed from a patient, genetically modified in the lab to target a specific cancer and infused back into the person. This treatment, available only in clinical trials, is being tested mainly for leukemia and lymphoma. The FDA is likely to approve the first CAR T-cell treatment next year or in 2018.\nOf these two immunotherapy approaches, most of the interest is focused on checkpoint inhibitors. That’s because they are off-the-shelf treatments that are much easier to administer than CAR T-cell therapy, which is customized to every patient, said Crystal Mackall, a former National Cancer Institute researcher who’s now leading immunotherapy trials for Stanford University School of Medicine.\nWhat are the latest developments?\nSome of the biggest news involves the use of Keytruda in lung cancer, which kills almost 160,000 Americans a year. In an international trial invoving the most common type of the disease, the drug outperformed chemotherapy for patients with high levels of a protein, called PD-L1, on their cancer cells.\nAt one year, for example, 70 percent of the patients in the Keytruda group were alive, compared with 54 percent of the chemo group, researchers said in October. The Keytruda group also experienced significantly fewer side effects. Based on the trial, the FDA approved the drug as a first-line treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and a high level of the protein. That was the first time that an immunotherapy drug got the green light as an initial treatment for lung cancer.\n“It’s a significant breakthrough,” said Neal Ready, an oncologist at the Duke Cancer Institute. “We’re starting to see people with advanced lung cancer who are alive at a year or two years or three years.”\nWhat are some of the main challenges in immunotherapy?\nAmong the biggest challenges are increasing the response rate among patients and turning initial responses into long-lasting remissions. CAR T-cell therapy often produces a high remission rate in blood-disorder trials, but a significant percentage of patients relapse.\nCheckpoint inhibitors induce responses — a tumor is shrunk or stabilized — in an average of just about 20 percent of patients, said oncologist Elizabeth Jaffee, the deputy director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Hopkins. The percentage is higher in some cancers, and researchers need to understand why, for example, the treatment benefits patients with melanoma but not pancreatic cancer. They think the key to improving effectiveness will be the development of combination treatments, as happened with AIDS. Jaffee points out that the tide was turned against that disease only after researchers figured out how to use a “cocktail” of medications to keep people with HIV from contracting AIDS.\nNationwide, hundreds of combination trials are underway. They involve the use of two or more checkpoint inhibitors, a checkpoint inhibitor with CAR T-cell therapy or an immunotherapy plus such standard treatments as radiation and chemotherapy. But combining these treatments can increase safety risks.\nJill O’Donnell-Tormey, chief executive of the Cancer Research Institute, said researchers also are trying to understand tumors’ “micro-environments,” which contain cells and other elements that appear to sometimes suppress the immune system’s response to cancer. She made her remarks at a conference this year in New York that was sponsored by the institute, along with the American Association for Cancer Research and two European groups.\nWhat are immunotherapy’s downsides?\nBy revving up the immune system, immunotherapy can cause sometimes serious damage to healthy tissue and organs. Researchers are working on ways to limit or even reverse the potential toxicity, but much work needs to be done.\nCAR T-cell therapy poses two types of safety risks. Almost all patients get sick with flulike symptoms, including high fever and pain, a week or so after the treatment; some end up in intensive care. The treatment also can cause brain swelling that can be fatal.\nYet standard treatments have major side effects as well. Chemotherapy and radiation, when used for children with leukemia, can cause long-term problems such as secondary cancers, infertility and heart damage. In many ways, researchers say, immunotherapy is less toxic over the long term.\nImmunotherapy can carry higher price tags. For example, Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda, costs about $150,000 a year. Once CAR T-cell therapies are approved by the FDA, they may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, according to some analysts. If the treatments are used as directed by the agency, chances are good that insurance will pay for at least some of that.\nDoes immunotherapy work for children?\nImmunotherapy in kids is a mixed picture.\nCheckpoint inhibitors are only now being tested extensively in children, so it will take time to see how well they work. But very early-stage studies suggest that they may not be as effective as in adults. One theory holds that these drugs work better in cancers with many mutations — and pediatric cancers tend to have many fewer mutations.\nCAR T-cell treatment, on the other hand, is being widely tested in children and has shown impressive effectiveness against the most common childhood leukemia, called acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\nHow do I find immunotherapy treatments?\nTalk first to your doctor, who should be able to help you find appropriate medication or clinical trials for unapproved treatment. Trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute can be found at trials.cancer.gov. Studies also are listed on the website ClinicalTrials.gov — though that doesn’t signify government endorsement or approval.

In Finland, as demonstrated by the OSTP case in Jakobstad, businesses actively accommodate multiple languages - for example, their ABB Service Crane Center employs staff speaking both Swedish and Finnish to satisfy all customer requests, and even technical documentation is provided in both languages. Hungarian, on the other hand, presents significant challenges as it is completely unrelated to surrounding Indo-European languages and has complex features including up to 238 possible forms for nouns.

At that time Jakobstad was on one of the most important shipping routes in the west of Finland and thus it comes as no surprise that shipbuilding and tar production dominated the local economy. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century the local economy saw further rise when a steam-operated sawmill and a tobacco company were being built. Today Jakobstad’s economy is dominated by companies in the timber and paper industries, by shipbuilding, and by companies in the metal industry: The OSTP (www.ostp.biz) is a manufacturer of stainless steel tubes, today in major part owned by Italian Tubinoxia and the minor owner is Outokumpu. With their 220+ staff they are one of the biggest and most important employers in Jakobstad, or Pietarsaari if you prefer.\nOSTP is expanding\nWhen OSTP were expanding their production facilities they needed an efficient solution for their material flow: the steel coils weighing up to 26 tonnes needed moving from the unloading area to their destination in the production. Several ABUS EOT cranes were already in operation in OSTP’s production plant. A solution favored at first involved forklift trucks, however, this was soon discarded in favor of an ABUS EOT crane. This crane is now going to be used for several steps within the manufacturing process: at first the coils will be unloaded from the trucks and transported to the stock area. When the coils are removed from the stock area they are then transferred to the uncoiler of the sheet metal slitting line.\nThe ABUS EOT crane solution with added benefits\nABB Service Crane Centre (www.abb.com/fi), the Finish agent of the ABUS Kransysteme GmbH, installed a double girder EOT crane ZLK with a load capacity of 32 tonnes and a span of 17.2 metres in the expanded production plant of OSTP in addition to the ABUS EOT cranes already in operation. The hoist used on this crane is a normal version double rail trolley of the DB type with walkway, i.e. it is very easy to reach the hoist for service and maintenance purposes. The hoist features a C-hook with counterweight to receive the coils. The crane also features crane lighting to give the best possible illumination in the unloading zone to provide additional safety. The crane is operated in a half-open building when unloading the coils. Therefore the drives of the crane as well as the panel have additional heating to allow save and trouble-free operation of the crane even in winter time with temperatures well below zero. The crane girder and the travel drives are also protected by a special paint system and canopies to better resist the inclement weather conditions. The crane operator controls the crane via radio remote control. The load on the hook is displayed via a large load display well visible form greater distances and quick and easy to read by the operator.\nThe bilingualism of the area around Jakobstad is also reflected on the crane: the lettering required for cranes operated by radio remote control is written both in Swedish and in Finnish. The crane documentation has been supplied in both languages as well. Apart from good references through prior deliveries of ABUS cranes, the success of this sale might have been thanks to the fact that the sales team of ABB Service Crane Center includes staff speaking Swedish and Finish which enables them to satisfy all their customers’ requests.","Learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture. Without the ability to communicate and understand a culture on its own terms, true access to that culture is barred. In a world where nations and peoples are ever more dependent upon on another to supply goods and services, solve political disputes, and ensure international security, understanding other cultures is paramount. Lack of intercultural sensitivity can lead to mistrust and misunderstandings, to an inability to cooperate, negotiate, and compromise, and perhaps even to military confrontation.\nExtremely Hard: The hardest language to learn is: Polish\nPolish is a West Slavic language and the official language of Poland. Its written standard is the Polish alphabet which corresponds basically to the Latin alphabet with a few additions. Polish-speakers use the language in a uniform manner through most of Poland. It is also used as a second language in some parts of Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. This phenomenon is caused by migrations. There are only a few dialects that differ from the standard Polish language, however the differences among them are not significant and mostly based on regional pronunciation and vocabulary changes. The most distinguishable are the dialects of Silesia and Podhale (highlander’s dialect). Worth mentioning is Kashubian – a separate language used by the inhabitants living west of Gdansk near the Baltic Sea. The number of its users is estimated at somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000. Although it is gradually becoming extinct, a lot of effort is being put into saving it and it recently begun to be taught at local schools as a minority language. Polish, like other Indo-European languages, shares some Latin grammar and vocabulary. There are 3 tenses (past, present, future), 2 numbers (singular and plural), and 3 genders (masculine, feminine, neuter). There are no articles but Polish, like Latin, and is an inflectional language that distinguishes 7 cases, defining the noun usage in a sentence. This feature makes our mother tongue difficult to master and presents a lot of trouble to foreigners. The average Polish speaker is fluent in their language not until age 16.\nVery Hard: Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian-These languages are hard because of the countless noun cases. However, the cases are more like English prepositions added to the end of the root.\nFinnish is one of the official languages of Finland and an official minority language in Sweden. In Sweden, both standard Finnish and Meänkieli, a Finnish dialect, are spoken. The Kven language, which is closely related to Finnish, is an official minority language in Norway. Finnish belongs to the Baltic-Finnic branch of the Finno-Ugric languages, being most closely related to Estonian, Livonian, Votic, Karelian, Veps, and Ingrian. Characteristic phonological features include vowel harmony, in which vowels are divided into two contrasting classes such that vowels from opposing classes may not occur together in a word; and consonant gradation, in which stop consonants (such as p, t, k) are altered before closed syllables (e.g., p is replaced by v, pp by p). There are also two lengths distinguished in vowels and in consonants. Many words have been borrowed from Indo-European languages, particularly from the Baltic languages, German, and Russian. Finnish dialects are divided into two distinct groups, the Western dialects and the Eastern dialects.\nHungarian is a Finno-Ugric language, distantly related to Finnish and Estonian. It is the largest member of the Finno-Ugric family of languages, spoken by about 10 million people in Hungary and 4.5 million in countries adjacent to Hungary and around the world. It is an “agglutinating” language, i.e., a language that uses large numbers of suffixes and post-positions. It belongs to the Finno-Ugric language family, which includes Finnish and Estonian, but its closest relatives are several obscure languages spoken in Siberia. Hungarian is not at all related to the Indo-European languages which surround it, and is very different both in vocabulary and in grammar. Hungarian is an agglutinative language, meaning that it relies heavily on suffixes and prefixes. The grammar is seemingly complex, yet there is no gender, a feature that most English speakers grapple with when learning other European languages. Hungarian is a highly inflected language in which nouns can have up to 238 possible forms. It is related to Mansi, an Ob-Ugric language with about 4,000 speakers who live in the eastern Urals, and Khanty or Ostyak, the other Ob-Ugric language which is spoken by about 15,000 people in the Ob valley of western Siberia.\nEstonian is the official language of Estonia, spoken by about 1.1 million people in Estonia and tens of thousands in various émigré communities. It is an Uralic language and is closely related to Finnish. Even the most ordinary everyday Estonian language contains numerous ancient expressions, possibly going back as far as the Ice Age. The language occurs in two major dialectal forms, northern and southern; the northern dialect, Tallinn, is used in most of the country and forms the basis of the modern literary language. The southern dialect is found from Tartu southward. Typologically, Estonian represents a transitional form from an agglutinating language to an inflected language. In Estonian nouns and pronouns do not have grammatical gender, but nouns and adjectives are declined in fourteen cases: nominative, genitive, partitive, illative, inessive, elative, allative, adessive, ablative, translative, terminative, essive, abessive, and comitative, with the case and number of the adjective(s) always agreeing with that of the noun. Thus the illative for “a yellow house” (kollane maja) – “into a yellow house” is (kollasesse majasse). The verbal system is characterized by the absence of the future tense (the present tense is used) and by the existence of special forms to express an action performed by an undetermined subject (the “impersonal”).\nPretty Hard: Ukrainian and Russian complex grammar and different alphabet but easier pronunciation. Serbian-Also similar to other Slavic languages with a complex case and gender system, but it also has many tenses. alphabet\nUkrainian is a language of the East Slavic subgroup of the Slavic languages. It is the official state language of Ukraine. Written Ukrainian uses the Cyrillic alphabet. The alphabet comprises thirty-three letters, representing thirty-eight phonemes (meaningful units of sound), and an additional sign—the apostrophe. Ukrainian orthography is based on the phonemic principle, with one letter generally corresponding to one phoneme, although there are a number of exceptions. The orthography also has cases where the semantic, historical, and morphological principles are applied. The letter ? represents two consonants [?t?]. The combination of [j] with some of the vowels is also represented by a single letter ([ja]=?, [je]=?, [ji]=?, [ju]=?), while [jo]=?? and the rare regional [j?]=?? are written using two letters. These iotated vowel letters and a special soft sign change a preceding consonant from hard to soft. An apostrophe is used to indicate the hardness of the sound in the cases when normally the vowel would change the consonant to soft; in other words, it functions like the yer in the Russian alphabet. A consonant letter is doubled to indicate that the sound is doubled, or long. The phonemes [dz] and [d?] do not have dedicated letters in the alphabet and are rendered with the digraphs ?? and ??, respectively. [dz] is pronounced close to English dz in adze, [d?] is close to g in huge.\nRussian is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia, the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages, and the largest native language in Europe. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of three living members of the East Slavic languages, the others being Belarusian and Ukrainian (and possibly Rusyn, normally considered a dialect of Ukrainian). Russian is written using a modified version of the Cyrillic (?????????) alphabet, consisting of 33 letters. Russian spelling is reasonably phonetic in practice. It is in fact a balance among phonetics, morphology, etymology, and grammar, and, like that of most living languages, has its share of inconsistencies and controversial points. The Russian language possesses five vowels, which are written with different letters depending on whether or not the preceding consonant is palatalized. The consonants typically come in plain vs. palatalized pairs, which are traditionally called hard and soft. (The ‘hard’ consonants are often velarized, some dialects only velarize /l/ in such positions). The standard language, based on the Moscow dialect, possesses heavy stress and moderate variation in pitch. Stressed vowels are somewhat lengthened, while unstressed vowels (except /u/) tend to be reduced to an unclear schwa. Russian is notable for its distinction based on palatalization of most of the consonants. The spoken language has been influenced by the literary, but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features, some of which are archaisms or descendants of old forms since discarded by the literary language. The total number of words in Russian is difficult to reckon because of the ability to agglutinate and create manifold compounds, diminutives, etc.\nSerbian is a South Slavic language, spoken chiefly in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia, and in the Serbian diaspora. Standard Serbian is based on the Shtokavian dialect, like the modern Croatian and Bosnian, with which it is mutually intelligible, and was previously unified with under the standard known as Serbo-Croatian. Uses primarily Cyrillic, but also the Latin alphabet as well. Serbian verbs are one of the most complicated parts of Serbian grammar (with noun cases, probably, being the hardest). They are inflected for person, number and sometimes gender. Serbian verbs are conjugated in 4 past tenses – perfect, aorist, imperfect, and pluperfect, of which the last two have a very limited use (imperfect is still used in some dialects, but majority of native Serbian speakers consider it archaic); 1 future tense (aka 1st future tense – as opposed to the 2nd future tense or the future exact, which is considered a tense of the conditional mood by some contemporary linguists), and 1 present tense. These are the tenses of the indicative mood. Apart from the indicative mood, there is also the imperative mood. The conditional mood has two more tenses, the 1st conditional (commonly used in conditional clauses, both for possible and impossible conditional clauses), and the 2nd conditional (without use in spoken language – it should be used for impossible conditional clauses). Serbian language has active and passive voice. As for the non-finite verb forms, Serbian language has 1 infinitive, 2 adjectival participles (the active and the passive), and 2 adverbial participles (the present and the past).\nFairly Hard: Chinese and Japanese-No cases, no genders, no tenses, no verb changes, short words, very easy grammar, however, writing is hard. But to speak it is very easy. Also intonations make it harder but certainly not harder than Polish pronunciation. I know a Chinese language teacher that says people pick up Chinese very easy, but he speaks several languages and could not learn Polish. I am learning some Chinese, it is not the hardest language maybe even the easiest language to learn. Not the hardest language by any measure. Try to learn some Chinese and Polish your self and you will see which is the hardest language.\nChinese languages – also called Sinitic languages – are a principal language group of eastern Asia which belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family. All varieties of modern Chinese are analytic languages, in that they depend on syntax (word order and sentence structure) rather than morphology—i.e., changes in form of a word—to indicate the word’s function in a sentence. In other words, Chinese has few grammatical inflections—it possesses no tenses, no voices, no numbers (singular, plural; though there are plural markers, for example for personal pronouns), and only a few articles (i.e., equivalents to “the, a, an” in English). There is, however, a gender difference in the written language (? as “he” and ? as “she”), but it should be noted that this is a relatively new introduction to the Chinese language in the twentieth century. They make heavy use of grammatical particles to indicate aspect and mood. In Mandarin Chinese, this involves the use of particles like le ?, hai ?, yijing ??, etc. Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of serial verb construction, pronoun dropping and the related subject dropping.\nJapanese is believed to be linked to the Altaic language family, which includes Turkish, Mongolian and other languages, but also shows similarities to Austronesian languages like Polynesian. The Japanese writing system consists of three different character sets: Kanji (several thousands of Chinese characters) and Hiragana and Katakana (two syllabaries of 46 characters each; together called Kana). Japanese texts can be written in two ways: In Western style, i.e. in horizontal rows from the top to the bottom of the page, or in traditional Japanese style, i.e. in vertical columns from the right to the left side of the page. Both writing styles exist side by side today. Basic Japanese grammar is relatively simple. Complicating factors such as gender articles and distinctions between plural and singular are missing almost completely. Conjugation rules for verbs and adjectives are simple and almost free of exceptions. Nouns are not declinated at all, but appear always in the same form. The biggest difficulty are accents, which do exist, but to a much lower extent than in the Chinese language. In addition, there are relatively many homonyms, i.e. words that are pronounced the same way, but have different meanings.\nAverage: French-lots of tenses but not used and moderate grammar.\nFrench is a Romance language globally spoken by about 77 million people as a first language (mother tongue), by 50 million as a second language, and by about another 200 million people as an acquired foreign language, with significant speakers in 57 countries. French is a moderately inflected language. Nouns and most pronouns are inflected for number (singular or plural); adjectives, for the number and gender (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; personal pronouns, for person, number, gender, and case; and verbs, for mood, tense, and the person and number of their subjects. French has a grammar similar to that of the other Romance languages. The French grammar provides definitions and links to further information about each of the French verb tenses, pronouns, and other grammatical structures.\nBasic to hard: English, no cases or gender, you hear it everywhere, spelling can be hard and British tenses you can use the simple and continues tense instead of the perfect tenses and you will speak American English. English at the basic level is easy but to speak it like a native it’s hard because of the dynamic idiomatic nature.\nEnglish is a West Germanic language that developed in England during the Anglo-Saxon era. English grammar has minimal inflection compared with most other Indo-European languages. For example, Modern English, unlike Modern German or Dutch and the Romance languages, lacks grammatical gender and adjectival agreement. Case marking has almost disappeared from the language and mainly survives in pronouns. At the same time, the language has become more analytic, and has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:02d19e26-a8df-4144-b318-e43ea2c9580a>","<urn:uuid:53e8e1fc-2a6f-40dc-8de7-c7cc87b7e2a4>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Could you explain what happened during John Rose's 'creative hiatus' and how it affected his career?","answer":"John Rose was born in London and emigrated to South Africa with his parents in 1940, where several of his compositions were performed. He then experienced a long creative hiatus until 1993, when he resumed composition after returning to the UK. During this period, he worked in education and as a choral conductor. After resuming composition, he produced significant works including two string quartets and several piano pieces between 1997-2001.","context":["John ROSE (b.1928)\nString Quartets and Piano Works\nString Quartet No. 1 Op. 14 (1997) [21:09]\nPrelude and Fugue Op. 20a (2001) [4:51]\nPrelude and Two Fugues Op. 20b (2001) [10:50]\nEssay on DSCH Op. 7 (1970) [11:13]\nString Quartet No. 2 Op. 17 (1999) [26:06]\nThe Edinburgh Quartet\nRobert Melling (piano)\nrec.

The booklet tells us that John Rose was born in London and emigrated to South Africa with his parents in 1940. Several of his compositions were performed there, before “a long creative hiatus” that lasted until he resumed composition in 1993. He has also worked in education and as a choral conductor. The booklet also provides useful information on the artists, as well as notes on the music by John Rose himself. These are short, pithy commentaries indicating, in the main, the motifs from which the music is constructed, and the interrelation between the works presented and others in his catalogue. This approach is much to be preferred to the impenetrable philosophical theses we sometimes encounter, and even more so to the trite, effusively personal confessions now becoming common, but even so, in his brevity, he does the listener few favours. In addition, he did not want the different sections of each of the string quartets banded separately, and whilst this undoubtedly preserves the integrity of each work – they are both played without a break – a CD is often used as a study tool, and would certainly be useful in this case, and presenting twenty-six minutes of closely argued music in a single flow is not the best way to initiate the listener.\nThe programme is made up of three piano works plus two string quartets. The earliest music on the disc is the Essay on DSCH. (There is a little confusion in the booklet notes, one of the essays suggesting that the work was composed after 1993.) There is nothing in the composer’s description to suggest that this is in any way a tribute to Shostakovich. Instead, it would appear that a motif from an earlier work struck him as similar to Shostakovich’s musical cipher, prompting the composition of this work. The piece is sonorous and gritty by turns, extremely well written for the piano in a style that will evoke Tippett in some listeners’ minds. There are moments of drama, and the piece closes with a lengthy, tranquil coda closing on a sonorous chord of A major. It is a compelling work to which one wants to return, but a certain emotional aridity will limit its attractiveness to some. This impression is confirmed in the first of the two sets of Preludes and Fugues for piano that share an opus number. Here, in spite of its clear and dramatic structure, the fugue does not quite succeed in leaving the world of the academia. The prelude, on the other hand, is based – as is the fugue – on a theme that stubbornly refuses to leave the mind once you’ve heard it, and it’s not every composer who achieves that! The second prelude is dark and heavy, with thick textures, the whole very serious and not a little oppressive. In this case the composer’s note allows the listener to follow the musical argument even at a first hearing. Once again I am put in mind of early and middle-period Tippett here, especially the fugal writing in some of that composer’s string quartets. The music is discursive and convincing, appealing perhaps more to the head than the heart. As for the performances, Robert Melling plays all three works with what appears to be total mastery and conviction. The composer will surely have been deeply satisfied and appreciative.\nFrom its arresting opening to the lively, conclusive finish, the Quartet No. 1 confirms the impression of a composer of great seriousness, uninterested in surface glamour and who expects his listeners to work at the music. Robert Simpson was another in this vein, and I would add his name to the list of composers Rose’s music can evoke, as well as, for different reasons, those of Bartók, Tippett again, and even Hindemith, names I cite merely in the hope of giving some impression of what this fascinating music sounds like. The Quartet never sounds as though it were conceived for any other medium, but there are times, as indeed there are in the piano works, when one would welcome a little more variety of colour, and there is a stratospheric passage just before the halfway mark that, striking though it is, rather tires the ear. There is, if anything, even less contrast of texture and colour in the Second Quartet, and for once I feel the work contains a passage or two where the composer stretches his motifs further than they can really bear. But once again one is struck by the seriousness of intent here, consummate craftsmanship, and a result that leaves the listener eager to return and explore the work further. Both works receive fine performances from the Edinburgh Quartet, though listening without a score I suspect that there are one or two passages in the Second Quartet where the group is particularly stretched. These are also those passages where I feel the composer’s inspiration is flagging, in which case the two impressions may well be linked.\nThis is a fine disc of uncompromising music from a little known composer. I recommend it to all those who like to stray from the beaten track.\nNot easy music at a first hearing, but compelling and satisfying.\nAnd a further view … from Rob Barnett:-\nRose was born in London of Dutch parents. He was a student of Rubbra whose own richly woven textures have, I am sure, encouraged Rose's approach. He emigrated to Cape Town in 1940 where his music was performed. After a long pause he began composing again after a return to the UK in 1993. Two major organ works have been recorded by Kevin Bowyer. Unrecorded as yet are Psalm XLI for chorus and orchestra and Spem in Alium Nunquam Habui for chorus, organ and timpani. There have been songs - which I have not heard - mostly settings of Chinese poetry. He is in good company: Lambert and Bliss.\nThe Edinburgh Quartet have already distinguished themselves with fine and enterprising CDs of the quartets of Leighton, Seiber and Crawford.\nThe music here largely dates from the period 1997-2001.\nThe First Quartet makes for a most resinous and soulful introduction. Like its 1999 successor it is in a single movement - certainly both are tracked as single spans of music - presumably just as the composer intended.\nThe First is tonal and affluently dense in texture. Ideas are often carried by the first violin. The music gives the impression of being in crowded flight and expressive of a complex of razor-keen emotions. Very touching ideas fly in, mesmerise and move on - as at 6.34. More surreal and even mildly acidic music occurs at 15.00 onwards. There’s a passage of fugal character at 16.01 which manages to shake off academicism just as the stultifying cloak was about fall around its shoulders. This is a generously tense, unrelenting and emotionally exhausting piece with some lyrical release. However, more dynamic variety would have aided the experience. Potent stuff.\nThree piano pieces separate the two quartets. The 2001 Prelude and Fugue op. 20a is of bell-clear crystalline clarity and grandeur. The op. 20b work wears a similarly grave visage and resounds with commanding music of the bell-tower. The early work is the Essay on DSCH - another Shostakovich tribute. It's in the nature of a Lisztian fantasy in the grand manner. I wonder whether Ronald Stevenson heard it at any point. Perhaps Stevenson's time in Cape Town overlapped with that of John Rose. All three pieces are splendidly delivered by Robert Melling.\nSecond Quartet runs to 26 minutes. Its material draws on music from Rose’s own Psalm XLI which was performed during the time this quartet was being written and from Rose's Spem in Alium. The notes tell us that the Mus es sein? Es mus sein motifs from Beethoven's op. 135 quartet also play their part. Again the brooding gravity of much of this music can be cut with a knife. A largely unwavering intensity is immanent. Even joy flows with pressure driving it forwards as in 6:23 onwards. A dancing delicacy can be heard at 10.30. The Edinburgh do well to sustain the close-to-breaking-strain tension extended over such a long span. The long emotional gradient into silence of the last five minutes of this quartet is etched into the listener's memory. The finale tremble into silence is telling indeed.\nI appreciated Warren Kimble's rather expressionistic Flower Quartet panels that ornament the front cover and each section of the liner-notes.\nJohn Rose must be pleased. By the way this John Rose should not be confused with that other intriguing Rose: John Luke Rose whose Piano Concerto and Symphony ‘The Mystic’ were taken up and then dropped by the BBC in early 1980s.\nThe composer is not going to let us into anything about the biographical context for these works – a pity. His succinct programme notes are technically descriptive - so be it. Music should stand or collapse on its heard characteristics. I am still intrigued but I will have to remain that way.\nThese two quartets aspire to grandeur and have about them the forbidding trappings of grandeur. Time will tell but for now all I can say is that I am drawn back to hear them again. In any event this is music of patent sincerity and some fascination.\nMusic of patent sincerity and some fascination."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8a777d31-4d1f-43c1-aaee-809a1aea8174>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the comparative effects of climate change versus antibiotics on respiratory health and allergy development?","answer":"Climate change primarily affects respiratory health through increased pollen concentrations and air pollutants, leading to worsened respiratory allergic diseases and altered immune system tolerance. It has increased both the intensity and duration of pollen seasons, with predictions showing ragweed pollen will increase fourfold in the next 30 years. Additionally, climate change-related thunderstorms increase ground-level pollen concentrations. In contrast, antibiotics affect respiratory health indirectly through disruption of the microbiome and immune system. Antibiotic use alters bacterial communities and immune responses, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and compromised barrier integrity, which can contribute to inflammatory conditions including allergies. Both factors can lead to increased prevalence of immune diseases, though through different mechanisms.","context":["The changes in the environment and biodiversity brought on by climate change could be responsible for increases in allergies, autoimmune diseases and autism, according to a Rutgers researcher\nClimate change and disruption of the ecosystem have the potential to profoundly impact the human body. Xue Ming, professor of neurology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, who recently published a paper in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health on the effects of climate change on allergies, autoimmunity and the microbiome — the beneficial microorganisms that live on and inside the human body — discusses how the delicate balance of the environment affects conditions such as allergies, autism and immune disorders.\nHow has climate change affected respiratory allergies?\nClimate change has worsened respiratory allergic disease and has altered the immune system’s tolerance in responding to toxins, which has led to an increase in the prevalence of immune diseases. People with chronic respiratory allergic disease that affects the nose and eyes, such as asthma and allergies, are at particular risk due to increased exposure to pollen and the increased concentration and distribution of air pollutants.\nAccording to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology, climate change has both increased the intensity of the pollen season as well as prolonged its duration. Increases in carbon dioxide were shown to lead to an increase in plant reproduction and total pollen levels, especially those plants that thrive at high carbon dioxide concentrations. For example, ragweed pollen has been increasing in concentration, with models predicting that levels will increase by four times within the next 30 years.\nThunderstorms, which have become more frequent due to rising sea temperatures, have been found to increase concentrations of pollen grains at ground level. After absorbing water, these grains can rupture and release allergenic particles that can induce severe asthmatic symptoms in patients with asthma or hay fever.\nClimate change has also been linked to increased concentrations and distribution of air pollutants such as ozone, nitric oxide and other volatile organic chemicals. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that these airborne environmental pollutants may be partially responsible for the substantial increase in allergic respiratory disease seen in industrialized countries over the past several decades.\nHow do changes to the ecosystem affect allergies and respiratory disorders?\nDeforestation and over-logging have led to a dramatic decrease in the diversity of plant species. As one species of plant becomes extinct, new species emerge to take their place. For example, as oak trees have been excessively harvested for architectural purposes, new species of trees have emerged. With these new trees come new forms of tree pollen, which are inhaled and ingested by humans on a daily basis.\nSimilarly, widespread pesticide use has altered the profile of insects, invertebrates and microorganisms with which we come into contact with through our soil and vegetation. As the environment is altered, our bodies are bombarded with novel organisms. The molecules which make up these organisms — known as antigens — are recognized as “foreign” by our bodies and create an inflammatory response.\nHow might a loss of biodiversity due to climate change affect non-respiratory diseases?\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, biodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history, with nearly 1 million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction due to climate change.\nThe loss of biodiversity related to climate change may affect the microbiome, potentially leading to inflammatory, autoimmune and neurologic diseases. Immunologic disorders, such as food allergies, are on the rise. For example, several studies have found that increases in carbon dioxide and temperature are correlated with changes in the composition of the peanut, making it more difficult for the body to adapt immunity.\nCould disturbances in gut bacteria affect the autism rate?\nDisruption of gut bacteria has been linked to neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, autism and Parkinson’s disease. In my own research, I found abnormal amino acid metabolism, increased imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, and altered gut microbiomes among some patients with autism spectrum disorder.\nWhat steps can be taken to minimize the health risks brought on by climate change?\nWe must end the destruction of our natural environment, decrease emissions of greenhouse gases and adopt more “green” behavior. With research demonstrating links between the microbiome and autoimmune, inflammatory and neurologic diseases, it is critical that we minimize antimicrobial exposure. This may involve altering guidelines for the prescription of antibiotics by medical professionals. In addition, given that the microbiome is directly impacted by our daily environment it is important to regularly immerse ourselves in nature and familiarize ourselves with biodiverse surroundings.","Michael Ash BSc (Hons), DO, ND FDipION reviews the current understanding of the role of antibiotics in the initiation of gut associated inflammation and local and systemic health problems, and briefly explores some strategies to prevent and manage this.\nWhat is perhaps the greatest medicinal discovery in the last 100 years has a sting in its tail, the tremendous success in managing bacterial infection has encouraged over and inappropriate use of antibiotics, the problems of which have been well documented. This review explores the developing comprehension that even a single day of antibiotic use has consequences that may produce transient and long term effects that compromise the health and well being of the patient and their bacterial co-habitants.\nSir Alexander Fleming discovered the antibiotic substance penicillin in 1928 and was awarded a co share in the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1945.\nIt was a discovery that would change the course of history. The active ingredient in that mould, which Fleming named penicillin, turned out to be an infection-fighting agent of enormous potency. When it was finally recognised for what it was—the most efficacious life-saving drug in the world—penicillin would alter forever the treatment of bacterial infections. By the middle of the century, Fleming’s discovery had spawned a huge pharmaceutical industry, churning out synthetic penicillin’s that would conquer some of mankind’s most ancient scourges, including syphilis, gangrene and tuberculosis. (Time Magazine April 1999)\nHowever, as the combined benefits of decent engineering for sanitation, prevention via vaccination and bacterial infection control through antibiotics have contributed to life extension, they have also produced microbe and human disturbances. The incidence of immune mediated disorders is continuing to increase and the gastrointestinal tract is continuing to gain traction as a site of significant origination.,\nMost healthcare professionals are now aware of the complication of prolonged antibiotic therapy and the risk of developing antibiotic resistance or trans/bacterial development. Patients are often less comfortable with this notion and will still seek antibacterial treatments for primary viral illness, follow the treatment protocol badly and continue to apply dubious standards of self care.\nThe Journal of Mucosal Immunology in March 2010, ran an editorial and paper on the adverse effects of antibiotics beyond those previously understood. Most Nutritional Therapists and clinicians will agree that there may be some level of bacterial disruption after a course of treatment. Most conservative researchers had suggested that the ‘fingerprint’ of species in the gut, maintained through bacterial communication techniques would ensure the bacterial architecture resolves a short time after cessation. Bonnie Basler PhD describes this quorum communication in an informative film from one the famous TED presentations.\nSome intestinal bacteria are mutualists that promote normal human physiology including proper digestion, metabolism, epithelial cell function, angiogenesis, enteric nerve function, and immune system development. Although bacterial communities in the intestine promote normal immune homeostasis, patients with inflammatory bowel disease or allergies have altered intestinal bacteria, indicating that microbial populations might influence disease pathogenesis and in particular those linked with adverse immune driven inflammation.\nIt is now understood that the composition of the microbiota is significantly altered by the use of antibiotics including the increase in urinary tract infections, diminished carbohydrate fermentation, loss of bile acid metabolism, pathogenic bacterial colonisation, immune disturbances, barrier defects and mucin degradation.\nMicrobe Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMP’S) are the molecular signatures used by bacteria to impart friendly messages to the mucosal immune receptors. They are also used to promote defence when a pathogen’s sticky patterns are identified. It is proposed that a change in the concentrations of these messengers by antibiotic therapy could disrupt the homeostatic health of the gut contributing to various significant changes in the competence of the gut related immune responses. It is becoming clear that a large part of our bacterial bedfellows have similar MAMP’S allowing them to operate in a symbiotic manner for immune tolerance and gastrointestinal health. It is this strategy used by probiotics to impart different messages to maintain a healthy digestive tract, and may also be used in the resolution or management of more complex immune mediated diseases.\nOur mucins are a vital part of the overall management, composed of an inner layer, a dense composition and free of bacteria, and the outer layer, made up of a looser matrix and offering a home to bacteria. The inner layer acts like a muffler, diminishing contact with the intraepithelial lining and yet still able to allow MAMP’s via dendritic cells to communicate with the immune system. The use of probiotics; L.plantarum and L.Rhamnosus (LGG) have shown a beneficial increase in this mucin layer, adding volume to the material and improving resistance to pathogen adhesion.\nA loss of this layer as shown in the diagram above may increase the total information load on the lining cells by loss of the muffling mucins in effect increasing the frequency and noise of the bacterial chatter, and may also facilitate translocation of bacteria across the lining, inducing an inflammatory response and additional loss of barrier quality. This increase in inflammation may induce local damage such as IBD but may also induce collateral damage to tissues far distant from the gut, such as the brain, joints and skin as described in a previous post.\nBacteriotherapy (the treatment of disease by the use of bacteria or their products)\nThe use of certain strains of probiotics have demonstrated barrier protection and cell survival. The opposite effect of loss of barrier integrity has many potential health complications related to inflammation as explained in a previous article. Antibiotic therapy offers the reverse scenario and contributes to pro-inflammatory cytokine production and loss of antimicrobial proteins, used by the gut tissues to maintain microbiota colonies and prevent pathogens binding. The use of selected probiotics (MAMP’s) during and post antibiotic therapy to selectively agitate the mucosal immune system represents a safe strategy.\nOur bacterial bedfellows and the single cell lining of the gut communicate through a variety of mechanisms, a loss of the bacterial composition can alter, tight junction expression, mucins, antimicrobial peptides and cytokine ratio’s. The resulting disturbance may then as a result affect the TH17/Treg ratio in the gut leading to increased production of the cytokine (IL-17), associated with inflammatory and autoimmune disease. Interestingly we as humans use our food source to provide control over the adverse production of this protein, Vitamin A derived from our foods, helps to programme the naive T cells in the gut to develop Treg or peacekeeping cells, rather than the inappropriate conversion into TH17 cells. The role of Vitamin A in mucosal health is well understood but it’s unique role in mucosal tolerance is only just being fully elucidated.\nAntibiotics used in clinic might be used to remove or suppress undesirable components of the human microbiome. Antibiotic treatment causes significant temporal and spatial alterations in various colonies of bacteria that have been proposed to have causative or therapeutic roles in human diseases. Antibiotic treatment also has significant negative effects on the output of pro-inflammatory cytokines in gut associated lymphoid tissues.\nFindings from this paper indicated that even short antibiotic courses can result in dramatic alterations to intestinal bacterial communities. In particular, significant reductions in the frequency of mucosal-associated Lactobacillus species were observed in antibiotic-treated as compared with control-treated animals.\nProbiotics can introduce missing microbial components with known beneficial functions for human health. Prebiotics such as those derived from apple soluble fibre can enhance the proliferation of beneficial microbes or probiotics as well as diminishing total inflammation, to maximise sustainable changes in the human microbiome.\nCombinations of these approaches might provide synergistic and effective therapies for specific disorders. The human microbiome could be manipulated by such “smart” strategies to prevent and treat acute gastroenteritis, antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, necrotising enterocolitis, and a variety of other disorders in which altered inflammation is a key driver.\nNutritional Therapists and other healthcare practitioners are going to have to consider the interactions of the medicines, foods, Saccharomyces Boulardii, and strain specific probiotics to optimise rather than compromise the restoration of gastrointestinal function – this is an exciting area of opportunity for specialism and research.\nThe incidence of lactic acid bacterial depletion and its potential role in the health of humans may make the use of a special strain such as LGG or combinations of strains a practical approach to post antibiotic minimisation of adverse immune disruption in the mucosal tissues. The role of SIgA in mucins and bacterial balance is also an area of significant opportunity for treatment, and Saccharomyces Boulardii has been shown to reduce IL-8 and increase SIgA as well as limit adverse effects associated with antibiotic therapy. In the gastrointestinal tract, SIgA exhibits properties of a neutralising agent (immune exclusion) and of an immunopotentiator inducing effector immune responses in a ‘non-inflammatory context’ favourable to preserve local homeostasis and control disease risk.\nS. boulardii effectively reduces the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children. \nAntibiotics, and most likely other agents of bacterial disruption, can alter the composition of the human gastrointestinal bacteria. In some people this may be enough to cause a loss of barrier quality and other adverse changes. The increase in immunological chatter can then cause damage locally and systemically via numerous routes.\nNo longer can antibiotics be viewed as a benign self recovering challenge to commensal bacteria. Nutritional Therapists can lead the way in the judicious use of strain specific bacteria and yeast to prevent and restore these damaged tissues.\n Johansson ME, Phillipson M, Petersson J, Velcich A, Holm L, & Hansson GC (2008).

AnswerParty!\nA chemical bond is an attraction between atoms that allows the formation of chemical substances that contain two or more atoms. The bond is caused by the electrostatic force of attraction between opposite charges, either between electrons and nuclei, or as the result of a dipole attraction. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \"strong bonds\" such as covalent or ionic bonds and \"weak bonds\" such as dipole–dipole interactions, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding.\nSince opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic force, the negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each other. An electron positioned between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them, and the nuclei will be attracted toward electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the chemical bond. Due to the matter wave nature of electrons and their smaller mass, they must occupy a much larger amount of volume compared with the nuclei, and this volume occupied by the electrons keeps the atomic nuclei relatively far apart, as compared with the size of the nuclei themselves. This phenomenon limits the distance between nuclei and atoms in a bond. Hydrogen\nLewis structures (also known as Lewis dot diagrams, electron dot diagrams, \"Lewis dot formulas\", Lewis dot structures, and electron dot structures) are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule. A Lewis structure can be drawn for any covalently bonded molecule, as well as coordination compounds. The Lewis structure was named after Gilbert N. Lewis, who introduced it in his 1916 article The Atom and the Molecule. They are similar to electron dot diagrams in that the valence electrons in lone pairs are represented as dots, but they also contain lines to represent shared pairs in a chemical bond (single, double, triple, etc.).\nLewis structures show each atom and its position in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another (pairs of dots can be used instead of lines). Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pairs of dots, and are placed next to the atoms.\nIn chemistry, a polar bond is a type of covalent bond between two atoms in which electrons are shared unequally. Because of this, one end of the bond has a fractional negative charge and the other a positive charge.\nIf the bond dipole moments of the molecule do not cancel, the molecule is polar. For example, the water molecule (H2O) contains two polar O-H bonds in a bent (nonlinear) geometry. The bond dipole moments which do not cancel, so that the molecule forms a molecular dipole with its negative pole at the oxygen and its positive pole midway between the two hydrogen atoms. In the figure each bond joins the central O atom with a negative charge (red) to an H atom with a positive charge (blue).

{"question":"What are the main types of breast surgery available through cosmetic procedures, and what steps should be taken to ensure a successful outcome?","answer":"The main types of breast surgery include breast augmentation (enlargement using implants) and breast reduction (for both females and males). Breast augmentation involves placing implants either between breast tissue and chest muscle or behind chest muscle, typically lasting 60-90 minutes. Female breast reduction removes excess skin and tissue to reduce breast volume, taking 2-4 hours, while male breast reduction (for gynaecomastia) involves removing fatty tissue through incisions around the nipple.

The CQC is a regulatory body that all hospitals and clinics providing cosmetic surgery must be registered with.\nPractitioners of non-surgical procedures do not currently need to be registered with the CQC or any other regulatory body, so if you have an issue it's best to take it up with the person who carried out the procedure or the clinic where it was performed.\nThere are many different types of cosmetic surgery procedure and it's important to find out as much as possible about any procedure you're considering.\nInformation about the following common surgical procedures can be found below:\nYou can also read about the general risks of cosmetic surgery.\nBreast augmentation or enlargement is a procedure used to increase breast size with implants. It's the most common cosmetic procedure carried out in the UK.\nBreast implant surgery is usually performed under general anaesthetic. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.\nThe procedure starts with your surgeon making an incision (surgical cut). Your surgeon will discuss with you the exact location of the incision before the procedure. It will depend on the shape and size of your breasts and where you would like the scars to be.\nAfter the incision has been made, the implants can be fitted. The implant can either be positioned between your breast tissue and your chest muscle or behind your chest muscle. In some cases, the surgeon is able to place the implant partly behind the breast and partly behind the muscle. Your surgeon will be able to offer advice about the position that is best for you.\nOnce the implants are in place, the incisions are sealed using stitches, which will usually be covered with a dressing.\nBreast implant surgery is sometimes carried out as day surgery, which means you will be able to go home the same day. However, if the operation is scheduled late in the day, you may need to stay in hospital overnight. Depending on the procedure you are having, the operation should take between 60 and 90 minutes.\nIf the stitches used aren't dissolvable, they will be removed after seven to 14 days. Some surgeons recommend wearing a tight-fitting sports bra 24 hours a day for up to three months following breast surgery.\nMost breast implants last about 10-15 years, after which time further surgery may be needed to replace them.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of having breast implants include:\nYou should contact your surgeon or doctor if you are concerned about your implants. Further surgery may be needed to replace it if there's a problem.\nRead more about the risks of breast implants and PIP breast implants.\nFemale breast reduction is an operation to reduce the weight and volume of a woman's breasts. It's usually done under general anaesthetic.\nMost breast reduction surgery begins with the nipple, which is moved to its new position, usually while still attached to the blood supply. If you have extremely large breasts, the nipples may be removed and repositioned as a skin graft.\nExcess skin and breast tissue are then removed. The remaining breast tissue is reshaped to create smaller and more elevated breasts.\nThe procedure takes between two and four hours. You are usually required to stay in hospital for one or two nights. The stitches will normally be removed between 10 to 14 days after the operation.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of female breast reduction include:\nRead more about the risks of female breast reduction.\nMale breast reduction is used to reduce the size of enlarged male breasts (known as gynaecomastia) if lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, haven't helped.\nThe procedure is usually carried out using a general anaesthetic.\nDuring the operation, the surgeon makes an incision around the nipple and excess fatty tissue is sucked out. If there is a lot of tissue to remove, cuts may extend down the chest and the nipples may need to be repositioned.\nThe operation usually takes about 90 minutes. You will be required to stay in hospital overnight.\nIf non-dissolvable stitches are used, these will need to be removed after seven to 14 days. An elastic garment also needs to be worn for one to four weeks after the operation to encourage your skin to heal properly around the affected area.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of male breast reduction include:\nEar reshaping surgery, also known as otoplasty or pinnaplasty, is used to improve the appearance of the ears and make them as symmetrical as possible.\nSurgery involving older children and adults can be carried out under local anaesthetic. This means the affected area is numbed. Younger children may need a general anaesthetic.\nDuring surgery, a small cut is made behind the ear to expose the ear cartilage. The cartilage is repositioned and shaped by removing small pieces, then scoring and stitching the remaining structure into the desired shape and position.\nThe length of time it takes depends on the complexity of each case. However, the procedure generally takes one to two hours. If local anaesthetic is used, you will usually be able to go home the same day. An overnight stay in hospital may be required if general anaesthetic is used.\nThe stitches are removed five to 10 days after surgery and you will need to wear a head bandage during this time to support the ears in their new position.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of ear reshaping surgery include:\nRead more about the risks of ear reshaping surgery.\nEyelid surgery, also known as blepharoplasty, is used to remove excess skin from the upper and lower eyelids to get rid of hooded eyelids or eye bags.\nBoth upper and lower eyelid surgery can be carried out under local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic. General anaesthetic is often preferred if both the upper eyelids and lower eyelids are being corrected.\nDuring surgery on the upper eyelids, the surgeon makes an incision along the eyelid crease in the natural skin fold of the eyelid and removes unwanted skin, fat and muscle. The surgeon then closes up the incision, which will hide the scar in the natural fold of the eyelid.\nDuring surgery on the lower eyelids, the surgeon moves or removes fat from the bags under the eyes either through an incision made just below the lower lashes or an incision made on the inside of the eyelid. A small amount of skin may also be removed, but the muscle that closes the eyelid is preserved.\nCosmetic eyelid surgery takes between one and two hours. If local anaesthetic is used, you can usually go home the same day as the operation. If general anaesthetic is used, you will need to stay in hospital until the effects wear off.\nThe surgeon will normally apply suture strips to support the eyelids after surgery, these are usually removed after three to five days.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of eyelid surgery include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on eyelid surgery.\nA rhytidectomy, or 'facelift', is a procedure used to reduce flabby or sagging skin around the face and neck. The procedure is usually carried out under general anaesthetic.\nThere are many different kinds of facelift, but generally incisions are made above the hair line at the temples, extending under and behind the ear and into the hairline. The skin is then pulled backwards and upwards before being stitched into its new position.\nAt the end of the operation, the surgeon closes up the incisions with stitches and applies a dressing to protect the area where the incisions were made\nThe procedure can take up to six hours to complete and an overnight stay in hospital is usually required.\nMost surgeons will bandage the face to minimise bruising and swelling. These bandages will stay on for one or two days and the stitches are removed after seven to eight days.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of facelifts include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on facelifts.\nLiposuction is used to remove unwanted body fat.\nMost liposuction operations are performed under general anaesthetic. For treatments on the lower parts of the body, an epidural anaesthetic may be used. This numbs the lower part of the body while you are awake.\nThe surgeon usually begins the operation by injecting a liquid solution into the area being treated. This fluid helps to reduce the risk of problems like bruising and bleeding.\nThe surgeon then makes a small cut in the skin. If the area being treated is large, several cuts may have to be made.\nA suction tube attached to a specialist vacuum machine, is then inserted into the cut. This loosens the fat in the area being treated and then sucks it out.\nThis procedure usually lasts between one and four hours. You will have to stay in hospital overnight if general anaesthetic is used.\nAfter the procedure you will be fitted with an elasticated corset or bandages for the treated area. This helps to reduce swelling and bruising, and it should be worn for several weeks after the operation. The stitches will usually be removed after about seven days.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of liposuction include:\nRead more about the risks of liposuction.\nA rhinoplasty, or 'nose job', is a procedure used to reshape the nose.\nThere are a number of different types of nose reshaping operation. The exact procedure will depend on the aim of the treatment. The operation may take place under a general or local anaesthetic.\nThe two main techniques used are called 'open' or 'closed'. Open means that some or all of the cuts are made outside the nose, whereas closed means all the cuts are made inside the nose.\nA nose reshaping operation normally involves separating the soft tissue that lies on top of the nose from the bone and cartilage underneath. Depending on the operation, the surgeon might break the nose bone and reposition it, and/or reshape the cartilage.\nNose reshaping surgery generally takes around two hours.\nAfter the operation, it's likely you will need to wear a protective splint over your nose for a few weeks. Stitches inside your nose will probably be dissolvable and will not need to be removed. Your surgeon will advise you about when any stitches outside your nose need to be removed.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of nose jobs include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on nose reduction and nose augmentation.\nAn abdominoplasty, or 'tummy tuck', is a procedure used to alter the shape of the abdomen (tummy area) by removing fat and excess loose skin, usually if lifestyle changes like healthy eating and dieting are unsuccessful.\nThere are two types of tummy tuck, called 'partial' and 'full'. These operations will usually be carried out under a general anaesthetic.\nIn a partial tummy tuck, the surgeon makes a large incision across the lower abdomen. They then separate the skin from the abdominal wall, remove excess fat and cut away the excess skin. The remaining skin is then pulled together and stitched.\nFor a full tummy tuck, the surgeon makes an incision across the lower abdomen, just above the pubic area. They then make a second incision to free the belly button from the tissue that surrounds it and they separate the skin from the abdominal wall.\nThe surgeon then pulls down the abdominal muscles and stitches them into their new position, removes fat deposits and cuts away the excess skin. A new hole is cut for the belly button, and it is stitched back into place. Finally, the surgeon pulls the remaining skin down and stitches it together.\nThe length of the operation will depend on the extent of the surgery, but it could take up to three hours.\nAfter the procedure, you will need to stay in hospital overnight. The stitches will be removed after seven to 14 days and you will need to wear a supporting corset for one to four weeks to encourage your skin to heal properly around the affected area.\nAs well as the general risks of surgery (see below), risks of tummy tucks include:\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) has more information on abdominal reduction.\nAs with any type of surgery, cosmetic surgery has associated risks and complications. The degree of risk depends on whether the surgery is in a small or large area, the level of experience of the surgeon and the overall health of the person having the procedure.\nGeneral complications from cosmetic surgery can include:\nThere is also a risk that your expectations of surgery do not match what is realistically achievable, so it's important to discuss these issues in detail with your surgeon before giving your consent to surgery.\nYou should have follow-up appointments after surgery so your recovery can be monitored.\nIf you have any concerns regarding your recovery from a surgical procedure, such as pain, swelling, discharge or any other unexpected side effects, speak to your surgeon, doctor or healthcare team immediately.\nAll private companies that provide cosmetic surgery must register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Always ask to see the company’s registration before agreeing to have cosmetic surgery at a private hospital or clinic.\nThe CQC inspects all cosmetic surgery providers and reports on their findings.\nThe cost of private cosmetic treatment can vary depending on where you have treatment and the type of procedure being carried out.\nImportant: Our website provides useful information but is not a substitute for medical advice.

If you are considering this for yourself, have you thought about the BEST way to go about it? In other words, aside from booking an appointment at the doctor’s office, have you thought about the process itself, and how to get the best results? Here is your essential guide to getting the best results from your cosmetic surgery:\n1) ESTABLISH CLEAR GOALS. Before you jump in, it is best to establish clear goals of what you want to achieve before having a consultation. The more specific your goals are, the more likely your doctor can create an effective plan to meet your needs and the less likely you will fall short of your ideal results. Try to be as specific in your goals as possible! Examples of very specific goals are wanting a straighter nose profile, wanting to remove “bags” from under your eyes, or wanting your tummy to look flatter and tighter. Nonspecific goals, such as wanting your tummy or eyes to “look better,” leave too much open for interpretation, and are less helpful in designing the best treatment plan. Only if your doctor can understand precisely what you are seeking, can he/she determine if the result is realistic and the best way to get there.\n2) CONSULT WITH A REAL EXPERT. Plastic surgery and cosmetic treatments require having knowledge of the procedures as well as the skills to provide them safely. Because of the local laws that apply in your state, it is technically possible for health professionals who are not specifically trained in cosmetic surgery or therapies to perform these treatments while remaining within legal boundaries. In the state of California where I practice, for example, any licensed physician can legally perform a facelift or breast augmentation even if he/she was never trained in plastic surgery at all! Yes . . . this is a scary thought. Thankfully, there are ways in which you can methodically go about the process of finding a great doctor. One of the best and most popular criteria to consider is board certification in plastic surgery. Certificates hanging on office walls claiming that the doctor is certified by some “cosmetic” board can fool many people. In truth, there is only ONE legitimate certifying board for plastic surgeons: The American Board of Plastic Surgery. So, be sure to know that the board certification is legitimate. Beyond board certification, membership in the ASPS (American Society of Plastic Surgeons) signifies both board certification as well as other additional characteristics. If you seek more selective “status” in your plastic surgeon, look for a physician who is a member of ASAPS (American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery). ASAPS doctors are automatically screened for board certification while also demonstrating a focus on cosmetic procedures along with ethical integrity and other parameters. These following web sites can assist you in locating practitioners and verifying their board certification: www.surgery.org (American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery – arguably the most “elite” society of cosmetic plastic surgeons), www.plasticsurgery.org (American Society of Plastic surgeons), and www.abplasticsurgery.org (The American Board of Plastic Surgery – you can check whether your doctor is board certified here). Once you find a doctor, recognize that there are varying policies as to how offices handle fees for a consultation. Some doctors offer complimentary consultations, others charge a fee, and yet others charge a fee initially and subsequently credit the amount back to upon booking a procedure. While you may have your own opinion about consultation fees, always remember that treatments and surgeries are far more important than the issue of a consultation fee in most cases. Consequently, I encourage people to avoid putting too much emphasis on the consultation fee. Often, the best-qualified doctors charge a consultation fee because of the time and expertise that they bring to the table for patients. So, in the long run, if you look for quality over these smaller financial issues, you will have access to a wider selection of potential doctors.\n3) FIND THE RIGHT FIT. Ensure that you have a comfortable fit with the treating doctor and office, and have confidence that you will be able to communicate with them as well as obtain the information you need. As with any process, it is important to have excellent communication with your treating team, and always recognize that doctors vary in their work style and personality. If you are comfortable that your doctor understands your goals and can formulate a plan that seems to be a good fit, you increase the odds of having a great experience. As with any situation that offers you a choice as to where you receive your care, getting a second opinion may help clarify where you feel the most comfortable. Any doctor who has his/her own surgery center would be among an elite group of physicians who have dedicated the energy and resources to managing the surgical process with a “hands on” approach. I have a policy of providing a tour of my surgery center to all new patients so that they have an immersive and thorough experience before they undergo surgery. Most patients are intuitive and savvy enough to recognize top-tier quality when they tour an office and surgery center.\n4) LEARN. Learn as much as you can about the procedure(s) as part of the process called “informed consent.” It is wise to be aware of the options available for your situation, the way in which the treatment will be given, and the risks or side effects associated with treatment. In spite of the remarkable capabilities of the Internet these days, it can be counter-productive to simply use Google to randomly search for information. In fact, I have seen patients become overwhelmed and even “stressed out” about information that they read on the Internet from questionable sources. This almost always occurs as a result of reading about bad complications that someone (often a celebrity) had suffered. Always remember that the “horror” stories get most of the media attention, even if they are based on avoidable or rare problems. I have found that my patients get much more reliable information from well-designed brochures, such as those from ASAPS, or by navigating to web sites of high integrity. You can refer to the web sites listed above for the ASAPS and ASPS resources.\n5) PLAN A BUDGET. Consider your budget and the costs, so that you are prepared. Most patients either pay directly for their procedure (with credit card, for example) or use a special line of credit, such as CareCredit (www.carecredit.com) and Alphaeon (www.alphaeon.com). Many offices are familiar with these companies, and can assist you in applying for a medical line of credit. With the help of these companies, it is possible for you to undergo treatment today and pay for it over time.\n6) PREPARE. Once you have a treatment plan, prepare thoroughly for your procedure(s). For cosmetic surgeries, such as breast augmentation or tummy tuck, you will typically need up-to-date blood tests and a physical exam to ensure you are ready for any anesthesia required. Also, there are a number of additional steps to prepare for surgery that can reduce your risk of side effects or complications. Of course, you should always get specific instructions from your own doctor, and some of the list that follows may not apply to you. Examples of advice often recommended before surgery include (1) Avoid pills that may increase your bleeding risk, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, etc., (2) Avoid most herbal products or supplements as well as vitamin pills unless cleared by your doctor, (3) Avoid unnecessary extreme exertion just prior to your procedure so that you are not dehydrated, (4) Obtain as much of the materials you will need after surgery in advance, such as compressive garments for liposuction, post-operative bras, healing creams, etc., (5) Prepare your home for your return after the procedure by making sure you are well stocked with food, have clean clothes ready, and have your pets’ needs accounted for. If you require medications after your procedure, be sure to pick them up in advance whenever possible. Prescriptions may include pain medications, antibiotics, sleep aids as well as others. It is common to need ice to apply to surgical sites, for which many people use frozen peas, (6) Be sure not to drink any fluids or eat anything by mouth for at least the 8 hours prior to a general anesthesia you may be having (or as advised by your doctor), (7) Be sure to wear comfortable and loose-fitting clothes that are very easy to remove and put back on after surgery. A zip-up top, for example, is better than one that requires you to stretch over your head. Also, be sure to leave all of your jewelry and valuables at home, (8) Make sure your transportation is set up with someone reliable, such as a relative or good friend. If you receive any anesthesia or sedation, you will only be discharged in the custody of a reliable adult who can drive, (9) Make sure your driver receives all of the instructions from the medical staff, as you may not remember the details right after you awaken from anesthesia.\n7) FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. Follow all of your post-procedure instructions carefully, and ask any questions of the staff for clarification. The results of a procedure can depend on both the surgery as well as the aftercare at home. Some instructions, such as taking a pill, can be quite straightforward, while other instructions, such as recording fluid output in a drain, require more detailed information so that it is done properly. I provide all of my surgery patients with a specific form that they take home and use as a reference for aftercare. It includes just about anything that they would need to know. I have also found it helpful to use specific instruction guides for non-surgical treatments when a procedure requires any detailed home care.\n8) KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENTS. Every surgery or procedure has its own aftercare regimen. Surgeries generally have a longer list of aftercare instructions when compared with non-surgical treatments, although laser treatments and some injections need extra post-treatment care. There may be a need to remove stitches, and the timing for stitch removal will vary with the procedure and the kind of suturing. A drain may be used with certain plastic surgery operations, and the decision for the timing of drain removal must be made by the doctor. In the case of a rhinoplasty, (“nose job”), for example, there may be a splint placed over the nose or special material inserted in the nose that must be removed. Although most of these aftercare visits are short, they allow your doctor to monitor you closely for any problems and keep you on track.\n9) BE PATIENT! Believe it or not, complete healing after surgery can take over 12 months! Of course, returning to work or activities occurs much sooner, while the softening of scar tissue and the reduction in scar visibility takes many months. So, patience is a virtue under these circumstances.\nIn summary, it is helpful to know what to expect if you want to consider cosmetic surgery, and, with the proper knowledge, you can stack the odds in favor of success. The key success elements are:\n- ✓ Establish clear and specific goals of what you want\n- ✓ Consult an expert, such as a plastic surgeon member of ASAPS\n- ✓ Ensure you have a comfortable fit with the doctor and office\n- ✓ Learn about the procedure and associated risks and alternatives\n- ✓ Consider your budget and the costs\n- ✓ Prepare thoroughly in advance so there are no surprises or problems\n- ✓ Follow the post-procedure instructions faithfully\n- ✓ Follow up with your doctor\n- ✓ Be patient!\nSaul R.

{"question":"How is nutrition managed for late preterm infants, and what role does fortification play?","answer":"Late preterm infants (34-36 weeks gestation) require carefully managed nutrition through breast milk, which is higher in protein compared to term infants. However, fortification of breast milk is often indicated, particularly if there was growth restriction in utero, faltering growth, static weight gain, or concerns with length or head circumference. Some infants may require specific preterm infant formula to meet increased nutritional requirements. Human milk fortification (HMF) is specifically added to expressed breast milk to raise concentrations of specific nutrients, ensuring nutrient needs are met whenever energy needs are met.","context":["Breastfeeding the Late Pre-Term Infant (LPTI) was a presentation at the 2021 ALCI Spring Study Day by Liz Greene RGN, RM, RNT, IBCLC\nLiz opened by acknowledging that we are seeing more of these late preterm infants (LPTI) due to a rise in the incidence of multiple birth pregnancies and resulting earlier gestation births, which in turn leads to a higher prevalence of feeding difficulties and increase in additional support required.\nThe LPTI is classified as 34+0 -36+6 week gestation, with moderate preterm infants (MPTI) being classified as 32+0 – 33+6 week gestation. Normal weight at 34+0 weeks (female and male respectively) >1.6-1.7kg and at 36+6 (female and male respectively) >2.2kg -2.3kg. This highlights the range of weight, maturation and significant development that is missed during this three-week period in utero.\nBritish association of perinatal medicine (BAPNM) acknowledge that LPTI have specific needs that require more attention, and have established a working group for health care professionals; “Management of moderate preterm infants framework for practice” first draft is being prepared.\nAlongside earlier gestation birth it is important to also acknowledge whether the LPTI was growth restricted in utero. Low birth weight is classified as <2.5kg – if body weight was <2nd centile for gestation the baby is smaller than average – resulting in less body fat and energy reserves which will impact upon oral feeding abilities. For this reason, despite maternal breast milk for LPTI infants being higher in protein and more tailored to increased requirements of the LPTI compared to the term infant, fortification of breast milk is often indicated particularly if growth restriction in utero or if growth has faltered since birth, static weight gain, concerns with length or head circumference etc. Donor milk is valuable for this cohort of infants but important to recognise nutritional limitations, and therefore these infants may require specific preterm infant formula to help meet increased nutritional requirements.\nLiz highlighted the increasing role of Neonatal dietitians within this setting to improve the care and outcomes these infants and their families are experiencing and the balancing act that is required between volume targets, fluid requirements and growth targets, and establishing oral feeding successfully.\nAnyone who is helping the mother to feed her late preterm infant should think about what has baby’s story been so far so that care can be individually tailored to infants’ needs – admission criteria for NNU vary between units. We know the LPTI is at increased risk of:\n- Respiratory Distress Syndrome -reduced surfactant\n- Hypothermia -reduced body weight and body fat\n- Poor feeding -natural consequence is that baby has less energy available to feed vs challenges\n- Suspected sepsis\n- Increased risk of readmission following discharge\nIgnition of BF usually encouraged from 32 weeks, bottle-feeding often from 33-34 weeks gestation. Individual assessment of oral feeding readiness is crucial -importance cannot be overlooked or underestimated particularly if goal of parent is to breastfeed.\nBenefits of having a tool to undertake individual assessment\n- Safe transition to oral feeding is key by assessing pace of baby’s developmental readiness\n- Reduce problematic feeding issues in the future\n- Working beyond the hospital stay and safeguarding future feeding\n- Minimise feeding issues\n- Focuses on readiness and ability of PTI\nPIOFRAS (preterm infant oral feeding readiness assessment scale) and PIBBS (Preterm infant breastfeeding behaviour scale) focused on as specifically look at infant readiness rather than assessing feeding once already established with the aim to not start at pace beyond infant’s ability.\n- Gestation of baby looked\n- Non-nutritive suck used as starting point for feeding readiness and baby behavioural state -oral and body positions, reflexes etc.\n- Movement of tongue -cupping, movement and sucking strength\n- Babies alertness also looked at\n- Stress signs during non-nutritive sucking -saliva accumulating, nasal nares trembling, colour changes or apnoea, tone changes, hiccupping, crying, refusal etc.\n- Visual or felt observation on finger\n- This tool was envisaged to be undertaken by oral therapists – limitations of staffing and skill set available\n- Completed by the mother\n- Advantage -similar to previous tool -rooting, suck, swallow, alertness, time baby actively sucking/swallowing, but also how mother feels baby is feeding\nHow can we support optimal feeding for mother and the late preterm baby?\nWell documented that nasogastric tube feeding (NGT) and orogastric tube feeding (OGT) and bottle feeding standard practice with this cohort of infants.\n- Breastfeed/Hand express (HE) within 1 hour of birth\n- The reason for birth between 34+0 -36+6 gestation may have required operative or assisted birth, oxytocin release could be inhibited by stress related to birth\n- If either mother and/or baby requires medical and midwife/nursing care at birth, support mother to HE and collect colostrum as soon as possible\n- Offering pictures of baby to aid HE of colostrum\n- Kangaroo care (KC) -want to facilitate as much as possible but realistic challenges i.e., space on NNU, maternal comfort, seating available -recliner i.e., laid back BF, if available they enhance the care available. Restricted growth infants can be difficult to hold. Gentle swaddle/cushions can be important to facilitate\n- Regular BF/expression and double electric pumping of breast milk -PTI may not have adequate strength suck to stimulate milk removal -therefore breast pump crucial if milk not being removed. Importance of keeping mother updated on infant’s progress if separated and providing photos to support with lactogenesis II\nKeeping LPTI and mother together (“rooming in”/transitional care) increases:\n- BF initiation\n- Lactogenesis II\n- Use of cup/tube feeding as alternate to bottle teats\n- Likelihood of BF continuation\nNot all units have transitional care services, not a “place” but tailored support to these mothers and babies, increased workload to staff needs to be recognised\n|Readiness for feeding||Signs baby is not ready for feeding|\n|Rhythmic sucking noted during non-nutritive sucking||Baby is sleepy – eyes are closed|\n|Baby putting fingers in and around mouth||Irregular or spaced-out sucks|\n|Baby is awake and alert||Disorganised suck-swallow-breathing|\n|Rooting behaviours||Messy feeder|\n|Flexed arms and legs, midline positioning||Extended posture and poor tone|\n|Refusal to suck-swallow or complete a feed|\n|Colour change, apnoea\nIf we push oral feeding too much -negative future feeding behaviours are likely\n- Can be commenced from 32 weeks onward\n- Baby is using lips, tongue, jaw, which will help to develop, suck skills\n- Can be messy -that is the norm\n- Increased BF continuation\n- Reduces bottle teat usage\n- Unsure if this increases length of stay in hospital\n- Cup feeding is infant driven -babies can lap milk earlier\n“At breast” supplementer:\n- Evidence of its success >37+0 weeks gestation\n- Further research is need for LPTI\n- Pre-requisites – readiness to feed, maintain a good latch, organised sucking and swallowing\n- Known challenges – fiddly, cost of tubes, tube blockage or dislodged\n- Suitable from 32+0 weeks onward\n- Useful if baby has sucking/latching difficulties\n- Breastmilk or alternative in a container level to baby or lower\n- Tube taped to index finger\nElevated side lying:\n- Acknowledges developmental stage of baby\n- Recommended in NNU and transitional care settings\n- Mimics cross cradle BF hold and paced feeding therefore easing the transition back to breastfeeding\n“Prompts” that can lead to negative feeding behaviours\n- Suddenly waking baby and commencing an oral feed\n- Rubbing/moving baby’s jaw to suck-swallow\n- Increasing the milk flow\n- Chin and cheek support\n- “Jiggling” the teat to encourage sucking/swallowing\n- Tilting back baby’s head and neck during suck-swallowing\nWhat are the key messages for supporting a mother to breastfeed her LPTI:\n– Facilitate STS as often as possible\n– HE and use of double electric breast pump in early days/weeks\n– Individualised advice and support for mother based on observation of baby’s readiness for oral feeding\n– Avoid/minimise separation of mother and baby\n– Transitional care\n– Tube and cup feeding increase likelihood of BF continuation\nJenni Ashcroft April 2021.\nJenni received a bursary of €100 from ALCI to attend the online ALCI Spring Study Day 2021.","Meeting the nutritional requirements of preterm baby represents a continuing challenge facing doctors, nurses, as well as the baby’s family. Nutrition during early life is now recognized not only as a key determinant for immediate neonatal survival, growth and mental development during infancy, but also as a major conditioning factor for long-term health. Preterm babies very often need admission to neonatal intensive care unit after birth. This make breastfeeding a little more challenging. However, most mothers are able to express their breast milk to feed their little ones.\nExpressed breast milk (EBM)\nBreast milk is the feed of choice for preterm baby. Besides providing nutrients needed for growth and development, human milk also contains numerous immune-protective components that protect the premature babies from infection. However, most of the preterm babies are unable to feed directly from mother’s breast at the initial stage due to their sickness or immaturity of sucking-swallowing reflex. Therefore it is very important for a mother to express her breast milk so that her baby can still receive breast milk using alternative methods such as orogastric tube feeding, cup feeding etc.\nEBM expression and storage\nClean your hands before expressing breast milk. Express breast milk in a clean container. Write the date and time on the EBM container each time after expressing. Do not mix EBM at different time in a same container. You can consult local healthcare staff in wards/ clinics regarding technique of expressing, storing and transporting EBM.\nAfter expressing, EBM should be kept in the fridge/ freezer if not sending to hospital immediately. You can store your EBM in a number of ways as follow:\n|Freezer compartment inside refrigerator||\n|Freezer section of refrigerator with separate door||\nStoring EBM in the fridge\nHow to transport expressed breast milk to hospital\nWhen transporting EBM to hospital, keep the EBM in a cold environment such as by using a cooler.\nExample of a cooler\nHuman milk fortification (HMF)\nPreterm babies often need HMF to be added in EBM. The aim of fortification is to raise the concentrations of specific nutrients in relation to energy to such levels that nutrients needs are met whenever energy needs are met.\nTotal parenteral nutrition (TPN)\nPreterm babies are born with limited nutrient stores, and take time to establish enteral feeding. Most babies < 32 weeks or < 1500g will require TPN at the initial stage while establishing enteral feeding. TPN is a type of nutritional formula giving intravenously to the baby. It contains nutrients such as glucose, protein, fat, vitamin and dietary minerals. TPN is an important source of energy and nutrients when the baby is still not on full enteral feed.\nPreterm growth is usually monitored by checking the weight, head circumference and length regularly. The growth parameters will then be plotted on a growth chart to monitor the trend of the growth. Higher growth velocity on the neonatal intensive care unit that was similar to intrauterine growth rates predicts better neurological outcome.\nFeeding the preterm babies after discharge\nThe very preterm infant at the time of discharge represents a nutritional challenge to healthcare providers as well as infant’s family on the decision on what type of milk should be given after discharge and on the need to continue to supplement mother’s milk. The World Health Organization, American Pediatric Society, and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterogy Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommend mothers’ own milk for nutrition of infants for the first 6 months of life and beyond. Close monitoring of feeding and growth is recommended after hospital discharge.\n- B. Koletzko et al. Nutritional Care of Preterm Infants.2014;110.\n- C. Agostoni et al.

{"question":"How do the breezeway designs compare between Mikkel Hansen's home in Black Mountain and the mid-century modern homes in Boston area? I'm fascinated by architectural features!","answer":"In Mikkel Hansen's Black Mountain home, the breezeway is a glass-enclosed room with a checkered vinyl floor that separates the living quarters from the utilitarian side of the house and currently houses his loom. In comparison, Boston area mid-century modern homes featured more elaborate breezeway designs, as exemplified by the 464 Concord Ave. house in Lexington, which has a breezeway foyer with walls of glass sliders connecting the main house to a 2-car garage, and the 75 Robin Road house in Weston, which features an all-glass breezeway that separates the bedrooms from the rest of the home.","context":["Home of the Week: Midcentury modern\nBefore he even considered learning to weave, Mikkel Hansen built himself a loom.\nA retired architect, he was more interested in the composition of the wooden instrument, and how its foot pedals made it hum, rather than the things it could create.\n“The logic and beauty of this piece of equipment intrigued me,” Mikkel said of the loom. It was not long until he took up the craft, and he has gone on to win awards for his fabrics that include at least one first place at the N.C. Mountain State Fair.\nHe came to weaving as he had approached many other aspects of his life, he said, through the conviction that “Beauty makes so much sense.”\nIt is perhaps his fascination with functionality that’s key to his appreciation of the simple, cozy dwelling in Black Mountain where he has lived with his wife for the past 25 years or so.\nBeyond its midcentury modern flair, the house is not particularly flashy. It has no glittering chandeliers, high ceilings, grand staircases or the like.\nBut on a recent visit, the most charming aspect of their house was that it indeed felt like a home.\nWith about 2,000 square feet, including two baths and two bedrooms, the house is accented with cozy spaces, family photographs and hardwood floors.\nIn the light-filled living room are colorfully patterned carpets Mikkel received from his parents, a wall of paintings and a wood-burning fireplace, along with a wall-to-wall bookshelf the couple has filled over the years.\nPerhaps most remarkable is its sizable north-facing windows, which look out onto their wooded backyard that includes a stone patio adorned with flowers and plants. The property encompasses a little less than an acre, with the house situated atop a slope.\nAs for their dining room, it is “adequate,” Mikkel said of the nook. Next to the front door, it features a small wooden table beneath a single light hanging from the ceiling. The adjoining kitchen is also compact, along with the laundry room next to it.\nAt one end of the house is a glass-enclosed room with a checkered vinyl floor where Mikkel keeps his loom and that once served as a so-called breezeway, separating the living quarters from the utilitarian side of the house. Adjoining it is a bright master bedroom that Mikkel said might have once served as a pottery studio, judging from its electrical outlets.\nIn their mid-80s, Mikkel and his wife, Jytte, a former longtime research technologist, are originally from Denmark. They came to the United States by boat around the time their home was built in the mid-1950s. Its designer was also an architect, who lived there with his wife for a time.\nThe couple initially wound up in Kentucky, where Mikkel found work at a power plant. Less than a year later, they moved to Chicago, living there for decades. They have a few grandchildren who live in the Upper Midwest.\nIn 1990 the Hansens discovered their Black Mountain home, after spending time traveling the country while keeping a cottage in Michigan. They bought it from a doctor, who was only its second owner.","Around the 1950s, architects, led by Joseph Eichler and Frank Lloyd Wright, introduced the mid-century modern style of architecture in an effort to move away from the ornate Queen Anne and Colonial Revival style that had previously been favored in and around Boston, as well as most of the northeastern area of the country.\nTypically more compact in size, mid-century modern homes were characterized from the exterior by their asymmetrical, yet plain facades, flat roofs, and large windows that were intended to bring the outdoors inside. On the interior, slight elevation changes due to small steps doing up and down between rooms, open floor plans, statement lighting, and geometric wallpaper were the norm.\nToday, there are quite a few mid-century modern homes in the Boston area, particularly in the city’s outskirts. An architectural style that is coveted by a number of buyers, these houses rarely sell for less than $575,000. To give you an idea of what you can find, here’s a quick look at 10 of the top mid-century modern homes in and around Boston.\n464 Concord Ave. in Lexington, MA\nDesigned and built in 1960 by The Architects Collaborative, this 4-bedroom, 4 bathroom home has 2,907 sq. ft. of living space. Located in the highly desired Five Fields neighborhood, it is your typical mid-century modern home with tons of windows, which is ideal for looking out at the conservation land directly behind it. It is especially unique, thanks to a 2-car garage that is connected to the home by a breezeway foyer with walls of glass sliders. In September 2016, it went on the market for $899,000, but was removed slightly more than a month later.\n540 Nichols Street in Norwood, MA\nBuilt and designed by Hayes Kelley in 1960 for his own family, this 3-bedroom, 1 bathroom home has 2,636 sq. ft. The quintessential mid-century modern home has floor-to-ceiling windows, an open floor plan, high ceilings, a step-down living room with a stone fireplace, and an elevated family room that opens to the kitchen, which is accented by a pink back splash. The home was sold for $585,000 in September 2016. Interestingly, this was $60,000 over the original asking price.\n75 Robin Road in Weston, MA\nDesigned by Henry B. Hoover (Boston’s earliest Modernist architect) and his partner, Walter Lee Hill, this home, built in 1958, has more than 3,400 sq. ft. with 5 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. The stunning home features an all glass breezeway that separates the bedrooms from the rest of the home, as well as floor-to-ceiling windows in the main living space (open kitchen, living, and dining room) that provide a glimpse of the Boston skyline. Several bedrooms in the home also have floor-to-ceiling walls with a door that opens to the outside. The home last sold for $1.7 million in June 2016.\n171 Grove Street in Lexington, MA\nAlthough this home, which was designed and built by renowned architect William Mello for his own family in 1967, slightly differentiates from a traditional mid-century modern, it is one. This is very obvious when you see the more than 3,000 sq. ft. home’s interior. The 4-bedroom, 2 bathroom home offers ceiling-to-floor windows, a 3-season porch, and an updated kitchen that has managed to retain its original charm. The home sold in August 2015 for $920,000.\n5 Demar Road in Lexington, MA\nFeaturing the Techbuilt design that was created by Carl Koch (guided by Frank Lloyd Wright), this 1955 home has 2,051 sq. ft. of living space, including 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Techbuilt houses, like this one, consisted of four foot wide pieces that could be erected in just a few days. It has a simple shape, numerous glass walls, and is clad in a cedar siding. In 1957, the Techbuilt design was named the Best Development House by the American Institute of Architects. The home sold for $758,000 in September 2015.\n38 Peacock Farm Road in Lexington, MA\nDesigned by Walter Pierce, who received plenty of accolades for this particular design, and built in 1956, this home was recently placed on the National Registry of Historic Places. Spanning 2,100 sq. ft., it includes 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It features a rock garden that was placed just inside the glass foyer, along with walls of glass to ensure plenty of natural light is always shining through the house. The open kitchen, living, and dining room include a large brick fireplace that is situated right in the middle. It last sold for $805,000 in Aug 2015.\nFlansburgh House in Lincoln, ME\nConsidered a modern icon, Flansburgh House was designed and owned by prominent Modernist architect Earl Flansburgh in 1963. The 2,382 sq. ft., 4-bedroom, 2 bathroom home features floor-to-ceiling windows in almost every room of the house, as well as multiple skylights, 2 fireplaces, and a separate garage that connects to the house via an underground tunnel. In March 2014, the home was listed at $1.05 million in 2014. The final selling price is not available.\n319 Farm Lane in Westwood, MA\nAlthough the designer of this 3,250 sq. ft. home is unknown, it was built in 1958 and features a bold crimson exterior. The home includes 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, large rooms (with tons of windows, obviously), a brick fireplace, and an atrium with cathedral ceiling that was added in 2015. It sold for $1,045,450 in June 2016.\n24 Lorena Road in Winchester, MA\nBuilt in 1951, this single story home spans more than 3,400 sq. ft. and includes 5 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms. Unlike most mid-century modern homes, it does have a bit of a sloped roof to allow for cathedral ceilings in the main living space. The home includes numerous windows, though only those on the back are floor-to-ceiling, along with a huge skylight and a massive stone fireplace. The home was put on the market for $1,499,999 in March 2016, but it is no longer listed for sale.\n607 Main St. in Concord, MA\nDesigned and built in 1953 by Walter Gropius’s architectural firm, Architect’s Collaborative, this 3-story mid-century modern home includes 4 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms spread over 2,915 sq. ft. Just like the other homes on the list, it includes countless floor-to-ceiling windows and an open floor plan. Additionally, it has tons of built-in shelving throughout the home. It was completely renovated in 2008 using the original architect’s plans and sold for $1,525,000 in September 2015."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aaaab5b8-7d77-45a9-8ea7-5e6b9da0c4f9>","<urn:uuid:225e7b5f-f940-48d2-8155-ce40c328f713>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the early domestication stories of horses and dogs differ in terms of their initial roles and relationships with humans?","answer":"Dogs and horses had quite different early relationships with humans. Dogs began their relationship with humans around 30,000 years ago in Ice Age Europe, initially as friendly wolves that were allowed to feed off human scraps in exchange for friendship and protection. They evolved from a now-extinct wolf-like animal and formed a companionship-based bond with humans. In contrast, horses were initially primarily used as a food source by humans, as evidenced by Stone Age cave paintings from around 20,000 years ago. While the exact timing of horse domestication is debated, it occurred later than dog domestication, with some arguing it took place around 6,000 years ago by tribes near the Black Sea. Horses were then gradually developed into working animals for tasks like packing, pulling chariots, and eventually riding, moving beyond their initial role as just a food source.","context":["Humans and dogs have been the very best of pals for about 30,000 years at this point.\nResearch suggests the eternal bond was formed at some point in Ice Age Europe.\nThere are a lot of theories about how the human-canine relationship ultimately developed.\nMany seem to believe dogs are the descendants of a breed of wolves friendlier than most of their more blood-thirsty and aggressive compatriots.\nThese early wolf-dogs were permitted to assume the role of moochers, feeding off human scraps in exchange for their friendship and, at times, protection and security, among other functions.\nInterestingly, research also suggests dogs did not evolve from the gray wolves we see roaming the wild today, but present-day dogs and wolves are both likely descendants of a common wolf-like animal that went extinct thousands of years ago. Either way, they share common traits.\nToday, there are a multiplicity of dog breeds, and canines come in all shapes and sizes. But, regardless of whether we're talking about adorable little teacup Yorkies or muscly German Shepherds, it sometimes feels as if dogs act more like wolves than domesticated animals.\nThis is particularly evident when they pass other dogs on the street and end up going insane.\nAnyone who's ever owned a dog has likely experienced this. More often than not, your dog is the epitome of sweet and friendly when it's just you two, but instantaneously becomes vicious when another dog walks by. It's always somewhat shocking.\nDog behavior is often difficult to explain. There are any number of reasons your dog acts like another dog is Satan incarnate when walking by it on the street.\nPrimarily, it's likely because of the love your dog has for you and a desire to protect you from potential or ostensible threats.\nDogs are inherently social. After all, they've evolved from a wolf-like species. Wolves live in packs and depend on community for survival.\nSimilarly, your dog depends on you for survival. You're its primary source of socialization, companionship, affection and sustenance.\nThus, when a dog passes by an unfamiliar dog, it might perceive the other as a threat and display what is known as \"protective aggression.\"\nDogs show many forms of aggression, but protective aggression is exhibited when canines seek to protect a member of their social unit.\nIn this case, it's their owner. This is also why your dog might act somewhat aggressively toward other humans.\nDogs can actually instinctually detect a friendly face and are excellent at perceiving human emotions.\nAlternatively, your dog might be hostile toward other canines or animals out of fear or defensiveness. Dogs are programmed to protect themselves and fight back.\nThey also, at times, aim to preemptively intimidate perceived threats (\"The best defense is good offense\" approach).\nThis is perhaps why we frequently see smaller dogs tenaciously barking at larger ones, to the bigger dog's confusion.\nBut the main point here is when your dog is acting a little weird, it's often because canines have big hearts and truly love humans.\nThousands of years ago, humans and dogs formed an immortal friendship out of a need for companionship in an unforgiving world.\nSome argue the bond between humans and dogs is the reason civilization persisted because they helped one another survive.\nThe instincts that allowed this relationship to flourish are evident to this day, and it's part of what makes dogs such amazing animals and great friends.\nCitations: We Didnt Domesticate Dogs They Domesticated Us (National Geographic), Humans and dogs first became best friends around 30000 years ago claim scientists (Mirror), Aggression in Dogs (ASPCA), Dogs Not as Close Kin to Wolves as Thought (Discovery), Dogs can instinctively sense a friendly face (The Telegraph)","The Domestication of the Horse\nThe Domestication of the Horse\nThe horse is best described as a single species (Equus) that consists of various breeds. It is a hoofed, herbivorous mammal that has had a significant impact throughout the history of man. In fact, the horse has been referred to as \"the proudest conquest of man,\" by the French zoologist Georges Buffon (1707-1788). Its importance to the course of human history cannot be understated.\nThe relationship between horse and human is quite unique. Unlike most other large animals, the horse has been likened to a partner and friend. From its earliest history, the horse has served as a food source, aided agriculture by plowing fields and bringing in the harvest, helped to track and hunt down game, served as an important transport vehicle for goods and people, as well as an integral part of war and conquest, and has even provided many forms of recreational activities.\nThe earliest form of the horse, known as Hyrocotherium, or eohippus (dawn horse) is believed to have first appeared on Earth approximately 50 million years ago. It is characterized as a being a timid creature about the size of a dog. It lived in swampy areas and its range extended over much of the world. As the habitat of the early horse changed from swamp to forest to grasslands, it went through many evolutionary changes until it reached its present form, Equus, that is seen today. It should be noted that although the range of the horse initially spread throughout the world, it became extinct in the Western world some 8,000 years ago and was brought into Western hemisphere by the Spanish about 500 years ago.\nInitially, the wild horse was used as an important food source. This use is depicted in Stone Age cave paintings, such as those seen at Lascaux, France. These are believed to be nearly 20,000 years old and show the horse as an object of human prey. In order to make better use of the horse, it was domesticated. There is little agreement as to when this actually happened, but it is likely that other animals such as dogs and cattle were domesticated first. Some authorities argue that early Cro-Magnon farmers were nomadic and domesticated the horse for use as a pack animal. Others make the case that domestication took place 6,000 years ago by native tribes living on the steppes adjacent to the Black Sea. After this time, horses quickly became indispensable to the people who used them.\nAfter domestication, horses were still used as a ready food source for their meat and mare's milk. But there is recent evidence that humans began to ride horses soon after domestication. The minimum amount of equipment needed in order to control the horse would be some sort of bit or mouthpiece attached to reins. Archeological evidence shows horse teeth with bit wear dated as early as 4000 b.c. The early forms of bits were probably just ropes around the jaw, but more sophisticated bridle setups using antlers coupled with some other pliable material have been uncovered. This type of system would give the rider superior control over the horse and indicates that these early nomads were probably accomplished horsemen.\nEarly humans had seen the power of draft animals and the yoke was believed to be invented around 5000 b.c. to harness this source of power. In the Near East, cattle were used to drive sledges, but wheels were added in the next millennium. As horses were brought from Asia between 2000 and 3000 b.c., it became apparent that these animals were much faster than cattle and they quickly became the draft animal of choice. The yoke collar needed to be modified for use with horses because it restricted their breathing. Breast straps and other types of collars were invented in order to circumvent this problem. By the fifteenth century b.c., Egyptians developed a wishbone-shaped yoke, joined by straps, that enabled the horse to breath without restriction while being used as a draft animal.\nThe use of the horse for war and hunting was not overlooked at this time either. An early form of a chariot pulled by horses was developed for these purposes. It was a light, responsive vehicle that gave the driver much control. All metal bits were introduced for use on chariots around 1500 b.c. These made the use of the chariot in warfare more effective because they were stronger and gave greater control over the team of horses. At that time, warfare was still restricted to large chariot forces requiring disciplined horses that were in good condition. It would be another 500 years before men got directly on the horse and began forming cavalry units.\nSpeculation exists as to the reason why early humans generally preferred driving horses rather than riding them. One reason commonly given was the small stature of early breeds. However, given the fact that small horses are used today as effective mounts, this assumption is questionable. It may have been sociological factors that influenced this, as it seems the upper class had a great aversion to horse sweat, so it may have been undignified to come into direct contact with the horse.\nThe first group to make wide use of the horse for successful warfare was a united group of nomadic tribes from the Russian steppe, collectively called the Scythians, in 800 b.c. They mastered the technique of horseback archery and measured their wealth in terms of horses. As feared warriors, they influenced future generations with their demonstration of the horse's great power and advantage. By 700 b.c. riding horseback was much preferred over a chariot for both hunting and war.\nNative tribes of the steppes made most of the technological advances involving the horse, and these advances were brought west as they tribes invaded neighboring lands. The first horseshoes are no exception. Horseshoes of various types were used by these tribes, but it was the Romans who made wide use of them. Horseshoes were used by the Romans to reduce wear of the hooves, especially on paved roads. These iron shoes were known as \"hipposandals\" and were tied to hooves. The modern iron horseshoe, which is nailed to the hoof, first appeared around the fifth century a.d.\nThe advent of the saddle, a seat for the rider, was an important development. The leather saddle, developed in around the third century b.c., greatly improved the utility of the horse. In conjunction with this, the stirrup—used to support the rider's feet—was used to help in the control of the horse as well. Attila the Hun (406?-453) is credited with introducing the stirrup to Europe, giving rider's in the West much more maneuverability and control. Subsequent advances in both the saddle and stirrup occurred throughout early history, with modern stirrups and saddles bearing a striking resemblance to those of the Middle Ages.\nThroughout human history the horse has been extremely beneficial and has helped to shape society into what it is today. The horse has been an important component in recreation, travel, labor, and especially war. First and foremost, its domestication was absolutely essential for society to realize how useful and valuable the animal could be. Secondly, the invention of important technological advances, such as the invention of the collar, bit, bridle, stirrup, saddle, and horseshoe, allowed humans to make the horse much more functional, which was important in its rise to significance.\nThe first domesticated horses were used as food and their hide, but subsequent generations began to use the animal for other things. It seems likely that the next major step was to use the horse to lessen the work done by man. As the horse was harnessed as a power source, the need for human power was reduced. This had the effect of reducing human slavery, since slaves were used primarily as a major source of power.\nThe legacy of the importance of the horse in antiquity would not be complete unless its significance in waging war was discussed. Armies that used horses for conquest had distinct advantages over those that did not. During antiquity the world was overrun by various ethnic groups that relied heavily upon horses during battle. The initial preference was for two-man chariots, that consisted of a driver and an archer positioned to shoot arrows at the enemy. Later, men directly mounted horses for combat purposes. This gave well-trained armies using the horse a significant advantage and proved to be a key component of conquest for thousands of years. The horse figured significantly in the course of human history and those that could best harness its natural power played more dominant roles until the technological advances of machines made the horse relatively obsolete in modern countries.\nJAMES J.
