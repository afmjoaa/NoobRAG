{"question":"Could you compare the secularization of German territories in 1803 with the treatment of Jewish communities in Augsburg during the same period? Looking for a brief summary!","answer":"In 1803, there was a massive territorial restructuring in Germany through the Final Recess, which involved secularizing ecclesiastical territories and transferring approximately 73,000 km2 of church lands to secular rulers. During this same period, Augsburg's treatment of its Jewish community saw a significant shift - while Jews had previously only been allowed to visit the city for day business, in 1803 Jewish bankers were officially permitted to settle there to help address the city's financial problems. The change became more concrete in 1806 when Augsburg lost its status as a free imperial city and was incorporated into Bavaria, effectively eliminating anti-Jewish restrictions, though this wasn't officially recognized until 1861.","context":["German mediatization (German: deutsche Mediatisierung) refers to the major territorial restructuring that took place between 1802 and 1814 in Germany and the surrounding region (until 1806 the Holy Roman Empire) by means of the mass mediatization and secularization of a large number of Imperial Estates: ecclesiastical principalities, free imperial cities, secular principalities and other minor self-ruling entities that lost their independent status and were absorbed into the remaining states.\nIn the strict sense of the word, mediatization consists in the subsumption of an immediate (German: unmittelbar) state into another state, thus becoming mediate (German: mittelbar), while generally leaving the dispossessed ruler with his private estates and a number of privileges and feudal rights, such as low justice. For convenience, historians use the term mediatization for the entire restructuring process that took place at the time, whether the mediatized states survived in some form or lost all individuality. The secularization of ecclesiastical states took place concurrently with the mediatization of free imperial cities and other secular states.\nThe mass mediatization and secularization of German states that took place at the time was not initiated by Germans. It came under relentless military and diplomatic pressure from revolutionary France and Napoleon. It constituted the most extensive redistribution of property and territories in German history prior to 1945.\nThe two highpoints of the process were the mediatization/secularization of ecclesiastical principalities and free imperial cities in 1802-1803, and the mediatization of secular principalities in 1806.\n- 1 Final Recess of February 1803\n- 2 Secularization\n- 3 Mediatization\n- 4 Consequences\n- 5 See also\n- 6 Sources\n- 7 References and notes\n- 8 External links\nFinal Recess of February 1803\nThe Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation (German: Reichsdeputationshauptschluss Latin: Recessus principalis deputationis imperii) was a resolution passed on 25 February 1803 by the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. It proved to be the last significant law enacted by the Empire before its dissolution in 1806.\nBased on a plan agreed in June 1802 between France and Austria, and broad principles outlined in Article 7 the Treaty of Lunéville of 1801, the law established a major redistribution of territorial sovereignty within the Empire, to compensate numerous German princes for their possessions to the west of the Rhine that had been annexed by France as a result of the wars of the French Revolution. The Treaty had referred only to the compensation of \"hereditary princes\", which excluded from any claim to compensation the ecclesiastical princes (prince-electors, prince-bishops, imperial abbots), Free Imperial Cities and Imperial Knights who had also been dispossessed.\nThe Final Recess was ratified unanimously by the Imperial Diet in March, 1803, and was approved by the emperor, Francis II, the following month. However, the emperor made a formal reservation in respect of the reallocation of votes within the Imperial Diet, as the balance between Protestant and Catholic states had been shifted heavily in the former's favour.\nFrom the re-establishment of the Holy Roman Empire by the Salian and Saxon Emperors in the 10th and 11th centuries, the feudal system had turned Germany and northern Italy into a vast network of territories of various sizes each with its own specific privileges, titles and autonomy. To help administer Germany in the face of growing decentralization and local autonomy, many bishoprics, abbeys and convents throughout Germany were granted temporal estates by successive Emperors. The personal appointment of bishops by the Emperors had sparked the investiture controversy, and in its aftermath the emperors were unable to use the bishops for this end. Following this, some of the bishops and abbots had begun to run their territories as temporal lords as opposed to spiritual lords. In the course of the Reformation, several of the prince-bishoprics were secularized, mostly to the benefit of Protestant princes. In the later 16th century the Counter-Reformation attempted to reverse some of these secularizations, and the question of the fates of secularized territories became an important one in the Thirty Years War (1618–1648). In the end, the Peace of Westphalia confirmed the secularizations which had already occurred, but also stabilized the situation.\nIn 1794, the armies of revolutionary France overran the Rhineland, and by the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, the Holy Roman emperor, Francis I of Austria, recognized French annexation of all imperial territories west of the Rhine river. By granting them new realms, the emperor sought to compensate the now stateless or diminished monarchs who lost their lands. The only available lands were those held by the Prince-Bishops, so most were secularised and dispersed amongst the monarchs of Germany.\nThe territory of secularized ecclesiastical principalities was usually annexed whole to a neighboring secular principality or, in the case of several prince-abbeys, granted to one of the princes or imperial counts whose lands on the west bank of the Rhine had been annexed by France. Only three survived for a relatively short time as non-secular states: the Archbishopric of Mainz, which became the Archbishopric of Regensburg, incorporating the latter bishopric and part of the archbishopric, and the lands of the Teutonic Knights and Knights of Saint John. Also of note is the former Archbishopric of Salzburg, which was secularised as a duchy with an increased territorial scope, and was also made an electorate.\nMonasteries and abbeys lost their means of existence as they had to abandon their lands, and most were closed. The remaining ecclesiastical states were also secularized after the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. The lands of the Knights of Saint John were secularized in 1806, Regensburg was annexed by Bavaria in 1809, and in the same year Napoleon dissolved the Teutonic Knights and gave their lands to neighboring princes, particularly the King of Württemberg.\nThe outcome of the Final Recess of 1803 was the most extensive redistribution of property in German history before 1945. Approximately 73,000 km2 of ecclesiastical territory, with some 2.36 million inhabitants and 12.72 million guildens per annum of revenue was transferred to new rulers. The rationale behind the Final Recess had been to compensate those rulers who had lost territory to France, but considerably more territory was gained through massive secularization: Baden received over seven times as much territory as it had lost, Prussia nearly five times. Hanover gained the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück, even though it had lost nothing. Austria also did very well.\nThe position of the established Roman Catholic Church in Germany, the Reichskirche, was not only diminished, it was nearly destroyed. The Church lost its constitutional role in the Empire; most of the Catholic universities were closed, as well as thousands of monasteries; and many Catholic foundations closed down. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss did to German land ownership what the Revolution had done to France.\nBishops and archbishops\nAbbeys, convents, and provostries\n- Kaisheim (Kaisersheim)\n- Odenheim and Bruchsal\n- Rot an der Rot\n- St. Blaise\n- St. Cornelimünster\n- St. Emmeran\n- St. Gall\n- St. George in Isny\n- St. Ludger\n- St. Peter\n- St. Ulrich and St. Afra\n- Salem (Salmansweiler)\nAlthough the number of German states had been steadily decreasing since the Thirty Years' War, there still remained approximately 200 states by the advent of the French republic. The defeat of the First Coalition resulted in the secularization of the ecclesiastical states and the annexation by France of all lands west of the Rhine.\nAllies of Napoleon obtained gains in both territory and status on a number of occasions in the following years.\nMediatization transferred the sovereignty of small secular states to their larger neighbours. In addition to about 100 principalities, all but a handful of the Imperial cities would also be annexed to their neighbours.\nIn 1803, most of the free cities in Germany were mediatised. On 12 June 1806, Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine to extend and help secure the eastern border of France. In reluctant recognition of Napoleon's dismemberment of imperial territory, on 6 August 1806, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II declared the Empire abolished, and claimed as much power as he could retain as ruler of the Habsburg realms. To gain support from the more powerful German states, the former Holy Roman Emperor accepted, and Napoleon encouraged, the mediatisation by those that remained of their minor neighbouring states.\nBefore the Battle of Waterloo and the final abdication of Napoleon in 1815, the Congress of Vienna was held from 1814 to 1815 by the Great Powers to redraw the borders of Europe. It was decided that the mediatised principalities, free cities and secularised states would not be recreated. Instead their former rulers were to enjoy an improved aristocratic status, being deemed equal to the still-reigning monarchs for marital purposes, and entitled to claim compensation for their losses. But it was left to each of the annexing states to compensate mediatised dynasties, and the latter had no international right to redress if dissatisfied with the new regime's reimbursement decisions.\nMediatized Principalities and Counties\n- Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym: Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Hoym 1806\n- Arenberg: Prince of Arenberg 1810\n- Aspremont-Lynden: Count of Aspremont-Lynden 1806\n- Auersperg: Prince of Auersperg 1806\n- Bentheim: Count of Bentheim-Bentheim and Steinfurt 1806;

For varying reasons, Aspremont-Lynden, Bentinck, Bretzenheim, Limburg-Styrum and Waldeck-Limpurg are also sometimes excluded. Hesse-Homburg was never considered sovereign by Hesse-Darmstadt and therefore was not technically mediatised, and Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) was annexed into the Kingdom of Westphalia but later had its sovereignty restored. The Schönburgs had been mediatised to the Elector of Saxony in the 18th century and were only counted amongst the Mediatised Houses at the Electors' insistence.\nMediatized free imperial cities\nMost of the mediatizations occurred in 1806 after the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine. Also mediatised 1806–1814 were several states created by Napoleon for his relatives and close allies. These include:\n- Prince of Aschaffenburg 1806\n- Grand Duke of Frankfurt 1814\n- King of Westphalia 1813\n- Grand Duke of Würzburg 1814\nThe only free cities in Germany not abolished in 1803 were:\n- Augsburg (abolished 1805)\n- Frankfurt (abolished 1866)\n- Lübeck (abolished 1937)\n- Nuremberg (abolished 1806)\nLater mediatizations were:\n- Arenberg (annexed to France in 1810, and not re-established in 1814)\n- Isenburg and Leyen (mediatised in 1814 by the Congress of Vienna for being too loyal to Napoleon)\n- Salm (several states of Salm survived to 1811 and 1813)\n- Stolberg-Stolberg and Stolberg-Wernigerode (annexed by Prussia in 1815).\n|This section does not cite any references (sources). (October 2014)|\nThe mediatization brought about a massive change to the political map of Germany. Literally hundreds of states[dubious ] were eliminated, with only around forty surviving. A number of the surviving states made significant territorial gains (most notably Baden, Bavaria, and Hesse-Darmstadt); and Baden, Hesse-Kassel, and Württemberg gained status by being made electorates (to replace three that had been lost in the changes). Of the imperial cities, only Augsburg, Bremen, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Lübeck, and Nuremberg survived as independent entities.\n- Confederation of the Rhine\n- Congress of Vienna\n- Holy Roman Empire\n- Free imperial city\n- French period\n- Napoleon I\n- Treaty of Campo Formio\n- Texts on Wikisource:\n- Arenberg, Jean Engelbert.

Documentary evidence of Jews living in Augsburg dates from 1212. Records from the second half of the 13th century show a well-organized community, and mention the Judenhaus (1259), the synagogue and cemetery (1276), the ritual bathhouse, and \"dancehouse\" for weddings (1290). The Jews were mainly occupied as vintners, cattledealers, and moneylenders. The Augsburg municipal charter of 1276, determining the political and economic status of the Jewish residents, was adopted by several cities in south Germany. Regulation of the legal status of Augsburg Jewry was complicated by the rivalry between the episcopal and municipal powers. Both contended with the emperor for jurisdiction over the Jews and enjoyment of the concomitant revenues. Until 1436 lawsuits between Christians and Jews were adjudicated before\na mixed court of 12 Christians and 12 Jews. In 1298 and 1336 the Jews of Augsburg were saved from massacre through the intervention of the municipality. During the *Black Death (1348–49), many were massacred and the remainder expelled from the city. The emperor granted permission to the bishop and burghers to readmit them in 1350 and 1355, and the community subsequently recovered to some extent. Later, however, it became so impoverished by the extortions of the emperor that the burghers could no longer see any profit in tolerance. In 1434–36 Jews in Augsburg were forced to wear the yellow *badge . The community, then numbering about 300 families, dissolved within a few years; by 1340 the last Jews had left Augsburg. The Augsburg town council paid Albert II of Austria 900 gulden to compensate him for the loss of his *servi camerae . Thereafter Jews were only permitted to visit Augsburg during the day on business. They were also granted the right of asylum in times of war. From the late 16th century Jewish communities existed in the close-by villages Pfersee, Kriegshaber, and, temporarily, Oberhausen.\nIn the late Middle Ages the Augsburg yeshivah made an important contribution to the development of the *pilpul method of study and analysis of the Talmud. The variant of the pilpul method evolved in Augsburg is referred to as the \"Augsburg ḥillukim.\" The talmudist Jacob *Weil lived in Augsburg between 1412 and 1438. While some Hebrew pamphlets were printed in Augsburg by Erhard Oeglin as early as 1514 on the initiative of the apostate J. Boeschenstein, a Hebrew press was established in 1532 by Ḥayyim b. David Shaḥor, the wandering printer from Prague, together with his son Isaac and son-in-law Joseph b. Yakar who had learned printing in Venice. Between that year and 1540 nine books appeared including Rashi's Pentateuch commentary (1533); an illustrated Passover Haggadah (1534); Jacob b. Asher's Turim (1536); a Melokhim Buch, in Yiddish (1543); a maḥzor; and a siddur. In 1530 *Joseph Joselmann of Rosheim convened a synod of German community representatives in Augsburg, the seat of the Reichstag (see *Germany ). An organized Jewish community was again established in Augsburg in 1803. Jewish bankers settled there by agreement with the municipality in an endeavor to redress the city's fiscal deficit. In practice, the anti-Jewish restrictions in Augsburg were eliminated in 1806, with the abrogation of the city's special status and its incorporation into Bavaria; however, the new Jewish civic status was not officially recognized until 1861. In 1871 Augsburg was the meeting place of a rabbinical assembly dealing with liturgical reform. The Jewish population increased from 56 in 1801 to 1,156 in 1900. It numbered 1,030 in 1933. In 1938, the magnificent synagogue, dedicated in 1917, was burned down by the Nazis. In late 1941, after emigration and flight to other German cities, the last 170 Jews were herded into a ghetto, with 129 of them sent to Piaski in Poland in April 1942 and the rest mostly to the Riga ghetto and Theresienstadt. In the immediate postwar period, a camp was established in Augsburg to house displaced Jews. A few weeks after the liberation, services were resumed in the badly damaged synagogue by survivors of the Holocaust and Jewish soldiers of the U.S. Army, and the community was eventually reestablished. The synagogue was restored and rededicated in 1985. As a result of the immigration of Jews from the Former Soviet Union, the number of community members rose from 199 in 1989 to 1,619 in 2003.\nR.

{"question":"How has the technology for determining location at sea evolved from historical navigation methods to modern GPS, and what are the technical principles behind GPS accuracy?","answer":"Historically, sea navigation relied on astronomical observations, with navigators measuring the Sun's and stars' positions to determine latitude, while longitude required accurate timekeeping using chronometers developed by John Harrison in the 1700s. Modern GPS technology uses 24 earth-orbiting satellites at 11,000-12,000 miles from Earth, each transmitting position and time data. GPS receivers determine location through trilateration by calculating distances to multiple satellites based on signal travel time. While basic GPS accuracy is 10-20 meters, differential GPS and WAAS technology can improve accuracy to within 3 meters by using ground-based reference stations to correct signal inaccuracies.","context":["Part of a high school course on astronomy, Newtonian mechanics and spaceflight\nby David P.

But in the days of the sailing ships, it was a very practical field--even one of strategic importance.\nBetween 1500 and 1800, when trading monopolies on spices, tea, chinaware, silk and other precious goods were hotly contested, and the navies of Spain, Britain, France, Holland and other countries competed for mastery of the oceans--in those days, sea-captains needed astronomy for finding their way at sea.\nGreat Britain established and supported the Royal Observatory in Greenwich (outside London), headed by the \"Astronomer Royal,\" while the French king created a rival institution, the Observatory of Paris. Sea officers learned to measure the positions of the Sun and of stars, and to use them in determining position in mid-ocean.\nTo measure latitude measuring (or deducing) the highest point in the Sun's daily motion across the sky gave the required information. We will come to that. (Note: An early instrument for such measurements, the cross staff, is described elsewhere in \"Stargazers.\").\nTo measure longitude, however, navigators needed to accurately know the time. Some used a small telescope to observe eclipses of the moons of Jupiter, whose times could be tabulated in advance, enabling them to set their clocks and thus determine their longitude. This method worked well on land, allowing geographers to accurately derive latitudes and longitudes on land and helping map the known world.\nIt was much harder in mid-ocean, however. The problem was finally solved by John Harrison, a British clockmakers, who constructed the first \"chronometers,\" clocks accurate enough for the job. (They were about as accurate as modern wrist-watches, which count the vibrations of a tiny quartz crystal; but in the 1700s, such accuracy was at the cutting edge of technology.) Anyone looking for more of the story may read the book [put on blackboard] \"Longitude\" by Dava Sobel, or look up on the web: The Discovery of Longitude by Jonathan Medwin.\nThis brief survey can only give a very quick overview of methods used in navigation.\nThen go over section 5a of \"Stargazers.\" The questions below may be used in the presentation, the review afterwards or both\n-- How can the help you find your latitude λ at night?\nIf the question arises: we can also calculate the small difference between the positions of the pole and the pole star, and take it into account\n-- Suppose the date is the equinox, March 21 or September 22. How can the noontime Sun give you your latitude λ?\n-- How would you measure that angle of the noonday Sun?\n-- Suppose the date is the winter solstice, December 21. How can the noontime Sun give you your latitude λ?\n-- What if this formula for latitude in the Northern Hemisphere gives a negative number?\n-- Suppose the date is the summer solstice, June 21. How can the noontime Sun give you your latitude λ.\n-- What if this formula gives an angle greater than 90 degrees?\nMention to the class that for other dates, formulas and tables exist which derive the local latitude from the height above the horizon of the noontime Sun.\n-- Besides observations of the Sun, what additional information is needed to measure longitude?\n-- What is a chronometer?\n--How did Robert Wood, sailing across the North Atlantic in World War 1, determine his ship's latitude, even though it was kept secret?\n--How did Robert Wood determine his ship's secret longitude, knowing the date was that of the Fall equinox, and having noted the time of sunset on the ship's clock? The ship was sailing east, from America to England, and its clock was presumably set (by time zones) a known number of hours ahead of the time at its port of departure.\n(The teacher might fill in the details below)\nSuppose that by the clock, when the Sun set at the ship, the time at the port of departure was 3:28 pm. The Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours, which comes to 360/24 = 15° per hour. Wood knew that it would only set 2:32 = 2.5333 hours later at the port of departure. During that time, the Earth would rotate\nTherefore the longitude of the ship was 38° further east than the longitude of the port from which it started, which could be looked up on an atlas.\nThe light was channeled inside a 42-foot wooden tube, about 6 inches across, but spiders got inside and spun their webs. So Wood cleaned the tube: he opened the door at one end, shoved the family cat into it (\"not without a struggle\"), then quickly shut the door again. The poor cat had no choice but to run to the other end, in the process brushing away the cobwebs.)\n--Who was Fridtjof Nansen?\nHave a student find out about Nansen and report on it before the class.\n[In addition to leading the \"Fram\" expedition, Nansen also crossed Greenland on skis, alone, was active in establishing the independence of Norway (from Sweden) and earned the Nobel peace prize for his work in resettling refugees from a bitter war between Greece and Turkey in the years after World War I.]\n--How can a radio help in determining longitude?\n-- What is the Global Positioning System (GPS)?\nHas anyone used or seen a GPS receiver? What is it like? What does it show? (It can show latitude and longitude, your changing position on a small map, and much more.)\nBack to the Lesson Plan Index Back to the Master Index\nGuides to teachers...

It’s also amazingly creepy technology. It’s a weird thing, having a satellite somewhere in space following your every move, allowing you to pinpoint your exact position on the globe within a few feet. It’s strange being “watched” by something you cannot see. Despite that, there is an undeniable usefulness in GPS, which has transformed the way people get around. These days it’s almost impossible to get lost, as GPS serves as a constant companion that always knows the way to your destination. Travelers are never again alone – and not only can they find their way, but they can get information on places they may want to stop en route, their speed of travel, and the time. There is a strong sense of comfort in having a GPS system when in an unfamiliar area, since nothing is unfamiliar to it.\nIn our car dashboards, in stand-alone handheld units and in our cell phones, GPS receivers come in all shapes and forms. All a person needs is an unobstructed view of space and their receiver of choice to do away with nearly every previous method of directional navigation. Put away your map and forget that sack of bread crumbs.\nThe big question – how does it work? How does your GPS receiver know where you are? How is it so accurate? What is making it function? Today we’ll take a simple look at GPS receivers and what makes them work to understand how these fancy little units make travel so easy.\nGPS, or Global Positioning Satellite, is a technology that came out of the 1970s as an effort to develop a system for detecting ballistic missile submarines. They conceived a system that would not be impacted by weather, could not be jammed and had infinite range. It was built in the 1980s, and first moved to the public sector in the 1990s.\nThe result is what we have today: 24 earth-orbiting satellites that are now open to public use for GPS purposes. There are actually 27 of them, but three of them just hang out and aren’t used – unless one of the other 24 fails. They are all owned by the United States. While all these space-based satellites obviously involve some massive complicated technology that goes beyond the scientific and financial comprehension of most people, the fundamental methods by which GPS satellites function in relation to receivers is relatively simple.\nEach GPS satellite is out there at a distance of 11,000-12,000 miles (different sources cite different exact distances), weighs two tons, is a little over 18 feet long and orbits the earth in 12 hours. Their positioning is designed so that at any given time, there are at least four satellites available to any particular location.\nGPS receivers require you to be outside. Sometimes, even exterior factors can block GPS signal, like super tall trees in the forest or standing near skyscrapers. It does, however, work all around the world, 24/7, in all weather, with no subscription fee.\nEvery GPS satellite transmits data about its current position and the current time. The time is controlled by the atomic clock and the position is based on where the satellite is in its rotation. All 24 of the GPS satellites are synchronized, so they all transmit this information at the same time. This all moves to your receiver at the speed of light.\nWith all that information, we come to the basic function of the GPS receiver: to locate as many satellites as it can at the time and figure out the distance between itself and the satellites. It uses this information and a process called trilateration to determine its own location. The more satellites it can connect to, the more precise its self-positioning will be.\nTrilateration is quite a word. Just saying it would be meaningless without a little explanation. It is a process of deduction. I’ll use the familiar city-based example method for explaining the basic process of how the receiver translates distances to satellites into your own location:\nSay I tell you you’re 370 miles from New York City. That’s useless, because you could be 370 miles in any direction. But then say I tell you you’re 130 miles from Cleveland, Ohio. This is a little more helpful, because now you at least know you’re somewhere between Cleveland and New York. It helps establish a direction, but still isn’t very specific. Then say I tell you you’re 230 miles from Charleston, West Virginia. If you drew a line out from all these cities and their appropriate distances on a map, they’d all intersect at one place – Pittsburgh. That’s very basic trilateration. A GPS receiver works similarly, taking the distances between the satellites that are orbiting the earth at different angles to trilaterate and figure out its own position. This is why when you can access more satellites, you can get a more specific positioning. Read on to see exactly how your GPS receiver determines its distance from the satellites.\nGPS receivers range in price for a variety of reasons. One of which is the number of receivers within the unit. Better units have several, which allow them to pick up more satellite signals simultaneously. Because not all the satellites are the same distance away, the signals don’t hit the receivers all at the exact same moment. Better units can handle this easier by utilizing multiple receivers.\nRadio waves handle the communication. Radio waves are super quick, moving at about 186,000 miles per second. The satellites aren’t even 1/10th of that distance from Earth. But, because the receiver has a super scientific computer brain, it is able to determine the satellite’s distance by clocking how long it took the signal to arrive. Measuring distance with time – how classy! It’s actually pretty complicated. Get ready, more explanation is necessary… I’ll keep it simple.\nSatellites emit a code. Your receiver emits the same code at the same time. The code emitted by the satellite is nabbed by the receiver and compared to its own code. There will be some lag, because the signal from the satellite took time to arrive from space. The receiver multiplies the lag by the speed of light to determine its travel time, and thus the distance the satellite is from the receiver. Got it? Good. No? Read it again.\nAnother thing the receiver does is store information about where all the satellites should be at any given time. They do move in fairly set patterns, after all. If any changes are made to the satellites’ orbits, the Department of Defense updates the information which gets sent to your GPS receiver.\nOf course, all of this doesn’t always work out so peachy keen. Nothing is perfect, believe it or not, not even space-to-palm radio communications! Fortunately, your GPS receiver is handy at fixing problems and fixing errors. Most handheld GPS units have a 10-20 meter accuracy, which is due to little bits of calculation error that make things slightly less than exact. This is where one of the other factors that change GPS cost come into play. Better receivers have differential compensation technology that can fine-tune that accuracy down to as little as three meters.\nInterference in the radio signal, slow-down as it passes through the atmosphere, bad information and other problems can cause the data to be faulty. Oh thank heaven for differential GPS.\nDifferential GPS uses a stationary receiver station to correct inaccuracies from the rover units in space. The system knows where it’s located, and it doesn’t move. If your receiver has DGPS capability, it can receive information from these systems, which will provide signal correction information to your unit. This increases accuracy because of the communication with a fixed-point signal.\nThere is also Wide Area Augmentation Systems (WAAS), which do a similar thing. It is a product of the Federal Aviation Administration that uses networked ground-based reference stations in North America and Hawaii to send correction messages to GPS receiver units. These correction technologies are something that could deserve its own article, and perhaps someday we’ll look at it in-depth.\nOnce all of the above information is received, calculated and corrected, your GPS receiver is able to figure out its latitude and longitude on the earth. This is crucial, because this is the information that allows your receiver to create a visual map display that is the heart of the device. What good would GPS information be if you couldn’t see it on the map?\nYour receiver is in unending communication with the orbiting satellites. Of course, everything we’ve talked about so far happens in the blink of an eye, thousands of times per second. Your GPS receiver can use this constant flow of data to give you turn-by-turn instructions on the road, visual representation of your position on the map, and it can even judge things like your travel speed and travel time. Constant communication = constant information = constant calculation = a fluid stream of data that appears on your screen.\nThe GPS unit is able to figure out driving routes for you based on the maps stored within its system. The basic rule of travel is that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Of course, roads don’t travel in straight lines, but your GPS is programmed to determine the most direct route between your latitude and longitude and the latitude and longitude of where you want to be using that concept. It picks the roads that get you there with the least amount of winding, allow the quickest driving speeds and all that jazz – just like directions given by any other computer system like Google Maps or MapQuest. Once the positioning data is in your GPS receiver, it’s the job of the software to calculate the route.\nThose 24 satellites handle all GPS positioning in the world. From the UPS guy to some random family on their way to Georgia, everyone is finding their way much easier thanks to GPS technology.\nHopefully now you understand a little better how satellites 11,000 miles away can pinpoint your location within a few feet. It’s an amazing process that has revolutionized travel and changed the way we interact with foreign areas.

{"question":"What are the financial implications of non-compliance with DOT regulations, and how do safety violations affect a carrier's operating status?","answer":"Operating without proper authority can result in carriers being put Out of Service and subject to substantial fines. Specific violations can lead to penalties ranging from $250 to $5,591 for operating without proper licensing, up to $1,239 per day (maximum $12,383) for denying access to documentation, up to $3,760 for falsifying records, and up to $79,976 for hazardous material violations. Additionally, failing a safety audit requires submitting a corrective action plan (CAP), and failure to submit the CAP within the specified timeframe results in loss of FMCSA registration. Companies must also maintain proper insurance coverage, as FMCSA will only issue authority after proper insurance forms have been submitted.","context":["Operating Authority is a motor carrier’s right to operate a commercial motor vehicle to transport goods/passengers for – hire. It is a business license for a motor carrier or broker. As a business owner, you need to comply with all federal and state regulations to run your business legally. Also, you need to comply with the financial responsibility (e.g., insurance), process agent designations, and MCS-150 completion (for USDOT Number).\nIf you operate without authority, you risk damaging your own business. Carriers operating without an authority or beyond the scope of their authority can be put Out of Service. A company operating without authority is also subject to fines.\nHere are the operating authority types:\nYou are required to register as a Household Goods Broker if you contribute any of the following:\n– Estimates (binding and non-binding)\n– Packing and unpacking items at personal residences\n– Loading and unloading at personal residences\n– Motor Passenger Carrier\n– Non – North America – Domiciled Motor Carrier\n– Freight Forwarder (FF)\n– Mexico-based Carrier for Motor Carrier Authority to Operate beyond US Municipalities and Commercial Zones on the US-Mexico Border (MX)\n– Mexican Certificate of Registration for Foreign Motor Carriers and Foreign Motor Private Carriers\nThe USDOT Number is a unique identifier when collecting and monitoring a company’s safety information acquired during compliance reviews, audits, inspections and crash investigations. The USDOT Number is a unique number for your business used to access your company’s safety information. Also, commercial, intrastate and unsafe materials carriers who haul types and quantities requiring a safety permit, must register for a USDOT Number.\nThere are two options for filing the necessary forms to obtain a USDOT Number:\nThe MCS-150, Motor Carrier Identification Report asks for specific information about your motor carrier operation. The information you list on your MCS-150 also provides the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) with the details of your operation.\nNeed a help with filling the documents? DOT Operating Authority’s team is ready to do all the paperwork for you. Give us a call at 1 – 888 – NOW – GETDOT.\nYou are required to have a USDOT Number if you have a vehicle that:\nTo apply for a USDOT Number, your company must be involved in transportation, traffic or trade between states or:\nWe have a free quote that will help you get in touch with DOT Operating Authority agency. Just fill the quote and our agents will do the paperwork of getting a USDOT Number at our earliest convenience. You can also contact us by calling at (855) – 327 – 8176.\nSometimes, in addition to a USDOT Number, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) requires that a trucking company has an MC Number, which is a type of operating authority as well.\nYou need to have an MC Number if your company:\nThere are several types of FMCSA authority, such as MC, MX and FF. Possibly, you are going to need more than one operating authority to be able to run your business legally, depending on what kind of operations you run and what cargo you hold.\nIf you are a new applicant and do not have a USDOT Number yet, you will be registered through Unified Registration System (URS). In that case, you will need to wait for 20 – 25 business days to get your operating authority. If you are already registered and have a USDOT Number just want to add operating authority, the process takes longer – up to 60 business days.\nWith DOT Operating Authority it will be simple for you to comply with the FMCSA regulations in every way. Our agents will always provide you with updates and all the information you need. Give us a call at 1 – 888 – NOW – GETDOT or (855) 327-8176.\nThis is another type of operating authority that is required for Mexico – domiciled motor carriers. If you are crossing the U.S. border, it is a must to have a valid FMCSA authorized MX Number and a FMCSA Certificate of Registration for commercial – zone operations. The time it takes to obtain an MX Number differs, depending on the application submitted and the means by which the application is submitted.\nIf you are a motor carrier with a home base in California and operate solely within the state borders, legally you do not need to have a USDOT Number legally. However, if you plan on operating interstate, getting a CA DOT number becomes a requirement.\nIt does not matter what your home base state is, DOT requirements stay the same. That means that you are going to need a DOT number if:\nWhen you are starting your trucking business, it might be confusing and take a lot of time. But do not worry – DOT Operating Authority will do all the paperwork for you. Call us at (888) NOW – GETDOT or (877) 702 – 9746.\nFreight Forwarder is a company that is specialized in managing storage and shipping of merchandise. It usually ships under its own bills of loading and its agents or associates at the destination provides document delivery. Basically, a freight forwarder is a company that manages the importing and exporting of goods. The answer to the question about who needs an FF Number is simple. If you are a freight forwarder then you need an FF Number. You cannot operate without it.\nUnified Carrier Registration is a base – state program that replaces the Single Registration System. Companies (SSRS) and individuals that operate business motor vehicles interstate are required to register their businesses. The registration should be in the participating state. An annual fee is required as well.\nAll the registered members must pay their UCR fee within in the state they inhabit primarily. However, some states are not taking part in the program. The following states: Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Wyoming and D.C. If you live in a state that does not take part, it is a must to pay the UCR fee in a neighboring participating state. If you do not pay your UCR fee, it will damage your business.\nYou should register under International Registration Plan if:\nA carrier or other regulated entity can change their name or address, or other details in their record, they should update their US DOT and operating authority record with FMCSA in a timely manner. Any detail changes must be updated such as an addition of a truck or tractor. In addition, FMCSA takes all entities under its jurisdiction to update their information every two years.\nWhen the time to update comes, you do not want to ignore it or put it off. Failure to update the MCS-150 could result in a $1,000 per day fine for every day it is not renewed, and the fine covers up to $10,000.\n|You need to file by last day of:||If your USDOT number ends with:|\nThere is much confusion sometimes regarding the renewal of your registration. If you need to request a reinstating of motor carrier operating authority, you can find help here, at DOT Operating Authority. The exception for this is if you are a passenger carrier that has been put out – of – service (OOS) for being an “imminent hazard”, this can also occur due to a final unsatisfactory safety rating (“UNSAT/UNFIT”). In this case, you cannot reinstate your registration; it is a must that you re-apply for operating authority.\nPlease note: before you request a reinstatement, it is mandatory to have your BOC-3 form. Visit our insurance requirements page to get more information.\nMany small details and errors can conclude in a filing failure. This can happen due to misstatements, name issues or omission. At DOT Operating Authority you can trust your documents to fill in. Our team will help with all 50 states corporation filling and make your paperwork as it needs to be.\nEvery state has a different set of laws and regulations in place. In most cases, no two states are the same. Due to that, you must get familiar with the set of rules present when dealing with each state’s Corp Filing. To find out what you need to do to form a corporation in your state, choose your state from here.\nCorporations differ from other kinds of business entities. A corporation is an independent legal entity, meaning it is separate from its owners, managers and other people who control it. A limited liability company (LLC) is a legal structure whereby the members of the company cannot be held personally liable for the company’s debts. Limited liability companies are, essentially, hybrid entities that merge the characteristics of a corporation and a partnership or a sole proprietorship. While the limited liability feature is like that of a corporation, the availability of flow – through taxation to the members of an LLC is a feature of partnerships.\nA C Corporation is a business entity, incomes of which are taxed separately from its owners. The owners are shareholders who choose a board of directors for managing the company. They have limited liability and are not personally liable for their business debts. They also cannot be sued for corporation’s misdeeds.\nHighway Use Tax, also called heavy vehicle use tax, is an annual fee you should pay if you operate a vehicle with a taxable gross weight of over 55,000 pounds on public highways.\nYou can claim the exempt status of your vehicle if it is:\nYour IFTA tax return must have a postmark before or on the due date when sending it. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the next business day is the final filing date. If you do not receive your return at least 14 days before the due date, call for a replacement.\nTax Return Reporting Quarters\nIf you do not file a quarterly tax return, pay the tax you owe or file your return by the due date, you may be subject to penalty and interest charges. The penalty is $50, or ten percent of the total net tax due with your return, whichever is more.\nMeeting all the insurance requirements is the main goal in every business, be you a motor carrier or a broker. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will only issue an authority after the proper insurance forms have been submitted.\nThere are two main types of physical damage coverage available on an insurance policy:\nEach type only pays for specific causes of damage to your vehicle, and both can be purchased separately. Adding or removing either of these types of coverage could result in increasing or reducing your insurance rates. In conclusion, the more coverage you have, the more your insurance costs.","For new motor carriers, and really any motor carrier, understanding what it takes to pass a safety audit is key. You’ll want to take a few proactive steps if you are a new carrier, but even if you have been in operation for a while, it starts with understanding audits in general.\nIn this post, we’ll break down what DOT safety audits are, what happens if you fail one, and what you can do to ensure your organization has what it needs to pass with flying colors.\nAccording to the FMCSA, a safety audit is a review of a motor carrier’s records, designed to verify that a carrier has basic safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, and Hazardous Materials Regulations.\nSince the FMCSA has made it very clear that workplace safety is of the highest importance, failure to follow proper procedure can lead to a loss in FMCSA registration and a heap of fines. These are consequences best avoided, which is why it’s so important to have documentation readily available.\nFirst of all, safety audits and safety inspections are not the same. DOT safety audits are performed less frequently and assess your organization’s overall compliance with regulations and safety protocol.\nWhen it comes to DOT inspections, these may fall in 8 different categories, like a level 1 DOT inspection, completed roadside by a safety officer. These inspections typically also examine vehicle-related items like Cargo Securement and others.\nAs a new motor carrier, you can expect to undergo a safety audit within the first 12 months of operation as part of the new entrant program. These are commonly referred to as new entrant safety audits.\nWhile new entrant audits and standard safety audits can be stressful and time-consuming, they are important and should be taken seriously. By aiming to comply with safety regulations to pass these audits, you not only avoid costly fines, but you ensure that your workplace is safe for you and your employees.\nDOT safety audits are also excellent opportunities for growth, since they pinpoint specific safety risks to correct, identify your fleet’s strengths and weaknesses, and give you information to eliminate unsafe practices.\nKeep in mind, many consulting firms will be able to help you with driver qualification files, handle drug screens, as well as anything else you need for this type of DOT safety audit. One of the biggest advantages of using a consulting firm to prepare is that you will be able to stay proactive, and make sure you have the information you need at all times.\nIf you are expecting a new-entry audit, you should receive an email from your state letting you know that you are subject to an audit, and what you need to have on file in preparation.\nThese items include:\nIn 2020, off-site audits became increasingly popular for numerous reasons as we recently discussed in our DOT Audits webinar. Expect off-site audits, or compliance investigations to continue to be a part of the new normal due to how cost-effective they are.\nIf your audit is conducted in person, it will be carried out by an FMCSA-certified auditor at your place of business. If done remotely, you’ll submit relevant documents to FMCSA online or via mail or fax.\nRegardless of which audit you’re chosen for, you’ll be notified of the type to expect by phone or mail.\nWhile some violations are cause for concern and will be addressed during a DOT safety audit, others are entirely unacceptable all will cause you to automatically fail the safety audit. Here are a few to pay attention to:\nIt’s important that your company is performing regular and random alcohol and drug testing, but conducting these tests is not enough. No matter how good a driver is, you should never employ a driver who refuses a required alcohol or controlled substances test.\nIt may be wise to task an outside agency with performing drug tests to take this compliance burden off of your staff, since they will be able to keep track of all of this information that you will eventually need.\nYour drivers are continuously on the road for long hours, around other motorists and pedestrians. It’s important that they are alert, healthy, and up to the task. Driver violations that ensure a failing grade for a safety audit include:\nYou and your employees need to pay attention on and off the roads. For instance, safety audits will result in immediate failure if you’re found to be operating a motor vehicle without securing the required level of insurance or failing to require drivers to keep hours-of-service records (logbooks).\nYour drivers need to be in tip-top shape, but your vehicle safety is also of top priority.\nOperating a vehicle that’s not annually inspected, operating a vehicle that’s declared out-of-service (OOS) for safety deficiencies before repairs are made, or failing to perform OOS repairs reported in driver-vehicle inspection reports (DVIRs) will result in immediate failure.\nNo one wants to pay out of pocket for fines, but they’re an effective way to help fleet managers and owners remember that safety comes first. If your drivers are operating without proper licensing, you could face fines from $250 up to $5,591. Denying access to documentation could cost you up to $1,239 in fines per day, up to $12,383.\nFalsifying records is not only extremely dishonest, but it will result in fines up to $3,760. And, last but not least, violations that involve hazardous material can cost you up to $79,976 in fines.\nSo, long story short, it pays to be safe.\nYou should receive your safety audit results within 45 days. If you fail a DOT safety audit, you’ll receive a detailed explanation as to why you didn’t pass and the requirements needed to formulate a corrective action plan (CAP). Your CAP must explain the action you will take to address the violations identified during the audit. Failure to submit your CAPs to the FMCSA within the number of days specified on your failure notification will result in loss of FMCSA registration.\nIf mistakes were made during your audit, you won’t be left to guess what they were. You’ll always be notified of any and all violations found while the safety audit was conducted. You’ll also be given an explanation of how to correct your safety problems.\nFor more information on Safety Audits, sure to refer to the FMCSA Safety Audits page.\nAssuming you pass your new entrant safety audit, there will be a monitoring period of 18 months as part of the new entrant period.

{"question":"I'm experiencing shoulder pain - what exactly is the rotator cuff and why is it so prone to injury?","answer":"The rotator cuff consists of four important muscles and tendons (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) that surround and stabilize the shoulder. The shoulder is unique because unlike other joints that have strong bone and ligament stabilizers, it's primarily stabilized by these muscles and tendons. The shoulder joint is like a 'golf ball on a tee' with a large humeral head and small labrum, which gives it a large range of motion but makes it less stable and more susceptible to injury or dislocation.","context":["Rotator Cuff Repair\nThe shoulder joint consists of the humerus (arm bone), the glenoid (part of the scapula bone), the labrum, and the surrounding tendons and ligaments. The humeral head sitting in the glenoid can be thought of as a “golf ball on a tee” because of the large humeral head and small labrum. As a result, the shoulder has a very large range of motion, but in exchange loses stability and is easily injured or dislocated. The four most important muscles and tendons that surround and stabilize the shoulder are the rotator cuff muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. These muscles are covered by a bursa that helps lubricate the tendons and allow them to glide freely during motion. Together, these muscles with the help of the labrum, a ring of cartilage around the glenoid, hold the humeral head into the shoulder “socket” and stabilize the shoulder. It is important to recognize that unlike other joints that have strong bone and ligament stabilizers, the shoulder is primarily stabilized by muscles and tendons.\nRotator cuff tears are common, and occur when one or more of the rotator cuff tendons becomes detached from the head of the humerus. The most common tear is in the supraspinatus tendon, but any of the four tendons can be involved. Rotator cuff tears can either be partial (incomplete) or full thickness (complete). A partial tear is still attached to the humeral head, but a full-thickness tear typically leaves a hole or a gap in the tendon. Rotator cuff tears in young individuals are generally acute tears that occur from a single traumatic event, such as a fall or accident. However, most rotator cuff tears are the result of degenerative fraying and weakening of the tendon over time. There are many causes for generative tears, and there is a greater risk for these to be bilateral (both sides) and to recur.\nSurgery is often beneficial for rotator cuff tears that have resulted in symptoms for 6-12 months, large tears, significant symptoms of weakness and pain, or acute tears that are amenable to early repair. The decision to undergo surgical treatment should be made between you and your surgeon.\nIf your surgeon has recommended operative treatment of your injury, there are a variety of different repair techniques, including an open repair that requires a surgical incision, an all-arthroscopic repair that uses small cameras inserted into the joint, or a mini-open repair that uses a combination of both mini cameras and small incisions. All repairs share the common goal of re-attaching the torn ends of the tendon to each other and to the bone, thereby allowing the muscle to heal in a pain-free and functional position.\nYour physician will recommend a specific rehabilitation protocol to enhance your recovery to activities and decrease pain after surgery. The importance of physical therapy in the shoulder cannot be overstated since it is the muscles and tendons that primarily stabilize the joint. Exercises will consist of exercises for improving strength, maintaining motion, and re-training your muscles during the recovery phase. These exercises will typically progress in stages as the tendon heals and gets stronger. It is important to follow the protocol exactly as your surgeon recommends since going to fast may result in injury to the surgical repair and going too fast can result in stiffness and decreased motion. Exercises should be performed in a supervised setting, as well as at home on your own time. Your commitment to rehabilitation is key to a successful outcome."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:71d5aee2-e3a2-4c65-9168-8aeb7f31128e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the nutrient requirements differ between tomatoes and houseplants when using balanced fertilizers? Please provide a comparison.","answer":"Tomatoes and houseplants have different nutrient needs when it comes to balanced fertilizers. For tomatoes, while an 8-8-8 fertilizer can provide initial support for root system and foliage development in poor soil, they ultimately require a 5-10-10 fertilizer with higher phosphorus and potassium once buds set. Continuing with 8-8-8 will result in more foliage than tomatoes. In contrast, houseplants generally do well with an 8-8-8 fertilizer in rich potting soil, as it provides balanced nutrients for strong roots and healthy foliage without over-fertilizing. However, flowering houseplants like African violets need more phosphorus and do better with a 7-9-5 NPK ratio.","context":["The needs of different plants will vary, so one fertilizer does not necessarily suit all.\nHere are some tips on choosing the right type of fertilizer for your plants.\nAzalea, Camellia & Rhododendron\nThese are lime hating plants, and as most fertilizers contain lime look for ericaceous fertilizers as they do not contain Lime, so are safe to use with plants like these.\nBeginning about eight weeks after transplanting the small plants to their permanent location, monthly applications of a commercially prepared fertilizer should be used, preferably the type which is dissolved in water and poured around the base of the plant.\nThe regular use of a high Nitrogen and Potassium fertilizer will greatly increase flower size and numbers, We recommend incorporating a slow release fertilizer such as Osmocote at planting time plus a weekly feeding of a high analysis liquid fertilizer after August 1st and until flower buds show colour. Change to a 20-20-20 fertilizer, or no fertilizer, after this date.\nSome plants, such as citrus plants, benefit from having a shot of fertilizer applied directly to their leaves. This is especially true if the plant is lacking iron, which is often indicated by yellow leaves with green veins. A foliar feeding is good during any period of rapid growth. You can find citrus labelled fertilizers in most garden centres, but if you don’t see any, pick a fertilizer that is low in nitrogen and has equal parts phosphorous and potassium. A 6-4-6 fertilizer is a good option, or a 7-3-3. Make sure it’s a good quality fertilizer complete with micronutrients. Follow the information on the fertilizer label for how often to apply it, but a good rule of thumb is to feed your citrus trees once a month until the weather cools and the growth begins to slow down. Then stop feeding, but give water when needed\nIt is important to keep established clematis well fertilized or you will end up with smaller and fewer blooms. During the first year, use a water-soluble fertilizer two or three times early in the season. Once it has been in the ground a year, apply a fertilizer high in phosphorus in May, and again in mid-June. Always follow the directions on the fertilizer package. Clematis use lots of water and want the soil to stay consistently moist. In mid-summer, an established vine can use several gallons of water each day.\nA water soluble powder type balanced fertiliser is ideal. Never apply to dry soil, always make sure the soil is damp first and thoroughly mix the powder with the water.\nLet’s take a look at the ingredients that make up a good tomato fertiliser as well as some interesting homemade secrets that you may find helpful in boosting your tomato plants nutrition.\nCertain necessities tomato plants need in order to grow to their fullest include calcium and magnesium. When people choose a standard NPK fertilizer many tend to overlook this but it is important you find one that has added calcium and magnesium or find an alternative method for giving these minerals to your tomato plant. NPK is the abbreviation for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, nutrients that all plants need. Usually, a plant would receive these elements through nutrient rich soil, but potted plants, or plants that have been grown in soil that is lacking in nutrition require fertilizer to provide these elements. The correct balance of these nutrients is important. One of the most highly recommended tomato fertilizer combinations is an NPK with a balance of 5-6-5 or 4-5-6. This is the percentage of each of the elements in the fertilizer, Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. This should be shown on the packaging.","When a “balanced” fertilizer is recommended to you, that could mean any number of NPK options, depending on soil conditions and the specific needs of your plants. But, when is it best to use lower nutrient percentages, such as in an 8-8-8 fertilizer?\nWith just 8% each of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, this NPK can be used for a wide variety of applications. Lawns, vegetables, evergreens, and ornamentals can all benefit from it.\nThe sum of an 8-8-8 ratio can be achieved most accurately by simply purchasing a ready-made fertilizer labeled as such. Alternatively, you can organic materials such as well-aged compost that also contain valuable macronutrients.\nWhen combined with elements like bone meal, cottonseed meal, and manure, a triple 8 NPK can be easily reached. Which will not only provide extra nutrients to your plants but increase soil fertility, as well.\n- Understanding 8-8-8 Fertilizer Labels?\n- What is Triple 8 Fertilizer Used For?\n- Fertilizer Type\n- How and When to Use Triple 8 Fertilizer\n- 8-8-8 Fertilizer FAQ’s\nUnderstanding 8-8-8 Fertilizer Labels?\nWith so many options to choose from, determining if a triple 8 fertilizer is the best one for you may seem a little discouraging. Especially when all you want to do is to grow healthy plants.\nNo worries! You can easily match a fertilizer to your plant goals by understanding the fertilizer labels.\nMost fertilizers state their NPK ratio right on the label. On the back of the container should be an ingredients list. This reveals all the ingredients in that product starting with NPK content (macronutrients), then all secondary micronutrients, closely followed by trace elements and any included fillers.\nSo, what exactly is an NPK ratio?\nAn NPK ratio is a three-numbered formula that indicates a fertilizer’s proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\nFor example, an 16-16-16 fertilizer NPK has 16% nitrogen, 16% phosphorus and 16% potassium. Every plant requires these three elements in order to thrive. Just in different proportions or NPK ratios.\nEach of these macronutrients plays a unique and vital role in plant cell formation, photosynthesis, and flower production.\nNitrogen plays a key role in encouraging the growth of healthy, green foliage, by fueling the production of chlorophyll. Which ensures that photosynthesized energy is available for plants to create their own food.\nNitrogen also fuels the proteins and enzymes responsible for regulating water and nutrient uptake and disbursement.\nPhosphorus is a major contributor to photosynthesis, focusing on flower and fruit production, rather than foliage. Triggering captured energy to convert starches and carbohydrates into food.\nAt the cellular level, phosphorus contributes to the construction of those same proteins and enzymes that nitrogen uses to regulate water and nutrients.\nPotassium circulates water, nutrients, and photosynthesized food throughout your plants. It also triggers proteins and enzymes, formed by phosphorus to build healthy plant structures.\nPotassium increases disease resistance and protection against environmental stresses by managing moisture conservation. And is especially effective in encouraging large, well-formed fruit on vining crops.\nWhat is Triple 8 Fertilizer Used For?\nA triple 8 fertilizer’s intended use is to increase plant success, while not overwhelming them. This would also apply to houseplants.\nIf you regularly add well-aged, nutrient-rich compost or manure to your topsoil, 8-8-8 fertilizer will help maintain a steady flow of nutrients to whatever is planted in it.\nA triple 8 NPK will encourage vibrant foliage for optimum photosynthesis on ornamentals and vegetables. While providing maximum support for flower and fruit formation. Although, many fruiting plants may need more phosphorus and potassium, once buds are set.\nWhy Use a Balanced Fertilizer?\nIndoor and outdoor plants will often require more of one macronutrient than another and at different times. When planted in poor soil, a balanced fertilizer can provide even nutrient availability that promotes healthy growth.\nA balanced, 8-8-8 fertilizer can also offset the leaching of vital nutrients from the soil (in potted plants) that can otherwise be a consequence of frequent watering. An equal NPK will keep the growing medium fertile enough to keep them happy.\n8-8-8 vs 10-10-10 Fertilizer\nThere’s only a 2% difference between a triple 10 and a triple 8 fertilizer. But, in small gardens, it’s important to note that a 10-10-10 fertilizer may actually be too high, especially in fertile soil. 2% can make all the difference between adequately supplementing nutrients and over-feeding.\nThere are four different application methods available to make nourishing your plants and soil easier.\n- Quick Release – liquid or water-soluble options provide immediate nutrient delivery. Offering accelerated, visible improvement for plants growing in poor soil.\n- Slow-Release – granules and spikes offer a steady stream of nutrients over an extended period of time, with fewer applications.\n- Organic – made from natural materials like well-rotted plant material and animal bi-products that, when combined, meet the NPK needs of most plants.\n- Inorganic – manufactured with synthetic chemicals. These can result in a higher yield, but can also potentially contaminate soil and nearby water sources.\nConcentrates, when mixed with water, help keep soil pH balanced and are often formulated as foliar sprays to combat deficiencies in leaves.\nPremixed options are available, as well. But, maybe higher in price. Caution is recommended, as liquid over-feeding is common and could lead to root burn.\nWater Soluble Powder\nPowder fertilizers can be applied directly to the soil around plants or diluted in water as a “tea”.\nPowders are also some of the most economical and have a virtually indefinite shelf life. But, they do carry a risk of root burn, if manufacturer instructions aren’t followed.\nConcentrated granules can provide consistent nourishment for up to nine months, with results showing in just a couple of weeks.\nThey’re less likely to cause root burn and are considered eco-friendly. Since no watering is needed to activate and is less likely to contaminate nearby surface or groundwater.\nSpikes are really convenient to use, especially if you have a substantial container garden. Pre-measured in various sizes, they’re easy to push into loamy soil.\nNutrients are slowly released by microorganisms in the soil and carry the added benefit of stimulating an increased resistance to disease and pests.\nHow and When to Use Triple 8 Fertilizer\nA triple 8 fertilizer can be applied as a liquid or by working slow-release granules into the soil.\nWhen planting saplings in nutrient-weak soil, a handful of 8-8-8 granules, in the hole prior to planting, will help them establish more quickly and the gentle formula will diminish the risk of root burn.\nWorking granules into the top few inches of soil in borders, or applying a water-soluble option, will provide plants with a great start.\nWith vegetables, applying a triple 8 NPK just after transplanting will contribute to an abundant harvest. When followed-up with an NPK higher in phosphorus and potassium, once buds set.\nTrees and Shrubs\nNew, perennial trees and shrubs produce robust root systems, vibrant color and size faster with a triple 8 fertilizer in the 3rd and 4th month after planting. Once established, these typically don’t require any further fertilizing. If symptoms occur, a quality soil test should reveal any deficiencies.\nCitrus and Fruit Trees\nCitrus and fruit tree fertilizers typically contain more phosphorus and potassium to help with flower and bud production and disease resistance. While triple 8 may be fine for young saplings and feeding at the start of the growing season, it is best to switch to high potassium fertilizer or high phosphorus fertilizer as the season progresses.\nBut, if you’re planting in poor soil, dry 8-8-8 fertilizer granules in the planting hole, in spring, will encourage faster establishment.\nOrnamentals need consistent nutrition to produce lots of summer color. A triple 8 NPK can ensure this and help accelerate maturity in annuals for a longer bloom time.\nInfertile soil, a slightly watered-down dose of 8-8-8 fertilizer will better support healthy plants without the risk of overfeeding them.\nGreen, leafy veggies thrive when side-dressed with a triple 8 NPK. Tomatoes, squash, and melons, though, require more phosphorus and potassium once buds are set.\nIf you’re starting with poor soil, a higher, balanced NPK after transplanting will create a healthy growing medium for the first couple of months.\nIs 8-8-8 Good for Tomatoes\nIn poor soil, an 8-8-8 fertilizer will provide a healthy growing environment that will encourage a robust root system and vibrant foliage. After which, a 5-10-10 fertilizer would be more appropriate.\nIf the use of a triple 8 NPK is continued, you’ll have more foliage than tomatoes.\nHouseplants require balanced nutrients for strong roots and healthy foliage. In rich potting soil, 8-8-8 fertilizer will support that without over-fertilizing. If your potting soil needs a boost, a 10-10-10 NPK would be more appropriate.\nHowever, indoor bloomers like African violets, need more phosphorus to form flowers. These do well with a 7-9-5 NPK.\nLawn and Grass\nLawns and native grasses need phosphorus to grow thick and lush. Yet, relying on high nitrogen fertilizers to maintain a tough, vibrant structure.\nIf a soil test has revealed nitrogen-rich soil beneath your grass, an 8-8-8 fertilizer would provide just enough nitrogen for a healthy lawn."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4cc9196d-38f7-45e6-bee4-92694f5830cc>","<urn:uuid:45a05270-c548-4436-9986-5f5e9b725432>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the current military alliances in the Asia-Pacific differ from Britain's position during the Falklands conflict?","answer":"During the Falklands conflict, Britain operated largely independently with limited external support, having to project power across 8,000 miles. In contrast, the current Asia-Pacific features a complex network of bilateral alliances and partnerships centered around the US. Countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea maintain close defense cooperation with the US while also building their own military capabilities. Additionally, while not formal allies, states like Taiwan receive implicit US protection. This web of relationships, though less formalized than NATO, provides more flexibility for cooperation and mutual support against regional threats, unlike Britain's relatively isolated position in 1982.","context":["How does one stop a revisionist autocracy from invading its island neighbor? If the invasion lands on this nation’s shores, how does one force the withdrawal of an adversary with local numerical superiority while operating at hundreds or even thousands of miles from main logistical hubs? In 1982, the British had to solve this exact problem when the military junta of Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands after years of claiming sovereignty over the British Overseas Territory. There are disquieting parallels between Operation Corporate, the British victory in its long-range, expeditionary operation to recapture the Falklands from Argentina and the challenges focused around the defense of Taiwan from China.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps has made it a priority to address the rise of great-power competition in the Indo-Pacific. British forces in the Falklands operated in a similar manner to how the commandant envisions marines operating in the future: small formations distributed across vast expanses of maritime terrain, relatively limited indirect fire support, and limited traditional close air support. Vertical lift aircraft were critical to enabling British maneuver and logistical sustainment in the South Atlantic. But these aircraft are largely absent from new Marine Corps concepts.\nTo address these discrepancies, I offer a brief overview of relevant lessons learned during Operation Corporate. After capturing these lessons learned, I turn to ways to better incorporate them into the Marine concepts, specifically focused on maximizing current and future vertical lift capabilities.\nOn Apr. 2, 1982, the armed forces of Argentina invaded the British territory of the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. Successive British administrations had concluded that any landings by Argentina would represent a fait accompli with little room for recourse. The government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, however, quickly committed itself to returning the Falkland Islands to the United Kingdom. Within hours, Operation Corporate was set in motion to drive Argentina from the rocky archipelago. The first naval vessels departed Britain less than three days after the invasion. A rapidly formed, combined task force overcame significant hurdles and transited over 8,000 miles to finally regain possession of the islands by June 14. Victory was not guaranteed. From the moment the task force set sail, a failure to anticipate vertical lift requirements, ambiguous command relationships, and a force design that marginalized amphibious operations threatened ultimate success.\nThe British operation had to overcome vast distances and associated challenges (Source: Department of History, US. Military Academy)\nThe British task force was primarily comprised of a carrier battle group to establish air and sea superiority, and an amphibious assault group, which included 3 Commando Brigade, was tasked with recapturing the islands. The rapid deployment of the British naval task force was impressive, but was initially conducted to force a political settlement with the hope that a military solution would prove unnecessary. As the British task force sailed from the historic ports of Sir Francis Drake and Adm. Lord Horatio Nelson, its logistical supplies and equipment were largely stowed without consideration for an eventual amphibious operation. A significant logistical reorganization was required at Ascension Island, the lone intermediate firm base available to the British. Utilizing surface vessels to reshuffle equipment should have proven a simple task for the Royal Navy, but the steep gradients, soft sand, and heavy surf of the beaches required extensive use of helicopters for ship-to-shore movement. Even after landing equipment at Ascension Island, the rough terrain meant that helicopters were essential to inland transportation. With minimal restow and staff coordination complete, the task force sailed toward their objective where unforgiving climate and terrain would require even more aviation support.\nAir defense proved to be a vital consideration throughout Operation Corporate. The decision to land elements of 3 Commando Brigade only after the carrier battle group established air superiority was ultimately deemed impractical and the risk of Argentine aircraft was accepted for the sake of expediency. Argentina possessed six times the number of aircraft of the British task force and the air defense systems organic to the Royal Navy could not provide adequate force protection to troops after landing ashore. The ground-based Rapier air defense system was intended to mitigate the risk of air attack in the absence of air superiority. The terrain best suited for the Rapier to perform this function was inaccessible by ground vehicles and the system itself was too heavy to be hand-carried. As a result, the commander of the amphibious battle group, Michael Clapp, was compelled to dedicate limited assets “to supply the Rapiers with one Sea King on permanent call for the delivery of stores and petrol for their generators.” For a helicopter force that would become heavily taxed, the reliance on these aircraft only increased as Britain transitioned from the amphibious landing to offensive operations ashore.\nThe geography of the Falkland Islands limited the number of suitable landing locations. San Carlos Water in the northwest of East Falklands was selected as the site for the landing. On May 21, the first elements of 3 Commando Brigade landed, but the buildup of the beachhead was delayed due to unresolved inefficiencies in logistical stores as well as the force protection measure of constantly moving surface vessels in and out of San Carlos Water. The only means to maintain momentum under these circumstances was a constant use of helicopters. From the initial landing until the eventual capitulation of Argentina on June 14, “Helicopters remained vital to logistics operations during the war because of the rough, trackless terrain of East Falkland.” When air-launched Exocet missiles sank SS Atlantic Conveyor on May 25, all but one of its critical cargo of additional helicopters was lost, further challenging the limited mobility of the ground force. The lack of adequate roads to traverse the rocky marshland ensured that the limited helicopter force was occupied externally transporting all artillery and heavy equipment while British marines and soldiers were left to march over the unforgiving landscape. As a stark illustration of the requirements on helicopters, it took 82 Sea King sorties to transport a single battery of six 105-millimeter howitzers and its required ammunition. This reduction in maneuver assets undoubtedly extended the conflict as a majority of helicopters were allocated to transporting equipment and not personnel.\nThe Falklands campaign (Source: Department of History, U.S. Military Academy)\nCommand relationships between inter-service units, and the inadequate allocation of helicopter assets for even a single brigade, were a tangible point of friction as the task force grew. The Royal Marine brigade fielded roughly 4,600 personnel, which the Ministry of Defence determined was too small to face the 10,000 Argentinians on the Falklands. With the addition of 5 Infantry Brigade, Maj. Gen. Jeremy Moore would command a divisional headquarters within the task force. Most of the battalions in this brigade were comprised of soldiers who split time between operational and ceremonial guard duty with no training in amphibious operations. This additional brigade represented an increase in overall numbers but produced confused command relationships that contributed to the single largest loss of British troops since World War II.\nWhen it was still believed a political solution was possible, little effort was made to define the exact role of 5 Infantry Brigade. The question of what to do with these troops was answered when 3 Commando Brigade conducted its first offensive actions after landing at San Carlos Water. The initial success at the settlement of Goose Green prompted 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment to bound well forward of logistical support, leaving them vulnerable to enemy attack without the possibility of rapid reinforcement. An ill-constructed support request process and lack of helicopter expertise on the amphibious staff allowed the ambitious battalion to requisition helicopter support that was sorely needed elsewhere. In response, elements of 5 Infantry Brigade would be landed at the settlements of Bluff Cove and Fitzroy to relieve the isolated paratroopers. The misallocation of helicopters required surface connectors to transport these soldiers despite their lack of amphibious experience. The 35-mile movement in open landing craft took several hours as soldiers were exposed to the frigid South Atlantic climate and Argentine air attack. As the sun set on June 8, multiple surface connectors were attacked, LSL Sir Galahad was sunk, and 51 soldiers and sailors were killed with 46 wounded.\nTo better understand how such tragedies happened, it’s important to go back in time to the years immediately following World War II. Inter-service competition hit the Royal Navy particularly hard in this period with the cancellation of an updated carrier program in 1966 and the decommissioning of Britain’s last catapult carrier — HMS Ark Royal — in 1979. This had cascading effects on the amphibious capabilities of the navy in the years to come. The only two remaining carriers capable of fixed-wing operations were HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible, whose small decks utilized vertical take-off and landing Sea Harriers at the expense of helicopter operations.\nThatcher inherited budgetary constraints that contributed to an increasingly niche view of the Royal Navy’s purpose. Her government’s 1981 Defence White Paper recommended the removal of all amphibious vessels by 1984. Britain’s belief that the unlikely requirement for amphibious capabilities would only be used as part of a larger NATO operation degraded the readiness of the Royal Navy. The two fixed-wing carriers were scheduled for sale to foreign militaries with the landing platform dock, HMS Intrepid, already in the process of being decommissioned. Fortunately for Britain, Argentina did not wait for the full impact of the projected changes in British amphibious capabilities. The sale of the carriers was delayed and the decommissioning of HMS Intrepid reversed for the use of its associated landing craft and medium-lift helicopters.\nIn hindsight, the gap between the British and Argentine capabilities appears inevitable. However, no amount of military professionalism could have bridged the 8,000-mile gap between Britain and the Falkland Islands without the appropriate means to not only arrive in theater, but move troops, supplies, and equipment across the inhospitable terrain of the islands. Had the conflict been delayed by a matter of months, a complete lack of amphibious vessels and its associated helicopters would have made repossession of the Falkland Islands impossible. Much has been written regarding the fortuitous timing of the invasion prior to the final transfer of Britain’s aircraft carriers. The carrier battle group, however, failed to accomplish its main task: air superiority. In the end, it was the essential mobility that vertical lift aviation provided that ensured that the Falkland Islands returned to British control.\nImplications for Force Design 2030\nThe commandant of the Marine Corps’ 2019 planning guidance lays out an ambitious, but necessary, plan to mitigate the threat of emerging peer adversaries. In each year since, his annual Force Design 2030 updates have built on this initial guidance, setting the service on a path which is directly in line with strategic guidance from the White House and the Department of Defense. Multiple conceptual documents have informed the commandant’s guidance. The concept of expeditionary advanced base operations seeks to mitigate potential adversary advantages “by improving our own ability to maneuver and exploit control over key maritime terrain.” Incorporating the lessons of the British experience with helicopter utilization in the Falklands is critical to ensuring that the Marine Corps does not repeat similar missteps during the maneuver and sustainment of its own distributed forces.\nIt is critical that vertical lift aviation is better integrated into maritime mobility. Utilizing surface vessels to land personnel and equipment ashore is not guaranteed. Artist’s renderings of conceptual Light Amphibious Warships depict the offloading of equipment on pristine beaches that the example of Ascension Island demonstrates as problematic. The Falklands War also exhibited that the requirement for mobility does not end at the shoreline. Excluding four light tanks, all supplies, artillery, and air defense systems were light enough to be transported by helicopter, demonstrating the rapid mobility that aviation provides. Restrictive inland terrain or a lack of existing airfields remains a consideration to Marine planners, particularly on islands throughout the Indo-Pacific that often lack large airfields and improved road infrastructure. CH-53E/K helicopters provide a unique capability to rapidly transport radars, mobile air defense systems, and ordnance for long-range precision artillery critical to new concepts. The air-refuellable capabilities of these platforms enable operations at distances exponentially greater than those covered by British helicopters. A 100 percent increase in active component KC-130 tanker transport squadrons stationed in the Pacific will provide range extension to CH-53E/K and MV-22 Osprey aircraft that provides the option to self-deploy from outside the First Island Chain to distributed expeditionary bases within it. The ability to overcome the tyranny of distance in vertical lift aircraft is not without precedent. Twice in 1989, MH-53 helicopters utilized aerial refueling to transit nearly 1,400 miles — roughly the distance between Guam and Taiwan — without landing to conduct combat operations in Panama. Operating at such ranges would clearly be the exception, but it provides Marine commanders with the option to rapidly employ vertical lift aviation when the threat, terrain, or alternative asset allocation prove prohibitive.\nProjected Marine command relationships could challenge the service’s utilization of vertical lift aviation, likely in ways that mirror the friction that the British Task Force experienced in 1982. The Marine littoral regiment was developed through the Force Design 2030 process with expeditionary advanced base operations in mind. The commandant has made it clear that this new unit is not the only entity that can conduct such operations, but the basing of current and future Marine littoral regiments within the Pacific ensures that they will conduct a preponderance of the new concept. Tentative doctrine only roughly describes aviation in a general support role to the littoral force without outlining the source of these aircraft. The emphasis of the tentative manual and “A Concept for Stand-in Forces” on aviation fires and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance over vertical lift threatens to replicate Britain’s inefficient utilization of helicopters in 1982. Moreover, with no organic aviation assets capable of vertical lift, a Marine littoral regiment’s reliance on composite squadrons of a Marine expeditionary unit to support their maneuver will prove unsustainable. Not enough vertical lift will exist to support operations of both these units concurrently as the only aircraft between the two elements is deliberately sized to support Marine expeditionary unit operations. Air wings allocating squadrons to current deployment cycles will find it difficult source additional tasking, especially in a CH-53 community reduced by 35 percent. This reduction was consciously designed to coincide with a concurrent reduction of infantry battalions by 13 percent. However, it was not simply the number of vertical lift platforms available, but the ad hoc command relationships that threatened the success of the British task force in 1982. The lack of defined support relationships within any current doctrinal or tentative publications between a commander of the landing forces and a commander of the littoral force would complicate any amalgamation of their respective entities. Wherever the source, clear allocation of aviation support during expeditionary advanced base operations, specifically vertical lift, should be defined moving forward.\nThe overwhelming emphasis on mobility contained in “A Concept for Stand-in Forces” ignores the stark disparity in speed, range, and flexibility of aviation compared to proposed surface vessels that the U.S. Navy is hesitant to fund. In fact, despite the critical role that it anticipates mobility will play within maritime terrain, vertical lift aviation is never once mentioned in this document. Any reliance on nonexistent logistical drones without continuing to integrate currently fielded air-refuellable, long-range vertical lift platforms further risks the viability of these new concepts. Offensive and reconnaissance drones have emphatically demonstrated their utility not only in operational tests conducted by the Marine Corps, but also in combat in Ukraine. The ability for unmanned platforms to logistically sustain marines in an environment envisioned by the commandant is less certain. While more recent unmanned concepts have been proposed, one of the more capable unmanned vertical lift platforms is the Kaman K-MAX helicopter. During a 33-month experiment in Afghanistan in 2011 it proved capable against an insurgent adversary, but its speed of 80 knots, one-way range of 267 nautical miles, and payload of 6,000 pounds is overwhelmingly outperformed by both the MV-22 and CH-53E/K. At a fraction of the price of manned vertical lift, unmanned systems would only provide a fraction of the logistical support. These alternatives to sustain marines throughout the Pacific should continue to be developed, but currently a capabilities gap limits these options to a supporting role.\n“Technological advance is sharply changing the defence environment. The fast-growing power of modern weapons to find targets accurately and hit them hard at long ranges is increasing the vulnerability of major platforms such as aircraft and surface ships.” One might believe this passage describes the current global environment, but this quote from Thatcher’s secretary of state for defence demonstrates that many of the considerations shaping the Marine Corps were relevant forty years ago.\nThe Marine Corps should take concrete steps to learn from the British experience during Operation Corporate. First, the Marine littoral regiment should capitalize on the inherent mobility and flexibility of vertical lift aviation through fully integrated training at long range in maritime terrain. Next, feasible command relationships between aviation and ground forces in distributed operations should be developed and clearly codified in evolving doctrine. Finally, the Marine Corps should continue to develop innovative, unmanned surface and air platforms with the understanding that existing systems must be leveraged until these technologies are fully fielded. Successfully incorporating vertical lift aviation into the commandant’s vision of the Marine Corps will prove challenging, but the negative impact of relying solely on alternative mobility options will prove to be untenable.\nNolan Vihlen is a CH-53E instructor pilot currently assigned to Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One and a recent graduate of Expeditionary Warfare School.

While the immediate neighborhood remains the main concern, European strategists are worried about a second source of risk: violent revisionism in the Asia-Pacific. The United States has already shifted its center of strategic gravity to the Pacific, but conflicts brewing there also require a European response.\n|Europe has a major stake in the stability of the Asia-Pacific region. It is therefore important for a wider European public to pay more attention to regional stakeholders.|\n|Assessing risks in the Asia-Pacific requires a careful analysis of revisionist signaling, regional security arrangements, and the role of middle-sized powers. European experiences and parameters do not fully apply|\n|This paper draws on case studies of the security and defense policies of Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. All four countries shape regional security significantly by engaging in assertive defense planning and diversifying their security relations.|\n|Important European stakeholders – NATO, the European Union, individual European states – can contribute to deterring violent revisionism in the region by deepening relations with AsianPacific partners.|\nRead all Country Reports from the project here:\nIn the spring of 2022, shortly after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, speculation arose about various “two-front” scenarios. Analysts in Europe feared that China might exploit the situation in Eastern Europe to force Taiwan into “unification,” which would draw the United States into a second conflict and also require a European response. China’s August 2022 military exercises – the largest in the Taiwan Strait since 1995/96 – have fueled such fears.\nThe Korean Peninsula makes for a second hotspot in the region: Large-scale war could erupt if the paranoid regime in Pyongyang launched a preemptive nuclear attack in response to real or imagined US attempts at regime change. On the peninsula, as in the Taiwan Strait, fundamental strategic interests are at stake – conflicts there will not stay local, but involve the United States and its regional partners as well as inflict massive damage on the global economy.\nUS President Joe Biden, who has been so explicit about not getting directly involved in Ukraine, has unequivocally stated that the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense if it was attacked by China. The reason is simple: From a US perspective, an independent Taiwan is essential to containing China and denying it direct access to the Western Pacific. This asymmetry – neither Ukraine nor Taiwan has a defense agreement with Washington, but the United States would be ready to defend the latter – reflects Taiwan’s higher strategic value.\nChina is aware of this and might be tempted to draw a simple parallel of its own from the Ukraine conflict: that raising the specter of nuclear war is a powerful tool to deter the United States from intervening in an invasion. In Pyongyang’s calculus, similarly, nuclear weapons represent the ultimate shield against any invasion. This is a problem of global consequence.\nEven without envisaging nuclear conflict, the worsening security situation in the Asia-Pacific is a difficult challenge for Europe: While Europeans continue to depend on the United States for their own deterrence and defense, they realize that the center of gravity for US and global security has shifted toward the Asia-Pacific.7 And even as Europeans are sending military support to Ukraine and stepping up on territorial defense within NATO, they find themselves under pressure to bring at least a symbolic military presence to the Asia-Pacific to signal their commitment to the Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\nAnd yet, Europeans must resist the temptation to directly apply lessons from Ukraine and the transatlantic theater to the Asia-Pacific, even if Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned that “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.” Fighting a war in a maritime theatre like the Asia-Pacific requires a far greater set of military capabilities and planning than does action on the European mainland. Russia was readily able to amass ground forces along its own as well as the Belarussian border with Ukraine over the course of several months. Though Chinese forces practiced the encirclement and blockade of Taiwan, they cannot easily do so under wartime conditions: Taiwan is part of the “first island chain” lining China’s coast, with US assets for military reconnaissance stationed close by. Should China bar foreign military vessels and aircraft from transiting the narrow Taiwan Strait, it would initiate war right then and there. Moreover, China may still be short of the amphibious capabilities needed to invade and conquer Taiwan.\nAs Europeans assess the risk of conflict in the Asia-Pacific, this paper aims to warn against three possible misperceptions:\n- That China and North Korea actually mean what they so loudly say;\n- That the institutions and states around them are too weak to deter them;\n- And that European engagement should focus almost exclusively on the United States.\nRevisionist Signaling in the Asia-Pacific\nChina has stepped up its signaling in sync with its mantra of national rejuvenation by 2050 – a goal that includes unification with Taiwan. Chinese aircraft conducted over 300 intrusions into Taiwan’s Air Identification Zone between September 2021 and January 2022. Similarly, China’s military exercises in August 2022 aimed to demonstrate Beijing’s „new normal” of assertiveness. North Korea, in the meantime, is making less use of its conventional forces than it used to but has accelerated its nuclear weapons and missile development campaigns. In 2022, the regime in Pyongyang oversaw a double-digit number of test events – approaching the record-setting intensity of 2016/2017 – to improve its new missile technologies.\nChina and North Korea are thus both sending loud signals of revisionism. But these must be seen in context: China’s belligerent rhetoric in large part reflects the domestic pressure under which the Communist Party is acting, with the 95th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army in August, President Xi Jinping’s reelection scheduled for the party congress in October, and ongoing military reforms. All three elements have likely shaped the scale of China’s military exercises in August, while the visit of US Congress leader Nancy Pelosi provided a convenient smokescreen.18 China’s maneuvers in the Taiwan Strait should be seen as political signals and operational probes, not as war rehearsals. That does not mean that the risk of war is zero, but Beijing was careful to announce its military exercises well ahead of time in order to avoid misperceptions. And the United States has been careful, too, by ordering its warships to “stay on station” in the waters east of Taiwan. North Korea likes to present itself as having a strong stomach for provocations. In fact, it has been careful to manage risks – by closely controlling, for example, where its missiles land. The regime in Pyongyang has long emphasized that its nuclear weapons serve the purpose of deterrence and self-defense. Even its posture of early nuclear use and preemptive escalation mainly serves the purpose of deterrence. North Korea’s propaganda includes revisionist demands for reuniting the peninsula under Pyongyang’s rule, but given that the regime’s priority is to ensure its own survival, maintaining the status quo serves North Korea’s interests best, as it does for South Korea, Japan, and the United States.\nMilitary exercises may signal intent but should not be seen as an immediate precursor of action. In fact, neither China nor North Korea can overtly move to change the status quo without incurring immense costs. Nor would success be guaranteed. As a result, they are more likely to engage in gradual revisionism by means of cyber activities, disinformation campaigns, and coercive measures that fall short of the use of force. After all, China and North Korea are already at home in this grey zone of hybrid warfare.\nSecurity Arrangements in the Asia-Pacific\nDefense alliances contribute to deterring violent revisionism because they increase the costs of an attack and make success more difficult or even impossible. NATO security assurances are assumed to be a major factor in Russia’s decision to stop short of military conflict with the Baltic States. Following this same rationale, Australia, Japan, and South Korea are stepping up military exercises and deployments to strengthen their joint deterrence postures with the United States. Particularly Japan and South Korea seek to present the nuclear deterrence posture that Washington has extended to them as reliable.\nThe United States maintains a network of bilateral alliances and partnerships in Asia and the Indo-Pacific region. At first sight, this web of security arrangements seems rather loose, but in fact it compares favorably to NATO for two reasons. First, it has room to grow without having to overcome institutional hurdles: Just take the AUKUS arrangement, which put Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States on track to tightening their defense relations and cooperation, including the joint development of strategic assets. Similar undertakings within EU and NATO frameworks involve far more actors and bureaucracy. Second, flexible arrangements can help countries to sidestep fundamental disagreements: The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States functions quite well despite India’s different approach toward Russia. The Quad recently extended cooperation to the field of maritime security and reconnaissance. Even Japan and South Korea, despite deep-seated grievances on both sides, cooperate on security.\nTaiwan enjoys the United States’ active protection against a Chinese invasion even without a formal defense arrangement. The same is true for Taiwan’s relations with its neighbors, which are also likely to come to its aid as they have a vital interest in containing China. Japan and Australia accept that there is a high probability of becoming entangled in any conflict in the Taiwan Strait, given the US military assets deployed in both countries. Furthermore, Japan is worried that China could attack its remote Okinawa islands because of their proximity to Taiwan. In contrast, the majority of US forces in South Korea would probably remain stationary to be available for contingencies on the Korean peninsula. Unlike a formal membership body like NATO, there is no hard dividing line in the Asia-Pacific between those who are protected and those who are not. Strategic ambiguity is a feature, not a bug.\nThe Importance of Regional Players\nIn this web of relations and absence of clear obligations, each protagonist – however small – has the potential to spoil regional security arrangements, as the Solomon Islands’ cooperation with China illustrates. But China, too, is struggling with the potential of countries in the region to spoil its plans. China is surrounded by frenemies – part friends, part enemies. Countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea are engaged in a tug of war with China, wishing, on the one hand, to maintain good commercial relations with Beijing while trying to safeguard their economic and military security on the other hand. Moreover, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Japan play an increasingly important role for security and defense in the region as they expand their military capabilities and step up on expenditure, planning, and posture. This is why the DGAP commissioned detailed reports on all four countries, with very short summaries presented here:\nAustralia is embracing its role in regional security. Canberra has shifted its focus back to territorial defense since 2016 because of two insights: First, Australia’s traditional advantage of being located at great distance from any potential adversary is being eroded by technological progress in weaponry; and second, China’s assertiveness and military modernization now pose a direct threat to Australia. As a result, Canberra is acquiring strategic assets for deterrence and reconnaissance. It is also fostering local manufacturing capabilities and diversifying its defense relations.\nJapan is grappling with its frontline status vis-à-vis China, North Korea, and Russia. The government appears set to transition the country toward a more assertive defense and deterrence posture as the ruling party’s proposal to build up capabilities suitable for counterstrikes against an enemy’s military assets illustrates. While close cooperation with the US defense industry remains crucial, Japan is pushing for more jointly developed and domestically produced systems. It is also diversifying its defense relations within the region.\nSouth Korea is making headlines as a rising global arms exporter. Seoul has long nurtured its domestic defense industry to be able to research, develop, and manufacture a wide array of weapon systems without depending on overseas partners. Such defense industrial policies are part of South Korea’s comprehensive force enhancement and defense reform program. Seoul remains focused on North Korea as the key military threat but also looks at China when it speaks of “omni-directional challenges”. Given its location in a dangerous neighborhood, South Korea’s joint deterrence posture and defense cooperation with the United States remain crucial.\nTaiwan remains focused on preventing escalation with China, deterring Beijing from using force, and defending itself should conflict erupt. Discussions evolve primarily around what type of capabilities Taiwan should buy or develop – whether to privilege large and showy capabilities for deterrence or smaller and more mobile assets for area denial. China’s most recent military exercises are likely to push the discussion toward strengthening the country’s air defense systems as well as its coastal defense through asymmetric capabilities such as unmanned aerial vehicles.\nHow to Deal with Conflict in the Asia-Pacific\nHow best to use these country analyses? Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are key stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific. They have no interest in acting as spoilers for regional security, and they also try to keep other regional states from doing so. It is these regional stakeholders – in addition to the United States – which shape relations and thereby structures in the region. Each of the four is walking a tightrope vis-à-vis China in order to safeguard its national security interests, which makes for a complex web of economic, military, and political interests. So what can Europeans, given their limited resources and focus on the conflict in Europe, do to support stability in the region?\nFirst, European governments need to dial down their military signaling. Joining exercises in the region invites counter-signaling and is counterproductive if the objective is to reduce the risk of conflict and maintain relative stability within the Asia-Pacific region. Instead of engaging in military symbolism, Europe should call China out on the challenges it poses, as was done in NATO’s latest Strategic Concept. A similar approach should be chosen for the threats issued by North Korea. This will prove more helpful, particularly if combined with leaving the door open for constructive engagement. To that end, Europe should also suggest measures that facilitate crisis communication and reduce risks of escalation.\nSecond, European governments need to deepen their economic and diplomatic relations with Asian-Pacific states. Interconnectedness helps both groupings of US allies to reduce their dependence on China. It will also protect them against the use of economic leverage and provide some deterrence against actual use of force. While closer relations do create risks for European governments, making an active decision to embrace these stakes – rather than sending the occasional frigate or Eurofighter to the Pacific – increases the credibility of Europe’s commitment to stability in the Asia-Pacific. NATO is already planning to increase issue-specific cooperation with its Asia-Pacific partners. The EU can similarly expand its bilateral cooperation with Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan on issues like the use of hydrogen energy, climate resilience, and cyber security.36 It could also engage its partners in an exchange on the risk of conflict and other aspects of military security. Individual European states can follow suit. Finally, it would be desirable to also involve private actors for multi-stakeholder exchanges on science and technology.\nThird, Europe’s stakeholders – its governments and international bodies – need to engage in contingency planning. They should consider how conflict in the Asia-Pacific could erupt, how it could escalate, and how NATO, the European Union, and individual European states would react. As with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, policymakers in Europe need to consider deterrence failure and escalation in the Asia-Pacific. European stakeholders can harness their existing presence in the region and expand relations to other states in the region in order to update their situational awareness. Until now, Europeans have largely held this conversation amongst themselves and, within NATO, with the United States. A multi-stakeholder approach to scenario building and wargaming will allow for more complexity and help Europe’s understanding of the conditions and repercussions of conflict in the Asia-Pacific.\nABOUT THE PROJECT\nThe DGAP’s project on “Risk Reduction and Arms Control in the Asia-Pacific Region” aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific and East Asia, with a focus on important players including Australia, China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States. The objective is to foster understanding in Germany and Europe of the risk of conflict in the Asia-Pacific and suggest possible steps to mitigate this risk and safeguard stability in and beyond the region. The project starts with taking stock of security developments in the Asia-Pacific.\nAll information and country reports can be accessed at https://on.dgap.org/3f35EBO.\nThis Policy Brief was published on September 19, 2022 in the project “Risk Reduction and Arms Control in the Asia-Pacific Region”.

{"question":"What are the 2 official languages in Ireland and how many people speak Irish as primary language?","answer":"Ireland has two official national languages: Irish (Gaelige) and English. English is the common language (lingua franca), while Irish is taught in all schools and is the primary language for approximately 100,000 people on the island in areas called Gaeltacht areas.","context":["Whether you are going on vacation, moving abroad, or traveling for work, it is always comforting to know the basics before you arrive. Feeling comfortable with what people eat, how they interact in public, and even how they get around, are some of the first steps to feeling at ease in another culture. If you know what to expect you can spend less time fretting and more time soaking in all of the new experiences travel brings.\nThe island of Ireland consists of four provinces. There are 32 counties, each with their own qualities. 26 of those counties are in the Republic of Ireland, while six lie in Northern Ireland (which is part of the United Kingdom). This means that the Republic of Ireland uses the Euro, while Northern Ireland uses the Pound Sterling.\nThe Emerald Isle is known for many things: unpredictable weather, lively music and banter, passion for sports, and exceptional literature. Perhaps the most beloved aspect of Ireland is the people. The Irish are known around the world for being friendly, clever, and wonderful hosts. For this reason, Ireland is an attractive location for global companies. If you are heading to Ireland for business with a multicultural team, read on to learn what to expect!\nWhen meeting someone for the first time, make direct eye contact and maintain it throughout the conversation. It is acceptable to be “fashionably late” to a social event by 15-20 minutes, but in a business setting, especially in Dublin, visitors are expected to arrive on time, although your Irish host could be late. Order is important to the Irish and queuing (waiting in line) is taken very seriously. Waiting your turn is proper etiquette. It is against the law to smoke indoors.\nThe extended family unit dominates Irish social structure. Family members may move away, but there remains a strong sense of “home.” The Irish have a reputation for wit and humor and enjoy telling elaborate stories and jokes in public and especially in the local pubs. The Irish language is lyrical and poetic, turning common communication into an art form.\nIreland has an official policy supporting bilingualism. There are two official national languages: Irish (Gaelige), and the second official language is English. English is the lingua franca, or common language, but Irish is taught in all schools and is the primary language for approximately 100,000 people on the island. These areas are called Gaeltacht areas. Signs are written in both languages and the English spoken in Ireland often adapts Irish words. The Irish have a rich heritage of language, speech, and literature and are prolific story-tellers with a penchant for understatement and wit. Speech volume tends to be low with outsiders and louder with family and friends. Wait to be introduced to strangers before introducing yourself.\nThe Irish are emotive speakers whose body language, use of words, and tone convey context and emotion. A handshake and a common greeting such as, “pleased to meet you,” or “how do you do?” are appropriate when meeting someone in Ireland. Known for their friendly, outgoing personalities, the Irish enjoy conversation, and engaging with someone from Ireland should not be a challenge.\nThe business day in Ireland is defined as 9am to 5pm. When arriving at the office, make sure to say “good morning” to your associates. Shake hands only with people you do not know. Employees commonly socialize in the local pub after work and consider it a place to unwind and where rank disappears\nWhile Ireland is an egalitarian culture, decision-making takes place in the higher business echelons and lower ranking team members wait for directions and decisions from above. To balance corporate structure, many companies will allow team members to express their opinions and share thoughts before a decision is made. Irish workers expect to be rewarded for jobs well done but not necessarily in public.\nFamous foods in Ireland include:\nFlats are typically the least expensive accommodation in Ireland. Flats are often older houses with shared facilities but separate living areas. Apartments usually have a better layout than flats and are therefore more costly.\nHouses throughout Ireland may either be free standing (in towns and villages) or semi-detached/row houses in the cities. If you are renting, the property may be furnished with basic furniture. Also, consider available area parking if you plan to have a car.\nIn Ireland education is compulsory for children between the ages of 6-16, or until the student has completed three years of secondary schooling and passed the Junior Certificate examination.\nStudents may attend preschool from ages 3-4. After preschool, students attend primary school (ages 4-12), then secondary school (ages 12-16), after which students may receive their Junior Certificate and stop their education.\nFor those that choose to, they may go on to senior secondary school (ages 16-17) or vocational secondary for job specific training. After senior secondary, students may be awarded a Leaving Certificate and decide to attend university domestically or internationally.\nHow can you tell if an Irish person is having a good time? They will be Dublin over with laughter!\nBusses are the most common form of public transit in major cities. Additionally, rail networks are available in Dublin, Cork, Galway, and Limerick. If you’re traveling along the coast, hop on a ferry. Or, pedal your bike through the countryside and around town for an eco-friendly option. If you’re planning on driving, be sure to carefully review the rules before getting behind the wheel.\nAttractions: Museums and Nature\nSome of the top attractions in Ireland are:\n- Blarney Castle\n- Guinness Storehouse\n- Bunratty Castle\n- Temple Bar\n- The Book of Kells\n- Kylemore Abbey\n- St. Patrick’s Cathedral\nSome of the most beautiful natural features of Ireland include:\nMake multiple copies of your documentation and keep these materials in a safe place. These documents should include the location of your nearest home country embassy in case of emergency. When you travel, always be sure to provide at least one other person with your itinerary. Keep your belongings close to you, as pick pocketing is common throughout Europe.\nAs in every country, there are places that are dangerous to go to if you are unfamiliar with the area. Ask the locals where they do not go, and try to avoid traveling alone and at night. Avoid exchanging money at ATMs that look temporary in structure or location. If you choose to drink in Ireland, plan ahead with your group. Be sure everyone stays together and do not drink excessively, as this may increase chances of being a victim of crime.\nLocal police patrol high traffic areas to watch for suspicious activity. Whenever you travel to a new place, remember that it is best to avoid large crowds when possible. Always trust your instincts; if something feels wrong to you, leave the area immediately. Allow extra time to travel, especially across borders. The Irish drive on the left side of the road, so be sure to take extra caution as a driver if you are used to driving on the right side of the road.\nFacts about Ireland\n- The most famous symbol of Ireland is the green shamrock. This small three-leaf plant is said to have been used by St. Patrick to teach about the Trinity in the Catholic faith.\n- Many Irish last names begin with Mac/Mc or O’ which are Gaelic prefixes for “son of” and “grandson of.”\n- It is estimated that over 80 million people of Irish descent live outside Ireland in countries all over the world.\n- Irish wit and literature is beloved around the globe. Some of the most famous writers include Jonathan Swift, James Joyce, Oscar Wilde, and Bram Stoker.\n- Ireland was the first country to tax plastic shopping bags to protect the environment. This occurred in 2002.\n- Legend has it that Irish step dance originated in bars during a time when dancing was prohibited; people danced while keeping their upper bodies still so that if a passerby saw them through the windows, they would not be accused of dancing.\nDid you enjoy traveling to Ireland via this Destination Profile?

{"question":"What are the key differences between reducing friction through ball bearings versus banking of roads?","answer":"Ball bearings and banking of roads reduce friction in different ways. Ball bearings work by changing sliding friction to rolling friction, which is much smaller, and are commonly used in mechanical structures with moving parts. In contrast, banking of roads (raising the outer edge above the inner edge) eliminates the need to rely on friction altogether by providing the necessary centripetal force through the component of the normal reaction. This is particularly important since friction on roads can be unreliable due to wet or oily conditions, and excessive reliance on friction causes wear and tear of vehicle tires.","context":["|Science > Physics > Circular Motion > You are Here|\nSafe Velocity of a Vehicle on an Unbanked Road:\n- The necessary centripetal force required to negotiate a turn by a vehicle moving along a horizontal unbanked curved road is provided by the force of friction between the wheels (tyres) and the surface of the road.\n- Let us consider a vehicle of a mass ‘m’ is moving along a horizontal curved road of radius ‘r’ with speed ‘v’.\nLet μ be the coefficient of friction between the road surface and the wheels then\n- This expression gives the maximum speed with which a vehicle can be moved safely along a horizontal curved road. If speed is more than this velocity, then there is a danger that the vehicle will get thrown (skid) off the road.\nBanking of Road:\n- To make the turning of a vehicle on a curved road safer, the outer edge of the road is raised above the inner edge making some inclination with the horizontal. This is known as banking of road.\n- When the road is banked then, the inclination of the surface of the road with the horizontal is known as the angle of banking.\nNecessity of Banking of Road:\n- As the speed of vehicle increases, the centripetal force needed for the circular motion of vehicle also increases. In the case of unbanked road necessary centripetal force is provided by the friction between the tyres and the surface of the road. But there is a maximum limit for frictional force, which depends on the coefficient of friction between the wheels and road.\n- When the centripetal force needed exceeds the maximum limit of frictional force, the vehicle skids and tries to go off the curved path resulting in an accident.\n- Without proper friction, a vehicle will not be able to move on the curved road with large speed. To avoid this we may increase the force of friction making the road rough. However, this results in the wear and tear of the tyres of the vehicle. Also, the force of friction is not always reliable because it changes when roads are oily or wet due to rains etc. To eliminate this difficulty, the curved roads are generally banked.\n- Due to banking of the road, the necessary centripetal force is provided by the component of the normal reaction.\nThe Expression for the Angle of Banking of Road:\n- Consider a vehicle of mass ‘m’ is moving with speed ‘v’ on a banked road of radius ‘r’ as shown in the figure. Let ‘θ’ be the angle of banking. The weight “mg” of the vehicle acts vertically downwards through its centre of gravity G, and N is the normal reaction exerted on the vehicle by banked road AC. N is perpendicular to road AC. Let ‘f’ be the frictional force between the road and the tyres of the vehicle.\n- Now, the normal reaction is resolved into two components (N cosθ) along the vertical (acting vertically upward) and (N sinθ) along the horizontal (towards left) as shown in the figure. Similarly, the frictional force ‘f’ can be resolved into two components (f sinθ) along the vertical (acting vertically downward) and( f cosθ) along the horizontal (towards left) as shown in the figure.\nThe free body diagram of a car is as follows\nTotal upward force = Total downward force\n∴ N cosθ = mg + f sinθ\n∴ mg = N cosθ – f sinθ ….. (1)\nThe horizontal components N sinθ and f cosθ provides necessary centripetal force\nmv2/r = N sinθ + f cosθ …… (2)\nDividing equation (2) by (1)\nNow, frictional force f = μsN\nWhere μs = coefficient of friction between road and tyres\nThis is an expression for the velocity of a vehicle on a curved banked road.\nFor the given pair of road and tyre μs = tan λ, where λ = angle of friction\n- Case – I:\nWhen the road is horizontal θ = 0°\nThis is an expression for safe velocity on the unbanked road\n- Case – II:\nWhen the frictional force between the road and tyres of the vehicle is negligible μs = 0.\nThis is an expression for the angle of banking of a road.\nWhen friction is not mentioned in the problem, use this expression to solve the problems.\n- The expression for safe velocity on the banked road is\n- The speed will be maximum when tan θ = 1 i.e. θ = 45°. It means the vehicle can be driven with maximum safe speed only when the angle of banking = 45°.\nFactors affecting the angle of banking:\n- The angle of banking depends on the speed of the vehicle, the radius of the curved road and the acceleration due to gravity g at that place.\n- The expression does not contain the term m representing mass, thus the angle of banking is independent of mass ‘m’ of the vehicle. Thus the angle of banking is the same for heavy and light vehicles.\n- the angle of banking depends on the radius (r) of the curved road. The angle of banking is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature.\n- For the given radius of the curve, the angle of banking increases with the speed.\n- For the given radius of the curve and speed of the vehicle angle of banking is inversely proportional to the acceleration due to gravity at that place. The acceleration due to gravity is more on the pole than that at the equator. Thus for the given radius of the curve and speed of the vehicle angle of banking is less at the pole than that at the equator.\n- If l is the width of the banked road, then the elevation of an outer edge of the road over the inner edge (provided angle of banking is small) is given by\notherwise h = l sinθ\n- In actual practice, some frictional forces are always present even on the banked road. So that the actual safe velocity is always greater than the calculated safe velocity on the banked road.\nHigh Speed on Unbanked Road:\n- During motorcycle race, the riders negotiate the curve on a flat road in that case they have to tilt their motorcycle and themselves to compensate the angle of banking at that place.\n- A cycling race track is called velodrome which has a saucer-shaped track. The rider has to take a position on a track as per his/her speed.\nOverturning of Vehicle:\n- When a vehicle moves along a curved path with very high speed, then there is a chance of overturning of the vehicle. Inner wheel leaves ground first. Let a vehicle of a mass ‘m’ is negotiating a turn along a curved path of radius ‘r’ with speed ‘v’. Let ‘2a’ be the length of the axle i.e. the distance between the two wheels. Let h be the height of the centre of gravity of the vehicle above the ground. Let R1 and R2 be the reactions on the inner wheel and outer wheel of the vehicle exerted by the road surface.\nThe frictional force ‘F’ provides the necessary centripetal force.\nTaking the moment of forces about the centre of gravity ‘G’\nFh + R1a = R2a ………… (2)\nReactions are balanced by the weight of the vehicle\nR1 + R2 = mg …….. (3)\nSolving equations |(1), (2) and (3)\nFrom these equations, we can see that as the speed increases reaction R1 decreases while reaction R2 increases.\nWhen reaction R1 is zero overturning of the vehicle takes place.\nThis is an expression for maximum velocity of the vehicle by which it can be driven beyond which overturning of the vehicle takes place.\nIf μ < d/h, vehicle skids and if μ >d/h, vehicle overturns\n|Science > Physics > Circular Motion > You are Here|","Ways of Increasing Friction and Reducing Friction\nMethods of Reducing friction\nWear and tear due to friction depends on two factors: the roughness of the two surfaces in contact and the amount of time the two surfaces rub against each other. Wear and tear of an object is not desirable as it reduces its life. This is more so in case of moving parts in automobiles and machinery. Therefore, efforts are made to reduce friction between moving parts.\nFriction between moving parts is usually reduced by introducing a substance between the moving surfaces. This process is called lubrication. The substance introduced is called a lubricant. Common lubricants are oil and grease.\nBall bearings are also used to reduce friction. Ball bearings change sliding friction to rolling friction. This is a very useful thing to do since rolling friction is much smaller than sliding friction. Ball bearings are used in most mechanical structures which have moving parts. Small metal balls made of stainless steel, brass, ceramic, etc., are placed between moving surfaces (the surfaces . can be flat or cylindrical) to reduce friction.\nOther than friction between solid parts, there can also be friction due to fluids (e.g., air and water). The force of friction due to air and water (and other fluids) is called fluid friction. When cars and aeroplanes move at very high speeds, their motion is opposed by friction offered by the air molecules surrounding them. The friction of air produces what is called drag, which opposes the motion of the vehicle. The same applies to ships and boats. To reduce drag, automobiles, ships, and aeroplanes are given a special shape, called a streamlined shape. An automobile with a streamlined body experiences minimum resistance when travelling through air. Even sea creatures like fish and shark have streamlined bodies, which makes it easier for them to move with great speeds in water.\nFrictional force can be reduced in the following ways\n- Use of lubricants: In machines, friction can be reduced by applying lubricants between the contact surfaces to fill the fine pores or depressions in the surfaces and make them smooth thereby reducing friction.\n- Polishing : unevenness of the surfaces can be reduced by polishing, thereby reducing the friction.\n- Use of ball bearings: In rotating machines, shafts are mounted on ball bearings. By doing so, rolling friction occurs lesser than sliding friction, thereby reducing the friction.\n- By streamlining: Air friction is reduced by designing streamlined bodies of cars or aeroplanes. Similarly, if the bodies of boats and ships are streamlined, friction of water can be reduced.\nMethods of Increasing Friction\nThere are two methods of increasing friction: one is by making the surfaces rough and the other by increasing the mass of the object that is moving.\nFor example, the tyres of vehicles have treads (these are the ‘designs’ that you can see on the tyre surface), which increase the friction between the tyre and the road. Similarly, the soles of shoes have grooves, in order to increase friction. Gymnasts often apply a coarse material on their hands to get a better grip by increasing friction.\nAim: To show that greater friction causes increased wear and tear.\nMaterials needed: A new eraser, a piece of paper from your notebook, a piece of cardboard, and sandpaper.\nMethod: Use the eraser to rub on the different surfaces mentioned above. Each time, make a note of the amount of wear and tear on the eraser.\nObservation: You will see that the rougher the surface, the greater the wear and tear.\nConclusion: Greater friction causes increased wear and tear."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d2e7814a-b494-409c-ab0c-5e622923654d>","<urn:uuid:96ad49c5-8cec-4816-8432-8a2ce584c947>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role did fashion and textiles play in advancing women's artistic expression in both 18th century France and early 20th century Paris?","answer":"In 18th century France, Rose Bertin used fashion strategically to create visibility for women at Court, designing dresses up to 3 meters wide to establish a visual presence for nobles like Marie Antoinette who lacked political power. This was a subtle way to gain influence in an environment where women's fundamental rights were invisible. Similarly, in early 20th century Paris, Sonia Delaunay used fashion and textiles as an artistic medium, establishing her own boutique La Maison Delaunay and creating innovative designs like the geometric pattern coat for Gloria Swanson. She applied her artistic theories about color and simultanisme to everyday items, from textiles to fashion design, though unlike Bertin's subtle approach, Delaunay could openly pursue her artistic vision through commercial ventures.","context":["Figure 1: Vigée Le Brun 1800. A posthumous portrait of Marie Antoinette. Figure 2: Vigée Le Brun c 1800. Rose Bertin.\nThe history of women during the four stages of the French Revolution and the roles that they played, remain hotly debated and somewhat obscure to this day. According to Yves Bessieres’ and Patricia Niedzwiecki’s journal \"WOMEN IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION (1789)\" commissioned by Institute for the Development of the European Cultural Area, there are almost 1,500 historical documents written by those who witnessed the French Revolution. The lack of women mentioned in these documents is attributed, according to Bessieres and Niedzwiecki, to the fact that out of the officially recognised 17,500 people guillotine, only 166 were women (Bessieres and Niedzwiecki. 1991). This coupled with the fact that history has been predominantly documented by men for men, creates an absence of investigative and diverse historical data regarding the role French women played in the Revolution and women in our collective history.\nThe lack of rights for women in acquiring certain skills and professional positions in a man’s world meant the female race and her history had been largely ignored and left at the mercy of a patriarchal society that fought against the very notion of semblance that women could equally achieve what men could. It’s understandable that such a society would not have readily endorse any narrative that reeked female heroism. And like Marie Antoinette, the visual depiction of women in the French Revolution has been vastly distorted, one dimensional and primitive.\nOn 5 October 1789, around 6,000 women marched to Versailles protesting the staggering 97% of wages, the poorest of the poor needed to purchase bread for their families. Their march triggered the rapid dethronement of the King and the First and Second Estates, but the women are most remembered and depicted as angry, vulgar wild beasts with axes and spikes. Any precursor to the nature of their characters was erased, leaving us with an unfair glimpse of angry and vicious women. By contrast, their male revolutionary counterparts were written about with a degree of dignity despite being responsible for some of the most ignoble acts. Leaders like Robespierre and lesser known male players in the revolution were celebrated and presented in a less derogatory manner, leaving their unsuitable mortal moments out of the spotlight. However, let’s put some facts and figures into perspective. By the end of the eighteen century, France was unsustainable, its population was over 28 million, 20 million of which were poor peasants and half of that 20 million were women. Of the 20 million 80% were illiterate and of the remaining percentage that was considered cultured, the majority were women (Bessieres and Niedzwiecki. 1991). Despite these numbers and the fact that members of women’s rights groups were prominent in the marches, their roles at the time, were reduced to vague and unflattering anecdotes by eye witness writers of the revolution.\nIn my quest to rebuild and restore the visual image of Marie Antoinette using conceptual photography, I’m also indirectly restoring the image of many women who fought for and against each other during the French Revolution.\nFigure 3: Alexandre Kucharski 1787. Marie Olympe de Gouges. Figure 4: Vigée Le Brun 1782. Self-portrait in a Straw Hat. Oil\nRights of Women Pre-Revolution\nThe rights of women in France leading up to the French Revolution were virtually non-existing. Women had no political rights to vote, they were barred from holding political office, and their schooling and education were generally focused on being a good wife and homemaker. Our personal preferences, like hobbies that we cherish and consider our private right, were not private for women in 18th century France. A woman’s activities and hobbies were centred around learning the interests of their husbands and adapting them. Gambling which we have associated strongly with male activity was part of French noble women’s activities. And Antoinette in her younger teenage years at Versailles was none the less an active participant in adopting particular hobbies and interests as were the social norm.\nWomen pre- revolutionary France like many of their counterparts around the world, relied on men for direction and decisions on how they should be governed. Prior to the Revolution, the seeds of feminism were quietly but firmly growing on all levels of French society. You had women of nobility and influence like Marie Antoinette, Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun and Rose Bertin who visually asserted their presence and influence using art and fashion to garner political favours and admiration that were denied to them because of their gender. Then you had the ordinary woman who worked as a flower girl or servant becoming more and more dissatisfied with unequal pay, their male counterparts earning 50% more for similar jobs. In the middle were the intellectual women who created organisations pre-revolution that promoted the rights of women, these groups were dismantled during 1794-1800.\nThe playwright and notable feminist Olympe De Gouges, who wrote ‘Les Droits de la Femme, 1791’ –‘ Declaration of the Rights of Woman, 1791’, was arrested, tried and sentenced to the guillotine on 2 November 1793, ironically on what would have been, Antoinette’s 38th birthday. Olympe was beheaded the following day, 3 November 1793, eighteen days after the beheading of Antoinette. Interestingly, when authorities failed to find any evidence against Olympe when they searched her property, she led them to a storage area where she kept her papers, it was in one of her plays depicting the Queen and the Revolution that would be used against her at trial.\nDuring the French Revolution, Olympe De Gouges advocated for change in the conditions of slaves in the colonies (1788), three years later, she would write her declaration, demanding equality for women, after all, the Revolution was about liberty, equality and the rights of man, for the people by the people. However, while De Gouge's views suited the revolution movement, she was also sympathetic to the monarchy and wanted it to remain in place. When Louis XVI was put on trial, she offered to defend him and had suggested he should be exiled rather than beheaded. The preface of her famed Declaration of the Rights of Woman was dedicated to the Queen, Marie Antoinette. It’s quite telling and complimentary that one of the world’s most extraordinary people, a supporter of human rights and renown feminist, was also a supporter of Marie Antoinette. It lends credence that a person living in such times, who was most aware of the political landscape, truth and gossip, would not have supported the queen had she believed the political pornographic pamphlets and the vast amount of propaganda against Antoinette.\nFigure 5: Le Brun 1783. Marie Antoinette in Muslin Dress. oil. Figure 6: Le Brun 1783. Antoinette with a rose. oil.\nGetting back to the nobility, women like Rose Bertin, for example, supported equality of the woman at Court - the French royal, political, social arena for networking. Bertin designed her dresses for women of nobility as wide as 2 to 3 metres. This was a strategic move to create a visual sensation and acknowledgement of the woman, in an environment where her political power and fundamental rights were invisible. It was subtle in its way of agenda, but the impact it had was profound. It enabled women like Marie Antoinette, though she was the Queen of France, she had no real political influence, but with Bertin’s designs she would become the Queen of Fashion, gossiped and talked about more than her husband, the king, and all other men of political power and influence. In some respects, one can speculate that it was her rise in celebrity status that furthered infused a sense of feminism among other women, who were already tirelessly working to promote the rights of women with their clandestine get-togethers or subtle, political bourgeois tea parties.\nAntoinette’s friend and favourite portrait artist, Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun, was equally subtle in her agenda to promote a powerful narrative of women using art. Her portrait of Antoinette in a chemise dress caused a scandal, and Vigée Le Brun was forced to redo the painting with Antoinette in proper Queen’s attire. Leading up to the Revolution when anti-monarchy sentiments were growing alongside outrageous bread prices, Le Brun would later paint Antoinette with her children in a solemn scene, an empty cradle symbolic of the child Antoinette lost, the portrait was meant to garner sympathy for the royal family and promote a softer narrative of Antoinette. Suffice to say; it was a little too late; the damage had already taken hold.\nFigure 7: Baptiste 2017. The Pillars that held Four.\nIn spite of the horrors during the Reign of Terror, women of the Revolution made their mark, collectively and individually, and as we look back at history, it’s decent to note all those who played a role in fighting for the rights of all genders.

BAPTISTE, MANDISA. 2017. The Pillars that held Four.","Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris\n17 October 2014 – 22 February 2015\nby NICOLA HOMER\nSonia Delaunay was a Paris School painter and designer. The Ukrainian-born artist played a vital role in the story of modern art as it unfolded in the 20th-century avant garde. The abstract artist was a pioneer of simultanisme (orphism), which she and her husband Robert Delaunay developed out of cubism in the mid-1910s. And she was the first living woman to have an exhibition at the Louvre. Yet she is little mentioned in art history books on the era, such as The Story of Modern Art.1 Now you can rediscover the artist in a major European show, which is on display in Paris through the winter and will travel to London in the spring.\nSonia Delaunay: Les Couleurs de l’Abstraction at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris is the first major Parisian retrospective devoted to the artist since 1967.2 Organised by the Musée d’Art Moderne with the Bibliothèque Nationale de France and the Pompidou Centre, it brings together more than 400 works, including paintings, murals, gouaches, prints, textiles and fashion designs. Finely curated by Anne Montfort and Cécile Godefroy, it explores the evolution of the artist from the early-20th century to the 1970s. The galleries give the impression of stage sets, adorned with rare gems of colour, which are a real delight to see. When the show opens in London on 15 April, it will be the first UK retrospective to assess the breadth of the artist’s career.\nDelaunay (née Stern, then Terk) was born in 1885 to a working-class Jewish family of three children. At a young age, she moved to St Petersburg to live with her maternal uncle, a successful lawyer. Through his family, she received the cultural sustenance of the bourgeoisie. Travels through Europe acquainted her not only with the galleries of the Hermitage, but also the Uffizi in Florence and the Munich Pinakothek. In 1904, she studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Karlsruhe, Germany. She arrived in Paris in 1906, the year in which Paul Cézanne’s Les Grandes Baigneuses (c1894-1905) was exhibited. With his pictorial fracturing, Cézanne signposted the way for Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, who, “roped together like mountaineers”, as Braque said, pioneered cubism, recognised as one of the turning points in western art.\nOn arrival in Paris, Sonia discovered the post-impressionists Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh, and absorbed the influence of the Fauves, such as Henri Matisse and André Derain, who used bold colours and a wild application of paint to create expressionist works. Early in the show, you can see paintings remembering her childhood holidays in Finland, such as Jeune Finlandaise (1907). The vibrant colour and pictorial arrangement of the artist’s figures, which stand against ornamental backgrounds, portray the influence of Matisse. Nu Jaune(1908) is painted in the tradition of Édouard Manet’s masterpiece Olympia (1863). The painting suggests a primitivism that is reminiscent of Matisse’s Blue Nude, Souvenir of Biskra (1907) and calls to mind the expressionism of Die Brücke, a group of German expressionist artists active in Dresden at the time.\nIn 1910, Sonia married Robert Delaunay and, in 1911, gave birth to their son, Charles. The cradle cover she designed, Couverture de Berceau (1911) is modelled on textiles of Russian peasants, but has a cubist pattern, which is typical of how she applied art to everyday life. By 1912, she and Robert were pioneering a new approach to cubism called simultanisme, also known as orphism, a term coined by the poet Guillaume Apollinaire.3 Sonia emphasised the dynamic power of colour and drew on her reading of the French chemist Michel-Eugène Chevreul. The chemist had an effect on the impressionists with his book, De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs, published in Paris in 1839, and his theories formed the basis for the Delaunays’ experimentation.4\nThe title of Sonia’s painting Contrastes Simultanés (1912) translates his ideas into a visual language of simultaneous, contrasting colours, which enhance each other, and in turn, add greater vibrancy to the painting.\nWhile Robert wrote about “rhythmic simultaneity”,5 and produced paintings, such as a series entitled Les Fenêtres simultanées sur la ville (1912), Sonia understood the effect of contrasting colours within the context of everyday life. The artist decorated boxes, produced book designs and fabrics, experimenting with the applied arts. Yet she often displayed a refined sense of poetry in her work. One of the highlights of the exhibition is a “simultaneous book”, which can be folded like a concertina. Entitled La Prose du Transsibérien et de La Petite Jehanne de France (1913), it was produced with Sonia’s great friend, the globe-trotting poet Blaise Cendrars. The poem is based on a journey on the Trans-Siberian Express. At the time, its fragmented, modernist design was revolutionary. The work is viewed as a masterpiece of avant-garde literature and poetry, because it presents such an original fusion of poetry and painting.\nOne of the unifying themes of the exhibition is the artist’s fascination with natural and electric light. Sonia often explored the simultaneous contrasts of colour that she observed around the city. The modern life of Paris inspired a selection of remarkable studies of crowds on the Boulevard Saint-Michel, where she recorded the modernising effects of Baron Haussmann’s new boulevards. The play of light across swirling figures in a dance hall creates a sense of movement in the series of Le Bal Bullier (1913) and the colour of technology has a magnetic aura in Prismes Électriques (1913). Together, they give an impression of the dynamism and energy of modern life.\nSurprised by the first world war, the Delaunays took refuge in Spain and then moved to Portugal, where Sonia continued her figurative studies. At this time, she painted flamenco dancers and captured the radiant light of the countryside and the colour of popular markets, as seen in orange-sellers. On returning to France in the 1920s, she created “dress poems” and costumes for the dadaists in Paris in 1922-23. The following year, she set up a textiles workshop, and then opened a boutique, La Maison Delaunay, and collaborated with the Dutch store Metz & Co. The 1920s were halcyon days for Sonia, during which she made an impact on the international world of fashion. In particular, she designed a wonderful coat in a geometric pattern for the American actor Gloria Swanson, which is on display in the museum. The glorious decade marked the culmination of the colourful, lyrical movement of simultanisme. The Depression cast a long shadow over the business. However, the artist’s foray into fashion anticipated the 21st-century evolution of the Finnish brand Marimekko, whose contemporary design language refers to orphism and the work of Sonia Delaunay on its website. Not only does this major European retrospective show why she was a doyenne of the 20th-century avant garde, but it reveals how her legacy brings art to everyday life today.\n• Sonia Delaunay: Les Couleurs de l’Abstraction will be on show at Tate Modern in London, 15 April – 9 August 2015.\n1.

Somehow,\nhistorians believe, Amos Humiston had managed to drag himself to this patch of ground\nafter he had been wounded, and was probably looking at his children's faces when he\nEven then, Humiston might have faded into obscurity, because there was nothing on his\nbody to identify him and the few soldiers from his unit survived the battle had moved\non before he was found. Somehow, though, the image of his children ended up in the\npossession of Dr. John Francis Bourns, a 49-year-old Philadelphia physician who\nhelped care for the wounded at Gettysburg. Months after wrapping up his volunteer\nwork there, he decided to try to find out the identity of the children's father.\nHis efforts produced a wave of publicity\nthat swept the North and became the\nPeople magazine cover story of its day. It\nbegan quietly enough, on Oct. 19, 1863,\nwhen the Philadelphia Inquirer published\na story under the provocative headline:\n\"Whose Father Was He?\"\nAfter the battle of Gettysburg,\" the article read, \"a Union soldier was found in a\nsecluded spot on the battlefield, where, wounded, he had laid himself down to die. In\nhis hands, tightly clasped, was an ambrotype containing the portraits of three small\nchildren ... and as he silently gazed upon them his soul passed away. How touching!\nHow solemn! ...\"\n\"It is earnestly desired that all papers in the country will draw attention to the discovery\nof this picture and its attendant circumstances, so that, if possible, the family of the\ndead hero may come into possession of it. Of what inestimable value will it be to these\nchildren, proving, as it does, that the last thought of their dying father was for them,\nand them only.\"\nWhen the article appeared 140 years ago, newspapers were not able to publish\nphotographs, and so the story, subsequently reprinted in dozens of newspapers and\nmagazines throughout the North, had to rely on a detailed description of the children.\nThe eldest boy, it said, was wearing a shirt made of the same fabric as his sister's\ndress. The younger boy in the middle was sitting on a chair, wearing a dark suit. It\nestimated their ages at 9, 7, and 5, only a year off the mark.\nOne of the reprints appeared in the\nAmerican Presbyterian, a church\nmagazine. That is where Philinda\nHumiston, living in Portville, N.Y., first\nsaw word of the ambrotype and the dead\nsoldier. She hadn't heard from Amos\nsince weeks before Gettysburg, and\nwhen she saw the description of the\nchildren, she feared the worst. But she\ncouldn't be sure. So she contacted\nBourns through a letter written by the\nBourns had printed copy upon copy of\nthe children's picture to respond to\n|Amos Humiston's Grave at the\nGettysburg National Cemetery\ninquiries, but so far, none of the people who had contacted him had turned out to be the\nright family. He replied to Philinda's inquiry as he had to the others.\nAnd so it was that one mid-November day, four months after the battle, she opened the\nenvelope from Philadelphia and knew for sure that she had been widowed for a second\ntime, and that her children were fatherless.\nThe story might have ended there if it weren't for another idea Bourns had. He believed\nhe could capitalize on the outpouring of sympathy toward the Humistons to raise funds\nfor an orphanage in Gettysburg, to house the children of fallen Union soldiers. And so a\nsecond publicity campaign began, appealing for donations.\nGifts came from the wealthy and the\nhumble. Among the contributors was\nfinancier Jay Gould, one of the richest men\nin America. But Sunday school classes also\npitched in to raise money, and, if they\ndonated a sufficient amount, they could\nreceive copies of a popular song called\n\"Children of the Battlefield\" by balladeer\nJames Gowdy Clark, whose first stanza\nconcluded with the lines, \"and blame him\nnot, if in the strife, he breathed a soldier's\nprayer: Father, shield the soldier's wife, and\nfor his children care.\"\nThe orphanage became a reality in October\n1866 and began with 22 soldiers' children\nranging in age from 5 to 12. At its peak, the\nHomestead, as it was known, had just\nunder 100 children. Bourns even asked\nPhilinda Humiston to move there with her\nchildren and help supervise the home,\nwhich gave her a means of support.\nNational Soldier's Orphan Home\nFrank Humiston is on line 15 and\nFred is on line 23.\nClick on thumbnail to view larger image.\nShe agreed to the arrangement but loathed living in Gettysburg, according to Humiston\nbiographer Mark H. Dunkelman. Possibly in order to escape, she accepted a marriage\nproposal from a retired preacher she had met only briefly as he passed through the\ntown. She wed Asa Barnes in 1869 and moved to Massachusetts. Her children finished\ntheir schooling in Gettysburg and then joined her.\nThe orphanage itself would have a short, unhappy history. It closed just 12 years after\nit opened, crippled by two scandals. The matron of Homestead, Rosa Carmichael, was\naccused of abusing the children and even shackling some of them in a dungeon she had\ncreated in the basement. And Bourns, the man who had made the Humistons famous\nand founded the orphanage, was accused of embezzling large sums of money from\nOf the Humiston children, Frank was the only one to receive a higher education,\nattending Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania medical school.

His home was in the Boston\narea, where he married and had two\ndaughters, but his sales work took him\nfrom Canada to Florida. In his 50s, he\nbegan to suffer from heart disease, and he\ndied in 1918, at age 59.\nAlice lived with her mother for several\nyears, ran a chicken farm for a short while,\nthen began to move almost constantly.\nFinally she settled in Southern California,\nliving near a namesake niece.

The first\nsettlement was made in 1805, by James\nGreen, on Haskell Creek in the north part\nof town. The first child born was Hannah\nGreen, daughter of James Green on April\n28, 1807. The first marriage was between Jonathon Dodge and Eunice Atherton, in\n1809. David Heusten was the first person to die, killed by the spring of a tree while\ngetting out spars, in early 1807. The first school was taught by Anna Carpenter, near\nPortville Village. Lyman Rice kept the first inn, in 1822 and Allen Rice the first store in\n1823. The first gristmill was located on Dodges Creek, started by Samuel King. The\nfirst sawmill, on Haskell Creek, was erected by James Green and Alpheus Dodge in\n1807. The first church was formed in 1824.\nThe Village of Portville is 0.81 square miles in area and had 1,136 residents in 1980,\n1,040 residents in 1990, and 1,024 residents in 2000.

These tribes included the Shawnee in the southwest, the Susquehannock in the south, the Delaware in the southeast, and the Iroquois (Oneida and Seneca tribes) in the north.\nEuropeans began to explore the region around Pennsylvania in the early 1600s. English explorer Captain John Smith sailed up the Susquehanna River and met with some of the Native Americans in the area in 1608. Henry Hudson also explored the area on behalf of the Dutch in 1609. Although both England and the Netherlands laid claim to the land it was several years before people began to settle Pennsylvania.\nWilliam Penn founded the colony of Pennsylvania\nAn English Colony\nThe first settlers in the region were the Dutch and the Swedish. However, the British defeated the Dutch in 1664 and took control over the area. In 1681, William Penn was given a large area of land by King Charles II of England. He named the land Pennsylvania after his family name \"Penn\" and after the forests in the land (\"sylvania is \"forest land\" in Latin).\nPenn wanted his colony to be a place of religious freedom. Some of the first settlers were Welsh Quakers looking for a place where they could practice their religion without persecution. Throughout the early 1700s more people from Europe immigrated to Pennsylvania. Many of them came from Germany and Ireland.\nDuring the 1700s, Pennsylvania had many border disputes with other colonies. Portions of northern Pennsylvania were claimed by New York and Connecticut, the exact southern border was in dispute with Maryland, and parts of the southwest were claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia. Most of these disputes were ironed out by 1800. The border with Maryland, which was called the Mason-Dixon Line after surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, was established in 1767. It would later be considered the border between the North and the South.\nWhen the American Colonies decided to fight for their independence during the American Revolution, Pennsylvania was at the center of the action. Philadelphia served as the capital throughout much of the revolution and was the meeting place for the First and Second Continental Congress. It was at Independence Hall in Philadelphia where the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776.\nThe clocktower at Independence Hall\nby Captain Albert E. Theberge (NOAA)\nSeveral battles were fought in Pennsylvania as the British wanted to capture Philadelphia. In 1777, the British defeated the Americans at the Battle of Brandywine and then took control of Philadelphia. That winter General George Washington and the Continental Army stayed at Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, not too far outside Philadelphia. The British left the city a year later in 1778, retreating back to New York City.\nAfter the war ended, the Constitutional Convention met at Philadelphia to create a new Constitution and government for the country in 1787. On December 12, 1787, Pennsylvania ratified the Constitution and became the 2nd state to join the Union.\nWhen the Civil War broke out in 1861, Pennsylvania remained loyal to the Union and played a vital role in the war. The state provided over 360,000 troops as well as supplies for the Union army. Since Pennsylvania was near the border between the North and the South, southern Pennsylvania was raided by the Confederate Army. The largest battle to take place in the state was the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, which many consider to be the turning point in the war. Gettysburg was also the site of Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address.\nPennsylvania Memorial, Gettysburg Battlefield\nMore US State History:\n- 1608 - English explorer Captain John Smith sails up the Susquehanna River.\n- 1609 - Henry Hudson claims much of the region for the Dutch.\n- 1643 - Swedish settlers found the first permanent settlement.\n- 1664 - The land comes under the control of the British.\n- 1681 - William Penn is given a large tract of land by King Charles II.

{"question":"Did both the Museum Kircherianum and the Ashmolean Museum maintain collections of mechanical devices and automatons?","answer":"The Museum Kircherianum definitely housed a collection of mechanical devices and automatons, including optical and acoustic machines, music boxes, hydraulic and astronomical machines, clockworks, tools and toys, and mechanical puppets. For the Ashmolean Museum, while the documents show it maintained extensive collections of various items including curiosities, antiquities, and natural specimens, there is no specific mention of a comparable collection of mechanical devices and automatons.","context":["The german Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) (see biography of Athanasius Kircher) was a famous 17th century Jesuit scholar, who published around 40 works, most notably in the fields of oriental studies, geology, medicine and music theory. Kircher’s best-known work today is his Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652–54)—a vast study of Egyptology and comparative religion. His books, written in Latin (which was the common scientific language then), had a wide circulation in the 17th century, and they contributed to the dissemination of scientific information to a broader circle of readers.\nMost of his life Kircher lived in Rome (from 1635), where he was to stay, until his death, at the Jesuit Roman College. There the philosopher was very much in the right place at the right time!\nFrom 1638 onwards Kircher was professor in mathematics at the Roman college, but his interest covered everything under the sun, (there were still such Renaissance men in the 17th century, let’s remember only Leibniz). When he was released from teaching duties after 8 years, he started publishing books, concentrating on a different subject every three to four years. He received visits or letters from scientists, royalty and clergy from all over Europe and beyond, together with a multitude of artifacts, curiosities of natural history and mechanical apparatus. These, together with his huge library, he later donated to a museum, which eventually became the famous museum of the Roman College or the Museum Kircherianum. This museum became one of the top attractions of Rome in the 17th century.\nThe interesting for us event happened in 1669, when Kircher published in Amsterdam his book Ars Magna Sciendi, Sive Combinatoria (see the lower image).\nIn the third chapter of this book is presented a new and universal version of the Llullistic method of combination of notions. Kircher seems to be convinced that the Llullistic art of combination is a secret and mystical matter, some kind of esoteric doctrine.\nKircher used the same circle-figures of Llull, but the alphabet which Kircher proposes as material for his combination-machine reveals the difference to Lullus’ at first sight (see the figure bellow). It is not the signification in correlation with the position in the table, because all nine places in each table are filled with the same significations we find in the Llullistic tables, that makes the difference. It is the notation, which creates the difference.\nIn contrast with Llull, who used Latin words, words with clearly defined significations for his combinations, Kircher began filling the tables with signs and symbols of a different kind. This means, that he attempted to solve problems other than the demonstration of the truth, which the Catholic Church had claimed.\nFurthermore, as can be seen from the following figure, Kircher tried to calculate the possible combinations of all limited alphabets (not only graphical, but also mathematical). As it is known, that at that time Kircher was a grand master of decipherment and tried to translate Egyptian hieroglyphic texts, it is clear that this schema can be connected to the process of encoding and decoding. Regarding his tabula generalis, the more mathematical way of thinking created the great difference between Llull and Kircher.\nKircher consequently published a book about the problems of encoding and decoding, and he even designed mechanical machines for the task. In addition, he himself collected machines and automata of different kinds: optical and acoustic machines, music boxes, hydraulic and astronomical machines, clockworks, tools and toys, mechanical puppets, and so on. This collection will became a foundation for the famous Museum Kircherianum","British Antiquarian and Archaeological Archives at the Ashmolean Museum:\nHistoric Ashmolean Museum Archives\nThe Department of Antiquities' archive contains catalogues and papers relating to the early history of the Ashmolean Museum. For many years these documents were housed in the Ashmolean Museum Library, but were returned to the department in the mid-1990s, prior to the Ashmolean libary being incorporated in the Sackler Library ( opened in 2001).

{"question":"Me new to logistics - what basic parts included in ecommerce logistics?","answer":"E-commerce logistics consists of several key processes: warehousing, picking, packing, and shipping. It also includes sourcing, fulfillment, inventory management, returns, and refunds. The process starts from the manufacturer and continues until the product reaches the consumer.","context":["E-commerce logistics is the art and science of moving physical products online, from the manufacturer to the consumer. The logistics process starts by designing your e-commerce website. This platform should address all of the necessary steps for selling and shipping products, including the need to define and track inventory, create purchase orders, and handle customer returns. Then comes packaging and shipping.\nAs e-commerce continues to grow at an astounding rate, online sellers will need to focus on developing an effective logistics strategy to continue to grow. The logistics strategies need to be tailored to fit different business needs. For example, a logistics strategy for online sellers can consist of multiple parts, including sourcing, fulfillment, warehousing, inventory management, shipping, returns and refunds, and more.\nEcommerce logistics is a term used to describe all the associated processes that take place – from fulfillment to the customer – when shipping products. Logistics is a complex system comprising several moving parts, including warehousing, picking, packing, and shipping. While successful e-commerce companies know that having a strategy that effectively integrates these processes is crucial for success, too many businesses fail to understand that logistics design has a lot to do with efficiency.\nKnow Your Customers and Audience\nIn order to have a successful e-commerce business and a positive customer experience, you must first and foremost focus on who your customers are. Making an effective call to action will help you to encourage your users to become long-term customers. As a result, your customers will have a better shopping experience, and you can tailor the various logistical factors to suit their preferences.\nAn e-commerce company’s success often depends on how well its logistics strategy is designed. By strategically selecting “their” logistics strategy, a company can control the products they ship to and from its customers. The logistics strategy is also crucial in ensuring that customers receive their orders quickly and are able to compare prices, delivery times, and shipping times across services.\nKnow Your Products\nThis is critical! A well-organized warehouse can be made possible by having a variety of products with varying dimensions, shapes, and weights. Keep in mind that there are certain items that have a short product lifecycle, and have to be planned for accordingly. Also, be prepared for a bullwhip effect. When you know your products well and plan for them, you can quickly access the most in-demand items and optimize your operations in terms of both time and space.\nWhen you know what you’re dealing with, you’ll be able to figure out how much weight each package carries, how much space it takes up, and how to best store it. Many online retailers already use product organization and storage organization to improve and smooth their operations. As a result, knowing what you’re dealing with can help you better organize.\nWho are your Collaborators?\nLogistics are a critical component in any successful e-commerce business. Having the right supply chain strategy can make or break your business. Businesses need to either have their own logistics, or they have to outsource processes such as warehousing, shipping, and order fulfillment capabilities (learn more), so that they can better serve customers, increase sales and grow their business.\nE-commerce logistics is critical to your e-commerce business. Logistics is a broad term that refers to the flow of goods from origin to destination. It’s more than shipping. It includes all of the activities involved in moving goods from point a to point b. That means your logistics strategy must include internal processes, such as accurate inventory control, as well as external processes, such as your vendor relationships, carrier selection, service levels, and order fulfillment and tracking.\nFurthermore, the processes of different logistics businesses have led to the rise of environmental concerns. In turn, many logistics service providers have begun implementing sustainable practices into their work processes to reduce their impact on the planet. Several may have even begun monitoring their environmental impact with the help of professionals from envirosuite.com and other similar sites. This collaboration enables logistics firms to make better-informed decisions through predictive modelling, real-time altering, and maintaining preventive measures.\nConsider Expanding Sales Network\nE-commerce continues to grow at stunning rates. The sales are projected to reach $3.8 trillion by 2020, which accounts for 17% of all shopping activity. This translates into a lot of competition. For brands looking to compete, e-commerce logistics should be at the forefront of their strategy.\nE-commerce logistics management software is the key to creating a streamlined and optimized operation, ultimately leading to better profits and customer satisfaction. However, designing a logistics strategy that works while managing risks and costs can be a challenging process, especially for smaller e-commerce businesses. The key is to design solutions based on your company’s specific needs and scale, with the understanding that you will need to make continual adjustments as your business grows.\nFinalize Everything Adjust if Needed\nLogistics is one of the most important parts of designing an e-commerce business strategy. There are many logistics companies that you must decide between, and these choices can have a huge effect on your business. Adjust your strategy if needed because this will save you a lot of money in the long run.\nImplementing the Strategy\nWhen we talk about e-commerce logistics strategy, we are talking about every element of the logistics process. The strategy involves how you organize your warehouse, the inventory system you use, your shipping process, etc. As e-commerce grows, so does the need for logistics. Companies realize they need a logistics strategy in order to run smoothly and efficiently."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:01db9bd5-be29-4a7d-8e4a-8d514032125e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do different languages handle uncomfortable sound combinations? Please provide examples.","answer":"Different languages handle uncomfortable sound combinations in two main ways: some languages alter these uncomfortable character combinations into more comfortable ones in writing, while others maintain the etymological writing but alter the pronunciation. This varies between languages as the concept of comfort is relative to each language. For example, German and Dutch, though closely related, have different comfortable pronunciations - the word 'book' is pronounced as 'Buch' in German but 'boek' in Dutch. Even within the same language, like American and British English, pronunciation can differ so significantly that speakers may have difficulty understanding each other in rapid speech.","context":["By reading this chapter you should be aware about Novoslovnica phonemes. At the beginning we will speak about two main features of the language: reproduction and alternation.\nReproduction (extra sounds) – is a process of adding a new sound (consonant or vowel) in the word.\nAlternation – is a process of changing some sound (consonant or vowel) or sounds to another one(s).\nWhat are the purposes of alternation and reproduction? These terms both obtain the single aim – to make our speech comfortable for ourselves.\nEvery language has its own comfortable combinations of sounds and avoided ones. Some languages alternate these uncomfortable character rows into another ones that are comfortable for language speaker in writing, some languages keep writing etymological and alternate the pronunciation of the uncomfortable words. Take into account the fact, that the concept of comfort is relative, that means two different languages (which are spoken by different nations) have different modes of comfort.\nExample: you can look at and compare German and Dutch languages. They are very close, but they have different ways for comfortable pronunciation. The word “book” in German sounds like “Buch”, but in Holland it sounds like “boek”. Thus, you see that these words are familiar, but their pronunciation differs a lot.\nMoreover, even one language spoken in different areas can differ greatly in the areas it is spoken.\nExample: American and British English. You know that it is still the same language, but pronunciation differs so greatly that American person can not always understand in ordinary speech (quick temp of speaking) what the British person have said.\nThis is the example how the same language differs in areas it is spoken. Furthermore, these areas should not be far away from each other. You can find information about different patois and even dialects in very small regions.\nNovoslovnica as a panslavic language absorbs different conceptions of the comfort term of Slavic languages.\nWhen reproduction is used, we add a new sound before the word we want to say. It can be whether a vowel or a consonant, depending on the previous letter in the word.\nWhen should we reproduce a sound? To deal with this problem, you should know a thesis, which is widely used in Novoslovnica.\nRule #: After consonant there should be placed a vowel. And after a vowel there should be placed a consonant.\nThis rule will help you in speaking and writing, when you construct your words with the reproduction.\nThere is a limited row of sounds that are allowed to participate in reproduction. In the table 2.1 you can see all of them.\n|Ï [i]||V [v]|\n|O [o]||J [ʝ]|\n- Осем osem (eight) [‘osɛm] – восем vosem [‘vosɛm]\n- Гра gra (game) [ɦra] – ігра ïgra [i’ɦra]\nSo now the only problem is to know about how should we reproduce these sounds.\nReproduction of consonants can be found in different parts of the word. There are three places, where reproduction can appear – the beginning of the word, middle part of the word and the ending of the word.\nWhen we speak about the beginning of the word, we should take into account what sound is at the end of the previous word. Due to rule 2 we should try to keep the “consonant-vowel” sequence inside our sentence. That’s why, we should do actions from the list below:\n- If the previous word ends with the vowel and temporal word begins also with the vowel we should add in the beginning of the word a consonant V or J. The choice of what letter to add depends on the vowel which is in the temporal word.\n- We should choose J for soft vowels\n- We should choose V for hard ones.\n- If there is one consonant and one vowel in the set of the first letter from the temporal word and the last letter from the previous word, we should not add nothing.\nSpeaking about word endings, rule 2 is also very important. We should add a letter B to the end of the word, if the next word begins with the vowel and temporal word ends with the vowel too.\nAs you see these two principles are practically equal, because wherever we add a consonant, the result will be the same. So the question is, when we should add to the end of the word a consonant and when we should add it to the beginning of the word. In practice, almost always we use the first case, when we add a consonant to the beginning of the word. The second case is used in prepositional constructions with such a word as “O” (about) (Look: “O” – “Ob”). In other cases try to use letters В and Ј for reproduction.\nThe third case of consonant reproduction is to reproduce it in the middle of the word. It is used, when there is a row of vowels in the word and it is difficult to pronounce them all together. Then you can divide them by the consonant J, which is put between the neighbor vowels. Don’t confuse it with the case, when with the addition of a vowel letter Ǐ transforms to letter Ј (see the next paragraph for it) and you receive to vowels divided by this consonant two. Look at the examples of consonant reproduction in the middle of the word.\n- Ідиот ïdiot (idiot) [idɨ’ot] – ідијот ïdijot [idɨ’ʝot]\nThe same situation is about vowel reconstruction. You can find it in the beginning, in the middle and in the end of the word, but it is a bit simpler than a previous one. Vowel reproduction appears when there is a rather large amount of consonants in one place of the sentence. This means that you can find a row of consonants in the word or a consonant conjunction in the end of one word and in the beginning of the next one. In any case, you should concern here about whether it is comfortable for you to pronounce these combinations of sounds.\nIn the beginning of the word we add a vowel Ï and there are no other cases. Very simple.\n- Гра gra (game) [ɦra] – ігра ïgra [i’ɦra]\nIn the middle or in the end of the word we add a vowel O. This case is used with prepositions and prefixes (“K” – “Ko”, “S” – “So” etc).\n- К дому k domu (to home) [k ‘domu] – ко двору ko dvoru [ko ‘dvoru]"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5f28a9b9-92a5-4a93-92da-089185aec91e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main technologies that shaped 19th-century opera staging?","answer":"The main technologies that shaped 19th-century opera staging were the curtain, the tam-tam (a type of gong), and steam. Since the late eighteenth century, composers increasingly attempted to control aspects of staging by embracing these specific stage technologies. These technologies had cultural resonances and hermeneutic potentials that influenced the nature and ephemerality of staged opera.","context":["Specializations: History and theory of opera, with a special focus on staging, technology, and mediality; contemporary “indie” opera; screen media; media archaeology; reception studies; music historiography; music and politics; music in the Third Reich; German and European cultural history since 1800; Verdi; Wagner; Hindemith.\nAbout: Gundula Kreuzer studied musicology, philosophy, and modern history at the Universities of Münster (Westphalia) and Oxford, where she earned her Master of Studies and D.Phil. in musicology. She held a Junior Research (postdoctoral) Fellowship at Merton College, Oxford, before joining the Yale Department of Music in 2005.\nIn both her writing and her teaching, Kreuzer approaches music from a wide range of interdisciplinary perspectives, such as social, cultural, and political history as well as theories of technology and multimedia. Her award-winning first book, Verdi and the Germans: From Unification to the Third Reich (Cambridge University Press, 2010), examines the changing impact of the popular Italian composer on German musical self-perception and national identity. Her second monograph, Curtain, Gong, Steam: Wagnerian Technologies of Nineteenth-Century Opera (University of California Press, 2018) addresses how composers since the late eighteenth century increasingly tried to control certain aspects of staging by embracing specific stage technologies. Focusing on the cultural resonances and hermeneutic potentials of the titular technologies of the curtain, the tam-tam, and steam before, in, and beyond Wagner, the book develops a deeply contextualized practical perspective on the nature and ephemerality of staged opera as well as its legacies in contemporary culture.\nTogether with Clemens Risi, Kreuzer guest-edited a double issue of The Opera Quarterly (“Opera in Transition”; vol. 23/2-3, 2011), and her critical edition of Verdi’s instrumental chamber music for The Works of Giuseppe Verdi: Series V appeared with The University of Chicago Press and Ricordi in 2010. She was Reviews Editor of The Opera Quarterly, served on the editorial board of the Journal of the American Musicological Society, and continues to serve on the editorial boards of Cambridge Opera Journal, VerdiPerspektiven, and WagnerSpektrum. She also gained experience as a freelance radio presenter in Germany and has been contributing to broadcasts on WNYC and BBC Radio3.\nIn May 2019, Kreuzer launched the first annual YOST: Y | Opera | Studies Today conference at Yale on the topic of “Indie Opera” to foster a dialogue between practitioners and scholars of opera across and beyond campus and the East Coast. Beginning in September 2019, this initiative will be complemented by a monthly Opera Studies Working Group at the Whitney Humanities Center.\nKreuzer’s first monograph won the 2011 Lewis Lockwood Award of the American Musicological Society, the 2012 Gaddis Smith International Book Prize of the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale, and the inaugural Martin Chusid Award for Verdi Studies (2013). Among other grants and awards, Kreuzer has received the Paul A. Pisk Prize (2000) and the Alfred Einstein Award (2006) from the American Musicological Society, as well as the Jerome Roche Prize (2006) and the Dent Medal (2019) from the Royal Musical Association. At Yale, she was awarded the Samuel and Ronnie Heyman Prize for Outstanding Scholarly Publication in 2010, was a Fellow at the Whitney Humanities Center in 2010-11, and has been a Senior Research Fellow in International and Area Studies at the Macmillan Center since 2012.

{"question":"soil preparation + planting depth comparison: carrots vs radishes detailed analysis","answer":"For carrots, two planting methods are used: broadcasting (scattering seeds on prepared, pre-watered soil and covering with light soil coating) or dibbing individual 1 CM deep holes. Both methods require thinning out seedlings later. For radishes, the soil must be tilled 6-10 inches deep with rocks removed and compost mixed in. Seeds should be planted 1/2 inch deep, spaced about 1 inch apart, with 8-12 inches between rows. Radishes grow best in soil with pH 6.0-7.0 and require even, moderate to heavy watering. They can be planted wherever there's empty space and are often used as row markers for slower-germinating plants. Both vegetables require well-prepared, well-drained soil for optimal growth.","context":["Growing carrots from seed\nBefore we go any further though, please look at the photos which both show carrots being grown well above ground. This is to deter the carrot fly pest which only flies at just a few inches above ground.\n1) Carrots grow best in soil which has not been recently composted, or if compost has been used it should be very well rotted otherwise the end result will look like something which has been spawned from a nuclear reactor site with lots of roots forking from the main one.\n2) Carrots are grown best in a light sandy soil, so if your soil is heavy or clay based then dig in plenty of fine builder's sand, the light coloured sand is best we find. All Purpose compose which you can buy from any garden centre is perfectly OK to use, either on it's own or mixed with soil and sand. Sharp sand is excellent too.\n3) You will find that some of your crop will show above ground and that part may turn green. Greening of the top of the carrot is caused by sunlight. Heavy rain can wash away the soil from carrot tops exposing them to the sun. The green colour is the chlorophyll pigment. Mound up the soil around the shoulders of the carrots to prevent exposure to the sun.\nSowing carrot seeds:\nA typical packet of carrot seeds contains in the region of 2000 seeds and these can be sown in your garden in one of several ways.\n1) By broadcasting: basically this means you get a handful of seed and scatter them onto your already prepared and pre-watered patch of soil. Cover them with a light coating of new soil and leave them to grow. This method means that you will have a great many shoots appearing very close together and they need to be thinned out to leave the strongest growing on to become part of your salad.\n2) The more time consuming method is to dib 1 CM deep holes in the soil and drop in an individual seed. Cover and leave to grow as normal. You will still have to do some thinning out because it is a virtual impossibility to drop just 1 seed into every hole. But at least with this method most of your seeds will grow at predetermined distances away from each other.\nWell, all the above should get you a good crop but there are other little things such as carrot fly which can ruin a whole crop, but we tackle that problem on one of our pages in the pests/diseases section. However, if you follow the tips below you should avoid the problem\n1) Carrot flies fly close to the ground and lay their eggs near to the top of you carrots. To overcome this you need to buy some very fine insect netting which will keep them away.\n2) Make a raised bed as high as you can and plant your seeds in there. As the pests only fly low they will not be able to infect your crop.\n3) When you plant your carrot seeds then also plant plenty of spring onion seeds around the edges of your plot and these will help to deter the pests.","Radishes are a fast-growing, cool-season crop that can be harvested in as little as twenty days. There are well over 200 varieties: including French radishes, daikon radishes, and other specialty varieties in a surprising array of colors, including white, purple, black, and even green. Eaten raw they can be whole, sliced, diced, or grated. You can also cook and pickle them. Most of them are typically eaten fresh and make a good addition to a salad or a substitute to pepper on a sandwich.\nWhere to Grow Radishes\nRadishes require a spot with full sun, fertile soil, and good drainage. Some varieties can be grown in partial shade. They will thrive in cool, moist soil. In cooler climates, they can be planted in both the spring and fall. In warmer climates, they should be grown over winter.\nRecommended Radish Varieties\n- Cherry Belle is the classic radish. Their roots are bright red, mildly pungent, and mature somewhere between 1/4 -1 inch in diameter. Cherry Belle is one of the few varieties that can be grown in the shade and matures in about 24 days.\n- White Icicle radishes have a mildly hot flavor. They are white and about 6 inches long, maturing in about 20 days. This variety of radish requires well-cultivated soil as it has deeper roots than other varieties.\n- French Breakfast is red with a white tip and a similar shape to the White Icicle. It has excellent flavor, withstands early summer heat, and is ready for harvest in about 24 days.\n- Champion radishes are bright red with a crisp white flesh. They do best in cool weather and are a good choice for early or late season planting. They are ready to harvest in about 28 days.\n- Easter Egg is a multicolored mix of red, purple, and white round radishes, these are a surprise every time you harvest them.\n- Miyashige has long white roots and is the classic Asian daikon radish. Sow in late summer for a fall harvest. Miyashige stores and pickles well.\nSoil for Radishes\nRadishes are not very particular about soil type but will do best with rich, well-drained soil with a pH of about 6.5. Till the soil 6-10” deep, removing all rocks and mix in good compost. If your soil is clay, you may want to add some compost and sand to loosen it up a little. As most plants, they would prefer a healthy addition of compost worked into the soil at planting time to provide some good organic matter to the soil. Radishes do nicely where leaves have been worked into the soil the previous fall.\n|Germination||45 - 85 F|\n|For growth||60 - 65 F|\n|Soil and Water|\n|pH||6.0 - 7.0|\n|Water||Even and moderate to heavy.|\n|Seed Planting Depth||1/2\"|\n|Root Depth||3 - 6\"|\n|Height||2 - 6\"|\n|Width||2 - 6\"|\n|Space between plants|\n|In Rows||1\" (small)\n2\" (large) - thin to 4 - 6\" eventually\n|Space Between Rows||8 - 12\"|\n|Average plants per person||10 - 20|\n|Harvest radishes once the root has become plump. Harvest the whole crop at once.|\n|First Seed Starting Date:||21 days before last frost date|\n|Last Seed Starting Date:||45 Days before first frost date|\n|Companions||Beets, carrots, spinach, parsnips, cucumbers, beans, lettuce|\n|Incompatibles||Cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts, broccoli, kohlrabi, turnips|\nRadishes are particularly sensitive to any interruptions to their growth and consequently are best direct-seeded outdoors. They are sensitive to frost, but if required, they can be sown indoors about 2 weeks prior to the first frost. If sown indoors, use a biodegradable pot so that you can plant the whole pot when it comes time to transplant them outdoors to minimize disruptions to their root system. Whether you plant indoors or out, the most important thing is to keep the soil moist. Sow seeds about 1/2“ deep and about an inch apart, with 8-12” between rows, depending on how large your variety is. Once the radishes begin to grow, you can thin them to about every 2”.\nRadishes can be sown wherever there is an empty space, from early spring until early summer, and starting again in the early fall. They make useful “row markers” sown among slow germinating plants like carrots and parsnips. By the time the carrots or parsnips have germinated, it is close to the time to harvest the radishes. Since they germinate in a few days, it makes weeding between the rows much easier.\nKeep your rows of radishes weed-free and give them a heavy watering every three days to ensure proper root development.\nRadishes are at their best for a very short time. If they are left in the ground too long, they will develop a sharp taste and a pithy texture, and their roots will eventually split. Radishes are ready to harvest in as little as 20 days, depending on the variety. Once the root has become plump, they are ready to pick. Harvest the whole crop once it matures, and store them in the refrigerator. If harvesting in hot weather, pull radishes from the soil and drop them into a bucket of cold water. Remove greens and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks. Storage can be extended up to several months in a properly maintained root cellar.\n|Remove green tops and store in plastic bags or containers with some water inside the refrigerator.|\n|32F||95 - 98%||2 - 4 weeks|\n- Fleas Beetles will leave small holes in radish leaves and do seem to have a preference for radishes. Your radishes will likely do just fine even if the leaves have a few holes in them.\n- Root Maggots will leave holes or channels in the radish skins.\nA lightweight, floating row cover applied at the time the seeds go into the ground will keep flea beetles away, and also prevent root maggots from spoiling the roots.\nNone of major concern.\nRadishes as a trap crop\nInsects tend to have preferences, much like humans when it comes to what they eat. They may eat one garden plant when it is the only thing available, but if given the choice, they might choose something they like better. These preferred plants are often within the same plant family. The same root maggots that like broccoli roots, also like radish roots. Flea beetles like broccoli and cabbage seedlings, but also like kale, turnips, pak choi, and radishes. That’s the idea behind a trap crop. You could, for instance, plant radishes with the primary intent that they would attract the root maggots and flea beetles and leave your broccoli and cabbage alone. Many gardeners have found radish to be a good trap crop to protect many of the cabbage family plants."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e5790b0d-9115-4cd8-8efb-0995b2855b32>","<urn:uuid:63cf68ca-0637-4361-8224-fa66cbd480cd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which provides more comprehensive home insulation: attic insulation or garage door insulation?","answer":"Attic insulation provides more comprehensive home insulation. Adding a layer of insulation in the attic is described as one of the easiest and most effective ways to insulate your home, with immediate effects - keeping the home warmer for longer and heating it more thoroughly. It also prevents warm air from melting ice and snow on the roof, preventing potential mold issues. While garage door insulation is important and can have R-values between R-8 and R-32, it primarily affects one specific area of the home. Garage doors, though often overlooked, are typically just the largest opening to the home and while insulating them helps with energy efficiency, it doesn't provide the comprehensive coverage that attic insulation does.","context":["When most people think of insulation, they think of that cotton candy looking stuff between the walls. However, it is that cotton candy looking stuff – otherwise known as an insulation – that is solely responsible for making sure that you are warm and comfortable during the winter. And it isn’t only the insulation between your walls that is making sure you are comfortable during the winter – you also have to properly seal windows, doors and even electrical outlets. Even a small energy leak can cause a large amount of energy waste. And when it comes down to it, you don’t need to spend a fortune to make sure your home is insulated for the winter. Here are some cheap, easy and effective ways to insulate your home for winter.\nThe easiest and most effective ways to insulate your home is to place a layer of insulation in your attic. The difference will be felt immediately – your home will stay warmer for longer and your entire home will be heated more thoroughly. Not to mention, if you want some smart winter tips for indoor air quality, adding a layer of insulation in your attic will also prevent warm air from melting ice and snow on your roof, which will ultimately prevent mold spores from spreading as a result of the water damage.\nAnother way to better insulate your home is to seal up your windows. There is a good chance that your windows aren’t properly sealed, especially if you have an older home. When it comes down to it, re-sealing your windows is easy. All you need to do is head to your local hardware supply shop and purchase caulking and a caulk gun. Simply set up the caulking gun and place a layer of sealant around the window casement. Just wait for it to dry and your windows will be properly sealed.\nNext, you want to seal and weatherize your doorframes. Usually, your front door – or any other exit and entry door in your home – has about a half inch to an inch of open space. This open space can be a huge energy leak and it can result in a much colder home. All you have to do is purchase what is called a “weather strip.” Simply install the weather strip as per the directions and you should stop feeling those cold drafts.\nLastly, you may also want to re-insulate your hot water tank. This is an important step before the winter begins, because when it is particularly cold outside, your hot water heater can take a long time to actually heat the water in your home. Not only can this be a nuisance, especially when all you want is a hot shower, but it can also be incredibly expensive. You can usually find hot water heater insulation online or at your local home renovation and supply shop. Typically, water heater insulation is inexpensive and it is easy to install. How would you like to stop worrying about whether or not you are going to get hot water every time you step into the shower?","Insulation adds to the overall comfort and energy-efficiency of your home. How well it does its job depends largely on its r-value. Almost everyone has a basic idea of how insulation works. You place it in empty spaces between the walls to prevent air from passing through. It’s the mechanisms behind this that make it a little more complex.\nUnderstanding Convection, Conduction, and Radiation\nConvection, conduction, and radiation are the three basic mechanisms of heat flow.\n- Convection – refers to the circulation of heat through liquids and gases. It explains why warm air rises while cooler air remains low in your home.\n- 2. Conduction – describes the way heat moves through solid objects.\n- Radiation – radiant heat always travels in a straight line. It heats solid objects along the way that are capable of absorbing its energy.\nMost insulation materials are designed to slow conductive heat flow. It also slows convective heat flow, although to a lesser extent. You can also buy radiant barriers or reflective insulation that reduce radiant heat absorption by reflecting heat away instead of absorbing it.\nIn any setting, heat will flow from the warmer area to one that is cooler until it reaches the same temperature. In your home, that means that heated air inside will flow into adjacent areas that are cooler such as garages, basements, attics, and outdoors. This is why an insulated garage door can help make your entire home more comfortable and fuel-efficient. During the summer when air is cooled indoors, heat comes into your home. Insulation can be used to keep warm air indoors or outdoors.\nWhat Is an R-Value?\nR-value is the measurement of an insulating material’s thermal resistance, or ability to resist heat flow. The higher the R-value, the better it is at insulating. The R-value is assigned based on a number of factors including the type of material it is, the thickness, and its density. Some types of insulation have R-values based on temperature, moisture accumulation, and aging. Insulation that is made from layers of various materials are rated according to the R-values of each individual layer.\nChoosing Insulation for Your House\nThe more insulation you install in your home, the greater the R-value will be. Not all homes require the same degree of insulation. You need to consider the climate where you live, the type of heating and cooling used, and which areas you need to insulate.\nTypes of Insulation\nThere are many types of insulation on the market for you to choose from. You’ll need to know where you want to install the insulation and the R-value before you choose insulation. The proper installation makes a huge difference in whether the insulation performs to its R-Value. Some are suitable as DIY projects while you need to hire professionals to install others. The basic types of insulation are:\n- Blanket: Batts & Rolls – Made from mineral wool, plastic, or natural fibers and used in unfinished walls, floors, and ceilings.\n- Concrete Block Insulation – Includes foam board place on the outside of walls in new construction and on the inside of walls of existing homes. Good for unfinished walls and foundation walls.\n- Foam Board (Rigid Foam)– Made from polystyrene, polyisocyanurate, or polyurethane. Used in unfinished walls, floors and ceilings, and unvented low-slope roofs.\n- Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs)– Foam boards or blocks used in unfinished walls for new construction.\n- Loose–Fill and Blown-In – Made from fiberglass, cellulose, or mineral wool. Used in enclosed existing or new wall cavities, unfinished attic floors, hard-to-reach areas.\n- Reflective System– This includes foil-faced kraft paper, polyethylene bubbles, plastic film, or cardboard. Used in unfinished walls, ceilings, and floors. A reflective system really doesn’t have an R-value due to the way it reflects heat flow instead of absorbing it.\n- Rigid Fibrous or Fiber Insulation– Made of fiberglass or mineral wool. Used in ducts of unconditioned spaces and other places where insulation is needed to withstand high temperatures.\n- Sprayed Foam and Foamed-In-Place – Materials include cementitious, phenolic, polyisocyanurate, and polyurethane. Used in enclosed existing walls, open new wall cavities, and unfinished attic floors.\n- Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs)– Made of foam board or liquid, foam insulation core, and straw core insulation. Used in unfinished walls, floors, ceilings, and roofs for new construction.\nOf these types, blanket insulation is the most commonly used type of insulation, most often in fiberglass. This type of insulation comes in widths that are suited for use in walls and attics, making self-application easier. When using insulation with a lower R-value than needed, this type of insulation can be used in more than one layer.\nDraft-Proof Windows and Doors\nInsulating your home starts with selecting the right insulation for all the empty spaces where air gets in or out. Draft-proofing all of your doors and windows helps even more. Weather stripping is an inexpensive and easy way to block drafts around windows and doors. Don’t overlook places like pipes that lead outside or old door sweeps.\nGarage doors are frequently overlooked when considering the overall energy-efficiency of a home. The fact is that it’s often the largest opening to the home. Whether your garage is heated or not, an insulated door can help stop the transfer of air between your home and the outdoors. There are some beautiful choices in insulated garage doors available today. They also come in a range of R-values, typically between R-8 and R-32.\nIf your garage door still has some life left in it, another option is to insulate your door. A simple DIY project could result in a more comfortable home and significant savings on your energy bill. If your door is outdated and in need of repair, it might be time to start shopping for an energy-efficient replacement.\nContact Coastal Garage Doors to get a free estimate and get an honest quote for a new insulated garage door. There’s a lot to love about insulated doors including greater durability, quieter operation, and better protection for your car. A warmer garage is more convenient and comfortable, even if you’re just passing through!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f6d368c-3179-43da-b8dd-e0b87a928343>","<urn:uuid:e06c8e68-8627-438b-b4c9-902b3d113382>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the diagnostic methods currently used for detecting esophageal cancer, and what are the major challenges in early diagnosis?","answer":"The primary diagnostic methods for esophageal cancer include barium swallow (esophagram) and upper endoscopy (EGD) with biopsy. During a barium swallow, patients drink a chalky liquid that coats the esophagus for X-ray imaging to reveal abnormal areas. Upper endoscopy involves using a flexible, lighted tube with a video camera to examine the esophageal lining and collect tissue samples if needed. However, major challenges in early diagnosis include poor survival rates (only 10-15% five-year survival) due to late-stage diagnosis, and limitations of standard white-light endoscopic examination which frequently misses early neoplasia since these areas are often clinically indistinguishable from normal mucosa or inflammatory changes.","context":["Current projects (Funded by the National Cancer Institute)\nHigh-Resolution Microendoscopy for the Detection of Esophageal Neoplasia\nDespite advances in chemoradiation therapy, the five-year survival rate for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN) remains a dismal 15 percent due to diagnosis at a late, incurable stage. Endoscopic screening is typically performed in high-risk populations with Lugol’s iodine staining of the mucosa and targeted biopsy of abnormal (unstained) areas. While Lugol’s significantly increases the sensitivity of white light endoscopy (>95 percent), specificity remains poor (<65 percent) as inflammation and other benign mucosal changes mimic neoplasia. While confocal microendoscopy has been shown to dramatically enhance the diagnostic accuracy and yield of Lugol’s chromoendoscopy, existing platforms are costly (>$150,000) and only available in a handful of tertiary centers worldwide.\nOur group has developed a portable, battery-operated, high-resolution microendoscope (mHRME) that provides subcellular images of the esophageal epithelium, delineating the cellular and morphologic changes associated with neoplasia. In a recent, single-arm pilot trial (R21), the HRME significantly increased the sensitivity and specificity of Lugol’s screening to 100 percent and 89 percent. Based on our extensive preliminary data, we are now optimizing and validating a lower-cost (<$725), tablet-based system with a software interface that provides real-time image interpretation assistance, thus facilitating usage by less-experienced clinicians in low-resource settings. This ‘optical’ approach will likely increase the efficiency, clinical impact, and cost-effectiveness of the current standard of endoscopic screening and surveillance. To validate this, we will conduct a randomized, multicenter trial of our ‘optical biopsy’ approach comparing it to the current standard of endoscopic screening/surveillance in the United States and China. In addition, we will construct, refine and analyze a disease model of ESCN to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of incorporating HRME into endoscopic screening and surveillance in both countries. Successful results can easily be translated to global cancer screening in other organs (cervix, colon, etc.).\nGlobal Early Cancer Detection:\nAcademic-Industrial Partnership to Develop and Test Esophageal Cancer Imaging Tools\nEsophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has one of the fastest rising rates of incidence in the United States. Unfortunately, the five-year-survival for patients diagnosed with EAC is only 10 percent. EAC develops primarily in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). Endoscopic screening and biopsy is recommended for at-risk individuals. However, standard white-light endoscopic examination frequently misses areas of early neoplasia, which are often clinically indistinguishable from normal mucosa and/or inflammatory changes. Studies have shown that as many as 43-57 percent of early cancers can be missed by this method. Thus, there is an important need for new endoscopic technologies which improve the ability of clinicians to identify precancerous lesions and early cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.\nThe goal of this partnership is to develop, optimize and validate novel multi-modal, multi-scale optical imaging platforms for non-invasive, early detection of esophageal neoplasia based on optical imaging. We are collaborating with colleagues at Pentax, Inc. to design and test multi-modal endoscopic imaging systems for early detection of neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. Widefield endoscopic imaging will be used initially to screen the surface area at risk to identify abnormal sites with high sensitivity; suspicious areas will then be imaged with much higher spatial resolution to achieve high diagnostic specificity. Both wide field and high resolution technologies will be integrated into a single endoscopic platform to increase the ease and accuracy of endoscopic cancer screening and surveillance. In sequential clinical studies, we will first separately optimize the performance of wide field endoscopic imaging and high resolution imaging. We will then integrate the wide field and high resolution imaging systems and validate their accuracy for the detection of neoplasia in subjects with Barrett's esophagus, the precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma. Lastly, we will develop an image atlas of typical wide-field and high-resolution images, interpretation criteria, and histopathology to train future users and serve as an educational resource.\nOptical Systems for In-Vivo Molecular Imaging of Cancer (with Rice University)\nCancers of the upper aero-digestive tract, which includes the oral cavity, oropharynx, and esophagus, are associated with rising incidence and uniformly poor survival, primarily due to diagnosis at a late, incurable stage. While visual screening and biopsy are recommended for at-risk individuals, the standard white-light exam frequently misses areas of early neoplasia. Moreover, incomplete resection leads to frequent recurrence. There is an important need for new imaging tools to improve early diagnosis and to guide effective treatment. Optical molecular imaging provides a unique solution to greatly improve clinical outcome. Over the last five years, we have developed optically active contrast agents, delivery formulations, and imaging systems which provide the ability to monitor and quantify molecular, functional, and morphologic biomarkers of early neoplasia.\nThis research project proposes to solve the clinical and technical challenges needed to realize these potential advantages in one organ system - the upper aero-digestive tract. This will be accomplished by first optimizing and translating contrast agents and imaging systems for early diagnosis of intraepithelial neoplasia. The second aim of this study will develop molecular imaging systems to enable image-guided therapy of intra-epithelial neoplasia.\nThe translational bioengineering studies proposed here will result in low-cost, portable tools to improve early detection and image-guided therapy of intraepithelial neoplasia in the upper aero-digestive tract, providing a foundation to extend these tools to other organ sites.","Esophageal Cancer: Diagnosis\nHow is esophageal cancer diagnosed?\nIf your healthcare provider thinks you have esophageal cancer, you’ll need tests. Diagnosing this cancer starts with your healthcare provider asking you questions. He or she will ask you about your health history, symptoms, risk factors, and family history of disease. He or she will also do a physical exam.\nWhat tests might I need?\nYou may have one or more of the following tests:\nImaging tests. These include a barium swallow (esophagram) and an upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD).\nBiopsy. This may be done during an upper endoscopy.\nFor this test, you’ll swallow a chalky liquid. This is called barium. Then your healthcare provider will take a series of X-rays of your esophagus. The barium coats the inside of your esophagus. This makes it easier to see on the X-rays. The X-rays show if part of your esophagus is too narrow or has any other issues that might be due to cancer. A doctor who specializes in X-rays (called a radiologist) views the images. Sometimes this test is done as part of a series of X-rays that includes the stomach and part of the intestine. This is called an upper gastrointestinal (GI) series.\nUsed alone, a barium swallow cannot normally diagnose cancer. But it can show abnormal areas that might need to be biopsied.\nFor this test, your healthcare provider uses a flexible, lighted tube with a video camera on the end. This is called an endoscope. This lets your healthcare provider see the lining of your esophagus. It also shows your stomach and the first part of your small intestine.\nClick Image to Enlarge\nBefore the test, your healthcare provider will spray your throat with a local anesthetic to numb it. You may also get a sedative to help you relax. Your healthcare provider puts the endoscope through your mouth. It goes down your throat into your esophagus. Your healthcare provider sees the picture from the scope on a monitor. These pictures shoe any tissue that isn’t normal.\nAn upper endoscopy takes about 30 minutes. You’ll need to stay in the testing area for about one to two hours until the sedative wears off.\nThis test can confirm if you have cancer in the esophagus. It can also show its size. If cancer is found, you may need other types of tests. These can show how far the cancer has spread.\nIf needed, your healthcare provider can also insert tools through the endoscope to remove small pieces of tissue for testing. This is called a biopsy. Your healthcare provider sends the tissue to a lab. There, it’s looked at under a microscope by a special doctor called a pathologist.

{"question":"Compare the ideal reverberation time for speech versus pipe organ recitals in a room - what's the difference? 说说语音和管风琴演奏的理想混响时间有什么区别？","answer":"Speech requires a much shorter reverberation time of 0.4 to 1 second, while pipe organ recitals need a significantly longer reverberation time of 2 to 4 seconds. According to acoustic standards like DIN 18041, for speech the reverberation time should remain consistent across the 100-4000 Hz frequency range, while music performance spaces can have slightly higher reverberation times at frequencies below 250 Hz.","context":["Optimal room acoustics / How to improve room acoustics\nIntroductory video on room acoustics\nAccording to respective use and building size, the DIN 18041 and the Austrian standard B 8115-3 define the ideal reverberation time (e.g. that which is perceived to be most pleasant by the average person). For ideal room acoustics, this reverberation time should remain more or less the same in the frequency range of 100-4000 Hz. For rooms where music performances take place this value should rise somewhat where frequencies lower than 250 Hz occur. However, the linear reverberation time is better suited to music rehearsal room.\nImages at right depict tolerance ranges according to standards (whereby the reverberation time of 1 second for ideal room acoustics is not likely here); tolerance range for middle frequencies plus/minus 20%.\nIn many rooms there are materials which act as absorbers. The effect is normally in the high-frequency area.\nSuch high frequency absorbers may include:\n- Carpeting/throw rugs\n- People (clothing)\n- Upholstered furnitu\nWithout the implementation of acoustic measures, reverberation time is lower in the higher frequencies\nBy way of the fact that high frequency absorbers are usually present, the absorption curve looks approximately as follows:\n(those frequencies which are absorbed the most exhibit the lowest reverberation times)\nDanger of over-absorption of high frequencies\nUsing the example of a Class A sound absorber\n((Alpha-w) αw = 1.00)\nIn the case of sound absorbers, it is frequently the case that only individual specifications such as (Alpha-w) αw are specified, yet in most cases, this is insufficient information.\nSound absorbers of this class are often characterized as broadband absorbers, even though they are also medium and high frequency absorbers.\nIn this example, the entire ceiling surface has been equipped with absorbers.\n- Incorrect absorption spread of the frequencies\n- Those frequencies required for speech intelligibility are over absorbed, while those for frequencies for undertones are not absorbed enough\n- Absorbers of this kind are not suitable for achieving ideal room acoustics\nLow frequencies are much harder to absorb than higher frequencies and are thus often simply ignored. Yet how important are these low frequencies for generally good room acoustics? This is a highly-debated topic for which there are no easy, simple answers. In order to shed light on the matter, here we present select data using speech as type of use.\nFrequency Distribution in Speech:\nIn which frequencies does information transmission occur when speaking? Information is chiefly transmitted in speech through consonants. Within the frequency band these are found above 1000 Hz (see diagram at right).\n(Source of diagram: Helmut V. Fuchs, Schallabsorber und Schalldämpfer (Springer Verlag, 2007))\nThis is often used as an argument for why lower frequencies have less significance for speech intelligibility in room acoustics.\nYet the following must be considered:\nIn which frequencies does the most sound radiation occur?\nThe frequency distribution of sound radiation is depicted in this diagram (source: Helmut V. Fuchs, Schallabsorber und Schalldämpfer (Springer Verlag, 2007)).\nThus by concentrating on medium and high frequencies the important “information frequencies” are swallowed and the parasitic frequencies are ignored. Low frequencies however have the tendency to blanket higher frequencies – think for example of the low-frequency rumbling of a passing lorry! Only insulating the medium and high frequencies – using the argument that it is these which transmit information – fails to fulfil the necessary requirements for good acoustics.\nFor most rooms, a linear frequency curve for reverberation time is ideal and in fact stipulated by DIN 18041. To achieve this, we have intensified our low frequency focus in product development.\nBelow our findings:\n- micro-perforated low frequency absorbers with a maximum performance of 100-315 Hz -> products 1, 2 and 3 and products 4, 5 and 6\n- micro-perforated low frequency absorbers with a maximum performance of 50-100 Hz (these frequencies are often not stipulated because absorption through conventional absorbers in this range is very low) -> product 1\n- One of our research findings: low frequency absorbers used in a panel absorber configuration do not exhibit sufficiently stable absorption performance.\nIt is easy to use our calculator to determine how to improve your room acoustics in the best way possible!\n- It is not necessary to know all the details; use the calculator to determine which absorber /absorber combinations are best for your planned project\n- Let the combination of the calculator and the relevant industry standards DIN 18041 and B 8115-3 do the work for you!","Sound Diffusion : Diffusion is the scattering of sound in all directions so that discrete reflections are not heard. The intensity and flow of the sonic energy is equal in every location of the room. Although walls and ceilings in any space can produce discrete reflections, the problem is usually noticed in small rooms with loud sources such as loudspeakers or music practice rooms. The reflections from the room interfere with the ability to properly hear.\nThe solution is to add diffuser panels to the walls and ceilings of the room. These panels don’t absorb sound but rather reflect it in many directions. Diffused sound is the spatial and temporal reflection pattern of mid and late arriving reflections to the listening area.\nA room that has sufficient diffusion will eliminate interfering reflections and maintain a natural ambience, It adds warmth and produces sonic images with more spaciousness (i.e.; more width, depth, and height and uniformly distributes the sound throughout the room). Diffusing surfaces have been used since antiquity in the form of statuary, coffered ceilings, columns and surface ornamentation.\nSound Diffraction: Diffraction is the act of changing the direction of a sound wave as it passes through an opening or around an object in its path. The amount of diffraction is determined by the sharpness of the bending of the sound wave. It increases with increasing wavelength and decreases with decreasing wavelength. When the wavelength of the waves are smaller than the obstacle no noticeable diffraction occurs. This is where diffusion takes over, by redirecting the waves. Our panels do both, depending on the frequency.\nComb Filtering : Comb filtering is the constructive and destructive interference between the direct sound and early reflections. Reflections cause time delays. This is because the reflected path length between the listener and source is longer than the direct sound path. Thus, when the direct sound is combined with the reflected sound, the listener experiences notches and peaks referred to as comb filtering. Using absorption panels will deal with comb filtering by removing energy from the room. It also deadens the room. Diffusion distributes the reflection over time, without absorption and thereby eliminates the comb filtering.\nRoom Modes: Sound waves consistently interfere as they reflect back and forth between hard walls. This interference results in tone quality at frequencies determined by the geometry of the room. This is particularly problematic at lower frequencies. That is because the step, or distance, between the next step is significantly greater than for higher frequencies. As the frequency goes up, the steps blend into a continuum, which no longer causes a sonic inconsistency. There are three types of room modes: Axial (two parallel surfaces), Tangential (4 surfaces), and Oblique (6 surfaces).\nFor most practical purposes calculating the axial modes for four room modes, the length, the width, the height and the diagonals of the room will give a good indication of which frequencies need special attention. Normally the first order, second order and third order waves are evaluated. As an example, if a room is 15’ wide, 9’ long and 7.5’ high the axial mode between two opposite walls is calculated by c/2X where c = the speed of sound (1,130 ft/sec) X = the distance between two walls. So, a 15’ wall to wall dimension results in a first order fundamental room mode of 37.6 Hz. The second order mode is 75.2 Hz and the third is 112.9 Hz. As the frequency increases, room modes are still present, but their number and density increase, so they are not perceived as a problem.\nModal Coupling : Modal Coupling is the acoustical joining of the loudspeakers and listener with the room’s modal pressure variations or room modes. Since conventional closed or ported dynamic loudspeakers are pressure sources, they will couple most efficiently when placed at a high-pressure region of the modal (or standing wave) pressure point. The loudspeaker placement will accentuate or diminish the coupling with the modal pressure variations at each of the modal frequencies. This is why in a non-linear room things sound so much different depending where you stand or sit in a room. This is also why one can increase or decrease the amount of bass by moving a loudspeaker. If you want to decrease the bass, move the speaker into the corner of the room, as close as you can. This moves the first cancellation notch to higher frequencies, where it can be reduced with porous absorption. Move the speaker away from the corner and the bass will increase.\nSpeaker Boundary Interference: (another term for modal coupling) Speaker Boundary Interference is the coherent interaction between the direct sound and the omni-directional early reflections of sound from the room’s adjacent boundaries. Since conventional closed or ported dynamic loudspeakers are pressure sources, they will couple most efficiently when placed at a high-pressure region of the modal (or standing wave) pressure point.\nThe loudspeaker placement will accentuate or diminish the coupling with the modal pressure variations at each of the modal frequencies. This is why in a non-linear room things sound so much different depending where you stand or sit in a room. To minimize the modal coupling effect it is very important to never place a speaker (especially a woofer) equidistant from the floor and two surrounding walls.\nSlap Echo: A quick repetition of the original sound after the original sound has ceased. Flutter Echo: Short echoes in small reverberant spaces that produce a clicking, ringing or hissing sound after the original sound source has ceased.\nSpecular Reflections: Specular Reflections occur when sound is reflected in one direction, like from the loudspeaker off a nearby a wall. In other words, wherever the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, it is typically called a specular reflection. This is a common flat wall reflection. A specular reflection occurs over a very short period of time. Conversely, a diffuse reflection happens over a relatively long period of time.\nLinear Room Response: Also called a Flat Response. Excellent Linear Room Response is the goal of every good listening/performing room. An excellent linear response means that for each and every frequency produced, at any given volume level, the room will effect that sound with the same relative characteristics, producing an “un-colored” sound. The sound will behave evenly anywhere in the room.\nReverb Time: Reverberation time is the time it takes a for the sound level in the room to decay 60 decibels. Or in other words, the time it takes the sound to become inaudible after turning off the sound source. Depending on the purpose of the room design, different reverb times are desired. The following are good approximate times for different applications:\nSpeech (.4 to 1 second)\nMusic practice rooms (1 to 1.5 seconds)\nHome Theater rooms (.5 to 1.25 seconds)\nLive recording rooms for quartets & jazz (.75 to 1.25 seconds)\nLive performance rooms for ensembles & contemporary music\n(1 to 2.0 seconds)\nOrchestral performance rooms (1.5 to 2.5 seconds)\nPipe Organ recitals (2 to 4 seconds)\nIn a normal sized listening room a sound wave has to travel about 10 feet on average between reflections off one of the six surfaces of a room. If the room has the typical home reverberation time of .6 seconds, a given wave will ricochet around the room some 70 times before becoming essentially inaudible.\nLive End, Dead End: The Live End-Dead End room is one of the primary designs promoted since the early 1980’s. This is where the front end of the room has primarily hard surfaces and the rear wall and rear sidewalls are primarily covered with sound absorbing material. This makes the front of the room lively and the rear of the room quite dead.\nReflection Free Zone: This is the name given the primary listening area in Home Theater Rooms and Mix/Mastering rooms. This is where the direct sound wave from the loudspeakers hit the listener before any reflected sound waves. This is done by room geometry, speaker placement, and acoustic treatment of the walls and ceiling with absorption and diffusion.\nBass Build-up: There is a lot of sonic energy in low frequency sound waves. The walls of a room can actually act like drum skins. They can sympathetically pulsate with some low end frequencies. Sometimes the geometry of the room will cause constructive interference of certain frequencies. Either of these conditions can cause Bass Build-up.\nThere are several types of porous sound absorbers commonly in use today, such as fiberglass, mineral wool or polymer foams. There are also membrane type sound absorbers and Hemholtz absorbers. They are all used to absorb sound.\nAbsorbers work by converting the acoustical energy of sound waves into heat.\nThe efficiency of a porous absorber is highest when the sound is traveling at its highest velocity. This point is reached at ¼ of the wavelength, and thus varies with the frequency. Since porous absorbers rely on particle velocity, they have limited efficiencies at low frequencies when they are mounted at the wall surfaces.\nAt the wall surface, where most porous absorbers are placed, is where the particle velocity is zero. Unfortunately, this is where they are least efficient. However, this is where the pressure is at a maximum. To exploit this high pressure, a membrane type absorber can be employed. A membrane with high internal losses coupled with an air cavity which has a porous material near the membrane, will sympathetically oscillate with the pressure fluctuations at low frequencies, thus creating air movement through the internal porous material.\nSabin: A Sabin is a unit of sound absorption equivalent to 1 square foot having a coefficient of absorption of 1.00. This name comes from Wallace Sabine, generally considered to be the father of acoustics.\nTo calculate the amount of absorption in a room you take the number of square feet of each different material in the room and multiply it by its NRC (Noise Reduction Coefficient). Then, add these sums together. This will give you the total number of Sabins in that room.\nHow to determine how much absorption a given room needs to achieve a specific reverb time:\nA) Determine existing reverberation time\nT = V/20S\nT = Reverberation time in seconds\nV = Cubic volume in cubic feet in the room\n20 = The constant\nS = Sabins present in the room This quantity is obtained by multiplying the area of each surface by its absorption coefficient and arriving at a total.\nB.) Determine acoustical absorption required\nS = V/20T\nS = Sabins (units of absorption required in the room)\nV = Cubic volume in cubic feet in the room\n20 = The constant\nT = Desired reverberation time in the room\nC) To determine acoustical absorption we need to add\nRequired Sabins (part “B”)\n- Existing Sabins (part “A”)\n= Sabins we need to add to the space\nTo determine how many actual square feet of a particular material, you have to look up its NRC and multiply it times the number of Sabins required.\nAcoustic Treatments: Any device or object designed to affect the sonic characteristics of a room is an acoustic treatment. All acoustic treatment materials have published performance specifications. Sound absorbers have a rating known as a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC). These properties vary over different frequencies. Materials are tested at 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 & 4000 cps. An average of the middle 4 frequencies is known as the NRC.\nLoudness of Sound: The loudness of a sound decreases with the square of the distance from the source. Sound travels about 730 miles per hour in all directions. The size of the room affects the listening experience. In any room, especially smaller ones, it becomes quite obvious how critical the space and loudness of sound affects the listening experience.\nBass Trap - Diaphragmatic or Membrane Absorber, Hemholtz Absorber:\nEvery audio engineer knows the importance of proper acoustic treatment. Without real bass traps, mixes that sound fine in your control room often sound boomy or thin when played elsewhere. Foam products and light-weight tubes absorb only the mid and upper frequencies. They do little to stop standing waves and acoustic interference that cause severe low frequency peaks and dips. And if you can't hear bass instruments accurately, it's impossible to create mixes that sound good everywhere.\nLow frequency response variations as large as 35 dB are common, especially in smaller rooms. Worse, the peaks and dips change around the room. The sound is thin here. It’s too bassy over there. And nowhere is the response even close to flat. A lack of effective low frequency absorption also makes the bass range sound muddy and ill defined.\nOnce a room has been properly treated the clarity and articulation of bass instrumentsimproves enormously, so you can hear what you're mixing more accurately and with much less effort.\nA Hemholtz bass trap or resonator is a device used to capture a very specific low frequency problem. It works much like blowing over the top of a bottle; a particular note is produced. If a porous absorber is placed in the neck of the bottle it will trap that resonant frequency. This is how the Hemholtz bass trap is constructed constructed.

{"question":"How are clinical trials addressing diversity issues in Alzheimer's research?","answer":"Clinical trials are addressing diversity issues by setting specific recruitment targets - for instance, the Bio-Hermes study aims to ensure 20% of participants are Black or Hispanic. This is important because historically, trials have been predominantly White despite Black Americans making up 14% of the population but less than 5% of trial participants, and Latinos representing 18% of the population but only 1% of trial participants. To improve diversity, researchers are offering free transportation, paying stipends, and including diverse staff members on research teams.","context":["GAP-Net site Kerwin Medical Center in Dallas and GAP President John Dwyer were featured in D Magazine talking about how the Bio-Hermes study is making it easier for diverse populations to participate in its new Alzheimer’s trial.\nDallas-based Kerwin Medical Center is emphasizing diversity as it enrolls patients in the Global Alzheimer’s Platform Foundation’s (GAP) Bio-Hermes study, which sets out to determine which biological marker test is most effective at foretelling the hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Unlike prior Alzheimer trials, the Bio-Hermes study seeks to improve racial diversity in trials by recruiting volunteers until 20% of the participants are Black or Hispanic.\nBecause of the hurdles to participating in and being aware of clinical trials, trial patients have historically been privileged and White. Nearly 14 percent of Americans are Black, yet they make up less than 5 percent of trial participants. Even though Latinos are 18 percent of the country, they represent just 1 percent of clinical trial patients.\nDr. Diana R. Kerwin, the founder, and president of Kerwin Medical Center, says clinic trials have a long-standing history of neglecting African American and Hispanic populations. “If you’re going to test drugs, they need to work for everybody. White Europeans are only roughly 70% of the general population over 60 years old,” she says. “So when we conduct clinical trials, and they’re all white Europeans in the trial, we’re not getting a good picture on whether the drug works for everybody.”\nAlthough there are medical technologies to determine whether someone has Alzheimer’s or not, it can be time-consuming with many visits to the doctor and a PET scan. But GAP President John Dwyer says he wants to expedite this process by developing a simple test to see signs of dementia. “We’re trying to get similar blood tests like those for heart disease or diabetes for Alzheimer’s, and this particular clinical trial that we’re undertaking is attempting to show where the new technologies are relative to the accepted, costly brain scans and show that they’re highly predictive and correlated and make it a lot easier to treat millions of people,” he said.\nBlood plasma tests provide indications of where specific proteins are in the blood and their levels, which is correlated to whether or not you have the disease. Since African Americans show the presence of Alzheimer’s at lower levels of this blood marker, it makes it important to represent different populations in the study. Despite failures in the past to include minority populations in clinical studies, researchers showed it was possible with trials during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“People of color, particularly African Americans and Latinos, are more vulnerable to COVID and are dying at a higher rate than White European descent people were,” Dwyer says. “So when they did the trials for the vaccines, they made a very intentional, conscious amendment to make sure they had a lot of folks from those communities in their trials.”\nTo recruit volunteers from communities of color in their study, GAP will make access to trial participation easier for these groups by offering free transportation and paying stipends to participants. The organization has also recruited people of color and Spanish-speaking members on their research team to encourage participation and make the experience easier for underrepresented populations. Participants don’t need to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to join the study because the study focuses on tests that differentiate healthy people from unhealthy people.\n“The important thing is that they seriously consider being part of the study and giving their precious time to us to make sure we get good results,” Dwyer says. “We need to make it easy for them. And they need to give us their time.”\nOriginally posted by D Magazine on July 7, 2021."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3a11cb9a-ac17-493a-bc5a-e907d4259f5c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between global and multinational approaches to contract lifecycle management, and how do they compare to procurement's role in managing contracts? 🤔","answer":"Global and multinational approaches to contract lifecycle management differ significantly, with global implying universal control and standards, while multinational emphasizes flexibility and regional adaptation. In procurement's contract management approach, the focus is on keeping contracts front and center during their term and drawing out opportunities for resource efficiency and value creation with suppliers. Multinational CLM requires consideration of language differences, regional standards, and varying legal systems, while procurement's approach emphasizes understanding contract content and tracking against estimated volumes. Both approaches aim to make contracts actionable, but multinational CLM specifically addresses cross-border complexities, whereas procurement's focus is on leveraging contracts for continuous improvement regardless of geographic scope.","context":["Procurement needs to be familiar with their company’s spend and purchasing habits on a very detailed level. This requires a combination of spend analysis, contract reviews and stakeholder interviews. What they must remember, however, is that procurement does not just need to increase visibility for the sake of their own understanding, but rather to increase the understanding of all decision makers in the organization.\nThis might include helping the CFO see past savings to appreciate the value of process improvements, or speaking to the COO about opportunities to put aside enough of their budget for the coming year to invest in an equipment upgrade. And the case examples are not limited to those with an internal point of view. In the case of collaborative supplier relationships, helping partners understand the spend trajectory or habits by business units could create new opportunities for them to optimize the services they provide or the inventory they keep on hand.\nFor procurement, however, all of the opportunities listed above require a different kind of relationship with spend itself. They must be familiar enough with the company’s purchasing and spend management to digest spend, give voice to contracts and create cross-product intelligence.\n1. Digesting Spend\nIt is one thing to look at spend data and be able to report the facts; i.e., “We spent $2.1M with 4 suppliers in the digital marketing category last year.” It is another thing entirely to know why that is an important fact and what it might mean to the organization. Was that expenditure up or down? Was it due to a change in the company’s strategy or in response to pressures from outside of the organization? Being able to engage in these kinds of conversations opens the door to greater C-suite access for procurement if there is not already a CPO in place.\nOf course, before procurement can sufficiently digest the spend data to offer the kind of insight executives would be interested to hear, they must understand the mindset of the execs enough to anticipate their questions. The best way to do this is to gather as much information about what issues are being addressed by the C-suite at any given time, including growth plans or major changes foreseen in the company’s industry. Anyone with access to spend can combine constraints and define a fact. Only value-oriented procurement professionals can translate the facts into something that has directional meaning for the company.\n2. Giving Voice to Contracts\nThe transition from metal filing cabinets to cloud-based contract lifecycle management (CLM) solutions has not had as much of an impact on how companies interact with their contracts as it should have. Contracts contain within them the potential to contribute to continuous improvement – as long as someone is willing to keep them front and center during their term. Once again, procurement is in a position to take something factual (the contract) and draw out opportunities to improve resource efficiency and value creation with suppliers.\nJust as with spend, the first step is reading and knowing what is in the organization’s most important contracts. The second step is bringing the contract to bear on how the company operates at the right times and in the right ways. Follow how the company is tracking against estimated volumes to see if discounts or rebates are due. Take full advantage of the service levels and support offerings outlined by the supplier. At the end of the contract term, procurement – and the rest of the organization — should be so familiar with the contract content and how effective it was in achieving the desired results that they can renew it by recapitulating its details or fix any glaring issues in the next contract.\n3. Creating Cross-Product Intelligence\nProcurement’s third opportunity to increase visibility and therefore build understanding is in the cross- product intelligence of all the information they are privy to in the course of routine activities. Procurement always has the chance to learn more than just what is laid out in the sourcing plan – it is what they choose to do with the information they gather that presents an opportunity.\nProcurement may discover that two business units, departments, or functions are starting to look at an area of technology that another is interested in or just started to implement. Procurement may gain insight into an area of investment that one executive wants to make and can be split-funded with another. Depending upon the size of the company, procurement may even find themselves in the position to make introductions or share critical updates internally. The key to making this possible is that all of procurement needs to talk openly. There is no sense in procurement being a microcosm of the company, siloed along spend category lines. Every piece of information or insight that anyone in procurement picks up should be shared and leveraged to its full advantage internally for the good of procurement and the good of the company as a whole.\nThe real message about visibility and understanding is that both are active pursuits. Procurement has to constantly re-examine the information and insight they have access to and to find more ways to leverage them.","In my last post, I wrote about the differences between global and multinational contract lifecycle management. These two seemingly synonymous terms provide guidelines for a large group of varied users and organizations, but they achieve their objectives in different ways. Global implies control, pushing a set of standards universally, while multinational implies flexibility, modifying a localized ability to accommodate regional norms.\nWith today’s preference for collaboration over mandate, multinational is often the “right” way to proceed. While that sounds like an easy choice to make, the devil is in the details when it comes to carrying out a multinational approach to contract management. Is it actually possible to maintain control while adapting to the unique circumstances that are bound to arise?\nIt is, as long as leadership recognizes the importance of being center-led rather than centralized. In addition, the technology in place must be agile enough to empower good decision making, avoiding the rigidity seen with traditional global CLM systems. Realizing this goal requires the ability to refine and implement globally consistent and efficient contract management processes across a myriad of stakeholders.\nThe professionals tasked with making contracts actionable on a multinational basis have an important task on two core levels: language and regional standards as well as legal systems.\nLanguage & Regional Standards\nIf there is an obvious example of functionality that is a must-have to maximize localized usability, it is language and formatting. This includes the user interface, the contract language and the metadata tags that are used to make the contract more searchable and usable. Although each contract is usually crafted in one originating language, multinational contracts often need to be accessible in one or more geographic areas. Regional differences—idioms, dialects, cultural references, and expressions—should be carefully considered.\nThe nuances of word choice can have serious legal implications if not chosen with great care and an understanding of regional or local law. For example, consider phrases in French in France v. Quebec, or Spanish in Spain v. Argentina or Mexico, or Portuguese in Portugal v. Brazil. This is an area where the right CLM solution can be an effective tool. Beyond a complete contract translation, it is possible to leverage metadata tags to ensure that the intended regional meaning of an agreement is preserved from language to language. By isolating salient details through metadata, these terms become abundantly clear across languages and dialects.\nBi-directional visibility and information flows are required to facilitate an effective multinational CLM effort. That’ means all “translated” contracts need active involvement of internal users and suppliers in the locations affected by the alternate language(s) of the contract. The meaning of terms and conditions, as well as the accuracy of different character sets or metadata tags, must be QA’d on a local level. Ideally, this will open up a line of communication internally in the organization for improved CLM adoption and interaction that continues through the life of the contract. The result: all involved counterparties are facilitated, not constrained, by the CLM solution.\nOnce everyone is in agreement about the intent and desired outcome of the contract on multiple local levels, it is also important to ensure that the contract is just as transferrable from a formatting perspective within the CLM system. It would simplify the authoring process if US English spelling, US dollars and US-based formatting (e.g., metric v. english, currency, dates and times) were always the defaults, but you can’t compel global users to an approach from one region.\nUnderstanding the Intent of Law\nBut even when words are translated accurately from one language to another, the intent—and therefore the results—may vary. Variations in law from one legal jurisdiction to the other (i.e., Common Law v. Civil Law) may also require something to be explicitly stated in one location, while it is enough to be implied or understood in another.\nFor instance, in common law in countries like the US, UK, India and Canada, everything the parties want to agree upon needs to be set out in the contract. That way it will be recognized by a court. Conversely, civil law systems in Latin America, most of Europe, all of Asia, and most of Africa, typically have extensive standard rules or codes that will be applicable on certain types of contracts. This means the contracts can be quite short. The drawback is that not all the rules are mandatory. This can create issues later if the parties end up disagreeing about certain provisions. It may not void the entire contract, but still can cause problems.\nThe end goal of each contract is to lead to a set of actions, behaviors, and results. To do that, they must take into account the nuances of law, culture, and language so that the outcomes are as accurate in translation as they are in the original authoring language(s). If contracts are to serve their intended purpose everywhere in the world they apply, their details must follow the same principles as a high-level multinational approach to CLM. That requires taking into consideration all of the information that is required to make the contract applicable on a local level—including language, currency, time and date formats, and local business practices. This draws those geographically dispersed business units closer to the center than the strongest global mandate ever could.\nA contract lifecycle management system that supports multinational requirements empowers companies to function accurately in a dynamic business environment. Allowing contracts to fall out of alignment with actual business requirements just because the solution in place can’t do better is no excuse.\nAddressing these areas properly as part of planning and deployment ensure organizations the ability to:\n- Drive consistent client experience through global guidelines and policies on documentation negotiations\n- Align roles and responsibilities across global, regional and local partners (legal and compliance teams, product and implementation teams)\n- Directly manage clients, suppliers and other third parties in documentation issues that drive resolution\n- Advance the digitization effort of contracts by accommodating business requirements and ultimately driving success\n- Enable contract owners to work closely with all global/regional managers on the appropriate usage of CLM in global frameworks\nTo get a closer look at what it takes to deploy contract lifecycle management multinationally, check out the on-demand webinar with IACCM."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c9d54b4c-faf9-4a92-8ce8-9735de28b322>","<urn:uuid:c61cc9cb-4e1a-4ff5-b10f-9d508e2353e8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a student of political systems, what are the key differences between how Lithuania and Nepal handled their transitions from authoritarian rule to democracy?","answer":"Lithuania made a clearer break from authoritarian rule when it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, with poets and writers like Platelis transitioning from being liberation activists to taking formal roles in the new democratic government, such as minister of education. In contrast, Nepal's transition after 1990 has been more ambiguous, with political leaders maintaining aspects of both authoritarian and democratic systems - using the old definition of politics (raja ko niti or king's policy) when convenient to avoid accountability, while simultaneously employing democratic rhetoric. This has resulted in a dysfunctional system where true democratic principles like equality under law have not been fully implemented.","context":["Lithuanian poet tells tales with longtime pal Hailji\nAn award-winning Lithuanian poet shared his 13 years of friendship with a Korean novelist after attending literary events throughout Korea and recalled darker times in Lithuanian literature.\n“The censorship and propaganda-generating in North Korea is similar to that in Lithuania, but to a lesser degree than it was in Lithuania,” said Lithuanian poet Kornelijus Platelis, 61, who was a liberation activist during the Soviet regime and who faced censorship in the 1980s.\nPlatelis, the former minister of education and science from 1998-2000 and Lithuania’s poet laureate in 1996, took a three-week tour of Korea, which included a literary event at the Yeosu Expo in South Jeolla. He sat for an interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily at its headquarters in central Seoul on Aug. 15, Korea’s Liberation Day.\nPlatelis presented his poetry at a gathering of Lithuanian writers to an international audience at the Lithuanian Pavillion at the Yeosu Expo in South Jeolla, which wrapped up its 93-day run earlier this month on Aug. 12. Platelis served as the commissioner general of the first Lithuanian pavilion at the 1992 expo in Seville, Spain.\nHe also served as deputy minister of culture and education from 1991-1993, after Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.\nThe meeting with Lithuanian writers was attended by Hailji, the 57-year-old Korean novelist, who has written extensively about Lithuania, giving it much praise. Hailji also presented his 2009 book “The Uzupis Republic,” which is set in Uzupis, a district in Lithuania’s capital which means “on the other side of the river” in Lithuanian. The book is in the process of being made into a movie, which Hailji hopes to film on location.\nHailji rose to fame in 1990 with his debut novel, “The Road to the Racetrack,” which was made into a film the following year.\nThe two met 13 years ago when Hailji first visited Lithuania, and the Korean novelist states that he has stayed “at his good friend” Platelis’ home in his three subsequent visits - once even making kimchi there - and that it was time to “return the favor.”\nBoth of them finish each other’s sentences.\nThe exposure that Lithuanians have to Korean literary works is mostly limited to some anthologies of translated Korean folk tales, admitted Platelis.\n“But ten years ago, he introduced seven of my poems in his paper,” said Hailji. The poems were translated by Platelis from English to Lithuanian, from Hailji’s collection of Enlish poems, and published in a weekly culture magazine in Lithuania.\nPlatelis said that in a literary gathering, “one young Korean poet said after reading my poems, he said he cannot recognize that they are from Lithuania.\n“The best poem is when mind, understanding, emotions and senses come together. What it’s about is not so important,” he said.\nPlatelis rose to literary recognition during a dark and turbulent time in Lithuania in the midst of the Soviet regime, where artists faced harsh censorship.\n“I worked as a building engineer for 12 years and all that time, I studied literature by myself. I’m self-educated,” he said.\nHe published three books over that 12-year span, which were so widely recognized that he eventually gave up architecture in 1988, toward the end of the Soviet regime in Lithuania.\n“At that time the style of poetry was dark and sophisticated,” said Platelis. “Poetry was the freest art, the freest way of expression because it would hide with metaphors and metonyms.”\nLiving in a small town in southern Lithuania, he created a liberation movement group in the 1980s and set about printing newspapers, but he was eventually thrust into leadership.\nHe recalled protesting, “We’re artists, we don’t want to be politicians. But people were scared and we were not employed anywhere. Those people who were employed anywhere would be released from their jobs [if caught protesting].”\nRight after World War II, censorship was especially tough, and he said hundreds of thousands of people were deported to Siberia, and those were “difficult times to be a writer.”\nThere were at least three layers of censorship. First were the editors. “They were your friends, you could talk to them.” Then came directors and editors-in-chief who controlled what they could and could not publish. The third layer was the special censorship office.\n“If they find something in your work, that is bad. It means you could be deported to Siberia or not published anymore,” he said.\nA selection of Platelis’ poems translated into Korean was published in the 2012 fall anthology of “The Poet’s World,” which he presented at a literary event hosted by the Seoul Foundation for Arts & Culture on Aug. 16.\nBy Sarah Kim [firstname.lastname@example.org]","How does one define politics in Nepal, especially when it comes to the use of power? The definition of politics before the 1990 era can be explained by the Nepali term rajniti, which in its literal sense means raja ko niti – the king's policy. This definition implied that all ordinances came from the king, one who was above the law, and could not be contested because any policy that came from the royal institution was also by its literal Nepali definition, sabai bhanda ramro niti, that is, 'the best of policy'. Of course the king had his advisors to guide and caution him but fundamentally there were no constraints on his use of power. Power at the time was in the literal sense the 'king's authority'.\nThe second definition of politics follows the 1990 democratic movement. This movement introduced the western concept of liberal politics, where 'politics is the constrained use of power'. Constraints include the parliament, judiciary and the various bureaucratic institutions, providing different levels of checks and balances within the governing system. Most importantly, no one is considered above the law.\nThe 1990 movement in its democratic essence should have brought about the end of the first definition of politics. But in the years that followed, including after the 2005 movement, the dual implementation of the first and second definitions has brought about a moral decadence in the overall polity and society of Nepal. Regardless of what happened before 1990, the current definition of politics cannot be said to be adhering to the fundamental principles of democracy.\nQuite contradictorily, our leaders straddle both definitions, using whichever is convenient for them. They use the first definition to dodge accusations, lapses of duty, or to delay decision making that may not be in their favour and to avoid punishment for any unlawful act. They use the second definition to prop up their false democratic rhetoric for the people. Besides other explanatory variables, the interchangeable use of these two definitions also accounts for why nepotism, favouritism and 'partyism' continue to run rampant; why coming to a consensus in writing a new constitution seems so difficult; why it took 18 elections to choose a prime minister; why Devi Prasad Regmi was thrown into jail for the slap case while minister Begum escaped punishment for a similar incident; why we hear commitments from successive governments that the loadshedding problem will be solved in five years; and why improvements in security are hyped up when we know our borders are in their most vulnerable state to date.\nSome may argue that since politicians are rational they obviously juggle these two definitions for an optimum outcome. But rationality, and most importantly democracy, cannot operate without a set of rules where the game is fair and everybody is equal in the eyes of the law. The leap into the democratic era, or the republic, is a symbolic rupture between the old and the new. It should herald a transformation in which, according to Weber, power should be embodied in the formal organisations of rationality, by which he meant power governed by a set of rules.\nFlipflopping on both definitions makes for a dysfunctional system of governance and fosters moral decay in the people who believed in and voted for them, only to be let down. Raising the price of oil one day and sending one's own student union to the streets the next day is akin to a split personality disorder. Similarly, there can be no justification for keeping the country hostage for almost seven months as 18 elections ran their course. This is a modus operandi worse than the rulers of the pre-1990s would have chosen. Ambiguity in political actions sends out a message of futility and fickleness of governance, stalls any hope of development and progress, and generates frustration in the people that will inevitably lead to the demise of the regime.\nA strong regime is one that conforms to a single definition of politics, sticking to the norms of a democratic republic, in which there is a set of rules based on the principles of equality and freedom. Unless the people of Nepal feel that everyone is equal by law, they won't see a difference between the politics of Naya Nepal and the old Nepal. Real change does not necessarily stem from the election of a new prime minister, or by overthrowing governments. Real change will come when the people of Nepal finally sense the fundamentals of democracy being implemented.\nBiraj Bahadur Bista is a PhD candidate at the Department of Political Science in Seoul National University, South Korea\n1. nepali voice\nCongratulations Mr. Bista on yet another well articulated piece.

You have presented a different way of looking at the ills of nepali politics. I presume you will do more research on this subject area in the future. Apart from bahunbad, party structure, education of our leadership etc., continuity of using old definition of politics and thinking that one is the law or above the law also mars democracy from flourishing. Does that mean that Nepali society and leaders haven't been able to disassociate from practicing politics from the old way? Certainly more research will be required to explain this phenomenom than a small article and I hope to you will continue on this topic in the future as well. _ sanjay\n22 FEB 2011 | 6:12 AM NST\nWith due respect, I beg to differ from the enlightened author. I under-stand 'rajniti' as 'raj' means rule and 'neeti' means a set of moral codes. Hence, 'rajniti' literally means a set of moral codes for ruling or governance. The real contest is in 'What constitutes that set of moral codes? Who constructs those rules? and, above all, 'Who exercises de facto those rules?' A ruler could be a King (Raja), or any other agency, e.g. a Parliament, or even a foreign agency the, e.g. 'British Raj' in India. In monarchy (mono archy= one person's rule) the king pretends to tap the so-called 'divine power' as the source of his authority and legitimacy and rules over the people ('praja'). In other words, feudalism is the proper name of the game (1961-1991). In oligarchy (oligo archy= rule of a few), a few self-selected 'tatha batha' or higher cast pundits, or 'sambrhanta pariwar' (the elites and aristocrats), or the novoua riches ('nava dhanadya') rule in the name of democracy (1991-2001). Both are fundamentally flawed as the sovereign people is excluded from the real power to govern themselves. After 2008 Nepal entered into a Republican era. The on-going fight in Nepal is whether the political parties, the intellegentsia, the professionals, the bureaucrats, the remnants of monarchy or the elites are willing to accept the supremacy of the sovereign people. 'Self-transformation' (I call it 'Swayambhoo') is an essential precondition for 'Swa raj' (Gandhi coined the term?). Political party leaders and the stakeholders of the 'New' Nepal need to show moral discipline to transform themselves. New set of values become norms of the day only if one is ready to apply those values on oneself ('praxis'). Sooner or later, we will know whether leaders of 'New' Nepal are truly committed to the moral codes of 'Swa raj'. Right now, there is a dearth of 'Raj Neta', a Statesman, with a stratgic vision and the courage to say \"No\" to 'Prabhoo' (Para bhoo= rule by 'the others')\n22 FEB 2011 | 7:36 AM NST\nit does not matter what they use - mono, dual, or plural - the current leaders cannot do nothin' they are all rotten eggs just waiting to be thrown out by the people.\n23 FEB 2011 | 7:12 AM NST\nDear Arun # 9.

{"question":"As a parent concerned about my child's wellbeing, how does childhood trauma affect brain development, and what role do healthy family relationships play in preventing these issues?","answer":"Childhood trauma significantly alters brain development, creating a 'trauma brain' that develops when a child is locked in a fight/flight/freeze state with corresponding hormones flooding the body, impacting both physiological and mental health. This can lead to poor decision-making, anger, substance use, and defiant attitudes. However, healthy family relationships can help prevent and address these issues. Building strong connections with children, providing clear boundaries with love and understanding, and engaging in active listening are essential. Parents should prioritize making bonds with their children, pay attention to their point of view, and set aside specific family time. Additionally, modeling healthy behaviors is crucial since children are like sponges, constantly observing and learning from how adults handle stress, manage feelings, and communicate with others.","context":["Being able to identify a child’s basic and physical needs such as nutritious food, shelter, warm clothing, and a reasonable bed time is obvious and easy to recognize. However a child’s mental and emotional needs are more difficult to identify and notice.\nThe environment you provide for your child each day holds many opportunities and chances for nourishing good mental health. Having good mental health helps and allows your child to learn and develop appropriate skills to influence, enhance, and improve communication and expression, social skills and interactions, emotional regulation, and confidence in themselves. Your child’s mental health is vital and plays a major role in their overall wellbeing. Here are some tips and strategies you can implement and apply in your daily lives to help support, encourage, and influence your child’s emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing.\n1. Active Listening and Communication View your child’s behaviors as a window to their needs and feelings. Your child is communicating something. What is it? Be patient and engage in active listening before offering your advice. Take time to sit down and ask open ended questions, to gather information, promote discussions, and give yourself as a parent opportunities for validations. As parents you are trying to encourage communication, not to discourage it. Be mindful of how you respond verbally and emotionally.\n2. Model Healthy Behaviors Children are influential and developmentally are constantly growing and learning. They are like little sponges soaking up everything around them. Children see how you handle stress, how you manage and deal with your feelings, how you problem solve, and how you communicate with others. It’s hard to model appropriate behaviors all the time but striving to model the behavioral and emotional responses you want your children to engage in.\n3. Establishing Boundaries and Structure Consistency and structure are beneficial both for children and parents. Clear structure, rules, and expectations provide limits and boundaries. Children need boundaries without them they lose their way. They need clear rules and consistent consequences. But they need them to be delivered with love, understanding and kindness. Talking about the reasons for both rules and consequences helps children understand why they need to follow rules.\n4. Building Relationships & Connections Making a connection and a bond with your child should be the upmost highest priority. Paying attention to your child’s point of view, thoughts, feelings, and concerns helps develop a bond and a healthy connection. Prioritizing time with your child is essential to developing the relationship. Scheduling or setting specific time aside for your child and family can only be beneficial for everyone.\n5. Providing Praise Providing praise to children helps build and develop confidence and a sense of selfworth. By providing praise you’re showing your child you acknowledge them, your encouraging them, and helping them develop awareness to when they do well. Praise also influences feelings of being proud.\n“We see how early childhood experiences are so important to lifelong outcomes, how the early environment literally becomes embedded in the brain and changes its architecture.” ~ Andrew S. Garner","In juvenile justice we have been making space to recognize and address the traumas youth have experienced. However, juvenile justice still lacks in addressing parental trauma of these youth. Can we treat, heal and prevent reoffending in a youth if we have not treated and healed the primary parent of the youth?\nThe juvenile justice system has evolved and continues to evolve from a mentality of accountability = punishment. The latest evolution has those of us working in juvenile justice donning our trauma-informed lenses, working to decipher what traumas may have adversely impacted the youth we’re working with. This practice is supported by research and opinion.\nFor more information, visit the JJIE Resource Hub\nThe research now informing practice demonstrates that more than half of adjudicated youth report four or more Adverse Childhood Experiences. For many in the field this has provided new interventions and practices. Language is beginning to change, use of detention versus treatment is being balanced. Juvenile courts are working to make sense of trauma-brain-driven actions versus choice and accountability. The focus mostly rests on examining the adjudicated youth for trauma, treatments, healing and accountability.\nHowever, we can’t talk trauma without talking family. We can’t talk family without actually talking to the family about the trauma experienced by the youth. The family may not be the cause of the trauma; however, family is central to healing.\nLong before research supported the trauma/delinquency link, delinquency and family were only linked in theories of social control. These social control theories argue that delinquency occurs when a youth has a weak bond to society and these bonds are ultimately learned in the family.\nNow science tells us differently. Now we know that a brain consistently met with adverse childhood experiences like witnessing domestic violence, not having enough to eat, having a biological parent leave or go to prison, being sexually or physically abused actually changes a child’s brain.\nThe child’s brain can become a “trauma brain.” This trauma brain develops after being locked in a state of fight/flight/freeze with the corresponding hormones flooding the body, impacting physiological health and mental health. Juvenile justice professionals are recognizing this reality, and the system is slowly evolving to make space for trauma.\nFor example, most juvenile probation officers no longer talk about “dirty” drug tests or tell a youth they are “dirty” for testing positive on a drug test. We have learned this kind of language can retraumatize or trigger a youth who has experienced abuse, especially sexual abuse. Similarly, those who work with delinquent youth are learning that trauma may contribute significantly to poor decision-making, anger, substance use and even defiant attitudes. But what is the trauma source? What is the trauma magnifier?\nIf we only treat the trauma, but don’t consider the sources or the magnifiers, then that youth may stay locked in trauma brain. That youth may be at greater risk for probation violations or committing future crimes or even move into committing adult crimes.\nWe must be willing to look beyond the youth in front of us. If the adverse childhood experience originated in the family, then we must consider the family. If the adverse childhood experience originated outside the family (i.e.: adopted youth, sexual abuse originating outside the family, natural disasters), we must still address the family’s reaction to the traumatized youth.\nMost importantly, we must make space for trauma members of the family may have experienced. If a parent abuses a youth, it is likely the parent was abused. Has the parent’s trauma been addressed or just punished?\nWe cannot expect a delinquent youth to heal from trauma if we place the youth right back into the environment where the trauma occurred, even if the trauma has stopped. For example, if a child witnesses domestic violence, science tells us that the child is more likely to have health issues, school issues, substance abuse issues and/or delinquency issues.\nEven if the battered parent becomes the primary parent and separates from the abuser, we know that battered parent’s brain has probably been changed by trauma. How can an adult with a traumatized brain be the sole support for a youth with a traumatized brain? We can’t expect change if the youth is to return to a home of chaos, where the trauma occurred.\nThe solution lies in working with the entire family. Wrap-around services begin to address this problem. However, not all families qualify for wrap-around services. Family courts have a history of ordering family therapy to address issues in the family, which is important.\nHowever, family therapy does not allow a parent of trauma to fully address individual issues. Research informs us: “when a mother had 3 or more ACEs, she was more likely to have mental health problems in the year after she had her baby, and she also tended to struggle with the feeling like she wasn’t a good parent.” To truly impact the negative effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences in delinquent youth, they must live in families where the adults have support to address their own Adverse Childhood Experiences and/or recent traumas separate from family therapy.\nWe can no longer ignore the negative impacts of Adverse Childhood Experiences and their ability to not only imprint, but steer, all future generations in a family. Work must be done to address the traumas, heal the traumas and build resiliency in all members of the delinquent youth’s family.\nDr. Cathy Anthofer-Fialon is the program manager for the 13th Circuit Family Division in Grand Traverse County, Michigan. She’s passionate in moving her local community and region to become trauma-informed and active in building resilience.\nMore related articles:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a460a60d-e085-4ecc-8838-1bc2b2cad93b>","<urn:uuid:b8fb7797-a790-4584-9012-603d0bf58985>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between autonomous maintenance in TPM and reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) approaches?","answer":"Autonomous maintenance in TPM is where operators are trained to perform simple maintenance tasks on their equipment, helping prevent small problems from becoming major issues and giving employees ownership over their equipment. In contrast, reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is a structured approach to identifying machine subsystems to establish safe minimums for maintenance and determine where predictive maintenance will have the greatest impact. While autonomous maintenance is operator-focused and emphasizes routine maintenance tasks, RCM is more analytical and systematic, used to effectively implement predictive maintenance where potential failures would have the greatest negative impact.","context":["Are you tired of dealing with unexpected equipment breakdowns that hinder your manufacturing processes? Do you want to improve your production efficiency while reducing costs and increasing profits? Look no further than Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) – a powerful tool in Lean Manufacturing Strategies. In this blog post, we will explore the importance of TPM and how it can transform your operations by ensuring the optimal performance of machinery, minimizing downtime, and enhancing overall productivity. So join us as we dive into the world of TPM and discover why it’s an essential ingredient for success in lean manufacturing!\nWhat is Total Productive Maintenance?\nIn any manufacturing process, there are three essential components: people, machines, and methods. Each of these components must be operating at peak efficiency in order for the manufacturing process to run smoothly. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a system that was developed in order to keep all three of these components operating at peak efficiency.\nTPM is a proactive approach to maintenance that emphasizes regular and routine maintenance activities in order to prevent problems before they occur. By keeping machines well-maintained, TPM can help to improve overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and reduce downtime. In addition, TPM can also help to improve employee morale by involving them in the maintenance process and giving them a sense of ownership over the equipment they use.\nThere are many different elements to a successful TPM program, but some of the most important include:\n1. Autonomous Maintenance: This is where operators are trained to perform simple maintenance tasks on their equipment. This helps to ensure that machines are properly maintained and can help to prevent small problems from becoming big ones.\n2. Planned Maintenance: This is a more traditional approach to maintenance where tasks are scheduled in advance and carried out on a regular basis. This helps to ensure that machines are always running at peak efficiency.\n3. Quality Maintenance: This is focused on ensuring that products meet quality standards throughout the manufacturing process. This includes both inspections and repairs if necessary.\nThe Benefits of Total Productive Maintenance\nTotal productive maintenance (TPM) is a set of activities designed to maintain and improve the performance of equipment and machinery. The goal of TPM is to achieve the highest level of equipment productivity and reliability while minimizing downtime and costs.\nTPM can be adopted in any manufacturing or processing environment, but it is particularly well suited to lean manufacturing environments where there is a focus on continuous improvement and waste reduction.\nSome of the benefits of TPM include:\n1. Increased Equipment Productivity: By preventing downtime and improving equipment performance, TPM can help to increase overall equipment productivity. In turn, this can lead to increased output and profitability for the business.\n2. Improved Equipment Reliability: TPM helps to ensure that equipment is properly maintained and operated, which leads to improved reliability and reduced downtime. This can help businesses to avoid production delays and lost revenues due to equipment failures.\n3. Reduced Maintenance Costs: TPM can help businesses to reduce their overall maintenance costs by minimizing downtime and improving equipment performance. In addition, TPM often leads to increased first-time fix rates, which can further reduce maintenance costs.\n4. Improved Employee morale: Implementing TPM often leads to improved employee morale as employees feel empowered to take ownership of their work and contribute to continuous improvement initiatives. This can lead to increased commitment and engagement from employees, which can further improve productivity levels.\nThe 7 Types of Waste in Manufacturing\nThere are seven types of waste in manufacturing: overproduction, waiting, transportation, processing, inventory, motion, and defects.\nOverproduction: Producing more than is needed or required. This is the most common type of waste in manufacturing and it can be caused by a number of factors such as incorrect forecasting, poor planning, or simply producing too much of a good thing. It results in wasted time, money, and resources.\nWaiting: This is waste caused by delays. It can be delays in getting raw materials or components, delays in the production process itself, or delays in getting products to customers. This type of waste results in lost time and opportunity.\nTransportation: Transportation waste is created when products or materials are moved unnecessarily. This could be due to the poor layout of the factory floor or the incorrect routing of materials through the production process. Transportation waste results in lost time and money as well as increased wear and tear on equipment.\nProcessing: Processing waste occurs when there are unnecessary steps in the production process. This could be due to inefficient machinery, outdated methods, or simply having too many steps that add no value to the product. Processing waste results in lost time and money as well as increased wear and tear on equipment.\nInventory: Inventory waste is created when there is more stock than what is needed to meet customer demand. This could be due to over-production (as mentioned above), incorrect forecasting, or simply holding onto too much\nHow to Implement Total Productive Maintenance\nTotal productive maintenance (TPM) is a strategic approach to improving the overall performance of an organization. It involves all employees in the continual improvement of equipment, processes, and resources. The goal of TPM is to eliminate waste and maximize productivity.\nTPM implementation can be challenging, but there are a few key steps that can help ensure success:\n1. Define the scope of the TPM initiative.\n2. Create a TPM Implementation Team and develop a plan.\n3. Train employees on TPM concepts and methods.\n4. Implement TPM activities and measure results.\n5. Sustain the TPM program through continuous improvement.\nTPM Tools and Techniques\ntotal productive maintenance (TPM) is a preventative maintenance program that focuses on optimizing the performance of equipment and machines. The goal of TPM is to reduce downtime, increase productivity, and improve quality.\nThere are several tools and techniques that can be used in a total productive maintenance program. Some of the most common include:\n– Maintenance planning and scheduling: This involves creating a plan for when and how often equipment will be maintained. This can help to avoid unexpected downtime and ensure that maintenance activities are carried out in a timely manner.\n– Preventative maintenance: This is a proactive approach to maintenance that involves identifying potential problems before they occur. This can be done through regular inspections, testing, and monitoring of equipment.\n– Predictive maintenance: This is a reactive approach to maintenance that uses data from sensors to predict when equipment is likely to fail. This information can then be used to schedule repairs or replacements before the failure occurs.\n– Condition-based monitoring: This is a type of predictive maintenance that uses sensors to monitor the condition of the equipment. This information can be used to identify potential problems so that they can be fixed before they cause issues.\nTotal Productive Maintenance is a critical component of any lean manufacturing strategy. It helps to reduce downtime, improve quality and productivity, as well as eliminate waste. By leveraging the benefits of TPM, companies can increase their profitability and remain competitive in today’s rapidly changing marketplace. With an effective implementation plan for Total Productive Maintenance, organizations can realize significant improvements in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction that will last long into the future.","Equipment Maintenance and Food Safety: What You Need to Know\nBy Jeremy Wright\nAsk most plant managers about why manufacturing equipment maintenance is important, and you’re likely to hear about downtime and cost control. Food safety, unfortunately, rarely comes up.\nYet along with sanitation, allergen control, food traceability and the like, equipment maintenance is a critical factor in safe food product production. As a part of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has mandated equipment maintenance as one of the risk-based preventive controls with which food manufacturers must comply. Equipment maintenance and calibration, as a function of CGMPs, is also considered key components of the GMP Prerequisite Program required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for any Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system.\nAs FDA continues to focus on prevention instead of reaction and monitoring as the guiding principle for food safety, production equipment maintenance will be increasingly important—and face greater scrutiny. Preventive maintenance (PM), as well as predictive maintenance (PdM), will soon replace reactive maintenance as the standard in the CGMP environment.\nWhen manufacturing equipment is not kept in good repair and condition, it can be a greater potential source of microbiological and physical contamination. Debris from worn or broken parts can contaminate the production line—or even enter the product directly.\nFlaking paint, excessive lubrication and rust can all create hazards. Furthermore, equipment not meeting operating parameters can impact product quality as well as safety. Critical Control Points can be missed, processes can be interrupted, and unwanted substances and chemicals can enter the production stream. Studies show the age of equipment at most food processors exceeds 20 years—an indication that proper maintenance practices are more important than ever.\nMaintenance: An Evolving Discipline\nAny discussion of best practices for equipment maintenance has to begin with the status quo: a reactive, run-to-failure strategy. While reactive maintenance has its place in some instances—if for example, the cost of maintenance is greater than the cost of unexpected failure—this practice is both short-sighted and, unfortunately, all too common.\nA better alternative, and one that is gaining momentum, is PM, which requires inspection, diagnostics, service and parts replacement, according to timely and well-planned maintenance schedules. It works especially well in food manufacturing. For example, in situations where multiple processing lines are coupled with packaging/filling lines that are run intermittently, there are natural opportunities for PM when lines are not in operation.\nCertain challenges of PM, despite its many advantages, are worth noting. Because work is done according to schedule instead of need, tasks may be done where wear has not occurred. Also, if production is curtailed due to drops in demand, technicians may sometimes continue to service equipment where the need is not evident. Finally, PM may take technicians away from equipment where a failure is imminent—or has occurred.\nFor reasons such as these, PdM is the strongest of all maintenance disciplines. PdM is a condition-based approach to machine reliability that identifies, measures and earmarks factory equipment for maintenance before a failure occurs. This is accomplished through a range of innovative diagnostic and sensing technologies including ultrasound detectors, thermography and vibration analysis, among others.\nPdM is extremely effective at anticipating failures and minimizing downtime. Thanks to the growth of the Internet of Things, supported by sensors that are becoming less expensive and increasingly sophisticated, problems can be identified at a premature phase. Bluetooth connectivity allows technicians to monitor equipment in real time, in order to head off issues before they impact either production or food safety.\nWhile the effect of PdM on food safety is measurable, facilities quickly experience other efficiencies. Fewer specialists are required to service machines, and less time is wasted on needless maintenance. Service tasks can oftentimes be scheduled when they are least disruptive and most cost-effective (and line personnel are less likely to be left waiting while repairs are made). Best of all, PdM supports better reliability engineering; through root cause analysis, engineers can determine and design equipment alternatives that reduce downtime and eliminate repeated failures.\nImplementing a PdM program isn’t as difficult as one might think. Many of the same disciplines used in PM are transferrable; in fact, if a plant is currently following a PdM regimen (as enumerated below), combining PM and PdM often achieves the best results.\nReview and analyze your current maintenance performance to determine the economic benefits, as even small changes can yield significant returns.\nIdentify the critical machines that, if offline, will slow or even shut down operations.\nDetermine the need for critical spare parts.\nThe goal is to maximize efficiency. If a part is readily available from a vendor, for example, it may not be necessary to carry it in inventory.\nThe right mix of PdM and PM can be determined through failure analysis. Reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) is a structured approach to identifying machine subsystems in order to establish safe minimums for maintenance. Utilizing RCM is a great way to roll out PdM effectively, where potential failures will have the greatest negative impact.\nOutside Knowledge Is Beneficial\nIn all these initiatives, an independent maintenance services partner can be invaluable. A skilled specialist organization will shorten the learning curve, delivering insights and best practices from other industries as well as other food producers. Managers are often surprised to see just how effective and beneficial non-food maintenance strategies can be in a food production facility.\nWith the speed and frequency of new products—not to mention more rigorous food safety standards—food processors must constantly examine ways to improve their manufacturing practices. It’s important to include equipment maintenance in this effort. With a strong, coordinated program in place, managers will find their facility becoming healthier, more profitable and, ultimately, safer."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b5d46a4-6321-4fe4-849e-10a4c1e0b6a3>","<urn:uuid:4f5bce07-977f-46cf-bc9e-7372c26bd202>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the average maximum temperature Kuwait City vs Ahwaz temperature (in celsius) during hottest months?","answer":"In July, both Kuwait City and Ahwaz have average high temperatures of 46.7°C. In August, Kuwait City averages 46.9°C while Ahwaz averages 46.8°C. These temperatures are based on data from 1994-2008 for Kuwait City and 1994-2005 for Ahwaz.","context":["Hottest Cities in the World\nAt least two cities contend closely for the title of 'Hottest City in the World'. What city ranks the hottest depends on how you look at the temperatures.\nHere we compare the world's most sweltering cities in terms of highest temperatures, hottest nights, and most days of extreme heat. So you can judge which is the World's Hottest City.\nCities With the Highest Highs\nIn the world's hottest cities, temperatures get above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) nearly every day for months at a time. Dozens of cities in the Middle East and Africa have extended periods of 40-degree weather.\nIt's in deserts along the Persian Gulf, on the Arabian Peninsula and in Iraq and Iran, where cities have exceptionally searing summers. In two cities here, the heat rises above the rest. Only Kuwait City and Ahwaz report having months with daily maximum temperatures averaging above 46 °C (115 °F).\nKuwait City lies on the coast near the head of the Persian Gulf. Capital of the tiny country of Kuwait, the city itself houses just over 30 thousand people, but it adjoins other cities that together form a large metropolitan area extending into the desert.\nAhwaz, also spelled Ahvaz, sprouts from the desert of western Iran with a population of close to a million. Although inland from the Persian Gulf, Ahwaz sits at just 23 metres (75 feet) above sea level.\nThe only cities that come close to the regular 46-degree temperatures of Kuwait City and Ahwaz lie roughly between the two cities. In southern Iraq, maximum temperatures average 44.8 °C (112.6 °F) in July and August at An Nasiriya, while Al Amarah has average highs of 45.5 °C (113.9 °F) in July and 44.9 °C (112.8 °F) in August.\nHow Hot is That?\nA 46 °C climate is so hot that it's well beyond the hottest weather ever experienced in many other countries. Forty-six Celsius tops by a degree ( 1.8 degrees F) Canada's record high temperature and is 7.5 degrees C (13.5 degrees F) warmer than the hottest day in the United Kingdom. Temperatures that would break records in some counties are normal weather, day after day, for several months a year in the world's hottest cities.\nThe only place in the United States with 46-degree heat is North America's hottest spot, Death Valley in eastern California. Summer temperatures at Death Valley soar to average highs of 46.5 °C (115.7 °F) in July and 45.4 °C (113.8 °F) in August.\nHighest Daily Temperatures\nAhwaz and Kuwait are nearly equal in their average maximum temperatures during the year's two hottest months. For both cities in July, highs average 46.7°C (116.1 °F).\nIn August, Kuwait City squeaks ahead with a 46.9 °C (116.4 °F) average high, while Ahwaz is just one-tenth of a degree Celsius cooler at 46.8°C (116.2 °F). These temperatures are averages from 1994 until 2008 for Kuwait City and from 1994 to 2005 for Ahwaz, the most recent periods of data available from their meteorological offices.\nOf course some months have received above average weather. The hottest month on record for Ahwaz was July 2000, when daytime temperatures reached an average 48.1°C (118.6 °F). Nearly as sizzling were August 2000 and July 1989 when highs averaged 48.0°C (118.4 °F). Since 1952, the Ahwaz weather station has measured temperatures of 50 °C (122 °F) or higher on several dozen days.\nMost Extreme Heat\nDespite Kuwait City having a marginally greater average, Ahwaz leads the way in extreme temperatures. Several times Ahwaz has achieved temperatures higher than those ever recorded in Kuwait City.\nFrom 1970 to 2000, Ahwaz made it to 52 °C (125.6 °F) or more on three days. Ahwaz had a high of 52.0 on July 12, 1971 and 52.2 °C (126 °F) on July 1, 2000. Neither of those broke any temperature records for the city, since it had already reached 54.0 °C (129.2 °F) on July 15, 1967.\nMeanwhile, 52 °C has never been officially documented, as of 2010, in Kuwait City.\nCity With the Hottest Nights\nIn most hot cities when daytime temperatures top 40 °C, it usually cools down at night to the mid-20s. Just a few cities have a month of nighttime lows that stay above 30 °C (86 °F), and Kuwait City is one.\nDuring the hottest months of the year, Ahwaz at night normally gets about a degree Celsius cooler than Kuwait City. But the Kuwaiti nights are not the warmest among cities.\nEven hotter nights occur in Oman, a country located south of Kuwait on the Arabian Peninsula. Several cities in Oman stay above 30 °C at night in summer, including Buraimi, Sur and Rustaq, plus the capital, Muscat.\nThe country's hottest city that measures weather is Samail, where from June to August nights generally don't go below 30 degrees. Samail's hottest nights are in July, which average 31.4 °C (88.5 °F), while the days climb to around 43 °C (109.4 °F).\nMost Hot Days a Year\nThe 40-plus heat that descends on Kuwait and Ahwaz stays for five months every year, from May to September. Not only are the highest highs of these two cities exceptional, so is the longevity of their really hot season. Although many cities do have months averaging above 40 degrees, only a few sustain 40-degree weather for as long as five months a year, notably Buraimi in Oman and Mecca (Makkah) in Saudi Arabia.\nOutside of their intensely hot months, temperatures cool substantially in Kuwait City and Ahwaz. Average highs drop to less than 30 °C (86 °F) from November through March, and even go below 20 °C (68 °F) in January. During winter, Ahwaz's location about 200 kilometres (125 miles) north of Kuwait helps make it a little cooler. Outside of the summer months, daytime highs in Ahwaz remain a degree or two lower than those at Kuwait City.\nMeanwhile at Burami, winters stay warmer than Kuwait City's, averaging below 30 °C only from December to February. At Mecca though, winter brings even less respite from the heat. The city near the Red Sea has daily highs averaging above 30 degrees every month of the year, ranging from 30.2 °C (86.4 °F) in January to 43.6 °C (110.5 °F) in June.\nYet for some cities the weather never even gets as cool as Mecca's. Possibly the only city with daily maximum temperatures averaging above 34 °C (93.2 °F) for every month is Ciudad Bolivar in Venezuela. Winter never happens there. Although Ciudad Bolivar's monthly highs only average at most 37.7 °C (99.9 °F), its coldest months, June and July, are still at 34.8 °C (94.6 °F).\nSo perhaps this means Ciudad Bolivar is the world's hottest city.\n|Month||Kuwait City||Ahwaz, Iran|\nIslamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organization.

{"question":"How do ECOZI's media campaign and Education Outcome Fund differ in their approach to improving education?","answer":"ECOZI's media campaign and the Education Outcome Fund take different approaches to improving education. ECOZI uses national television through their 'Education 15' show to raise awareness about education rights and policy changes, filming episodes across different provinces to reach all corners of Zimbabwe and involve various stakeholders. The Education Outcomes Fund, on the other hand, focuses on financial incentives by rewarding successful interventions through pre-agreed prices per outcome (like number of students completing exams). However, the Education Outcomes Fund's current design has limitations as it focuses on providing financing directly to non-state actors, while ECOZI's approach engages both government officials and civil society organizations to implement education reforms.","context":["Taking CSO campaigns to new heights: Education rights on national TV in Zimbabwe\nECOZI – the national education coalition of Zimbabwe was established in June 2009.\nEZOZI receives 300.000 USD over a 2-year period from Education Out Loud to work with education policy advocacy. ECOZI is one of the 54 national education coalitions currently receiving funding from EOL.\nECOZI is a Privat Voluntary Organization (PVO) network of organizations based all over Zimbabwe working within the education sector.\nECOZI is a democratically run coalition with a total of 54 member organizations.\nECOZI is member of the Education Coordinating Committee of Zimbabwe, the African Network Campaign on Education for All (ANCEFA) and Global Campaign for Education (GCE).\nECOZI works to unite civil society in Zimbabwe in the common pursuit of the right to quality, compulsory and free basic education for all and emphasizes publicly funded education.\nIn 2020, the implementation of the new Education Amendment Act begun in Zimbabwe. The Act addresses important issues not included in previous legislation such as corporal punishment, disability and girls’ education following pregnancy. ECOZI, the National Education Coalition of Zimbabwe funded by Education Out Loud, was one of the lead organizations engaging with the government and preparing amendments to the previous Education Act – making sure that the new Act was inclusive and secured rights for marginalized children.\nIt was a victory for ECOZI and Zimbabwe when the new Act was passed. But a problem remained. Advocacy and Communications Officer with ECOZI, Mercy Mangwana Mubayiwa, explains:\n“It was not well known amongst most Zimbabweans - they had no idea what was going on with the new amendment. What were the changes? Which rights were ensured? We wanted to make sure that they knew that”.\nIn Zimbabwe, it takes long for news of policy changes to travel to remote regions. Changes are published in press releases by the authorities resulting in little if any engagement with the people affected by the changes. ECOZI wanted to address this:\n“We thought; we need to popularize the Education Amendment Act. We need to break down the Act. The best way to do that was to engage with people through mass media. We decided, we would create a talk show” Mercy Mubayiwa says.\nAiring on national TV\nEvery Sunday and Monday when you tune into the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Cooperation television channel, the talk show “Education 15” is aired. With the financial support of Education Out Loud, ECOZI created 13 TV episodes with different panels of CSO representatives, government officials and experts discussing topics related to the new Act.\n“We sat down and looked at the key groups affected by the new Act. We decided which groups needed advocacy and which topics more awareness. And then we came up with an interview schedule for the episodes – each discussing a different topic from the Act” Mercy Mubayiwa explains.\nIt was important for ECOZI to reach people in all corners of the country and to involve organizations from all regions in the process of creating the talk show.\n“We managed to shoot each episode in a different province. In Harare, for example, we filmed an episode about education and disability. We had representatives from organizations fighting for disability rights speaking directly to disabled students and their families on national TV. We discussed how to make sure that all schools in Zimbabwe have the facilities to accommodate students with disabilities. Enough classrooms, enough teachers” Mercy Mubayiwa recalls.\nSharing advice and learnings\nECOZI's best advice to others:\nSocial capital and networking are the keys to ensuring change. You must use your social capital to hold those in power accountable, and to drive social change through them. It all begins with you breaking down the walls of the offices they hold and creating lasting professional relations, cognizant of the fact that they are ordinary human beings before being leaders and appealing to that makes them want to deliver.\nThey would like to learn:\nBest practices on how to engage more in advocacy on the latest digital platforms including podcasting and listening through our social media engagement. Additionally, inspiration on how to enhance discussions and further feedback following our media campaign.\nHow do you plan a TV show?\nIt was clear for ECOZI that to really make the new Act matter, they had to reach a wide range of stakeholders: from policy makers and other organizations to parents and students. Planning a large media campaign and shooting a TV show requires extensive coordination. Coordinating with partner organizations from far away regions can be an additional challenge, Mercy Mubayiwa explains:\n“The coordination was a bit hectic. But we used our network, our membership organizations and benefitted from collaborating with the Zimbabwe Child Rights Coalition which helped us coordinate and connect with new organizations”.\nOne of the most important aims of the campaign was to engage the government in the project and to make officials aware of their responsibility for implementing the new Act.\n“It is quite difficult to get government entities involved when you are planning something to do with shooting video and speaking directly to the public. We succeeded with engaging government officials in the show by using our links with the ministries and the fact that we are working with them on various other projects. We managed to get them on board” Mercy Mubaryiwa proudly highlights.\nEducation for all children in Zimbabwe\nSince the first TV episode aired in December 2020, word of mouth has helped spread news of the Act: “We have received very positive initial feedback from our member organizations and the general public. As the episodes are airing, we have people coming up to us saying: Hey, I have seen you on television!” Programme Manager, Clemence Nhliziyo explains smilingly.\nThe plan now is to broaden the reach of the campaign even more by collaborating with other TV channels and reaching out to stakeholders via YouTube and social media platforms – all to make sure that the new changes get out to everyone.\n“We want to create an advocacy platform and make sure that everyone knows about the Act so that we see the actual changes on the ground. Our goal is, that when you walk into a school and ask about corporal punishment, disability rights or girl’s education following pregnancy, students know their rights and teachers knows how to implement the latest changes”.\nMercy Mubaryiwa takes a pause and adds:\n“At the end of the day what we work towards every single day is getting to a point where every child in Zimbabwe has access to inclusive, quality education. Without limitations and regardless of their economic situation, where they are from in the country or who they are”.\nEducation Amendment Act in Zimbabwe\nThe Act came into force in May 2020.\nIn the process of identifying gaps in the previous Education Act, ECOZI was one of the lead organizations representing civil society in proposing relevant amendments to the previous Act.\nThe Act secures a long list of rights for pupils and protects marginalized groups in the education system which were not included in the previous Education Act. This includes protecting children from being suspended excluded, expelled, or discriminated against because of pregnancy, race, gender, religion, and many other circumstances which creates marginalization.\nThe Act has included measures on adult education ensuring that adults who have not completed basic education have the right to access education for free.\nThe Act addresses corporal punishment in schools and prohibits teachers from punishing and mistreating students both physically and psychologically.\nThe Act states that every registered school shall provide infrastructure and resources suitable to use for students with disabilities.","Donors are considering a proposal for a new “innovative finance mechanism” to increase funding for education, based on recommendations from Gordon Brown’s Education Commission. We agree that we need to finance an expansion of education in the developing world. But sadly, the International Finance Facility for Education (IFFEd) proposal is too good to be true. Using donor guarantees to increase lending by multilateral banks could increase the supply of loans—but there are simpler ways to do that without setting up a new facility.\nA more pressing problem seems to be the low demand for finance for education. Reducing the price of borrowing might help at the margin, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. The problem seems to be that while investment in education produces big social returns, these are not thought likely to produce sufficient fiscal returns to repay loans on a realistic timescale. To increase demand for education finance, donors could have more impact by monetizing the social returns—for example, by promising to pay for outcomes. This would increase education finance, and respect country ownership, while reducing the risk for donors that they might otherwise be financing ineffective programmes.\nThe Education Commission, chaired by Gordon Brown, UN Special Envoy for Global Education, makes a strong case for why more money is needed for education. As common sense suggests, education enriches lives, increases incomes, and builds societies. This intuition is embodied in the new World Bank Human Capital Index, which relates education and health to incomes. But, as the Education Commission has highlighted, we have a learning crisis across the developing world. Learning standards in low income countries are 100 years behind high-income countries. The Commission projects that it will take until the year 2100 for all countries to reach the global goals for education and for all children to complete primary and secondary education.\nDespite this pressing need, support for education has not kept pace with other international aid spending (such as global health). Nor has domestic spending been sufficient to fill the gap.\nWhy is demand for education finance so low? Three reasons:\n- First, returns to education investment are long-term. Though learning outcomes can be achieved in the medium term, benefits for the economy and society materialize later, as the educated cohort become adults and join the labour force. Governments with politically-shaped time-horizons may not place much weight on those future benefits, and may not be inclined to borrow money to invest in achieving them.\n- Second, the fiscal returns may not fully reflect the broader benefits to society of education—and it is fiscal returns that are needed to repay government debts. In countries in which growth is constrained by many factors, and with a relatively small formal sector to tax, the impact on public finances of better educational outcomes could be less than is needed to repay the debt. This can be a problem which constrains investment in social sectors generally, not just education.\n- Third, spending more money on education will not necessarily generate the desired outcomes. The premise of the Education Commission report appears to be that the learning crisis is caused by a financing gap (the size of which they have calculated based on assumptions about the costs of providing education). But we don’t have much evidence that a big increase in spending is going to generate the learning outcomes (and there is some evidence to the contrary). One reason that finance ministers may not be allocating money to education is that they have a hunch that this won’t solve the deeper, more structural problems that are stopping education systems from working well. (Arguably, finance seems to be more of a constraint in health systems than for education systems.)\nThis disincentive for borrowing for social spending is why developing countries prefer to finance health and education using their own tax revenues and grants from global funds rather than loans from the multilateral development banks. Among the background papers the Education Commission commissioned in 2016 was an ODI report on this very issue, supported by a survey of World Bank borrowers and country directors. The second highest reason given for a reluctance to borrow for education was the lack of offsetting fiscal or fee revenues. The top reason (in terms of a large majority either agreeing or strongly agreeing) was that, “there is overwhelming competition for limited (MDB loans), especially from sectors with a clearer cash flow” (italics added), which is another way of framing the same concern. This suggests that even if there was a way to increase the supply of loans for education, there would still be a constraint on the demand side.\nIt is good news that many countries are becoming rich enough to graduate from concessional lending to borrowing at commercial rates. As their cost of borrowing increases, and with the risk of another debt crisis hovering over the developing world, it is not surprising that governments are reluctant to borrow for investments with uncertain fiscal returns, including social spending such as education and health. That’s a problem on the demand side, which a proposal to increase the supply of finance seems unlikely to dent.\nAid for education has fallen as a share of total aid, and education aid has been somewhat flat in real terms since about 2009 (though as the graph below shows, it was at an all-time high in 2016). The relative decline of education as a share of aid is surprising, since education is typically a politically popular cause for aid donors. One possible interpretation is that donors feel more confident that spending on health will produce demonstrable results, whereas it is less clear that pushing more money into flawed education systems will fix them. It is certain that as education systems improve and grow they will need more finance from somewhere; it is far less certain that providing that finance will cause them to improve.\nSource: UNESCO, 2018\nWhat would the International Finance Facility for Education do?\nTo address this challenge, the Education Commission first recommended the International Finance Facility for Education (IFFEd) in its September 2016 report, The Learning Generation.\nIt is an ingenious idea. Donor countries would issue guarantees worth about $2 billion to IFFEd. (In many countries, according to the prospectus, these guarantees would not count as public spending, at least not until or unless they are called). Based on these guarantees, IFFEd would make a capital-like instrument available to multilateral banks, provided that the banks leverage this capital with additional borrowing in the market, and use the extra lending capacity for “new and additional” education loans. This would enable the banks to increase their lending by about $8 billion while remaining within the risk appetite prescribed by their shareholders. The Commission envisages that this additional lending for education will be blended with new grant funding (they also expect this to be $2 billion). This grant funding would be used to soften the terms of the $8 billion of loans. So an extra $8 billion of concessional education lending would be generated by $2 billion of donor grants, plus $2 billion of donor guarantees which might or might not ever be called. This blending of grant finance with loans, and a switch from commercial loans to borrowing at lower rates from MDBs, would reduce the overall cost of loans for borrowers. The result will be an increase in the supply of MDB lending, earmarked for education, at a lower price than commercial borrowing or other MDB loans.\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Five possibilities:\nFirst, if the problem is the reluctance of developing countries to borrow for social investments which do not directly generate revenues to service the loans, then increasing the supply of loans from MDBs, albeit at a lower price than commercial loans, is not the answer. The proponents argue that the lower price may encourage a bit more demand. That’s true, but it doesn’t address the underlying disincentive to borrowing for education: the loan will still have to be repaid, even if it is at lower interest rates. (Of course, given enough funding, grants can also be used to retire or “buy back” the loans entirely, at a net present value cost which can be significantly below face value, but this is not the main thrust of IFFEd.)\nSecond, there is a non-trivial risk of a new debt crisis, in which many developing countries will face debt burdens they cannot service. If this happens, donors will once again have to bail out the international financial institutions who have made bad loans. As far as we know, it has not yet been decided whether IFFEd resources will be first in line to bear any losses, or whether it will be on an equal footing with other capital. If IFFEd bears the first loss, then donors that have issued guarantees to IFFEd for the MDBs’ existing loans would quickly find they have to pay out; and other donors will, at first, free-ride on debt relief provided by IFFEd contributors. (If the IFFEd capital is on a par with other shareholders, then in effect IFFEd is equivalent to an injection of callable capital to the MDBs, but with conditions on how the capital is used and, potentially, less leverage than a normal capital injection.)\nThird, the mechanism does not automatically drive funding towards successfully implemented education programmes. It pushes money through the MDBs—whose staff may indeed be better placed than most to make a hard-nosed assessment of the likelihood of success. But it does not envisage a significantly new performance-based allocation of finance.\nFourth, there is already a mechanism to increase the lending capacity of multilateral development banks: increase their capital. MDBs can borrow from capital markets because they are backed by donors through a combination of “paid in capital” (which is about 5-10 percent of MDB capital) and “callable capital” (the other 90-ish percent) which the donor guarantees to provide if the bank’s resources are exhausted. So far, no MDB has ever had to draw on its callable capital. If the IFFEd capital has the same seniority as the other capital subscriptions, then it is financially the same as a group of donors increasing their callable capital, but without the usual discussions of burden sharing. .\nFifth, if donors are willing to generate additional resources for lending or grants to developing countries, it is not clear why we should restrict this additional funding to education. Why not do the same for job creation, family planning, or access to energy? There is a general consensus that aid is most effective when countries determine their own priorities, rather than when support is conditional on countries responding to donor conditions and preferences. By making a capital increase for multilateral banks conditional on future loans being available for particular purposes, IFFEd would set an awful precedent that could easily lead to an accumulation of earmarks and conditions for future multilateral lending that would greatly undermine the principle of country ownership—as they have in the earmarked trust funds. It is not at all clear that it is desirable to import these distortions into core balance sheet operations of the multilateral development banks.\nSo, what would be better?\nRecall that education finance may be limited by three factors:\n- long time horizons for at least some of the benefits of education;\n- lack of certainty about fiscal returns; and\n- lack of certainty that more money will result in better education outcomes.\nIt does not seem obvious that increasing the supply of loans for education, albeit more cheaply than commercial borrowing, will do much to address these. If this diagnosis is correct, then the prescription of increasing the supply of loans for education, albeit at rates slightly below commercial borrowing, does not seem likely to succeed.\nMore promising would be a class of approach that addresses these challenges directly: the international community should find a way to turn education outcomes into more immediate fiscal returns.\nA mechanism to monetize education outcomes would make education more investible for governments, because it would also provide quicker fiscal (not just social) returns, and those returns would be quicker and more certain than if the government was waiting for the impact of better education on economic growth. This creates a more immediate financial return for investments in education systems, and in doing so makes it more likely that governments would be willing to invest in education. These could be part-funded through MDB loans, if countries want them, which would then be quickly “bought down” or bought back entirely, by results-based grants. The results-based debt buyout for polio, financed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is a good example of this approach.\nNor would such a mechanism need to repay the full costs of investment in education: if the fiscal benefit of education outcomes could be made a little quicker, a little bigger and a little more predictable, that could be enough to tip the finance minister’s decision towards investing in education. A donor mechanism to improve the fiscal returns to education outcomes could be calibrated to leverage as much additional investment as IFFEd.\nSuch a mechanism should be an attractive way for donors to increase finance for education, because outlays would be dependent on education outcomes actually being achieved. This reduces the risk of donors pumping money in to education systems only to find that lack of finance is not the binding constraint—which seems to be a risk that is holding donors back from increasing finance for education today, as well as holding back finance ministers from taking out loans for the education system.\nThere are several possible ways to monetize education outcomes, including the Education Outcomes Fund, which is also promoted by the Education Commission. This mechanism would reward successful interventions through a pre-agreed price per outcome (for example, number of students sitting an accredited school-leaving exam), using pooled funds from both aid and philanthropists.\nBut the current design of the Education Outcomes Fund is far from ideal: notably because current thinking focuses on providing financing directly to non-state actors. The international community should be agnostic about the mix of state and non-state providers: that’s a decision for the country to make. We should be willing to monetize the social returns to education however the country chooses to deliver them. There is currently no proposal to provide fiscal benefits to governments that enable them to monetize education outcomes.\nThe Education Commission’s proposals for IFFEd and an Education Outcomes Fund are also being met with healthy scepticism about the need to create yet more new financial mechanisms. Ideally these approaches could be pursued by existing vehicles. If the goal is to increase lending by multilateral banks, then an increase in callable capital could be provided directly without creating a new institution. If donors were persuaded that they should provide large-scale outcomes-based funding for education, then they could make use of an existing multilateral grant pool, the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). If GPE does not have the mandate or skills to do this, it would be better to improve it than to set up another parallel fund.\nThe Education Commission’s IFFEd: Right diagnosis, wrong medicine?\nThe Education Commission is right to raise the alarm about the learning crisis, and the lack of funding to address it. But their prescription does not follow from their own diagnosis of the problem. The problem seems to be on the demand side. Governments do not want to borrow for education, for respectable reasons, even more so with an eye to a possible debt crisis. Donors could increase finance for education by creating fiscal returns linked education outcomes, so leveraging their aid to enable more investment in effective education programmes. That is likely to be preferable to creating new financial mechanisms aimed at pushing a bigger volume of loans on unwilling borrowers, irrespective of performance.\nOur purpose is not to undermine the pressure for more effort on education, but rather to nudge well-intended efforts towards better ways of achieving this goal. We understand that the best approaches are not always possible.\nBut our order of preference for financial solutions to this problem, in order of best to worst, would be:\n- Donor commitments to turn the long-term, social benefits of education into shorter term fiscal returns (e.g., through an outcomes window at GPE, a new Outcomes Fund, or in some other way).\n- Donors provide conventional grant funding for education, bilaterally or through existing multilaterals such as GPE.\n- An increase in capital for multilateral banks to enable them to lend more, preferably with fewer conditions than envisaged by IFFEd.\n- A new International Finance Facility for Education."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:41e2faa0-f99d-4114-a90f-b86d21a69fb8>","<urn:uuid:8df89a50-105c-43c4-a287-c8cf26279999>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between clinker and carvel ship construction methods?","answer":"The main difference is in how the hull is constructed: in clinker construction, the planks overlap each other and frames are fitted afterwards, while in carvel construction, frames are shaped first and planks are attached edge-to-edge to create a smooth surface. Clinker was traditional in northern Europe, particularly Scandinavia, while carvel originated in the Mediterranean. Carvel construction proved more suitable for building larger ships and became widely adopted in the 15th century for ocean-going vessels and naval warfare ships.","context":["A new technology: from clinker to carvel\nWhat were these changes in ship technology? They arose out of the differences between the shipbuilding traditions of northern Europe and the Mediterranean. Medieval ships from London, Bruges or Riga would have shared certain technological characteristics and would have looked similar at a distance. On the other hand they were very different in design, construction and appearance from their counterparts from Pisa, Venice or Alexandria.\nThese differences were the result of thousands of years of development in which the people of these two regions devised their distinctive ways of building ships constrained by various social, material and environmental factors.\nAn example of clinker construction drawn by Jon Adams. © University of Southampton, 2016.\nIn the north there were two dominant ways of building ships but both shared an important and recognisable characteristic: their hulls were either partly or entirely built with overlapping planks into which frame timbers were fitted to enhance hull stiffness. The greater and longest-lived tradition of building ships this way originated in Scandinavia and is known as ‘clinker’, from the words clinch or clench, because the nails that fastened the planks together were ‘clenched’ over a rove or washer (see image above).\nIn the Mediterranean a different method had been devised in which it was the frames that were shaped first, the planks being attached to them in a smooth edge to edge layer (see image below). It is because the frames of Mediterranean-built ships made a more or less coherent structure in their own right that this method is sometimes known as ‘skeleton construction’.\nAs well as their hulls, the sails that propelled these ships (the rig) were also different. In the north seagoing ships of the medieval period were propelled by a single large square sail but Mediterranean ships favoured triangular ‘lateen’ sails set fore and aft on one or more masts depending on the size of the ship. Another important difference was that Mediterranean ships had side rudders while those of the north had more efficient stern rudders that were less easily damaged or lost.\nAn example of carvel construction drawn by Jon Adams. © University of Southampton, 2016.\nIn the 1300s an increase in economic activity not only saw a rapid increase in the numbers of ships trading up and down the Atlantic seaboard but also in the numbers of ships from northern waters entering the Mediterranean. This led to fascinating processes of technological exchange in which Italian shipwrights in places such as Pisa and Genoa began to build ships that combined the best features of north and south. Using their frame-based construction they adapted the hull form to carry a centreline, stern rudder. They also set a northern style square sail on a central main mast but retained a lateen sail on a smaller mast towards the stern – the mesan or mizzen mast. Before long a third mast – the foremast – was added and this provided an even better balanced rig, greater manoeuvrability and in some situations more speed. It was this rig that we still call the classic ‘ship rig’.\nIn their turn, these ships traded north where their qualities were quickly appreciated by merchants and navies alike. The larger ships built in this manner were called ‘carrack’ by the northerners and the smaller ones were ‘carvels’ a term probably derived from the Portuguese ship type ‘caravella’. The word carvel or its equivalent quickly spread throughout 15th century northern Europe and came to refer to any ship built in this frame-led manner irrespective of size. The reason for its appearance in every northern European language at this time is because it was quickly recognised that these ships answered many needs of an increasingly maritime and global world.\nCarvel construction was robust and could incorporate timber of lesser quality than the traditional clinker. It was not only better suited to the building of large ships but carvels were also more suitable for the ways in which ships were now to be used: Long-distance voyaging for transatlantic fishing and whaling, ocean-going trade in ships that were fast, manoeuvrable and defensible and of course for naval warfare.\nIn this last role we see the carvel ship quickly developed into a platform for guns of increasing size as the early nation states vied for power and control. This in essence is what we see in Henry VIII’s Mary Rose, The Scottish Great Michael, the Swedish Mars, and a host of other great ships of the period, capable of exerting terrifying power through the muzzles of their guns but also of projecting the dynastic power, status and prestige of their renaissance rulers.\n© University of Southampton, 2016","Clinker boat traditions\nBuilding clinker boats is an ancient technique in the Nordic shipbuilding tradition. The old technology is still in use along parts of the Swedish coast, especially for smaller boats, such as the types called ekor, snipor, and jullar.\nGeographical location: All of Sweden\nClinker-built means that the edges of hull planks overlap each other and that they are held together along the overlapping edge, called the lands. The base of the boat consists of the keel or bottom platform with stems, to which the planks are attached. The frames are adapted to the shape of the boat and are held to the planks either with wooden pins (called treenails) or with nails of iron (later also copper). To prevent leakage, the boat is sealed with natural fiber (often flax) and tar. In earlier centuries, plant fibres such as moss or animal hair were used.\nThe method of fitting in the frames after the planking is finished is different from building boats in carvel technique, where the frames are set up on the backbone first, and the planks are attached to them edge to edge, to produce a smooth surface. Clinker boats and even ships were traditionally built without drawings, although in modern times building from drawings has become more common. Boatbuilders used sticks, string and levels or other simple tools to check the hull for symmetry, and could design some components using geometrical methods, such as arcs of circles.\nClinker construction is an historically dominant tradition in Scandinavian boatbuilding, and is usually thought to have originated in the region, although there are boatbuilding traditions using overlapping planks elsewhere in the world, including India and Vietnam.\nThe oldest clinker-built vessel found in Sweden is the Äskekärr ship. It was found in an area which proved to be an old shipyard in Ale municipality just outside Gothenburg. The ship, which is sixteen meters long, has been dated to c. 930 AD. It was built in oak, with caulking in wool and resin, and had been in use for many years, to judge by all the repairs. The Äskekärr ship, a so-called knarr, was a merchant ship propelled by sail. Since the ship was repaired with a piece of wood from much farther south, it is believed to have sailed to the continent. Measurements have been made and a full-scale copy, named Vidfamne, was built in the 1990s. Two more ships from the later Viking period have since been found just south of Varberg, of which one, a merchant ship, was about 15 meters long.\nHowever, most clinker-built vessels were smaller working craft used in fishing, hunting and livestock farming. The boats are found everywhere in the Nordic countries, with different features in terms of length, width and depth. All of the earliest known examples are double-ended, with stems at both ends, and this tradition is still strong. A few later exceptions are the eka and julle, which have transom sterns, as do several types of flat-bottomed craft, such as dories, which can be built either double-ended or with a narrow transom. Clinker-built boats with transoms appeared first mainly on the Baltic coast, but gradually spread throughout Sweden.\nSmaller clinker-built boats - generally referred to as allmogebåtar (vernacular boats) - are found in a range of variations depending on how and where in Sweden they were used. The choice of building materials is also different in different parts of the country. On the west coast, for example, oak is a much more common building material than on the east coast, where the boats are usually built in pine.\nMany older boat types are still found in lakes and streams in central and northern Sweden. For example, Dalarna's church boat has striking similarities to Viking boats in its long and narrow form, the use of wide planks, and high stems. In Dalarna, boats have been built as a commercial enterprise for many years, so that this type has spread to other areas.\nThe julle built in the Swedish region of Bohuslän is traditionally made of pine planks on oak frames and primarily used for fishing. Smaller jullar four to five metres long could be sailed or rowed and were usually undecked. Larger jullar could have decks and even coamings. The form and size of the julle changed somewhat with the introduction of engines in the early 20th century.\nAnother common type in Bohuslän in the 19th century was a larger, decked boat called a drivgarnsbåt, originally used for fishing. These boats later became popular for sport and leisure, and came to be called koster. They were built all along the west coast, but mainly at Orust and Gothenburg. Several of these boats are still in use, some on Lake Mälaren.\nClinker boats were built mainly by local craftsmen, and the knowledge was passed on orally, often from father to son. The customer usually supplied both the timber and the building location. The boats were built with a simple kit of hand tools.\nPassing on knowledge\nThe old techniques are still used in parts of Sweden for the construction and maintenance of smaller boats. Although theoretical and practical woodworking education is of great importance for the preservation and transmission of knowledge, the core of the learning process lies in practice. Important skills include the choice of material, the knowledge of which part of the tree will work best as a stem or frame, and how to saw the timber to give planks the maximum strength. The skills to build and renovate a clinker-built boat are essential within the maritime historical arena for keeping vernacular craft and sailing cultural heritage alive.\nThere are a few high schools and vocational schools in Sweden which have education programmes in boatbuilding. These include instruction in tool and machine knowledge, how to read drawings, wood technology, and an introduction to shape and construction.\nPreservation is today largely in the hands of non-profit organizations, not least the associations which maintain wooden vernacular craft and pass on the knowledge of how to maintain and sail them. However, major repairs, such as replacement of planking and caulking, usually have to be undertaken by people with professional experience, a skill set which is at risk of disappearing as the number of traditional boats decreases.\nConstruction and renovation of clinker-built boats takes place at Nyhamns Såg & Båtbyggeri in Nyhamnsläge. Comprehensive documentation is part of the process, and the shipyard also holds a collection of some of Skåne's oldest preserved working boats. A number of independent craftsmen in the region are also involved in operations.\nOn Holmön near Umeå there are several active boatbuilders. Activities are connected to the local boat museum, and in addition to a collection of older clinker working craft there is a teaching workshop. Boats are sometimes built in the Viking tradition, without drawings or moulds. Knowledge is passed on from older boatbuilders to younger. The boat museum’s teachers are promoting and carrying on the island’s traditional boatbuilding techniques.\nLinks and litterature\nAdams, J. 2003.

{"question":"What are the main similarities between Marcus Crisis Prevention Program (MCPP) and ABA therapy in managing behavioral issues?","answer":"Both MCPP and ABA therapy focus on managing and treating behavioral issues using evidence-based approaches. MCPP provides training on safely de-escalating and managing individuals when they become aggressive or destructive, particularly in individuals with autism. Similarly, ABA therapy uses data-supported techniques to increase and decrease behaviors that are meaningful to the client and their social environment. Both approaches emphasize the importance of defining behavior in objective terms and examining the relationship between behavior and its controlling variables. They also focus on treating complex problem behaviors through systematic assessment and intervention strategies.","context":["Behavioral Clinical Practitioner\nSeth Clark, MA, BCBA, has more than 12 years of experience in the assessment, management and treatment of severe problem behavior. As a part of the Severe Behavior Program team, he currently oversees the Marcus Crisis Prevention Program (MCPP) and is the co-creator of the MCPP system. The goal of MCPP is to provide quality training that focuses on training teachers, staff, providers and clinicians on how to safely de-escalate and manage individuals when they become aggressive or destructive. Seth has trained staff on MCPP techniques across the United States as well as in Australia, Kazakhstan and South Korea. Moreover, Seth has extensive experience training medical and nursing staff on crisis prevention and management techniques.\nSeth also has in-depth knowledge and experience in the assessment and treatment of severe problem behavior. Seth received his master's degree in applied behavior analysis from University of Maryland, Baltimore County, while also working at the Kennedy Krieger Institute Neurobehavioral Unit. After finishing his degree, Seth worked as a case manager in the Severe Behavior Program at Marcus Autism Center. The Severe Behavior Program is specifically tailored for the assessment and treatment of severe destructive behaviors like self-injury, aggression, property destruction and other dangerous behaviors. The program treats some of the most complex problem behaviors in the state of Georgia. During his time in the Severe Behavior Program, Seth oversaw a wide variety of complex and challenging cases. He also served as a behavior consultant to schools, hospitals, and community-based providers that work with individuals who exhibit severe problem behavior.\nSeth’s current research focuses on the refinement of teaching methods to reduce crisis behavior.

(The Center) is a company created in 2007 to meet the needs of families who have children with autism. Our mission is to provide the best possible services for children with autism spectrum disorders using methods and procedures that have been proven effective through research and real world application. The Center provides highly trained Behavioral Treatment Therapist (Senior) and Behavioral Treatment Technicians (Line staff), all of whom are supervised by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) Licensed Supervisor.\nWhat services does The Center provide?\nThe Center provides Applied Behavior Analytic (ABA) therapy services with emphasis on Skinner’s analysis of verbal behavior to children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. ABA therapy services include Intensive and Non-Intensive services funded through private insurance, and Comprehensive and Focused services funded through ForwardHealth/Medicaid. The Center also provides specially designed Social Opportunities, Consultative Services, Individualized Workshops, and Specialized Trainings including Toilet Training.\nThe Center also provides individualized workshops and trainings for schools, families, and other agencies.\nWhat is ABA?\nApplied Behavior Analysis is the science of studying behavior and applying data-supported techniques to increase and/or decrease behaviors that are meaningful to the client and the client’s social environment. The field of ABA seeks to:\nØ Define behavior in objective and measurable terms\nØ Examine the relationship between a behavior and its controlling variables\nØ Analyze socially significant behaviors that are in need of improvement\nØ Study behavior through a three-term contingency\nWhy do we use ABA?\nØ ABA-based approaches for educating children with autism and related disorders have been extensively researched and empirically supported.\nØ Application of behavior analytic strategies for treatment of children with autism is the most highly documented effective treatment.\nØ The Surgeon General of the United States of America noted that thirty years of research demonstrated the efficacy of applied behavioral methods in reducing inappropriate behavior and in increasing communication, learning, and appropriate social behavior in children with autism.\nØ The following agencies state that ABA-based procedures represent best practices for individuals with autism and mental retardation (Hagopian and Boelter, 2006):\no National Institute of Mental Health\no National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\no National Academy of Sciences (Committee on Educational Interventions for Children with Autism)\no American Psychological Association (Division 33; “Guidelines on Effective Behavioral Treatment for Persons with Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities”)\no Association for Science in the Treatment of Autism\no California Department of Developmental Services\no Florida State Department of Children and Families\no Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities\nØ Current research demonstrates that eclectic approaches are less effective. Several studies (Ditza Zachor and colleagues, 2005; Svein, Eikeseth and colleagues, 2002; Janet Howard and colleagues, 2005) compared the use of ABA-based procedures to ‘‘eclectic’’ treatment. At follow-up, the children receiving the non-eclectic Applied Behavior Analysis program scored higher and had made more progress than the children in the other groups in areas of language, communication, social skills, independence, and reduction of problem behaviors.\nWhat is verbal behavior programming?\nVerbal behavior programming places focus on the principles of ABA and uses proven teaching procedures within the field of ABA based on:\nØ B.F. Skinner’s Verbal Behavior as a guide to the classification of language\nØ The application of Skinner’s work by Michael, Sundberg, Partington, Carbone, McGreevy, and others\nØ The following conceptual frameworks:\no Functional Assessment: Treatment of problem behavior is based on identifying the causes and consequences of behavior. By looking at what happens before and after a child demonstrates a behavior, it is possible to understand why a behavior continues to occur and to develop a plan to change the situation and thereby change the behavior.\no Motivative Operations: Careful attention is given to the environmental situations and actions of others that encourage or discourage a child in his or her learning and behavior.\no Matching Theory: The child’s learning is our responsibility, and we need to use teaching methods that promote cooperation and learning so that the child enjoys learning and wants to stay in the teaching environment with us.\no Functional Communication Training: Emphasis is placed on teaching the child to communicate effectively in his or her environment.\nWhat is the ABLLS? What is the ABLLS-R?\nThe ABLLS is The Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills developed by Mark Sundberg and Jim Partington. It has been revised by Jim Partington and is called the ABLLS-Revised. The ABLLS/ABLLS-R is an Assessment, Curriculum Guide, and Skills Tracking System that:\nØ Assesses child’s level in 25 different areas\nØ Documents progress\nØ Aids in development of treatment goals\nHow does verbal behavior programming differ from “Lovaas Therapy”?\nØ Training is initiated by teaching functional communication-requesting (manding)\nØ Early skills are taught in natural settings (natural environment training)\nØ The following teaching procedures are utilized:\n1. Pair teaching environments with reinforcement (make them fun)\n2. Start with easy responses\n3. Use errorless teaching (reduce the number of errors the child makes when learning)\n4. Intersperse easy and difficult responses\n5. Work quickly\n6. Mix and vary responses\n7. Teach until fluent (the child can perform quickly and correctly)\nHow many hours a week will I have therapists in my home? How is the therapy time divided?\nThe Center’s goal is to maximize direct intervention hours while maintaining quality supervision. A clinical recommendation is made by the lead therapist regarding the appropriate number of treatment hours for each child.\nEach therapy shift will typically last 2-3 hours. This time is divided between teaching around the house (natural environment training-NET), structured teaching (intensive table teaching-ITT), and community practice. During each shift, the therapist will also need time to review notes, set up the teaching environments, and document progress toward goals.\nWhat information do I need to provide to the Center?\nIn order to be able to secure authorization for your child’s treatment, The Center requires the following documentation:\nØ The most recent diagnostic report for you child and any other previous diagnostic reports.\nØ Results of age-normed, standardized testing of your child’s cognitive ability, language skills, and adaptive skills. This testing may have been conducted as part of your child’s diagnostic evaluation or a part of an IEP or IFSP evaluation.\nØ Current IFSP (birth-3) or IEP (school)\nPrescription for treatment from your pediatrician and medical evaluation that has occurred within the last 12 months. The prescriber must be a Medicaid provider. The Center will provide the forms for these requirements.\nEveryone coming into my home has a different title. What do these all mean?\nEach child in the program will receive the services of the Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) Licensed Supervisor, a Behavioral Treatment Therapist (Senior), and 2-5 Behavioral Treatment Technicians (Line Staff).\nThe Licensed Supervisor consults to you and the team, directs treatment, assists in the development of goals, assesses and tracks progress, helps the team problem solve and refine direction and approach, and maintains accountability. The Licensed Supervisor confers with the Treatment therapist at least weekly and works with the child, treatment therapist, and one or more treatment technicians at least every two months.\nThe Treatment Therapist is an extension of the Licensed Supervisor and works with your child, family, and other team members 2-5 hours per week. The Treatment Therapist conducts the ABLLS/ABLLS-R Assessment, develops and implements a treatment plan, establishes and maintains the treatment book,\nassists with scheduling, assists in the development and maintenance of house rules, facilitates team meeting, tracks progress, and serves as communication liaison between parents and The Center’s staff.\nTreatment technicians are trained and directly supervised by the Licensed Supervisor and Treatment Therapist. They will provide the bulk of your child’s treatment hours. Treatment technicians implement therapy protocols as directed by the Licensed Supervisor and Treatment Therapist and document progress toward those goals.\nWhat can I expect from an intensive in home program?\nØ This work will be time consuming.\nØ I will be an active participant in my child’s growth.\nØ My child may have therapy for up to 40 total hours a week.\nØ I may need to prioritize my child’s treatment.\nØ Initially, therapists will spend time on fun activities with my child with very few teaching trials (pairing).\nØ My child will improve his ability to communicate.\nØ My child may sometimes cry.\nØ I will learn ways to respond to my child’s problem behavior.\nØ Sometimes I will need to confront behaviors rather than avoid them.\nØ A lot of people will be in my house.\nØ Therapists will be working with my child at a table and around the house and yard.\nØ There will be community outings involving therapists, my child, and me.\nØ Despite the best laid plans, people cancel.\nØ Progress takes documentation.\nØ I will be expected to follow through on behavior intervention plans, self-help skills, contriving opportunities to request, etc.\nØ My child will be more independent in daily routines.\nØ My child may not “recover” in three years.\nØ My child will learn.\nØ I am my child’s most important teacher."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0c69caa8-fea5-448b-b34b-797b92de7449>","<urn:uuid:51395f7d-c83c-4b64-9c89-31b52a4fb189>"],"error":null}

Relevant solutions could include remote monitoring for landscape-scale intelligence, modelling carbon sequestration linked to land management and spectral devices.\"\n- Biodiversity: Biodiversity and climate are two sides of the same coin and biodiversity is vital to mitigating and adapting to climate change.\n\"It is vital that biodiversity measuring also improves so it’s possible to track the types and changes in biodiversity throughout time. Relevant solutions could include camera trapping, co-operative models working with smallholder farmers and on farm or remote data collection practices.\"\nDiageo’s Global Sustainability Director, Kirstie McIntyre, said: “Even under the 1.5c trajectory called for by the Paris Agreement, farmers in the southern hemisphere will need help to adapt to climate change. Our next Diageo Sustainable Solutions round will create action for innovators around the world to help save lives and livelihoods in the countries and communities that are most at risk.”\nJohn Cant, Head of Diageo Sustainable Solutions, added: “Globally, we have unpredictable weather with increasing droughts and floods and a gap in our agriculture monitoring capabilities. Soil moisture monitoring must be improved so we can look at where we can improve soil water holding capacity, supporting our farmers to maintain a steady farming cycle and income.”\nFor more information and to apply, visit https://dss.diageo.com/","SHV Energy has joined the KLM Corporate BioFuel Programme (KCBP). In so doing, SHV Energy will reduce its headquarters’ CO2 emissions by 50%. Additionally, the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) has extended its participation in KCBP for a further two-year period. TU Delft first joined the programme on 1 July 2017.\n“Participation in the KLM Corporate Biofuel Programme underscores SHV Energy’s strategic decision to actively contribute to the development and production of sustainable energy products. Within that context we are also investing in the first European facility for sustainable aviation fuel and bioLPG in Delfzijl, jointly announced with SkyNRG and KLM earlier this year.” – Bram Gräber, CEO SHV Energy\n“TU Delft is steadfastly committed to finding sustainable solutions for aviation, largely in cooperation with KLM in different fields from sustainable aviation fuel to aircraft design. By participating in the KLM Corporate Biofuel Programme, we can contribute towards making it possible to use sustainable innovations in practice. In 2018, our contribution effectively reduced CO2 emissions for our flights by 19%. In this manner, we are proud to be building a sustainable future, arm in arm with KLM and SkyNRG.” – Rob Mudde, Vice Rector Magnificus/Vice Chairman TU Delft\n“Thanks to the parties participating in the KLM Corporate BioFuel Programme, including SHV Energy and TU Delft, it will be possible to achieve enormous progress in terms of developing the market for sustainable aviation fuel. What’s more, these two organisations also cooperate with KLM in different areas of sustainability, respectively building Europe’s first production plant for sustainable aviation fuel in Delfzijl and developing a new and innovative energy efficient aircraft concept known as the Flying V.” – Harm Kreulen, Managing Director KLM The Netherlands\nAbout the KLM Corporate BioFuel Programme:\nThe KLM Corporate BioFuel Programme (KCBP) makes it possible for companies to power a share of their flights using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The participants pay a surcharge that covers the difference in price between SAF and traditional jet fuel. In turn, the surcharges are used to purchase SAF.\nBut why is the programme so important?\nDue to insufficient production capacity and concomitant availability of sustainable feedstock, SAF is in short supply. Using SAF could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 85%. KLM is convinced that SAF is important in the short and medium term in order to achieve the airline industry’s envisaged reduction in CO2 emissions. For this reason, KLM, SkyNRG and SHV Energy announced in May this year that they would be joining forces to build the first European SAF production plant in Delfzijl in the Netherlands. By 2022, the plant will be producing 100,000 tonnes of SAF and, as a by-product, 15,000 tonnes of bioLPG a year.\nAbout “Fly Responsibly”:\n“Fly Responsibly” embodies KLM’s commitment to creating a sustainable future for air transport.

{"question":"What is the fundamental difference between cómo los bistatic radars y indoor radar systems handle signal polarization and clutter suppression?","answer":"Bistatic radars primarily deal with clutter through their geometric configuration, where the transmitter and receiver are separated by a distance comparable to the target range. However, this configuration makes them more susceptible to clutter near the baseline. In contrast, indoor radar systems can employ more sophisticated clutter suppression methods, specifically using orthogonal polarization characteristics. This is achieved through a designed transceiver that can transpond electromagnetic waves in vertical polarization only when the received signal is in horizontal polarization, allowing for discrimination between target and clutter through polarization character.","context":["Del Mistro, Mario. A Study of Bistatic Radar and the Development of an Independent Bistatic Radar Receiver. MSc Dissertation. Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Cape Town, 1992.\nThis thesis introduces concepts about bistatic radars, and their history. Geometry and various measurements are also discussed. A documented receiver system built is also available within this thesis.\nThis report contains a literature review of bistatic radar and also describes an experimental L-Band bistatic radar receiver which was built at the University of Cape Town.\nIn a bistatic radar, the transmitter and receiver are separated by an amount which is comparable to the distance to the targets which are being displayed. The separation of the transmitter and receiver cause various parameters to change when comparing the bistatic radar to a monostatic radar. Some of these parameters are listed below.\n- The radar range equation is now a function of RT2RR2 and no longer RM4. The gain of the transmitter and receiver antenna must be taken into account as two different antennas are being used.\n- In a monostatic radar the constant range contours form circles around the collocated transmitter and receiver, whereas in bistatic radar they form ellipses and the transmitter and receiver are the foci of the ellipses.\n- The constant power contours of a monostatic radar are also circles. In a bistatic radar they are ovals surrounding the transmitter and receiver. As the ovals get closer to the line separating the transmitter and receiver (baseline) the ovals collapse and start forming separate circles around the transmitter and receiver.\n- The coverage of a bistatic radar is the area which is illuminated simultaneously by both the transmitter and the receiver. The coverage area can never exceed that of a monostatic radar.\n- The range and cell area resolution degrades as the target approaches the baseline. In order to compete with a monostatic radar very narrow transmit and receive antenna beams are required.\n- Due to the separation of the transmitter and the receiver, a PPI display will be distorted. This distortion is commonly called bistatic distortion.\n- The bistatic radar target cross section (RCS) varies according to target position relative to the transmitter and the receiver. When the target crosses the baseline, its forward RCS is observed. The forward RCS is sometimes 15dB larger than the monostatic reverse RCS. As the target moves further away from the baseline the bistatic RCS starts approximating the monostatic RCS.\n- As the cell area (area of ground illuminated by the transmitter and receiver antenna) of a bistatic radar is larger than that of the monostatic radar near the baseline, the bistatic radar is inherently more susceptible to clutter.\nThe receiver must maintain synchronization in receiver azimuth and PRF, at all times, in order to correct for bistatic distortion on a PPI display. This distortion is corrected by converting the transmitter-to-target azimuth to the receiver-to-target azimuth and determining the target-to-receiver range which is a function of the delay time. The delay time is the time difference between the direct pulse and the reflected pulse. This will cause the trace on the display to move in a complex pattern, hence correcting this distortion.\nA bistatic radar receiver was built for the Electrical Engineering Department at UCT. The purpose of the radar is to monitor aircraft approaching and departing from DF Malan Airport. The motivation for this project is to utilise one of the main advantages of the bistatic radar.","In indoor scenario, radar echoes are interfered by clutter from walls, ceilings, floors, and other indoor objects. Therefore, clutter suppressing is one of the key problems for indoor radar. This paper focuses on the problem of clutter suppressing for a secondary radar system which can be used in indoor localization. A clutter suppressing method based on orthogonal polarization character is presented. The orthogonal polarization character here is achieved by a designed transceiver, which can transpond electromagnetic waves in vertical polarization if and only if the received signal is in horizontal polarization. Thus the newly introduced polarization character can be used to discriminate target from clutter. Clutter is suppressed after calculating scattering similarity parameters via Pauli decomposition. Simulations and an experiment are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method. Compared with previous methods, the proposed method can distinguish stationary target with both static and varying clutters. Therefore, it is more practical for applications.\n\"Clutter Suppression for Cooperative Radar Based on Orthogonal Polarization Character,\" Progress In Electromagnetics Research C,\nVol. 87, 227-240, 2018. doi:10.2528/PIERC18081801\n1.

{"question":"What are the typical signs that indicate a rescue team has spotted someone in distress?","answer":"When rescue teams spot someone in distress, they use specific signals to communicate this. A ship might sound its horn or use a searchlight to signal. Light aircraft typically raise and lower their wings in a rocking motion to indicate they've spotted someone. If they leave the area after signaling, it might mean they need to refuel or are summoning a helicopter for rescue.","context":["Rescue and Recovery\nIn most survival and search and rescue situations where it has been reported that people are missing, the situation is usually resolved within 48 hours. This is because of the training, capabilities and the responsiveness of professional search and rescue teams. However, in order that a survival situation can reach a happy outcome in as short a timescale possible, survivors themselves also have to be aware of their responsibilities both before and during a rescue and recovery situation in order that they are fully prepared for a rescue attempt.\nSignalling PreparationSignalling is dealt with in more depth in another article contained on this website but it’s crucial that you know how to signal for help correctly and to do so in the most appropriate location. That means that as soon as you have got the basic priorities of survival covered, you need to evaluate the environment surrounding you and look for possible landing zones, drop zones or suitable places in which boats can moor up or at least get close to you. In fact, once your basic survival needs are met, you may even wish to relocate your position to a nearby but more suitable place for a rescue attempt if it is practical for you to do so, before you start attempting to signal for help. However, you need to weigh this up against any information you have left with people back home as if you have told them your destination and you stray too far from it, your rescuers may not know where to look as they will tend to start searching from your last known position and then work outwards from there.\nHow You Can Tell You’ve Been SpottedUnless you’re the sort of person who comes fully ‘tooled-up’ and you have an emergency radio on you, rescuers are only too aware that most people facing a survival situation have no means of direct communication with their rescuers but there are some signs which they can give to let you know that you’ve been spotted and that help is at hand. A ship might sounds its horn or might be able to use a searchlight or some similar device to send you a signal to let you know they’ve seen you and a light aircraft will usually raise and lower its wings in a kind of rocking motion. This is an indication that they have spotted you and you shouldn’t panic if they then leave the area. This might simply mean that they are low in fuel and need to refuel or it may mean they are summoning help from a helicopter to complete the rescue mission, so you should not give up hope and should simply stay put.\nPreparing for the Rescue AttemptIn the event of a rescue attempt being made by a helicopter or light aircraft, you need to ensure that anything that you have lying on the ground which could get sucked up by the rotor blades or inside an aircraft engine are removed out of harm’s way. This might include tents, tarps, ropes, blankets etc. You also need to keep a safe distance from any landing area if you’ve been told that the aircraft is going to land.\nStaying Calm and the Importance of Following OrdersMany people who have never faced a survival, rescue and recovery situation before often make the fatal error of thinking that once a rescue team has spotted them, then it’s all a matter of ‘plain sailing’. However, you would be foolish to think this and many rescue attempts have had to be aborted due to the inability of those being rescued to follow instructions carefully and, in some cases, not following instructions given by the rescue teams has resulted in death.\nTake a helicopter, for example. It’s not always as simple as the chopper landing on an open patch of ground and then all the survivors simply clambering into it. Depending on the terrain and environment, a helicopter might have to use a horse collar, a winch, a basket or even a rope to lift you from the ground. And, if you don’t follow instructions to the letter which the crew will give you prior to the rescue attempt, it could end up being disastrous. Neither should you panic. Despite your relief, it’s important that you remain as calm as possible and follow any instructions to the letter. After all, the rescue crews do this for a living and are highly professional and well-trained. By ignoring their instructions, you are placing yourself at risk of severe injury or even possibly death. This is as equally as important if a boat or ship is providing the rescue – simply pay heed to the instructions which you might be given. People have even got as close to safety as a rescue craft’s doors but have still been lost due to their inability to follow instructions or through panic or impatience.\nIf some device is being used to bring you into an air or sea craft, do not let go of the device even though you think you might be safe. Always wait for a rescue technician to remove you from the device. A split second too soon can mean the difference between survival and death.\nBy using common sense, understanding the mechanisms of how a rescue and recovery takes place, preparing for the rescue and following instructions from the rescue crew, you’ll be able to complete the final stage of survival - the rescue and recovery stage which is often the most challenging and difficult."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:84b12e47-63af-4965-8b85-56c0dad8a728>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the procedures and monitoring requirements compare between egg donation cycles and IVF treatment for women over 40?","answer":"For egg donors, the process involves about two weeks of daily early morning monitoring visits (15-20 minutes) for blood tests and ultrasounds, followed by an egg retrieval procedure under sedation that takes about 20 minutes with 45-60 minutes recovery time. Donors receive injectable fertility medications to stimulate multiple egg development. For women over 40 doing IVF, the monitoring and procedures are similar, but additional considerations are needed - some clinics recommend earlier egg retrieval timing since eggs may mature too quickly, and supplementation with DHEA may be advised to improve egg quality and quantity. Both groups need to make lifestyle changes, but women over 40 are particularly advised to quit smoking, maintain healthy weight, exercise regularly, and seek treatment at specialty clinics with higher success rates for their age group.","context":["1. Complete our Questionnaire\nYour first step as an egg donor at Weill Cornell Medicine is to fill out our secure questionnaire. You will be invited for a consultation if the questionnaire shows that you are a good candidate for donation.\n2. Consultation and Screening\nThe initial visit includes a physical examination, psychological testing, blood tests, and genetic screening. We will answer questions and discuss side effects and risks. Once you are approved as a donor, we will match you to a family and set a date that is convenient for you to begin the egg donation cycle. Usually the actual donation cycle is about a month after the consultation.\n3. Donation Cycle (about two weeks)\nA. Follicular Development\nWe try to obtain multiple eggs to increase the chance of success with egg donation. You will be treated with injectable fertility medications that stimulate the development of a number of eggs. These medications have been used for over 20 years and are the same drugs used by infertile women undergoing IVF. You will receive these medications free of charge, along with detailed information and instructions. We will teach you to give yourself the injections--and it's not as hard as you might think.\nB. Monitoring Your Cycle\nThe donation cycle usually takes about two weeks. During those two weeks, you will need to make daily early morning visits to Weill Cornell Medicine for blood tests and ultrasounds.\nThese visits last less than 20 minutes (usually only 15 minutes), and are scheduled between 7:00 AM and 8:30 AM. This daily monitoring allows us to adjust the dose of medication that you take each day and is important for your safety as well as the success of the program.\nC. Egg Retrieval\nAt a certain time (usually 7 to 12 days after you start injections), your eggs will be ready to be retrieved. On the day of the retrieval, you must cancel your usual activities — work, school and social activities — so that you can have the procedure and then rest and recover afterwards. You will sleep during the procedure (an anesthesiologist will give you IV sedation), and you will not feel pain.\nThe procedure takes about 20 minutes. The doctor doing the retrieval uses ultrasound to see exactly where the eggs are. He or she uses a small needle, directed by the ultrasound, to take the eggs from the ovary. There are no incisions or stitches involved. After the procedure is complete, you will be taken to the general recovery room for approximately 45-60 minutes. Because you will have received IV sedation, you will need a friend or family member to escort you home.\nD. After Egg Donation\nDuring the cycle, you may experience mild side effects including tenderness in the breasts or ovaries, fluid retention, and moodiness. After the retrieval, these can take up to two weeks to disappear completely.\nAs with any procedure, there are risks to egg donation. Serious risks are rare and include hyperstimulation syndrome, ovarian torsion (twisting), infection, and bleeding. These will be discussed in detail during your consultation with the physician.\nOccasionally donors experience ambivalence or uncertainty during or after the cycle. Our psychologists are available at any time to offer emotional support. Most donors, however, experience personal satisfaction from the donation process.","For many, the possibility of getting pregnant after a certain age seems unattainable. However, pregnancy after 40 is possible for some women, whether naturally or assisted with a treatment like IVF. The IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs do drop pretty significantly, but success shouldn’t be ruled out entirely.\n- What factors affect IVF success rates over 40?\n- Donor Eggs vs Own Eggs & IVF Success Rates Over 40\n- How to Increase IVF Success Rates Over 40\n- IVF Success Rate Over 40 with Own Eggs by Clinic\nWhat factors affect IVF success rates over 40?\nWomen 40 and over encounter lower success rates in regards to all fertility treatments, including IVF. In short, IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs significantly different from success rates under 40. However, certain factors change the success rates.\nOver the age of 40, birth rates steadily and rapidly decline, on average. To put things in perspective, in 2014, the live birth rate for patients age 40 with own eggs was 16%. At age 43, the live birth rate dropped to 5%. Over 44, the live birth rate dropped further still, to 1%. At the same time, some clinics have much higher rates than these; they are specialty clinics with specific programs for this age group.\nWhat makes IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs lower than average?\nMany people ask questions related to why IVF success rates over 40 are lower than the success rates for younger women. To answer them, we have to consider what makes IVF successful in the first place.\nIVF success with own eggs depends on fairly good numbers of healthy, viable eggs. In other words, both egg quality and egg quantity matter. As women age, both of those factors get impacted. Fewer eggs develop, and of them, fewer eggs are of excellent quality.\nAccording to some experts, one of the primary ways age impacts egg quality relates to chromosomes. Eggs with an abnormal number of chromosomes lead to failed IVF transfer. As women age, the potential for an abnormality in chromosomes increases very steadily. “At age 30 about 30% of eggs are chromosomally abnormal. By age 40 about 60% are abnormal and by 44 years old 90% are abnormal.” (Advanced Fertility).\nThus, due to the likelihood of a lack of viable eggs, IVF success rates over 40 with own eggs drop and continue to decline the older a woman gets.\nDonor Eggs vs Own Eggs & IVF Success Rates Over 40\nWhile all of the above information is true regarding own eggs, it isn’t true when it comes to IVF success with donor eggs.\nWomen over 40 who use IVF to become pregnant stand a very good chance of success if they use donor eggs. The live birth rates for women using donor eggs vary only slightly between the ages of 30 and 47. This means that when women over 40 use donor eggs, their chances of success remain largely the same, barring other factors.\nA woman in her 30s using donor eggs has almost the same likelihood of IVF success as a woman in her 40s who uses donor eggs.\nThis information shows even more clearly that the cause of the decline in IVF success rates over 40 is almost solely to do with donor eggs. A woman’s ability to carry and deliver a baby over 40 isn’t much different than a younger woman’s ability. The difference has to do with egg quality and quantity. That’s why fertility specialists recommend IVF with donor eggs when a woman is age 40 or older.\nExperts believe that while the age of the eggs matter, the age of the uterus doesn’t. At least, it has very little to do with IVF success rates over 40 with donor eggs.\nWhen choosing a donor for eggs, women should choose a woman that is younger and with few health issues. IVF success depends so much on healthy, viable eggs, that whoever you choose to donate eggs for the procedure should be in optimal health and age.\nHow to Increase IVF Success Rates Over 40\nSome IVF clinics specialize in IVF after 40 and provide women with tips and information to increase the IVF success rate. They say that are a number of things women and their doctors can do to increase the chance of success.\nChoose Donor Eggs\nTo significantly increase IVF success rates over 40, consider using donor eggs. As previously described, donor eggs from healthy, younger women generally lead to better success. If you remain open to the possibility, your chances of success go up.\nDonor eggs increase the chances of success by upwards of 70 percent in some cases. The difficulty in choosing egg donation lies in the emotional attachment many people have to the dream of a biological child. Choosing donor eggs can be difficult for many people. For those who’ve struggled for many years to conceive, it is sometimes the only option.\nIf a woman is over 42, the likelihood of pregnancy with own eggs sharply declines. Also, note that many IVF clinics limit the age for treatment to 45, after which a patient must choose donor eggs. This is because the chance of success using a woman’s own eggs after 45 is 1% or less.\nConsider Mini IVF Procedures\nSome patients choose Mini-IVF, a procedure which requires a smaller amount of fertility medication and aims to produce one to three viable, healthy eggs. Some experts believe Mini-IVF improves IVF success rates over 40 because mini-IVF results in better-quality eggs and embryos. Regardless, the reduced cost of the treatment can be beneficial.\nSupplement with DHEA\nThough it is not talked about often, DHEA supplementation provides several potential benefits that increase chances of success over 40. Benefits include better and more eggs, higher rates of natural pregnancy, fewer miscarriages, more successful IVF cycles, and a smaller chance of chromosomal abnormality.\nSome IVF clinics suggest that DHEA supplementation could potentially eliminate the need to use donor eggs for some women.\nOpt for Earlier Egg Retrieval\nRetrieving eggs earlier in women over 40 improves the chances of positive outcomes and IVF success rate. Some IVF clinics state that, sometimes, eggs in women mature too quickly. As a result, by the time fertility specialists retrieve the eggs, they are not viable or healthy because they have matured too much. So, the clinic suggests that doctors working with women closely monitor the ovarian cycle in order to better control the timing.\nMake Lifestyle Changes\nSome fertility specialists suggest that making appropriate lifestyle choices improves IVF success over 40 with own eggs or donor eggs. Changes in diet, smoking habits, and weight loss can have an impact. Cutting smoking, for example, dramatically improves odds of success. Women who smoke require twice the number of IVF treatments. Additionally, smokers need to take more fertility drugs than non-smokers and experience more failed implantation cycles.\nSuggested lifestyle habit changes include:\n- Quit smoking at least 3 months before fertility treatment\n- Lose weight, if you are overweight (may increase chances of success)\n- Exercise regularly\n- If you’re underweight, seek help getting to a normal weight range\n- Take supplements\n- Cut excess sugar or unhealthy food out of your diet\nChoose a Specialty IVF Clinic for Over 40\nSuccessful IVF involves choosing a clinic that specializes in pregnancy. These best IVF clinics for over 40 typically have much higher success rates. In all likelihood, the clinic’s team does a good job of screening patients before making IVF attempts. The team probably spends a great deal of time determining which fertility diagnoses have the best possible IVF success rate.\nClinics with older pregnancy specialties are also likely more equipped, and knowledgeable about treatments specific to that age group.\nSome clinics have an IVF success rate of 60% or higher for older women. If a clinic’s success rate in the demographic is very low, keep searching for a clinic with better outcomes. Many reputable clinics publish this information online. If not, you can research it in the IVF success rates table.\nSome clinics specialize in IVF treatments in older women, because the procedures and practices require special attention. Fertility specialists may also recommend certain IVF treatments with higher chances of success in older patients.\nGet Help Sooner\nWomen over 40 who are experiencing fertility challenges need to seek help as soon as possible. Age does matter when it comes to pregnancy. Even if a couple is unsure about whether or not IVF is right for them, sooner is better than later in these cases.\nExperts suggest that after IVF three or four months with no successful pregnancy, you should get a consultation or consider fertility testing. This includes hormone testing for egg equality and potential early menopause.\nSet up a consultation with a high success rate IVF clinic in your area that specializes in pregnancy over 40.\nIVF Success Rate Over 40 with Own Eggs by Clinic\n*The following IVF success rate reports are base on the latest CDC data published in 2019 with 20 or more transfers.\nIVF Success Rates at 41-42 with own eggs (nondonor eggs)\nAverage live births rate at 41-42 with own eggs is 27.9% in total 4,389 IVF transfers.

{"question":"Could you explain how 国内通货膨胀 (domestic inflation) affects sovereign debt crisis? Need quick facts.","answer":"Inflation and sovereign debt crises are directly linked. When inflation occurs, especially through currency or deficit-induced inflation where governments print money to meet budget deficits, it can lead to currency devaluation. This devaluation increases the country's international debt burden since the local currency becomes worth less relative to the debt obligations. When combined with slow economic growth, this can trigger a sovereign debt crisis where the government becomes unable to meet its debt obligations. This situation typically results in loss of investor confidence and can lead to further currency depreciation, creating a negative spiral that can affect the entire economy.","context":["What is Inflation?\n- Inflation is a quantitative rate’s measure at which the average price level of selected goods and services basket in an economy increases over a period of time.\n- It is situation under which there is sustained, unchecked increase in the general price level.\n- It depicts fall in the purchasing power of money.\n- Inflation can be have positive as well as negative consequences like inflation is good for tangible assets but has negative effect on cash holdings.\n- It is estimated as the percentage rate of change in price index over the reference time-period.\n- Currently in India inflation rate is measured with the help of Consumer Price Index- combined (Base year- 2012).\n- Till April 2014, the Inflation rate was measured with the help of WPI (Wholesale Price Index).\n- Rate of Inflation= (Current period price index-Reference period price index)/(Reference Period Price Index)×100\nTypes of Inflation\nBased on Causes\n- Currency inflation: Printing of currency notes causes this type of inflation.\n- Credit inflation: Credit expansion leads to a rise in price level causing inflation.\n- Deficit-induced inflation: When expenditure exceeds revenue, government can ask RBI to print money to meet the budget deficit causing deficit-induced inflation.\n- Demand-Pull inflation: An increase in aggregate demand over the available output leads to a rise in the price level and is called demand-pull inflation.\n- Cost-push inflation: Inflation in an economy may arise from the overall increase in the cost of production and is known as cost-push inflation.\nBased on Speed or Intensity\n- Creeping or Mild Inflation\n- When the speed of upward thrust in prices is slow but small, it is known as creeping inflation.\n- It is helpful for economic development.\n- Price rise at very small rate (<3%).\n- Walking or Trotting Inflation\n- When prices rise moderately and annual inflation rate rises in a single digit, walking inflation occurs.\n- It is the time when government should focus on the issue.\n- Price rise at moderate rate (3% <Inflation< 10%)\n- Galloping and Hyperinflation:\n- When creeping and walking inflation are left unchecked, the rate of inflation will rise above 10% and termed as galloping inflation.\n- This leads to instability of the economy.\n- Hyperinflation is when the prices of goods and services rise more than 50% per month.\n- It is the last stage of inflation.\n- Examples: Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe in the 2000s, American Civil War and Venezuela in 2018.\n- Price rise at very high rate (20% < Inflation < 100%)\n- It is a situation in which the inflation rate is high, economic growth rate slows, and unemployment remains steadily high.\n- It is also known as recession inflation.\n- It is dilemma for economic policy, since actions intended to lower inflation may worsen unemployment situation.\n- Core Inflation\n- Price rise in all goods and services except food and energy due to high prices fluctuations is core inflation.\n- It is calculated as government needs a stable and true picture of inflation.\n- Headline Inflation\n- This measure considers total inflation in an economy, including food and energy prices, which are more volatile.\nCauses of Inflation\nRising prices are the root of inflation. However, it can be classified into three types:\n- Demand Pull factors: These are the set of factors due to which there may be an increase in the demand for goods and services in an economy. Its example include:\n- Increase in government expenditure putting more money in the hands of public which in turn increases demand and prices automatically increases.\n- Population increase\n- Money hoarding\n- Fluctuated consumption pattern.\n- Cost- Push Factors: This factor is a result of the increase in the prices of production process inputs. For example: If wages increase than the productivity, increase in price of a product can be seen.\n- Increase in indirect taxes like custom and excise duty raise the cost of production increasing the price.\n- MSP (Minimum Support Price) increase\n- Infrastructural issues\n- Failed monsoon and disaster.\n- Built-in inflation: As the price of goods and services increases, labour expects and demands more wages to maintain their cost of living that increases price and wage-price spiral continues.\nEffects of Inflation\n- Redistribution of income and wealth:\n- Due to the effect of inflation, some group of people loses and another group of people gains.\nIn case of debtors and creditors-\nIn case of Producers and Consumers\n- Effects on Production and Consumption:\n- Due to inflation, the demand decreases which curtails the production.\n- People try to use fewer services which lead to decrease in consumption.\n- Unfavorable Balance of Payments:\n- Export decreases and import increases from other countries which lead to decrease in forex reserve.\nHow is Inflation Measured?\nThe inflation rate is calculated as a percentage change in price index.\n1. Wholesale Price Index (WPI): Wholesale Price Index or WPI measures the changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk by wholesale businesses to other businesses. It is released by the Economic Advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n- An upward surge in WPI indicates inflationary pressure in the economy.\n- The base year is taken 2011-12 in India.\n- Major components of WPI are primary articles subdivided into Food Articles and Non-Food Articles.\n- Other component: Fuel & Power, Manufactured Goods like Textiles, Apparels, Metals, Sugar, Oils and more.\n- The monthly WPI shows average price changes of goods usually expressed in ratios or percentages.\n- However, it does not include services such as the health, IT, Education, transport and unorganized sector etc.\n2. Consumer Price Index: It measures retail inflation in the economy by collecting the change in prices of common goods and services like food, housing, apparel, transportation, electronics, medical care, education, etc. This provides insights as to how much a consumer can spend to be on par with the price change.\n- There are 4 consumer price index numbers in India: CPI for Industrial Workers, CPI for Agricultural Labourers, CPI for Rural Labourers and CPI for Rural Labourers.\n- CPI has much larger weightage of primary articles then WPI which is 57%. Hence, food inflation is reflected much more appropriately in the CPI when compared to the WPI which gives only 20% weightage to primary articles.\n- RBI had adopted the new Consumer Price Index (CPI) (combined) as the key measure of inflation. The national CPI is meant to measure retail inflation. This index will combine urban and rural CPIs, both under preparation and to be released simultaneously. Unlike many other countries, India does not have a unified CPI and uses the WPI as a benchmark. The unified CPI will usher in a fundamental shift in the way the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) targets inflation.\nMeasures to control Inflation\n1. Monetary Measures: Tighter monetary policy can decrease demand-pull or the cost-push inflation.\n- RBI may increase the bank rates/repo rates. etc (qualitative tool) to curb the supply of money in the market.\n- RBI can resort to Open Market Operations\n2. Fiscal Measures: There are two ways of fiscal measure that can be taken by the government:\n- Cutting expenditure on schemes, projects, spending, etc.\n- Increasing direct or indirect tax.\nSome Terms related to Inflation\n- Disinflation: Decrease in the rate of inflation\n- Deflation: Negative inflation or persistent price level decrease.\n- Reflation: This happens when the Price level increases because the economy recovers from recession.\n- Stagflation: When stagnation and inflation coexist in the economy. Stagnation- low national income growth and high unemployment. Inflation + Recession (Unemployment)\n- Misery index: Rate of inflation + Rate of unemployment\n- Inflationary gap: Aggregate demand > Aggregate supply\n- Deflationary gap: Aggregate supply > Aggregate demand\n- Suppressed / Repressed inflation: Aggregate demand > Aggregate supply. Government will not allow rising of prices in this.\n- Open inflation: Situation where price level rises without any price control measures by the government.\nYou wish to have unlimited access to all 20+ structured live courses and 500+ mock tests then subscribe to Gradeup Super.

During periods of economic distress, a country is characterized by social chaos, social unrest, bankruptcies, reduced trade volumes, currency volatility, and breakdown of law and order.\nDue to the magnitude of the economic distress, government interventions for economic recovery can be slow to bring the economy back on track, and the delay causes even greater disorganization of the economy.\nCauses of Economic Collapse\nThe following are some of the causes of economic collapse:\nHyperinflation occurs when the government allows inflationary pressure to build up in the economy by printing excessive money, which leads to a gradual rise in the prices of commodities and services. Governments resort to creating excess money and credit with the goal of managing an economic slowdown. Hyperinflation occurs when the government loses control of the price increases and raises the interest rates as a way of managing the accelerating inflation.\nStagflation refers to a situation in which the economy is growing at a slow rate while simultaneously experiencing high rates of inflation. Such an economic situation causes a dilemma among policymakers since the measures implemented to reduce the rise in inflation may increase unemployment levels to abnormally high levels. Stagflations and its effects on the economy may last for several years or decades.\nFor example, the United States experienced stagflation from the 1960s to the 1970s. During said period, economic growth was stagnant, and the inflation peaked at 13% per annum while the inflation rate in the United Kingdom was at 20% per annum. Once stagflation occurs, it is usually difficult to manage, and governments must incur huge costs to bring balance to the economy.\n3. Stock market crash\nA stock market crash occurs when there is a loss of investor confidence in the market, and there is a dramatic decline in stock prices across different stocks trading in the stock market. When a stock market crash occurs, it creates a bear market (when prices drop 20% or more from their highs to hit new lows), and it drains capital out of businesses.\nCrashes occur when there is a prolonged period of rising stock prices, price earning ratios exceed long-term averages, and there is excessive use of margin debt by market participants.\nScenarios that Define an Economic Collapse\nThe following are some of the things that characterize an economic collapse:\n1. Rising interest rates\nDuring periods of economic collapse, interest rates peak at abnormally high levels, and it limits the amount of money that is available for investors to invest. High interest rates hinder economic growth since investors, corporations, and the government find it costly to service existing debt obligations and take out new loans due to the high cost of capital.\nWhen a major company declares its inability to finance its debt obligations and resorts to disposing of its assets to pay creditors, investors lose confidence in the company and will be hesitant to trade their money during periods of financial distress.\n2. Sovereign debt crisis\nSovereign debts are debts taken up by a government to finance capital-intensive infrastructural projects. However, when the government takes on too many debts and is unable to pay principal and interest obligations when they fall due, it increases the risk of defaulting on its existing debt obligations and becoming bankrupt.\nA sovereign debt crisis occurs during periods of slow economic growth, wars, political instability, drought, and when investors lose confidence in the government. Due to the large size of sovereign debts, a default by the government is likely to affect the global economy and cause spill-over effects on other jurisdictions.\n3. Local currency crisis\nA local currency crisis occurs when the currency depreciates in value due to a loss of investor confidence. This occurs when foreign investors who have invested in a country and advanced credit to the government lose confidence in the government’s ability to meet debt obligations or generate the agreed-upon returns.\nIn such situations, the foreign investors withdraw their investments in the country. The move increases the selling of the borrowing country’s currency in the international market, resulting in currency devaluation. In return, the currency devaluation increases the country’s international debts, resulting in the loss of the country’s purchasing power.\n4. Global currency crisis\nA global currency crisis involves the loss of value of a major currency that is used in cross-border trade transactions between individuals, corporations, and governments. For example, the US dollar is used as the world reserve currency in the Bretton Woods institutions, which means that if the US dollar depreciates in value, it may trigger a global economic crisis.\nCFI offers the Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst (FMVA)™ certification program for those looking to take their careers to the next level.

{"question":"Can you compare the conservation challenges faced by the mountain pygmy possum and the Grassland Earless Dragon in Australia?","answer":"Both species face significant conservation challenges. The mountain pygmy possum suffered from inbreeding due to physical isolation over 20,000 years, leading to reduced genetic variation. This was addressed through a genetic rescue program that successfully increased the population from a handful to over 200 individuals. The Grassland Earless Dragon faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation, with 99.5% of its Natural Temperate Grassland habitat destroyed since European settlement. Both species are affected by climate change - the possums need genetic variation to adapt to warming conditions, while the dragons are particularly vulnerable due to their short lifespan and low fecundity, with climate change expected to bring warmer temperatures and declining rainfall that could affect their reproduction and survival.","context":["Genetic Rescue Helps Endangered Possum\nGenetic rescue, the process where inbred populations receive genes from another, healthy population, has for the first time been used to increase the population and help the future survival of the endangered mountain pygmy possum.\nFor the first time, a breeding technique known as genetic rescue has been shown to increase population numbers and survival rates of the endangered mountain pygmy possum. Population levels are now the highest they have been for over two decades. The study was published in the international journal Nature Communications.\nGenetic rescue is the process where inbred populations (where individuals are mating with close relatives because their populations are too small) receive genes from another population. This can be natural, but it is also a tool used in conservation to increase the overall genetic diversity of the population. In this study, genetic rescue was used to introduce male mountain pygmy possums from a healthy population at Mount Hotham to a recipient group of females at Mount Buller, both in the state of Victoria, Australia.\nThese two groups had become physically isolated from each other over 20,000 years ago. The isolation had led to inbreeding and a lack of the genetic variation that is essential for overcoming disease and ensuring that the population can thrive.\nDr Andrew Weeks from the University of Melbourne led the study, and says that since the genetic rescue programme began in 2011, the possum population has experienced rapid growth and is now larger than it was when the population was first discovered in 1996. “Before 2010, there was thought to be only a handful of individuals at Mt Buller. Now, Mt Buller females from the genetic rescue are bigger and have more offspring that survive longer than the progeny of pygmy possums born outside the program. We now estimate the population to be over 200 possums,” he says.\nCo-author Dr Ian Mansergh from La Trobe University says the study’s findings mark an important development in conservation management: “Our study confirms genetic rescue as a successful conservation technique, especially when used for small, isolated populations of threatened species.”\nAlongside the genetic rescue, there was also a programme of habitat restoration, predator control and environmental protection instituted by the land manager. This was essential to avoid the reversal of the benefits brought by genetic rescue, if the population cannot expand or still faces the threats that reduced the population in the first place.\nA genetic rescue programme is now underway to help another species under threat – the critically endangered eastern barred bandicoot at Mount Rothwell Conservation Centre near Little River, also in Victoria. The long-term hope for genetic rescue is that it will provide endangered animals with enough genetic variation to adapt and evolve to new challenges, especially man-made threats such as climate change.\nCo-author Professor Amy Hoffmann says: “These animals are now facing an extra threat. They are experiencing physical isolation and introduced predators as well as climate warming. The hope is that animals can adapt if we give them the genetic tools to do so. We have shown the technique is successful in the mountain pygmy possum, and hope the eastern barred bandicoot can recover if they are also given enough support.”","Grassland Earless Dragon\nThe native Grassland Earless Dragon (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) was declared an endangered species in the ACT in 1996 and has special protection status. It is listed as vulnerable internationally, endangered nationally and in NSW, and threatened in Victoria.\nThe species was probably once widespread throughout south-eastern Australia wherever native grassland was present. In the ACT, the lizard was rediscovered in 1991 after not being recorded for 30 years; it is known to live in Natural Temperate Grassland and native pastures in the Majura Valley and Jerrabomberra Valley.\nThe Grassland Earless Dragon is a small lizard found at higher altitudes and in cooler regions than any other earless dragon. It is usually less than 150 millimetres long and weighs 5–9 grams. Distinctive markings on its back allow for individuals to be identified. During the breeding season, subadults and adults often have yellow-orange or reddish coloration on their throat, sides of head and flanks.\nThe lizard likes well-drained sites dominated by Tall Speargrass and shorter wallaby grasses, with patches of tussocks and open spaces between them. In the ACT these sites are frost-hollow grasslands that usually have had little or no ploughing or pasture improvement. The lizards use arthropod burrows, particularly Wolf Spider and Raspy Cricket burrows, for shelter and nests. Eggs are laid in November to January and hatch between January and March. The lizards are short lived, with females usually producing only one clutch of eggs. They eat a variety of small invertebrates, especially ants, beetles, spiders and moths (including larvae).\nApproximately 99.5% of Natural Temperate Grassland in Australia has been destroyed or drastically altered since European settlement.\nACT populations declined dramatically between 2005 and 2009, possibly as a result of lack of ground cover caused by drought and exacerbated by overgrazing that exposed them to heat, predation and starvation. Recent monitoring has suggested there has been some post-drought recovery of populations.\nThe major threats to the Grassland Earless Dragon are:\n- loss and fragmentation of habitat through clearing of native grasslands for urban, industrial and infrastructure development and for agricultural purposes\n- modification and degradation of native grassland habitat, particularly through weed invasion, cultivation and pasture improvement, overgrazing or close mowing, excessive vegetation biomass, wildfire or inappropriate fire regimes, and predation by domestic, wild and native animals\n- major ecological disturbances to grassland habitat such as widespread (unplanned) fire, drought and climate change.\nThe lizard’s relatively low fecundity and short life span make local populations vulnerable to the effects of wildfire, drought and other environmental changes on their habitat. This vulnerability is increased where fragmentation of habitat prevents recolonisation from surrounding areas.\nHabitat fragmentation and degradation will exacerbate any effects on populations from climate change, which is expected to bring warmer year-round temperatures with fewer frosts, more hot days and warm spells, and declining rainfall (especially in winter). These changes have the potential to affect the lizard’s reproduction and survival as the structure of their habitat is sensitive to drought, and sparser ground cover will lead to higher ground temperatures.\nThrough the Grassland Earless Dragon Action Plan (2017), which continues the 2006 action plan, and the ACT Native Grassland Conservation Strategy (2017), the ACT Government proposes to maintain the conditions, in the long term, that encourage a viable, wild population.\nConservation effort is focused on protecting viable populations in functional native grassland habitat within the Majura Valley and the Jerrabomberra Valley.\nThe overall conservation objectives include:\n- conserve all ACT populations\n- manage the species and its habitat to maintain the potential for evolutionary development in the wild, particularly through mowing or grazing, removal of weeds, patch burning and creation of a diverse habitat structure\n- enhance the long-term viability of populations through management of adjacent grassland to increase habitat area and connect populations\n- provide offset areas, with management plans, for areas subject to urban development.\n- continue extensive survey, monitoring and research\n- collaborate with research institutions and non-government organisations and encourage citizen science and volunteers.\nThe highest level of protection is in nature reserves, though populations of the species have been maintained on leased Territory land used for stock grazing, providing the grazing regime is compatible with maintaining suitable habitat. Where the species occurs on Commonwealth land, the ACT Government will continue to liaise with the Australian Government and Canberra Airport to encourage continued protection and management.\nRestoring grasslands to low or marginal quality habitat might help the Grassland Earless Dragon colonise and occupy these areas when conditions are favourable, and hence help maintain genetic diversity in the longer term. There may also be opportunities to reconnect sub-populations.\nMaintaining a varied grassland structure and avoiding herbage biomass extremes will maximise the range of shelter and thermal niches and food for the lizard. As part of this, small-scale patch burning has been trialled in Jerrabomberra West Grasslands.\nFor an improved understanding of the species’ biology, ecology, habitat and techniques to breed in captivity, the ACT Government will continue to collaborate with other states, universities, CSIRO, Australian National Botanic Gardens, other research institutions and non-government organisations. Monitoring will continue to determine long-term population trends and evaluate the effects of management.\n- Grassland Earless Dragon Action Plan, 2017\n- The ACT Native Grassland Conservation Strategy and Action Plans, 2017\n- See the lizard’s distribution at the ACTmapi website.\n- Australian Government information\nEpsddcomms@act.gov.au or call Access Canberra on 13 22 81"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f63f30db-6420-460a-a38d-264c45dddff5>","<urn:uuid:4987bfbf-b690-412b-90f1-0211ba3f87c0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm struggling with addiction - what's the key difference between methadone and crystal meth in terms of how they affect brain chemistry?","answer":"While both substances affect brain chemistry, they work very differently. Methadone is specifically formulated to restore normal chemical balance in the brain and relieve withdrawal symptoms without producing a high, helping users regain control over addiction-based thinking patterns. In contrast, crystal meth severely disrupts brain chemistry by triggering an intense dopamine release that creates a powerful rush and reward effect, making users highly susceptible to addiction and dependency. Over time, meth can change brain chemistry so dramatically that even high doses cannot produce desired pleasure levels.","context":["The Effects of Opiate Addiction on Your Thinking and How Methadone Maintenance Treatment Helps\nChronic and long-term opiate addiction does a number on a person’s thinking as well as on his or her overall outlook on self and others. Even after a person stops using opiates, the effects of drug use can persist for months or even years at a time.\nWhile many people may consider the physical effects of drug abuse to be the source of addiction, these effects only wreak havoc within the body’s chemical make-up. In actuality, the heart of addiction lies inside the mindset that forms during the course of using drugs.\nWhile alleviating physical discomforts can go a long way towards supporting abstinence, methadone maintenance treatment programs use behavioral-based interventions to help you develop and maintain a drug-free mindset. Overall, methadone maintenance treatment addresses both the physical and psychological aftereffects of addiction.\nThe Psychological Effects of Opiate Addiction\nIn general, a person’s thinking and emotions develop out of the chemical workings of the brain. When functioning as normal, the brain secretes needed amounts of neurotransmitter chemicals for regulating bodily functions and enabling a person to handle the events of any given day. Chronic opiate abuse turns the brain into a chemically imbalanced environment. These conditions give rise to the thinking patterns, emotions and eventual behaviors that drive the opiate addiction lifestyle.\nChronic opiate use also warps an important area of the brain known as the brain reward system. The reward system coordinates input from the cognitive centers and the limbic or emotion-based centers to determine what drives a person, as well as what his or her motivations and priorities will be. According to Addiction Science & Clinical Practice, by the time opiate addiction sets in, the brain reward center has developed its own dependence on the drug and essentially “classifies” drug use as a top priority in person’s life.\nMethadone’s Therapeutic Effects\nMethadone’s use as a treatment drug relies on its ability to mimic the effects of addictive opiates and thereby relieve much of the physical discomfort addicts experience in recovery. Methadone, too, belongs to the opiate class of drugs and is specifically formulated to relieve withdrawal and drug craving discomfort without the high risk for addiction that other opiates carry. In effect, methadone restores a normal chemical balance in the brain, which in turn enables a person to take control of negative, addiction-based thinking patterns.\nThe Benefits of Behavioral-Based Interventions in Methadone Maintenance Treatment\nWhile methadone’s effects do pave the way for new thinking to take root, the thinking patterns associated with addiction remain well intact if no further treatment measures are taken. Methadone maintenance treatment programs employ behavioral-based treatment approaches to help recovering addicts replace addiction-based thinking patterns with the type of mindset that supports continued abstinence from drug use.\nBehavioral-based interventions help you identify destructive thinking patterns and develop strategies for coping with daily life without the need for drugs, according to Maryland Department of Health. The types of interventions used may include:\n- 12-Step support groups\n- Drug education training\n- Individual psychotherapy\n- Drug counseling\n- Group therapy\n- Family therapy (when needed)\nAs addiction has more to do with the mind than the body, opiate addiction treatment doesn’t really begin until a person starts work in behavioral treatment. Overall, methadone maintenance treatment equips recovering addicts with the tools and supports needed to maintain abstinence on an ongoing basis.\nIf you or someone you know struggles with opiate addiction and have questions about methadone maintenance treatment, please feel free to call our toll-free helpline at 800-891-9360 for more information.

The release of dopamine is thought to be responsible for the rewarding effects of many drugs that are abused. This surge in dopamine activity – combined with the drug’s relatively low cost – makes users of crystal meth highly susceptible to abuse, addiction and dependency.\nAs a result, crystal meth addiction can be a hard addiction to overcome. For both long-term and short-term users of crystal meth, the crash after using the drug can feel unbearable. The high release of dopamine means that after the meth rush, there is a relative depletion of active dopamine – leaving the user with intense cravings to go back to the drug and regain the high. For long-term users, brain chemistry can change so dramatically that even high doses of meth cannot release enough dopamine to produce desired levels of pleasure.\nTreatment for Crystal Meth Addiction\nIf you or someone you love struggles with crystal meth addiction, there is still hope. You can achieve complete recovery from crystal meth addiction through a comprehensive treatment plan.\nTreatment design will vary on an individual basis. However, commonly utilized treatment approaches for crystal meth addiction often include a combination of behavioral treatment strategies1:\n- Cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n- Contingency-management interventions (tangible rewards in exchange for maintaining sobriety).\n- Education for family members.\n- One-on-one counseling.\n- Drug tests.\n- 12-step support groups.\n- Support for participating in activities that are not related to drugs.\nSo Where Does Medication Fit In?\nThe FDA doesn’t currently approve of any specific medications for the treatment of crystal meth addiction.2\nSupportive medications, however, are meant to be used alongside therapy to help ease the intensity of the detoxification process – which typically includes a range of uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms typically felt by meth users include3:\n- Intense desire for the drug.\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has made medication development for crystal meth addiction a priority, and NIDA’s National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network has made great strides to find medications that enhance the user’s ability to cope with meth withdrawal.4\nMedications That May Help Your Meth Addiction Recovery Efforts\nWhen withdrawal is supervised by professionals, you can usually receive medication treatment to soften the symptoms of both short-term detoxification and long-term psychological withdrawal. While meth is not currently FDA approved for treating meth addiction, research has been starting to show some specific medications that may become approved by the FDA in the near future for their abilities to help treat meth addiction.\nMedications Currently Under Study for Treating Crystal Meth Addiction\nTrial studies have been performed with many medications believed to possibly enhance long-term recovery success. However, more studies will be needed to confirm drug efficacy in the treatment of meth addiction, and each individual’s response to a given medication may somewhat vary. Some of the medications that have been studied so far include5:\nFor Reducing Meth Use:\n- Buproprion. This drug may reduce meth use in light meth users only.\n- Modafinil. This drug shows mixed results. One study has suggested that this drug – when combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy – may help reduce meth use. Other studies have not shown a lot of promise for this drug.\n- Naltrexone. More than one study have suggested that this drug has potential for reducing use and increasing abstinence of methamphetamine.\n- Mirtazapine. One study found that mirtazapine – alongside cognitive-behavioral therapy – was associated with significant reductions in meth use among a sample of men who have sex with men (MSM).\n- Topiramate. One study found topiramate to reduce overall meth use. Total abstinence from meth was not observed in conjunction with taking topiramate, however.\nFor Reducing Meth Cravings:\nA range of medications have been tested for reducing meth cravings, many of which showed no success in reducing meth cravings. Some of the medications that have shown more promise, however, include:\n- Dextroamphetamine. While this drug has not been shown to affect meth use, it has been shown to reduce meth cravings. Dextroamphetamine is itself an addictive stimulant, but is available as a prescription tablet – potentially facilitating closer medical vigilance and safer dosing while mitigate cravings.\n- Rivastigmine. Studies have suggested this drug might help reduce meth users’ desire for meth.\n- Buproprion. This drug has been correlated with reduced meth cravings.\n- Nicotine. Nicotine administration during meth withdrawal has show to reduce meth-seeking behavior in some individuals.\n- Naltrexone. Studies on naltrexone have appeared to reduce meth-seeking behavior – a possible indicator of its ability to reduce meth cravings.\nMedications that May Reduce Both Meth Use and Meth Cravings\nOut of the medications that have been studied so far, it appears that two of those drugs may show some promise in reducing both meth use as well as meth cravings:\n- Buproprion (including Wellbutrin). Available in several trade name formulations (including Wellbutrin and Zyban), buproprion is currently FDA-approved for major depression, seasonal affective disorder and smoking cessation. Buproprion may be one of the most publicized medications in aiding methamphetamine addiction. Buproprion’s mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it is believed to weakly inhibit uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. This action results in increased amounts of norepinephrine and dopamine available in the body. As mentioned earlier, dopamine is one of the body’s primary “pleasure chemicals,” while norepinephrine is one of the body’s primary “fight or flight” chemicals. Buproprion’s efficacy in this capacity is reported to be pronounced only in light meth users.\n- Naltrexone. Naltrexone is currently FDA-approved for treating both alcohol and opioid drug dependence. It works as an opioid receptor antagonist – meaning that it competes with and blocks other drugs that would normally have an effect on opioid receptors. Naltrexone is believed to have some potential for helping with meth addiction by blocking meth-induced dopamine. More studies are still needed to evaluate naltrexone’s efficacy and role in treating meth addiction.5\nAlong with these promising medications, some researchers have also been working steadily on immunological treatments.6 This kind of treatment involves engineering antibodies to target methamphetamine in the bloodstream and bond to the molecules of meth. Researchers hope that this method could help halt meth overdose and other dangerous effects meth has on the brain and other organs. It would also negate the pleasurable rush of the drug.\nDiverting ADHD medications\nMedication Use in Treatment Facilities\nWhen you feel ready to really turn your life around and quit meth, you will want to begin considering the type of treatment facility you’d like to help you along your recovery journey. The two main types of treatment you will encounter are:\nOutpatient treatment is an option for some individuals who have less severe addictions and who don’t have any coexisting medical or mental health conditions. Many standard rehab facilities offer outpatient treatment services that let you intermittently check in with your healthcare provider for medications and therapy – while still being able to go home at night after treatment.\nWhile the intense symptoms of acute stimulant withdrawal may only last days to weeks, crystal meth is capable of creating such dramatic changes in brain chemistry over time that prolonged care is frequently beneficial for those seeking recovery. As a result, many crystal meth users maximize their chance of success by quitting their meth use under the watchful care found in an inpatient rehabilitation center.\nInpatient programs offer an immersive treatment environment, with access to medical care and support should it be required. Supportive medications can also be administered to help you navigate the unpleasant withdrawal period, potentially increasing the likelihood of long-term sobriety.\nInpatient Facility Types\nWhen you’ve decided to look into inpatient addiction treatment options, you’ll come across a few different types of treatment facilities, depending on your needs and budget:\n- Luxury rehab facilities offer residential addiction treatment alongside a wide range of desirable, high-end amenities to make your recovery process as comfortable as possible.\n- Executive rehab facilities provide private residential addiction treatment with accommodations and allowances that enable busy professionals to maintain an active involvement in their workplace throughout recovery.\n- Standard recovery programs also provide quality addiction treatment in a residential setting. While these facilities might not offer the luxuries of the aforementioned programs – they are generally the most affordable inpatient treatment option for those on more limited budgets.\nMedications Are No Substitute for Human Support\nAlthough medications have been proven to help with crystal meth addiction, they should be used in conjunction with – rather than as a substitute for – some of the primary meth treatment approaches that rely on human support. Group and individual counseling, cognitive-behavioral therapy, family involvement and addiction support groups all have their own substantial roles in contributing to one’s addiction recovery.\n- Group and individual counseling. Group and individual counseling are common and important aspects of most addiction treatment programs, as social support and one-on-one therapy both play important roles in successful recovery.\n- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT should be an essential component to your recovery and is often incorporated into group and/or individual counseling. Although medications may aid in reducing cravings and may temporarily address other emotions involved in addiction, ongoing recovery requires resolving the root causes for your addiction and changing your mental and behavioral patterns. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help you understand the triggers and situations that cause you to use meth and can help you learn how to cope with these cravings without meth. This type of therapy teaches real-life techniques for recovery.\n- Family involvement. Research has demonstrated that family involvement and support can improve the chances for a loved one to seek help and successfully comply to a treatment plan.7 Family members can offer invaluable support, often providing encouragement and motivation for the user to get sober. This support can lead the user towards a more dedicated recovery process.\n- Addiction support groups. Recovery success rates among those involved with a 12-step program tend to be higher than success rates among those who are not. Those in a support program are much less likely to relapse. Involvement in a 12-step group – such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous – can provide you with peer support as well as spiritual growth. Although it may not be for everyone, a 12-step support group may provide just the support you need during your early days of recovery and beyond.\nOverall, there are many tools that can help in the process of recovering from methamphetamine addiction.\nMedication is one of these tools and can certainly aid you, or a loved one, in the recovery process. Although recovery from crystal meth can seem like a daunting ordeal, the long-term effects are considerably more daunting. With the help of medication, you can avoid some of the common pitfalls that can lead to relapse.\nThe Effects of Crystal Meth Addiction\nFor individuals addicted to crystal meth, the prospect of quitting the drug can be daunting and even terrifying. These feelings of overwhelming fear are understandable, however, as the idea of going through the withdrawal process can be overwhelming.\nBut before you run away from the meth recovery process out of fear, consider the consequences of not working through this fear. Continuing use of crystal meth puts you at risk for both short-term and long-term consequences – some of which can even be deadly.\nShort-term effects of crystal meth may include8:\n- Heightened vigilance or attention.\n- Increased activity and restlessness.\n- Increased breathing rate.\n- Rapid and irregular heartbeats.\n- Euphoric rush.\n- Decreased appetite.\n- Hyperthermia (increased body temperature).\nOne of the most obvious and hazardous long-term effects of crystal meth use is the potential to develop an addiction. As the functionality and molecular structure of your brain begin to change, the compulsion to persistently use the drug is strengthened. Since your body eventually becomes tolerant to meth over time, however, your regular drug dose will begin to lose its ability to produce the same pleasurable effects – spurring the need to take higher doses to achieve the same effects.\nIn addition to addiction and tolerance, other long-term effects from meth use include8:\n- Profoundly disrupted sleep patterns.\n- Mood disturbances.\n- Dental problems (“meth mouth”).\n- Auditory hallucinations and delusions.\nIt has been found that individuals who have experienced severe meth-induced psychosis might struggle with persistent psychotic features, even after achieving sobriety. It can take a brain quite a long time to readjust. Strokes and other sudden cardiovascular events may occur, even in the short term with methamphetamine abuse. However, the consequences of the neurologic damage that may result – including paralysis, loss of speech, cognitive decline and dementia, for example – may persist for much longer durations.\nFind Help for Your Meth Addiction\n- What treatments are effective for people who abuse methamphetamine?

{"question":"Could you compare the leaf characteristics of Papilionaceae and the Simabaceae-related families, focusing on their compound leaf structures and special features?","answer":"The Papilionaceae and Simabaceae-related families show distinct patterns in their compound leaf structures. Papilionaceae has pinnate compound leaves with 14-70 leaflets arranged in a paripinnate pattern, with leaflets being either alternate or opposite. The leaves are pulvinate and may be gland-dotted. In contrast, the Simabaceae-related families have digitately ternate or bipinnate compound leaves with up to 5 leaflets. They feature distinctive characteristics such as extra-floral nectaries on young leaf margins, and often possess domatia manifested as hair tufts. Both families can have stipules, though in Simabaceae-related families they are typically caducous.","context":["Family Papilionaceae. Robinieae.\nHabit and leaf form. Trees, or shrubs, or herbs.

{"question":"How do the mounting mechanisms differ between a drill press dust collection system and a router circle jig?","answer":"The drill press dust collection system uses a column clamp made from two 3/4-inch plywood pieces glued together, with an articulated arm system consisting of multiple links connected by 1/2-inch hex head bolts. The system attaches to the drill press column near the head. In contrast, the router circle jig is made from 1/2-inch plywood and requires a pivoting point plus a cutting point, along with a piece of cold rolled flat steel and a tightening knob with matching tap and bolt for securing the jig.","context":["|Project by tyvekboy||posted 308 days ago||3382 views||43 times favorited||15 comments|\nFeb 7, 2013\nI don’t know how many of you have bought or considering to buy a 2-1/2 inch flex form hose kit to use as a way to control the dust/chips on your drill press. The picture of it looks good but it doesn’t really give you a solution on how to set it up.\nHere is my solution and I hope it helps you setup your dust collection on your drill press.\nFirst you have to start by making some way to mount it to your drill press. I made a mounting clamp that is attached to the drill press column near the head of the drill press. I could add a description of how to make this but I’m going to assume you are like me and can look at a picture and figure it out. I glued two 3/4 inch pieces of plywood to get the thickness of my clamp and you may see why this is key layer.\nHINT: Glue two pieces of plywood together. Drill 1/8 inch pilot holes through the glued up block (where bolts that will secure the column clamp to the drill press column will pass) after glue sets up before ripping lengthwise. This will aid in drilling matching holes later. Rough cut half of hole in each part and finish with template, router and flush trim bit. Counter sink and drill as required for clamp attachment bolts using the 1/8 inch pilot holes previously drilled. I used 3/8 inch threaded rods and threaded knobs to attach my column clamp to the drill press.\nAfter the column clamp is made, you can then make the articulated arm which consist of pieces that I’ll call links and 1/2 hex head bolts 3-1/2 inch long, nuts and washers.\nStart by making a template of a link like the one shown. It will be faster if you make more templates and make the links in batches of 4 or more. Each template will have two center holes about 4 inches apart thru which a #6×3/4 inch screw is used to fasten the template to a piece of 3/4 inch plywood. Rough cut on bandsaw just outside of the template and finish up with flush trim bit in router following the template. The area around the screw holes are 2 inches in diameter.\nAfter removing the template, drill 1/2 inch hole and round over edges.\nMake more links than you think you need. You’ll never know when you might need to make more of these articulated arms for your shop.\nAfter enough links are made, start assembling the articulated arm with the nuts, bolts and washers as shown below. You’ll have to determine how long to make the articulated arm but since it is so modular, it’s easy to make it longer or shorter.\nChoose one of the long arms of the column clamp and drill a 1/2 inch hole to secure one end of the articulated arm. Now you know why using two pieces of 3/4 inch plywood to make the column clamp is key. Also note the front of the clamp is shorter than the back of the clamp. That allows clearance for the lever handles to rotate.\nAttach your articulated arm to the hole just drilled.\nYou now need to make a hose transition piece to put at the other end of the arm. This piece is shown below and consists of a shop vac hose splice clamped in position.\nAttach the hose transition piece to the other end of the articulated arm.\nThe vaccum hose is attach on one end …\n... and the other end gets the flex form hose.\nIf you don’t have a light built into your drill press, you can use the other arm of the column clamp to attach an articulated arm to which you can attach a light. If you already have a light, you can use the other arm to mount some sort of drill holder (articulated or not).\nHappy drilling and I hope this sucks for you.\nAll comments and questions welcomed and encouraged.\nThanks for viewing.\n-- Tyvekboy -- Marietta, GA","Woodworkers are always making jigs. Sometimes a jig is used only once, other times it can be used hundreds or thousands of times. In this article and video we are making an adjustable circle jig for a router that has been designed and drawn by David Cooksey, one of our long-time members. David has been sending me plans and drawings of many different jigs and woodworking objects for some time now and we thought it was high time we let everyone else in on David's great ideas.\nToday we are covering this circle jig, and you are welcome to down load your own version of it from our Plans section, and it's free ... and we all have David Cooksey to thanks for this. NOTE, you do have to be a member of woodworkweb in order to access our download section, but that's free too, and then you can access all the other plans and links to plans that we have put together for our members and subscribers.\nThere is a short list of materials that you will need ....\nThe Router Circle Jig is made from 1/2 inch plywood, and you should have a nice flat, decent grade of plywood for this. You will also need some sort of a tightening knob or other similar fastening mechanism, also a 2 x 4 inch piece of cold rolled flat steel we refer to as a blank, which you can probably find as a scrap piece at your metal supply store and lastly you will need a suitable tap and matching bolt or the bolt connected to your tightening knob will need to match your tap that you will be using to create a threaded hole in your steel blank.\nThe first question many people will ask, is why wouldn't you just cut a circle on a bandsaw? Of even a Jig Saw or Scroll Saw? The answer is, well, if you have one or all of those tools, yes that is one option, but if you are looking for a nice clean cut the router might be a better choice, also, if you want to put some sort of a decorative edge on your circle, such as a you might see on a small table table, then the router is definitely the be best tool for that.\nThe main thing to keep in mind when making the jig is that there are really 2 points of importance on it, the point where the tool will cut the wood and the other point that will be the pivoting point. The rest of the jig is all about convenience and ease of operation.\nWe are not going to go on at length on how to make the jig because the drawing and video are mostly self explanatory and if you want to make changes or modifications to suit your particular router or applications, then you should do that.\nWhen using the jig, especially with a pure carbide bit, remember to go slow and take smaller amounts of wood off with each repeated pass. The reason for this is that carbide is NOT steel. It's composition is more like crystal which means it will break before it bends. Too much force on the side of carbide bits and they will snap in half, which can also happen if you are forcing them into wood too quickly, they can snap there too.

{"question":"How do the challenges of accurate estimation compare between traditional project management and agile approaches when dealing with unique requirements?","answer":"In traditional project management, the main challenge stems from projects being unique and non-repetitive, making it difficult to find similar historical projects for analogous estimating efforts. This uniqueness inherently affects the accuracy of estimates since each project has distinct characteristics. In agile approaches, as demonstrated by the Big Rock sizing method, the challenge manifests in determining size early without a big upfront requirements phase, when requirements are only known at a high level and subject to change. Both approaches acknowledge the difficulty of precise estimation - traditional methods try to address this through various techniques like parametric estimating and three-point estimates, while agile methods like Big Rock sizing handle it by focusing on relative sizing, team consensus, and accepting that estimates won't be perfect but should balance out through the law of large numbers.","context":["Scheduling tools are only as good as the activity duration and cost estimates entered into them. Accurate estimating of these elements is therefore imperative for creating a schedule that is realistic.\nThis article discusses the principles and approaches to aid the project manager’s attempt to accurately estimate the duration and/or cost of a project.\nOne of the major challenges of scheduling projects is coming up with accurate estimates for the schedule. This is such an important and difficult component of scheduling that whole jobs have been created around this function. Estimators, as they are titled, work eight hours a day and forty hours a week estimating the duration and/or cost of projects. Estimators attempt to apply scientific approaches to a skill that is primarily an art form. One useful estimator resource, used in the engineering and construction industries, is the RS Means book.\nIt provides valuable and detailed labor, equipment, and material estimates for construction projects. The RS Means construction estimates are based on historical data. They provide the estimator with the closest approach to a scientific estimating method. However, the RS Means data is limited to the construction industry. Estimators in fields like the research and development industry do not have this tabulated cost data. And will have to rely on less scientific approaches to estimating.\nThe difficulty in estimating is inherent in the characteristics of projects. Projects by definition are unique. They are not repetitive processes. Therefore, it is difficult to find similar historical projects for analogous estimating efforts. There will always be something distinct about a project to distinguish it or separate it. Despite this set back analogous estimating is one of the best approaches to project estimating.\nWhen analogous estimating is not a viable option you may want to consider parametric estimating that examines relationships between variables on an activity to calculate time and/or cost estimates. In parametric estimating you determine the unit duration or cost and scale this value for the number of units in the project. It’s important for the measurement to be scalable for accuracy. For example if it took two days to code 500 lines of computer code it will take eight days to code 2000 lines of computer code. Parametric estimating is another approach that attempts bring a scientific method to what is primarily an art form.\nMany times the most accurate way to estimate a project is to procure expert judgement. This is someone with direct knowledge of the field in question. Who would be better to provide this knowledge than the people actually doing the work? Yes, resources performing the work always know best how to estimate their work, provided they have some related experience.\nThere is also another benefit to obtaining team member estimates: they take ownership of the estimate. If the estimate comes from upper level management or perhaps, a sales representative, the team members performing the work do not have ownership of the estimate, and are less likely to produce the effort required to achieve the estimate goals. Ownership matters! It has a significant impact on team member productivity.\nSo we obtain our estimates from team members performing the work. The question remains, what kind of estimate do we get from team members? Do we ask them for a pessimistic estimate? This will provide the most conservative estimate. For that matter is a one-point or single-point estimate sufficient? Or would a three-point estimate considering the pessimistic (P), most likely (M), and optimistic (O) outcome be better. With the three-point estimate we introduce some statistics to the estimate that reduces some of the subjective nature of the estimate. The formula for a three-point estimate is as follows:\nThis equation is a very simplistic average. The Program Evaluation and Review Technique, developed by the U.S. Navy in the 1950s, employs a weighted average. It weights the average to the most likely estimate, which should be the most accurate. The weighted average duration or cost estimate is below:\nThus, a little bit of statistics is added to the estimate that provides a more scientific and structured approach. Also, studies have also shown that team members that have difficulty providing a one-point estimate are more readily able to provide a three-point estimate. A three-point weighted average estimate is the best expert knowledge approach. You can even provide a standard deviation to the estimate as follows:\nCreating a believable schedule that can be performed in the real world requires accurate duration and/or cost estimates. Because projects are not operational processes but unique temporary endeavors estimating schedule durations and costs from similar or analogous past projects is not always feasible. Consider the scientific parametric approach when projects are dissimilar, but variables from one project to another are scalable.\nAnother recommended approach is expert or team member three-point judgement on durations and/or costs inserted in a weighted average equation estimate. Estimators can also provide an initial top-down estimate on deliverables, and then follow up with a more detailed and accurate bottom-up estimate starting with the individual tasks (activities).\nRita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep, Eighth Edition, Rita Mulcahy, PMP\nForecast Scheduling with Microsoft Project 2010, Eric Uyttewaal, PMP","This is the third article in the QSM Agile Round Table series. The QSM Agile Round Table was formed to discuss the role of estimation in agile environments. QSM customers shared their questions, challenges, and experiences on the relevance and benefits of scope-based estimation in an agile environment. The Round Table spent several meetings on the key topic of sizing an agile release. The discussion centered around two main questions:\nHow can you determine the size of a release early in absence of a “big upfront requirements phase,” and thus when the requirements are only known at a very high level and subject to refinement and change?\nHow can you determine size in a consistent way across multiple products, projects, and agile teams so that you have good historical data on which to base an estimate?\nThis and the next article in the QSM Agile Round Table series are based on those discussions.\nAaron Jeutter, a participant in the Round Table from Rockwell Automation, presented the technique of “Big Rock Sizing.” This technique is used at Rockwell Automation for early sizing and estimating based on high level requirements that will be refined using agile techniques as the work progresses.\nTeams need to develop estimates for an overall schedule to support the initial funding and final funding milestones of projects. These teams within product development organizations are held accountable to these estimates.\nSome groups at Rockwell Automation use a “Big Rock” estimation technique to derive a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for initial funding requests. The term “Big Rocks” came from a set of initial planning sessions completed for several projects. This method is also used to refine labor and cost estimates for the final funding milestone. The goal is not to estimate a mountain, or a whole bunch of pebbles… only the “Big Rocks”. The estimates start with the same basic Agile premises:\n- The estimate of a group of people is usually better than that of a single person\n- The estimates won’t be perfect. Some estimates will be high and others will be low. The estimate depends upon that balancing out in the end. The statistical property called the “Law of Large Numbers” often comes into play for most cases.\n- Force “choice points” of estimate values. If something is definitely “bigger” than a reference, it gets forced to the next size.\n- Align the activity to a common estimate schedule and do our best to ground the schedule with previous project results.\n- Derive at least two different schedule estimates:\n- Given a value of X number of developers, the possible delivery date is Y.\n- Given a delivery date of A, you will need B developers to achieve that schedule.\n- Describe the Epics based upon expected scope, complexity and risk, not effort days.\nKeep the sizing activities to a one or two day estimation session. The key participants involved with the sizing should be those who will be implementing the final product. Stakeholders outside of the team may participate and should be available to help clarify expected scope throughout the sizing process. Other non-technical participants (like project managers) may attend, but only as observers.\nThe basic agenda for Big Rock sizing activities consists of:\n- Introductions; Ground rules for the workshop; agenda walk through\n- Pre-work review\n- Sizing grounding\n- Review and wrap-up\nThe pre-work encompasses preparation of an outline and/or hierarchy of a preliminary architecture concept and clear definitions of the architectural elements. If an existing structure is not available, a small group of knowledgeable people should meet ahead of time to discuss and determine the initial structure. This structure does not have to be set in stone for the whole project. The key is to capture the information accurately and save it for reference in the future.\nTo keep the structure from getting too detailed, it is recommended to keep to three levels of Epic / Portfolio Item descriptions:\n- First Level – Executive / High-Level description\n- Second Level – Key Stakeholder, Manager-level description\n- Third and deeper – Development Team / Engineer-level descriptions\nIt is highly recommended to keep the number of First Level Epics to about ten or less, but allow for more complexity at the Second or Third levels. Most of the time, Big Rock estimation only is limited to the second level of Epics. On occasion, building the Epics to the third level tends to happen with complex projects / products. Stories are the next level and should not be written until after the Epics are sized. The Stories should not be written in the Big Rock estimation meetings.\nThe goal of performing the “Sizing Grounding” is to establish a common understanding of the values used when sizing the Epics. This can be one of the more difficult parts of the estimation activity. Teams almost always undersize the points, or are astonished when the points roll up to be so many, or the schedule runs so long. Many teams who do waterfall estimation grossly underestimate the schedule and then run late. The key is to focus on the complexity and risk in terms of Epic points and then normalize it back to our basis of guesstimated time from other projects. In many cases, a less complex time-consuming activity may end up having the same size as a highly complex, short duration activity.\nAt Rockwell Automation, most teams prefer to do T-Shirt sizing, especially for Big Rock estimation. Other teams use sizes of dogs (Chihuahua to St. Bernard) or other non-numerical ways of estimation. Don’t start assigning points to the sizes until after the T-shirt sizing is finished. Assigning points right away causes the team to only think about points and not comparative sizing of the Epics.\nThe smallest T-shirt size should be considered to be more than the largest Story. Occasionally, a lot of smaller related features not big enough to be the smallest T-shirt can be collected into a “bulk” Epic. These are usually important items that can be completed in a very short amount of time or little effort.\nThe first step is to decide on what an Extra Small or Medium Epic is in terms of complexity, size, and risk. It’s useful if some of the people in the room are experienced in Scrum and estimation and have a link back to actual data from a working scrum team. Since many teams like to have more granularity, it is recommended to add other T-Shirt sizes when appropriate.\nThe team should identify Epics or sub-Epics that everyone agrees is Medium-sized for the purposes of estimation. Select an Epic that is a likely candidate where the Epic is fairly well understood, discuss it, and see if the team can agree if the Epic is medium in size. If not, find another likely candidate Epic and try again until you find the Medium reference Epic. Once that is done, create brackets with definitions for XS and XL. The rest of the sizes can be defined as you start estimation.\nAn example commonly used at Rockwell Automation for Medium-sized Epics is the integration of Ethernet interfaces used by our products. Most teams reuse existing software or use toolkits to implement these interfaces. The scope and expected capabilities are similar across multiple products, making the Ethernet interfaces a perfect choice as a reference Epic.\nTry to avoid defining the reference Epic in terms of effort hours, person days, etc. This is difficult to avoid, but the issue is that Developer A’s effort hours to do this may be half of Developer B’s.\nThis activity is Rough Order of Magnitude sizing, not detailed estimation. The goal is to get through the Epics with a reasonable, but not perfect, estimate of Epic points with consideration of complexity and risk.\nFor estimation, the general steps are as follows\n- Look at the Epic. Is it small enough to size within 5 minutes? If so, skip to step 3.\n- If it’s too big, or too complex, break it down into sub-Epics. Some of the sub-Epic work may already be captured via sub-requirements in the product requirements, the functional requirements or some other document.\n- Discuss the Epic, preferably in five minutes or less, to the point where the estimators understand the Epic.\n- The estimators state the size of the Epic. If there are a few very vocal people who are influencing other people’s sizing, then you may want to use planning poker cards or another silent method. If necessary, the primary facilitator asks “Is this more or less complex than the Medium sized Epic?”\n- The high and low estimates are discussed. Uncertainty should be reflected in higher Epic sizing.\n- The estimators come to consensus on the final sizing.\n- The primary facilitator records the result, and the team moves on to the next Epic.\nReview and Wrap Up\nOnce the team has finished sizing all of the Epics for estimation, the primary facilitator reviews the parking lot for anything that still needs to be discussed. The team is asked if there are any concerns or outstanding issues associated with the sizing. Everyone will want to know “what the answer is”. Depending upon the tools used, the primary facilitator may or may not be able to give one.\nThe primarily facilitator takes the T-shirt sizing and converts it into Epic points. The facilitator should work with an expert estimator with experience in Scrum to do this. If possible, you want your Medium reference Epic to roughly match up with a known team’s Medium Epic. The points for Medium can be extrapolated from this as a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate.\nWhen assigning points for Epic sizing, use sizes bigger than the largest Story that the teams plan to work on. For example: The team agrees that the largest Story is 20 points, so the smallest Epic would be 40 points. The modified Fibonacci series can be used to set the points for the remaining T-shirt sizes. The table below is based on this particular example:\nReminder: Each team will have its own velocity. This velocity will be different than the assumptions made with the ROM calculations. The Epic points can (and should) be refined at a later date to match the real velocity of the team. Different teams will have different velocities, so resizing of estimates is essential for tracking and monitoring purposes.\nSizing Results Example\nThe table below represents results of a sizing activity for an application with PC and Web interfaces. The Parent Portfolio items are Communications, Business Logic, User Interface and Infrastructure. These are broken down into more specific, but still general work sets that can be sized. These lists are normally prepared as part of the pre-work prior to the sizing activity. This helps provide the structure for the discussions tied in with the sizing activity. For most projects, this will likely be a much longer list with at least one more level of complexity.\n|Portfolio Item (Parent)||Portfolio Item (Child)||T-Shirt Size (Pick List)|\n|Communications||Ethernet Stack Integration||XS|\n|Communications||REST Library Integration||S|\n|Communications||Application Specific Features||L|\n|Business Logic||Database Services||M|\n|Business Logic||Algorithm Updates||M|\n|Business Logic||Business Logic Testing||S|\n|User Interface||PC Interface Development||S|\n|User Interface||Web Interface||S|\n|User Interface||UI Testing||M|\n|Infrastructure||Build System Configuration||S|\n|Infrastructure||Life Cycle Support||M|\nOnce the sizing activity is completed, these can be assigned the Epic Point measures so an initial burn-up chart can be produced for review and discussion with stakeholders. Using the sizes indicated earlier in this document, this example works out to be 1940 Epic Points in size. Assuming the team is capable of completing 60 Points per Sprint and 3-week Sprints, this project could be completed in approximately 32 Sprints or 96 weeks.\nTeams and stakeholders to have discussions regarding the scope, complexity and risk for key functionality in the software product, without confusing that with schedule needs. When the schedule is considered first, the work estimate tends to magically compress to fit the desired schedule. Coming out of the first sizing session, the results will likely be unacceptable to key stakeholders. When this occurs, the project definition should be decomposed, redefined or refined to address the Epics that are considered too large. A subsequent sizing session should be performed after the project definition has been updated.\nThe Big Rock Sizing method balances estimation between the top-down and bottom-up methods used for sizing software efforts. Big Rock Sizing also provides the key stakeholders visibility into how the scope, complexity and risk exist in the proposed project. As the teams continue to use this method, Big Rock sizing can be adjusted to fit organizational needs. The results of this sizing can be used in conjunction with the SLIM Estimate tool using Function Units and the Agile estimation templates.\nSteve McConnell, “Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art”, (Redmond, Microsoft Press, 2006), 115"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:823b7a49-1e17-44c4-855d-75c7b6b74d6d>","<urn:uuid:5f539cd3-f4fb-48fa-a2d6-dc579008b878>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the essential maintenance practices for a healthy aquarium, and how do they help control nitrate levels?","answer":"Essential maintenance includes regular water changes of 1/3 of the aquarium water every 3-4 weeks, or better yet, weekly 10% changes to maintain pristine conditions. Regular water changes remove nitrates - when you remove a volume of water, you remove all nitrate in that volume. Daily inspections are necessary to remove any dead fish, decomposing plant material, or uneaten food. Filter maintenance is crucial - while filters trap waste and detritus, they must be regularly cleaned or replaced as trapped dirt continues contributing to nitrate load. Additionally, maintaining appropriate fish population levels is vital - overstocking leads to excess waste and high nitrate levels. A useful rule is to stock only half the number of fish you think your aquarium can hold.","context":["The basics of keeping an aquarium\nFish Facts & Feeding\nDo fish grow to the size of their aquarium?\nThis is probably the most widely held misconception in the hobby. We are all supposed to grow to our adult size. However, if you put me in a box and don’t feed me well you will affect my growth.\nIs it ok to just feed my fish flake food?\nOn the reef there is an infinite variety of foods and therefore nutrients. Mix it up - frozen foods, prepared foods, high quality pellets, and live food.\nWhy don’t my fish thrive?\nI have customers who ask “why do my fish die after a couple months” or “why isn’t it growing”. Well in some cases people are slowly starving there fish to death. If a fish is under nourished it will be weak, more susceptible to illness, and unable to grow.\nCan I kill my fish by over feeding?\nFish are not stupid they will not eat themselves to death; however, because we have put them in an artificial environment we can kill them with poor water quality. Be sure that all fish food is eaten and none is falling to the bottom to rot.\nProblem: the more fish food the more fish waste. Solution: more frequent water changes.\nHow often do I feed my Blue Tang(community fish) and Panther Grouper(predator)?\nIn nature tangs graze on algae and other foods all day long and therefore should be fed until full at least 2-3 times a day, this is achieved by offering several small portions during a feeding rather than one large serving. Groupers and Lion fish will eat a fish almost there own size and then lay around digesting for a couple days, so they should be fed only 3-4 times a week.\nWhy does my fish stay in the corner of the aquarium?\n1. On the reef there is an abundance of hiding places for the fish. If hiding places are not provided in the aquarium the fish is under constant stress and does not behave naturally.\nThe safer your fish feels the less it will hide.\n2. Another factor is what we call dither fish, this is the natural abundance of other fish on the reef. If your fish is alone or in the company of very few free swimming fish it may feel uncomfortable and frequently hide or act nervous.\nBrittle star fish, queen conchs, emerald green crabs, blue leg hermit crabs, scarlet red leg hermit crabs, sand sifting star fish, fighting conchs, algae eating snails, medusa worms, sea cucumbers, and horseshoe crabs.\nWe’re talking about reef scavengers who feed on detritus, bacteria, algae, and all other biological waste. These fascinating creatures prevent such waste from polluting the aquarium and literally choking the reef. These animals are generally hardy and long lived and there benefits to the reef aquarium are immense. By processing the organic waste, which would otherwise settle and rot in your substrate, the detritivores can help maintain chemical balance within the tank.\nThese animals are for the most part self-sufficient in the home aquarium, scavenging on the uneaten bits of fish food and waste that have fallen to the tanks bottom. A new or very clean tank may not provide enough nutrients, in which case some food should be added about once a week but be careful not to over feed the tank.\nOn the whole, these animals are hardy and do well even with the beginning hobbyist. Avoid drastic changes in pH and salinity-density by acclimating to new tanks appropriately. Enjoy your “clean-up crew” as they work for you!\n*In Freshwater aquariums this includes algae eaters and bottom feeders - catfish, plecostomus, shrimp, etc.\nBiological Filtration & The Healthy Aquarium\nThe basis of all healthy aquariums is what we call biological filtration. This is the presence of good nitrifying bacteria that breaks down raw fish waste (ammonia) and converts it into a less toxic form of waste (nitrates). Because the fish are being fed they are producing waste. The nitrogen cycle begins as the microscopic good bacteria starts to populate the aquarium clinging to all surface areas and breaking down this waste.\nIt takes an average of 4 weeks for a fresh water aquarium to complete this process of bacteria growth and about 6 weeks for a salt water aquarium. Because water conditions are at there worst during this time before bacteria population is complete it is important to start with hardy fish that can endure these conditions and never over feed or over populate the new aquarium.\nThere is a company marketing a living culture of these bacteria which takes 1-5 days to balance the aquarium instead of weeks. It is refrigerated and has a limited shelf life before it expires. This product must be introduced at the same time as fish. There are many other products that can be found on the pet store shelf that claim to cycle an aquarium but may not be as effective.\nOnce the nitrifying bacteria is established in the aquarium ammonia should never be present again. Only killing of the good bacteria by extensive cleaning of to many surfaces or adding excessive waste would result in an ammonia bloom. The most important part of maintaining the health of your little ecosystem is to dilute the always rising nitrate level by changing 1/3 of the aquarium water every 3-4 weeks. Even better one can create more pristine and consistent water conditions by doing weekly 10% water changes.\nKeeping A Salt Water Aquarium Can Be Easy!\nEveryone seems to know someone who has had a bad experience keeping an aquarium. The reason for this is that that person was misguided by someone who really didn’t know the basics themselves. Equipment and information are the two most important requirements for success. The hobby changes with time just as the Computer industry does. Recently we’ve gone back to simpler more natural methods with less equipment. Getting up to date with these methods and not getting too technical is the key to creating your ideal aquarium. First you must decide which type of salt water aquarium you want.\n#1 The most simple and least expensive is what we call a fish only aquarium. Several beautiful fish in an aquarium creates a stunning effect with lots of color and movement. Because the waste produced by fish is not tolerated well by living corals the fish only aquarium requires less maintenance.\n#2 An invertebrate aquarium has less emphasis on fish but many beautiful anemones, corals, shrimp and other very interesting and colorful animals and plants. These aquariums are low maintenance and simple due to the good water quality easily achieved by a smaller number of fish.\n#3 The third and most involved type is the reef aquarium. Considered the pinnacle of the hobby, the objective is to maintain excellent water quality for invertebrates/corals while having several exotic fish.\nOnce you have decided which type of aquarium best suites you then its time to determine the size. You have many options, but if you don’t find a standard that suites your creative needs then ask us to have one custom built for you. In choosing an aquarium, remember the longer and wider you go the better. The taller you go the more problematic it may become.\nHaving considered all these factors it’s time to talk to one of our friendly expert advisers, and dive in!","Keeping Up with NitrateAuthor: Sara Jackson\nWhether you are a seasoned fish hobbyist or just a beginner, you ought to know what a problem nitrate can be—not only to get rid of, but the harm it can cause your fish.\nWhat Is Nitrate?\nAmmonia is the most significant dissolved waste in an aquarium. It is produced by fish wastes, rotting leftover food, and decomposing plant matter. The bacteria in your biofilter convert ammonia first into nitrite and then into nitrate. While ammonia and nitrite are highly toxic to fish, nitrate is much less so. However, as nitrate accumulates, fish will eventually be affected.\nThe level of nitrate cannot be detected directly, as it is invisible and odorless. An algae bloom usually indicates high nitrate levels, though algae is able to grow in newly set-up tanks with nitrate levels as low as 10 ppm.\nYou will first need to determine what the nitrate level is in your aquarium by testing the tank water with a test kit. Follow the directions in the kit, and by matching the color of the test with the included color chart, you will know how much nitrate is in the water. Although many aquarists run their tanks with extreme nitrate levels, the ideal is a maximum of 5 to 10 ppm. Levels of 20 to 50 ppm are too high. Freshwater tanks can be at the higher end, with marine fish-only setups at the lower end and reef tanks as near zero as possible.\nMany fish will not show any symptoms of nitrate poisoning until the level reaches 100 ppm or even higher, but studies have shown that long-term exposure to sub-critical concentrations of nitrate stresses fish, making them more susceptible to disease, interfering with the growth of young, and decreasing the likelihood of reproduction.\nWhen nitrate levels rise to completely intolerable levels, fish will become lethargic and may have open sores or red blotches on their skin. It is common for fish kept at high levels to die suddenly, and often when a new fish is added to an aquarium in which the fish have gradually become accustomed to high nitrate concentrations, the new fish quickly dies from the shock.\nAn aquarium with a high nitrate level typically suffers from one or more of four principal factors.\nOverfeeding is the number-one cause of high nitrate levels in aquariums. Overfed fish produce much more waste than normal, and when more food is given than they can take in, the uneaten food rots and produces even more wastes.\nKeeping too many fish in a tank also leads to problems with accumulated wastes. More fish means more waste. Most aquariums contain way too many fish, and high nitrate levels are a very common problem in them.\nDid You Know?\nA useful rule of thumb promoted by many aquarists is to figure how many fish you think you can put into your aquarium, and then put only half that number in.\nIt is always better to understock your tank, but if you find yourself in the situation of having too many fish, you must either get rid of some or buy a larger aquarium.\nLaxness in cleaning filters often underlies high nitrate levels. Remember that the media in the filter merely trap wastes, food particles, and detritus. Until you clean or replace the media, the dirt is simply out of sight, but it’s still adding to the nitrate load of the water.\nDecaying Plant Material\nEven though plants are natural filters and can help keep nitrate levels down, their dead leaves, if not removed, will decay and produce additional wastes. Even healthy growing plants can lose stems or leaves, and these dead pieces can accumulate on the bottom.\nThere are various devices and procedures that can lower the nitrate level. Nitrate-adsorbing filter media and anaerobic denitrifying biofilters will remove dissolved nitrate, but they will do nothing to eliminate the cause of the problem. The simplest solution is a water change. When you remove a volume of water from your aquarium, you remove all the nitrate in that volume. So, change half the water and you’ve removed 50 percent of the nitrate.\nNow, before you roll up your sleeves and dive right into a thorough cleaning of your aquarium, remember that going from polluted water to fresh, clean water can be just as harmful to your fish as the nitrates themselves. The change in the water chemistry can be a physical shock to your fish. So, if you have a very high nitrate level, start slowly. Lightly vacuum the substrate until no more than 15 percent of the water has been removed. Continue vacuuming the substrate once a day, getting a little deeper into the gravel each time and removing about 10 to 20 percent of the water. Keep testing, and once the nitrate level reaches 5 to 10 ppm, establish a maintenance routine that will keep it there.\nTo prevent high nitrate levels, the underlying cause of “Old Tank Syndrome,” you will need to perform regular maintenance and water changes. If you ignore this care, your nitrate will rise, and your fish will suffer.\nFeed your fish sparingly. Make sure they finish their food in two minutes or less. Instead of feeding your fish one large amount of food once a day, try feeding them smaller amounts two or three times a day.\nDon’t overcrowd your aquarium. If careful feeding still leaves you with high nitrate, you probably have too many fish for your setup.\nDo a quick inspection every day. Remove any sources of decomposition: neglected food items, dead fish or invertebrates, and dead or dying plant leaves and stems.\nYou will need to perform regular water changes. The minimum schedule should be weekly, but more is often better! Large changes of 50 percent or more are much more effective at keeping wastes sufficiently diluted. Sometimes tap water contains levels of nitrate that are unacceptable for the aquarium. If that is the case, you either need to use a water purifier such as a reverse-osmosis unit, or you’ll have to buy suitable water for your aquarium.\nOf course, such large changes are not generally possible with a marine tank, though they work very well. This is why saltwater hobbyists often rely on nitrate-reducing systems like live rock and deep sand beds, and it is why reef aquarists usually keep only a few small fish that are lightly fed to minimize waste production.\nCheck your filters regularly. If you do not have a dedicated biofilter and rely on the bacterial colonies in your mechanical filter medium, replace only part of the medium at each cleaning. However, if the medium is seriously matted and plugged, a gentle cleaning in a bucket of tank water will remove most of the decomposing gunk without damaging the biofilter. In fact, it will increase biofiltration capacity because of the increased flow of oxygen-rich water through the medium.\nA heavily planted tank is the most natural way to have low nitrate levels, since plants will utilize much of the ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate produced in the aquarium. This is the principle behind growing and harvesting macroalgae in a saltwater sump system. The rapidly growing algae remove wastes from the water, and the regular removal of some of the algae permanently removes those substances from the system.\nMangrove plants are especially popular with marine aquarists, but they are equally effective at removing wastes from fresh water. These plants are rooted under the water, but they must grow out of the water. Remember, though, that plants can only utilize a certain amount of wastes, which is why planted tanks, like reef setups, are typically lightly stocked with fish.\nAlthough it takes effort to maintain low levels of nitrate in your aquarium, the reward of watching healthy, beautiful fish swimming tranquilly in a tank in your living room far outweighs the work that goes into assuring the health and longevity of your fish.\nSee the full article on TFH Digital http://www.tfhdigital.com/tfh/201102#pg87"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6d43f3bb-51e2-4211-82b5-428b0ec0ea53>","<urn:uuid:b5e21cd6-b57c-4b37-bc72-0f72bb38eb82>"],"error":null}

Manmade fibres are estimated to account for around 80% of the total fibre consumption in the global technical textiles market. The majority of technical textiles are manufactured using regular fibres or their specialty variants, whereas, high performance fibres account for a mere 5% of the total fibre consumption. Its materials designed for specific applications requiring concrete and demanding properties (mechanical resistance, tenacity, insulation, thermal resistance, acids, ultra violet, and infrared).\nDespite the downturn in the global textile industry, the technical textiles sector is proving to be an increasingly strong inspirational force for the industry. The market presence of technical textiles is expanding, and the field is experiencing growth in functions and applications. Consumption of technical textiles constitutes approximately 25% of the total volume consumption of all textiles in industrialised countries. Global demand is expected to be especially high for geotextiles, industrial textiles and building textiles.\nWith the growing dominance of technical textiles, technical textiles can be classified into 12 groups from the application point of view. Protech is one of these groups which is an ensemble of textile products and related material used in the manufacture of various protective clothing for the personnel working in hazardous environment. Therefore, technical textiles play an important role for producing protective and safety clothing. The variety of protective functions that need to be provided by various textile products is diverse and considerable.\nProtective clothing includes garments and related paraphernalia for protection from harmful chemical environments. These types of textiles include protection against ballistic, cuts, abrasion and other types of severe impact, which includes fire and extreme heat, stab wounds and explosions, hazardous dust and particles, biological, nuclear and chemical hazards, high voltages and static electricity, foul weather, extreme temperature environments, and low visibility – to name but a few.\nTextiles with exceptional insulation performance, providing protection against very low or high temperatures, have been obtained with aerogels (nano-porous structures of amorphous silica gel). These textiles will be advantageous for those working in harsh environments, but also for extreme sport/outdoor activities.\nDue to their enabling character and the unique properties of materials at nanoscale, nanotechnologies are particularly suitable for use in technical protective textiles.\nTheir use in this sector is still at an early stage, with research following two main paths:\nAlthough fire resistant workwear is widely associated with being worn by fire fighters, it’s also very important in many industries and workplaces that have fire hazards within their working environments. Clear selection criteria would be set and outlined to help the reader to understand the factors that he/ she should consider before having a decision related to selecting the proper type of fire resistant workwear, specifying it and therefore doing the procurement for such critical items that will save the worker’s life.\nIn a flash fire without the protection of flame-resistant workwear, the worker is exposed firstly to the heat of the fireball and then secondly to the heat of the burning fabric of the worker’s clothes. The heat generated by a burning fabric depends on the composition of material, treated or non-treated, weight and weave of the garment and if the material was clean or soiled with hydrocarbons.\nAccording to OSHA, the use of flame0resistant clothing greatly improves the chance of a worker surviving and retrieving quality of life after a flash fire. Flame resistant clothing can significantly reduce both the extent and severity of burn injuries to the body. In order to achieve higher fire protection, OSHA advise employers to comply with the standards number 29 CFR 1910.132(a). As a reaction to higher injuries from fire accidents in the oil and gas industry in the US, in May 2010 US Department of Labor enforced oil and gas organisations to apply and implement the above mentioned standard where applicable. The organisations also are required to comply with the related NFPA standards, namely NFPA 2112 and NFPA 2113.\nFurthermore, and according to CAPP, fire resistant workwear provides protection against flash fires in two ways. First of all, fire resistant workwear is designed so that it does not burn when exposed to flame. This in itself provides protection for the worker by eliminating or reducing injury when clothing burns after exposure to flash fire.\nSecondly, fire resistant workwear is designed to decrease the amount of heat that penetrates the skin during a flash fire. The fabric basically provides a barrier between the flash fire and the worker’s skin, reducing the amount of energy transmitted to the skin thus providing further protection to the worker. In this case, the thicker the fabric used in the making of fire-resistant workwear, the better the degree of protection to the worker. Accordingly, it is very important to consider the type of garments needed for working on site with flash fire potential, as the workwear has the possibility to extremely boost or reduce the associated hazard.\nAll this effort and research carried out by health and safety related departments should come with a guide that helps the manufacturers to make suitable attire, which can in turn help workers in protecting themselves from flame and heat associated with fire. It also provides a road map for the procurement professionals to make the right decision when selecting and purchasing workwear that is fit for the occasion.\nIt is very important for the people who are responsible for employees’ health and safety to be aware about the standards and requirements for PPE, and accordingly articulate and craft their own guide and specifications that can help in getting and acquiring the correct products that can in turn provide the workforce with the needed protection from workplace associated hazards and dangers.\nBesides the selection criteria I introduce in my Fitting the Occasion article (fit to purpose, comfortable, durable and with legal compliance), the selection of flame-resistant workwear is based on the following principles:\nThe first principle is the sole responsibility of the health and safety department, while the other three principles shall be worked jointly between health and safety and procurement departments.\nAs per OSHA and CAPP, the wearing of fire-resistant workwear should be considered as the basic standard for work in and near all oil and gas facilities. Any facilities or locations where oil or gas could be present can have an associated risk of flash fires. Welding and cutting, also, can produce hazards such as sparks, spatter, radiation, slag, heat, hot metal, fumes and gases, and even electric shock. Since these hazards may cause burns, injury or death, it is important for welders and cutters to wear protective equipment that is adequate for the hazards at all times. Welding and cutting operations could be in the oil and gas industry as well as construction and infrastructure industries. Nevertheless, regardless of the industry and workplace, the employer shall ensure that all employees engaged in welding or cutting operations shall wear adequate fire retardant work clothing, fire retardant gauntlet type gloves and arm protection, an apron of fire retardant or other adequate material, adequate eye and face protection against harmful radiation, particles of molten metal, or for chipping and grinding welds; and safety boots. The materials used in fire resistant clothing can protect against other workplace hazards as well and should be considered even when the risk of a flash fire is low. These other hazards may include minor scrapes and abrasions, hot surfaces, some chemicals, sun, and cold.\nAlthough many standards have been set for fire protection workwear, generally speaking all of them consider similar criteria for evaluating the hazard and indicating the kind of fabric to be used in such kinds of clothing. However, to get good results in setting your selection criteria and specification, it is recommended to adopt and implement one of these standards at a time and not try to comply with all at the same time.\nOther option is to study all the standards and data available for the fire-resistant workwear and craft your own standard. However, adopting two different standards will give you more flexibility in the sourcing process when it comes to the procurement side. In this way, you can eliminate any possible superiority that manufacturers can play during the procurement cycle provided they are following particular standards while others follow different, but equivalent, standards.\nAfter assessing the hazards and learning the related standards, it is very important to know about your marketplace. What are the existing goods and to what extend do they comply with the international standards and particular requirements? Knowing your market makes you able to set and select the standards and specifications that can be used during the procurement process, which is realistic and applicable – as well as fitting your purpose and meeting your needs. It also allows you to recommend some brands or manufacturers or even country of origin, depending on the local authority norms and preferable and adopted standards.\nDuring the development of specifications, you have to differentiate between fire resistant workwear and fire-retardant workwear, as both of them are made from different fabrics. Naturally flameresistant fabrics are fabrics manufactured with fibres whose inherent properties make them naturally flame resistant without a chemical treatment. The fabric’s effectiveness will not be reduced by repeated washing or wear since fabrics such as these ensure optimum protection throughout the life of the garment. Flame retardant treated fabrics are produced by applying a finish to a fibre or fabric to reduce its flammability, or by incorporating a flame-retardant chemical into the fibre prior to spinning. The flame-retardant treatment chemicals are activated by intense heat, producing char and gases that inhibit combustion for a certain time. Because the flameretardant treatment is a chemical treatment which is washed out with time, the fabrics will only conform to heat and flame standards for a limited number of washes. Therefore, flame “resistant” is the proper term for protective clothing.\n“the materials used in fire resistant clothing can protect against other workplace hazards as well and should be considered even when the risk of a flash fire is low”\nFlame resistant clothing is required in various workplace applications where the risk of exposure to open flame exists. Flame resistant workwear is recommended for persons working in the field of electrical maintenance, utility work, industrial manufacturing, construction, power generation, energy distribution, oil and natural gas workers and other types of hazardous occupations. Although flame resistant clothing is dominant in protecting workers from the possibility of burns, it is important to know that flame resistant clothing only helps to minimise the possibility of burn injury; it does not eliminate it.\nUnfortunately, wearing the wrong clothing will actually make burns and fires worse rather than acting as a protection against injury. Synthetic fibres like polyester, rayon, and other blends will actually melt to the skin when exposed to intense heat. On the other hand, cotton and natural fibres act as a fuel that will burst into flames and continue to burn if a worker is exposed to extreme heat.\nThese guidelines form the basis for the reasoning behind the design of fireresistant workwear for protection against flames and heat.\nIn a power generation industry, the hazard in an arc fire, flash fire, or other sudden unexpected release of intense heat can sometimes occur after the accident. For arc fires, an arc exposure value is measured as the amount of electrical energy per unit area. This value is applied as a rating to determine how effective flame-resistant clothing is at meeting dangers from electrified equipment and arc fires. If a person is knocked unconscious, flame resistant clothing can offer protection for the worker until they can be rescued. For instance, this type of workwear is made to be either self-extinguishing or noncombustible so that a person’s clothing will not continue to burn.\nTechnical clothing of multi-layered material that offers resistance to fire is used for the clothing of the fire-fighters. Thus, the outer layer is made of metaaramid fibre, which gives resistance to fire, and para-aramid fibre which gives a better mechanical strength. The outer layer is followed by an impermeable layer, which serves as waterproof membrane. Then follows a layer made of meta-aramid, which gives thermal insulation. The inner layer is a layer of aramid yarn knitting or modacrylic. Technical textiles are considered as the perfect solution for flame retardant protective clothing. They will not only protect but are also extremely comfortable to wear. The fabric also offers maximum breathability. The safety standards for flame retardant fabrics are extremely strict; and technical textiles can fully meet all of these standards.\nFor example, technical textiles can comply with:\nTechnical textiles are used to manufacture flame retardant workwear ranges that consist of individual items. The spectrum of areas where they can be used is extremely wide, since in many jobs flame retardant workwear is important to ensure optimum protection.\nFire resistant workwear is very important to protect workers within working environments that have a noticeable hazard of fire and explosions such as mining, and oil and gas. However, fire resistant clothing can help in protecting workforces involved in construction, utility, telecommunications and power generation industries. Many people suffer serious injuries and even death due to fire accidents during their work. This will affect the productivity of work and therefore the profitability of the business. Although PPE costs companies money every year, not using it costs society more and affects the overall economy of the country.\nWhile selecting the fire-resistant clothing we have to understand our industry needs, assess the hazard levels, understand the existing standards and the availability in the marketplace, and then set the proper specification that can help buyers to take their purchasing decisions and acquire the proper attires that will fit the purpose and be comfortable, durable and comply with legal requirements. In many countries, having an unsafe workplace give the rights to the workers to sue their employers and enforce a compensation that can threaten companies with huge loses that are much greater than the cost associated with having a safer workplace.\nPeople matter and protecting human life is priceless. Keeping your workforce safe and healthy will improve their productivity, reduce the number of days off taken by employees due to injuries, and bring the cost of compensation related to accidents and injuries to the minimum levels. That will save a lot of money and increase the ROI of the business. This should be considered as a motive to business people, to consider safety and provide all tools to maintain their employees’ safety and good health.\nTechnical textiles help to greatly improve the quality of fire-retardant materials and make them safer and more reliable. With the continuous development and innovation in the technical textiles industry, more new products and fabrics will come to the fore that may yet create revolution in the PPE industry.\nAli Sadeddin is a mechanical engineer who has been involved in the construction field for more than 20 years.

Our current fashion system is predicated upon a rapidly escalating TAKE > MAKE > WASTE linear system, fuelled by the demands of fast fashion, and is responsible for the depletion of resources, polluting ecosystems, social inequalities and generating catastrophic waste mountains. A quarter of our industry resources are wasted as fabric and garment leftovers, and around 500 billion US dollars worth of textile waste is landfilled or incinerated globally every year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. At the dawn of a critical new decade no one can now ignore the fact that ‘fashion business as usual’ is no longer an option...\nThe role materials can play in a more positive future is crucial; research undertaken by both the Kering Group and the Ellen McArthur Foundation shows us that up to 80% of a product’s environmental impact can be attributed to the material choice alone. From a sustainability perspective, materials really do matter; they represent the beginning of the design journey, embodying tactile promise, and expressing the creativity and substance of new fashion products. They also account for highly significant impacts across the supply chain, and generate 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.\nIf raw materials are sourced from regenerative and restorative farming systems, the fashion industry can contribute towards mitigating the climate crisis and deliver benefits for nature and people. It is estimated that 30% of the need for climate action to remain within 1.5°C can be met through nature-based solutions, such as regenerative agriculture. Therefore, our materials play a significant role towards positive change, and may even offer restorative and regenerative benefits, by rebuilding soils and damaged ecosystems, protecting biodiversity, sequestering CO2, and providing communities with a stable living wage.\nWe need to urgently rethink our relationship with the resources that provide our mate- rial needs, and actively engage in positive sourcing and practices that diversify our fibre basket and limit and tackle waste streams intelligently. Currently our global fibre demand is dependent upon two polluting and highly unsustainable material sources; two-thirds of our materials are made from toxic petrochemicals, and over a quarter is made up of thirsty, pesticide and fertiliser-dependent conventionally farmed cotton, grown in unsustainable monocultures, and are still to this day associated with human rights abuses. Only around 1% of present cotton production is organically farmed, although that demand is on the increase.\nScientific consensus states that we urgently need to decouple from our dependency on fossil fuels, both as a raw material and as an energy source, and look to nature-based solu- tions to tackle our most pressing issues. Ingenious and sustainable use of alternative plant fibres can contribute to this much-needed material diversity, and the regenerative systems they are grown within can provide effective carbon sinks and havens for biodiversity.\nIn the materials world there are a plethora of approaches emerging that explore new sustainable material opportunities as solutions, for example; reclaiming waste, capturing carbon, innovations in the fields of biosynthetics and bio-fabricated materials, all spot-lighting the innovations that point to a new, more diverse material landscape; one that prioritises working in harmony with nature, respecting precious planetary resources, and seeks to reframe ‘waste’ as a valuable resource. These innovations exemplify a broad scope of new material possibilities, and demonstrate that there are potential solutions available to drive much-needed change. In recent years, we have seen a surge in research and development in these areas, along with a return to the best practice farming methods of traditional fibres.\nFIBRES FROM NATURE\nMany of our raw material requirements are fashioned from nature. We have depended for centuries on agriculturally grown materials, such as cotton, hemp, linen, and animal fibres. Returning to traditional fibres but using high-performance fibre technology, VentileTM textile technology produces an extra durable, waterproof and literally life-saving, mili- tary-tested textile from an extra-long staple, certified organic cotton. To ease our reliance upon cotton, hemp is reappearing, as it is an ecologi- cally positive plant to grow, low in water and pesticide demands, known to return nutrients to the soil, and absorb more CO2 per hectare than an equivalent sized forest.\nWeganoolTM by Faborg uses a little known hollow cellulose fibre grown in abundance in arid areas of South India, without the need for fertilisers or pesticides. Another textile innovation is Bananatex®, created by revisiting a ‘forgotten’ historical fibre, and the identification of this raw material source, its low impact relationship with the natural world and the farming communities that harvest it, demonstrate that fashion can indeed have a positive impact. Made from sustainably grown banana plant fibres, it is a waterproof and durable fabric that is naturally biodegradable and fully circular. The fibres are from plants cultivated in the Philippines within a natural ecosystem of sustainable forestry. Its self-sufficiency has made it an important contributor to the reforestation of areas once eroded by palm plantations, whilst enhancing the prosperity of local farmers.\nREPURPOSING AGRICULTURAL WASTE\nMaterials science company Circular Systems have identified that a staggering amount of agricultural waste is burnt or left to rot globally each year. This represents a pollution hazard and a valuable cellulose feedstock source, but also an innovation opportunity. They developed the AgraloopTM system and resulting BioFibreTM yarn from agricultural waste streams such as cane bagasse and oil seed fibre. Shocked by the environmental impact of commercial leather production, entrepreneur Carmen Hijosa founded Ananas Anam, as a responsible community project in the Philippines, and developed a durable vegan non-woven leather alternative Pinatex® from repurposed post-agricultural waste pineapple leaves. Mexican innovators Desserto® have created a vegan cactus biobased leather alternative that is grown on an organic plantation, respecting biodiversity, with low energy and water use.\nThe need to both clean up our plastic pollution and de-couple from our dependency upon petroleum, both as an energy source and a material feedstock is an urgent imperative. Currently, we recycle only 9% of our plastics globally. Creating circular recycling systems requires innovation both at the material level and at the systems level, joining up networks between industries and creating infrastructures to repurpose plastic and textile waste streams. Innovators in this category are ingenious in identifying sources and systems for harvesting waste and repurposing it into high quality, functional and even luxurious fibres. By harvesting ocean plastic, PET bottles, recycled fishing nets, and plastic waste collected by networks of fishermen provide income from a different kind of catch. Innovators in this area include Parley who have produced an ocean plastic fibre, and Econyl® who coor- dinate networks of fishermen to retrieve and recycle ocean waste, which supports local communities to harvest marine plastic, in Europe and the west coast of Africa. Their fibre has a DNA tracer embedded within to verify the provenance of the material.\nWe are seeing ever more sophisticated recycling fibre technologies and options in all fibre categories - recycled cotton, wool, regenerated cellulosic, polyester and nylon textiles - but the share of fibre-to-fibre recycling is still very low (currently estimated at below 1 percent by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation). However, new fibre technologies such as Lenzing’s RefibraTM uses a portion of pre and post-consumer cotton with certified wood feedstock in a closed loop Lyocell process, spotlight the opportunities to use underutilised waste from scraps, and capture the value locked into our waste streams. Also, on the brink of commercial availability are a plethora of new technologies that are able to separate cotton and polyester blends at the molecular level and produce feedstocks for new-born cellulose and polyester fibres.\nThe nascent era of bio-fabricated materials is a relatively new category of man-made materials, created by harnessing biologi- cal organisms, working and designing with nature to form new, sustainable possibilities. The dawn of a new decade has seen innovations that have been in research and development for decades, and many are now poised to become commercially available. This category of materials manufacturing synthesises nature’s materials, providing new properties, and currently focuses on the potential of; ALGAE, MYCELIUM, BACTERIA and YEAST.\nAwareness of the devastating impacts of intensive cattle farming, and the rapid growth in vegan lifestyles has led to a flourishing of mycelium leather alternatives. MycoTEX® by Neffa has developed engineered clothes from compostable mycelium mushroom roots, eliminating the need for chemicals and pesticides, and reducing water use by 99.5% compared to agricultural fibre crops. MycoWorks have created ReishiTM a fine leather alternative, which launched commercially in 2020. Biotech company Bolt Threads have launched MyloTM, which has attracted investment from Kering, Adidas and Stella McCartney. Ecovative also produces a mycelium leather alternative, MycoflexTM that can be engineered to grow in any shape or size.\nWorking at the intersections of science and design, Charlotte McCurdy has created an algae-based, carbon-negative biopolymer, exploring the role of material sources in sequestering carbon, and highlighting the need to stop putting fossil fuels back into our material feedstocks. Designer Cassie Quinn created an algae yarn that can be spun and knitted, or used as a fine thread for embroidery. It requires no heat when making, and is fully biodegradable. MarinaTex, by Lucy Hughes, is an award-winning domestically compostable bioplastic created from fish waste that replaces non-renewable, petrochemical-based plastic for packaging applications.\nDESIGNING WITH MICRO-ORGANISMS\nSynthetic spider silk has already attracted much attention and has been showcased at the V&A Museum in London. Created by identifying the spider DNA and replicating the protein through a yeast fermentation process, like brewing beer, it is then extruded using a wet spinning method. Those in the bioscience industry think spider silk could be the most significant technological fibre advance since nylon, and there are many other companies pursuing it commercially, such as AMSilk, producing and distributing silk biopolymers for use in textile products, medical and cosmetics applications.\nCurrently, our conventional dyestuffs are mostly made from petrochemicals. Responding to the urgent need for change in the fashion industry, Post Carbon Lab have created bacterial pigment dyeing and photosynthesis coating. The photosynthesis coating is a living layer of microorganisms that can be applied to textiles to enable active photosynthesis during the user phase; wearing a medium-sized T-shirt treated with the coating can generate 72.8% of the oxygen created by a tree in 24 hours! LVMH Award Shortlisted designer Piero D’Angelo’s project also explores the creation of dyes using a unicellular organism that feeds on bacteria, yeasts and funghi, producing different shades by altering the pH. The genus of this organism is not harmful to humans and can be kept alive through a ‘mother culture’, continually growing pigments.\nThese innovations represent examples of the diversity of solutions that point the way to more intelligent relationships with our material world. With awareness and understanding of the impacts of our choices and professional practices comes the impetus to act with care and responsibility. We look forward to embracing this new materials landscape, and the birth of responsible systems and models for a reimagined material future for fashion.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAmanda Johnston is curator and consultant at The Sustainable Angle, having curated the sustainable textiles collection and Future Fabrics Expo since its inception.

Extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton fibres are used to form a low-twist yarn, which is then woven into a tight high-density textile to create a 100% cotton fabric, capa- ble of providing an effective barrier against inclement weather. In wet weather the softly spun yarns - within the tight weave - dynamically expand to form an effective barrier against the elements.\nA species of banana native to the Philippines, is harvested for its fiber, also called Manila hemp, extracted from the leaf-stems. when Magel- lan made land in the Philip- pines in 1521, native peoples were already cultivating and harvesting abacá for use in traditional textiles.\nINTERNET OF FUNGUS\nColloquially known as the WOOD-WIDE-WEB, mycorrhizal networks are underground networks that connect individual plants together and transfer water, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients and minerals.

{"question":"How do states compete for jobs and capital, and what role does immigration play in their economic growth?","answer":"States compete through varying economic policies, with red states implementing low taxes and right-to-work legislation while blue states raise taxes and minimum wages. Red states saw better job growth, with the nine states without income tax experiencing 13% job growth from 2001-2011 compared to 7.6% national average. Regarding immigration's role, introducing immigrants can reduce the social security tax burden and potentially enhance economic growth. The growth rate of GDP per worker initially decreases then increases as immigrant flow increases, and higher-quality immigrants further boost economic growth.","context":["States are increasingly competing with one another for jobs and capital. America’s federalism has always allowed for high degrees of regional competition compared to more centrally governed nations, but declining regional specialization and more partisan state legislatures have accelerated that competition to record levels.\nRegional specialization kept Industrial Age companies in particular areas: butcheries in Illinois, car manufacturers in Michigan, and steel mills in Pennsylvania. In modern America however, regions are less specialized than they were in 1860. Declining transportation costs and the shift away from manufacturing have meant that America has an essentially national economy, with companies able to locate wherever they choose. There are glaring exceptions to this trend — Silicon Valley is in California and financial services firms are tethered to New York — but even these industries have become more mobile.\nAs companies have become increasingly mobile, states have also become increasingly partisan, exacerbating differences in economic policy. Thirty-seven states now have a governor of the same party that controls the legislature. This allows the party in power to rapidly make major changes in public policy.\nThis year alone, Kansas and New Mexico have both enacted major tax cuts and North Carolina is expected to change from a progressive, three-bracket income tax to a flat tax while also cutting the corporate income tax. Indiana and Michigan enacted right-to-work legislation in 2012, making it much harder for labor unions to organize. Texas, which has always had low taxes and right-to-work laws, goes one step further and uses the Texas Enterprise Fund to offer generous subsidies to corporations willing to relocate.\nWhile red states are becoming more pro-business, blue states from California to Illinois are raising taxes and the minimum wage. Whatever the other merits of these policies might be, they definitely make a state less attractive to businesses. The nine states without an income tax experienced 13% job growth from 2001-2011, compared to a 7.6% national average. Since 2009, right-to-work states have created four times as many jobs as states with pro-union policies. Public policy isn’t the only reason for this discrepancy — the boom in fracking has occurred mostly in red states — but all other things being equal, businesses prefer lower taxes and weak unions.\nThis means that red states will continue to gain jobs and population while blue states will continue to lose them. The implications from this will shape America’s economy and politics for years to come.\nThe Democratic states that have been raising taxes would have a hard time cutting them even if they wanted to. These states often have billions in unfunded pension debt, creating a vicious cycle: raising taxes to stabilize the pensions in the short term, having the pension arithmetic worsened by lost population and jobs because of the tax hikes, and then needing to raise taxes again.\nFor their part, red states will need to cope with the large increases in population. New people mean increased demand for public services like schools, roads, and police. This in turn leads to increased expenses, forcing the states to either move away from the low tax rates that made them successful or paper over the deficits with long-term bonds and other fuzzy fiscal math.\nLouis Brandeis famously wrote that states are “laboratories of democracy.” The widening distinctions between state policy will teach America an economic lesson about taxes and corporate behavior, but it will also give Republican states unexpected challenges. If the laboratories can’t handle those challenges, they may end up on fire from their own chemical compound.","Chen, Hung-Ju and Fang, I-Hsiang (2011): Migration, Social Security, and Economic Growth.\nDownload (287kB) | Preview\nThis paper studies the effect of population aging on economic performance in an overlapping-generations model with international migration. Fertility is endogenized so that immigrants and natives can have different fertility rates. Fertility is an important determinant to the tax burden of social security since it affects the quantity and quality of future tax payers. We find that introducing immigrants into the economy can reduce the tax burden of social security. If life expectancy (or the replacement ratio) is high enough, the growth rate of GDP per worker for an economy with international migration will be higher than for a closed economy. Regarding migration policies, our numerical results indicate that economic growth rate of GDP per worker will first decrease then increase as the flow of immigrants increases. Increasing the quality of immigrants will enhance economic growth.\n|Item Type:||MPRA Paper|\n|Original Title:||Migration, Social Security, and Economic Growth|\n|Keywords:||Economic growth; Fertility; Migration; Social security.|\n|Subjects:||F - International Economics > F2 - International Factor Movements and International Business > F22 - International Migration\nH - Public Economics > H5 - National Government Expenditures and Related Policies > H55 - Social Security and Public Pensions\nO - Economic Development, Innovation, Technological Change, and Growth > O1 - Economic Development > O15 - Human Resources ; Human Development ; Income Distribution ; Migration\n|Depositing User:||Hung-Ju Chen|\n|Date Deposited:||18.

{"question":"How does moisture content affect the bonding process when using different adhesives to restore clay artifacts? Could you provide a technical analysis of chemical reactions involved? The preservation of ancient ceramics depends on this understanding. 在修复陶器时，水分含量如何影响不同粘合剂的粘合过程？","answer":"Different adhesives interact with moisture in distinct ways during ceramic restoration. Superglue and B72 adhesive require moisture on the surface to create bonds through chemical reactions, but clay pots typically have very little moisture after being fired in kilns, resulting in weak bonds. In contrast, epoxy creates chemical bonds without needing additional moisture and generates heat while curing - though this heat generation makes it potentially damaging to artifacts. Water-soluble adhesives like Elmer's glue work through drying rather than chemical reactions, while rubber cement can be dissolved using alcohol or acetone. Understanding these properties is crucial for selecting appropriate binding agents for conservation work.","context":["Artwork Related to this Lesson\nStudent Learning Objectives\n- Students will identify the skills and technology used by an art conservator.\n- Students will carefully observe fragments of a work of art, identify questions and constraints, and collaboratively design solutions for a reconstruction problem.\n- Students will understand how the physical characteristics of clay affect the selection of the binding agent used during reconstruction.\n- Students will consider how ancient Costa Rican religion and environment influenced cultural products.\n1. Introduce the art museum conservator as a blend of scientist, artist, and historian. Ask students:\n- Why might an art museum need a conservator? (to take care of objects in the collection)\n- What kinds of skills might an art conservator need? (painting/sculpting, knowledge of art history, chemistry)\n- What type of technology might a conservator of art use? (computers, X rays, sampling and analysis of materials)\nTell students they will be solving a real problem that NCMA conservators encountered a few years ago. Show students the image of the reconstructed Crocodile Effigy Vessel and tell them the object was buried in the ground for hundreds of years. Ask:\n- What kinds of conditions was it exposed to over this time? (heat, dirt, microbes, water, handling)\n- How might those conditions have affected the object? (changed the color, caused nicks and breaks, caused the material to become more fragile)\n- Why do you think the object was made of clay rather than some other material? (clay was readily available, easy to shape; wooden objects wouldn’t have lasted that long underground)\n- How did the conservators know what the work of art looked like originally? (comparison with other crocodile effigies and other examples of ancient Costa Rican art)\n- What are some precautions that the conservators had to take when reassembling the work of art? (not altering the appearance, matching the appearance when filling in gaps, preventing any further damage from occurring)\n2. Divide students into groups and tell them that they are to imagine that they are a team of conservators who have the task of putting this broken work of art back together. Give each team a printout of the broken work of art and the background information. Tell the students that they are to complete the examination report after considering the following questions:\n• What does the visual information tell you about the condition and construction of the object?\n• How can the background information give you more information?\n• What material do you think the object is made of? What makes you think that?\n• Upon first impression, what shape do you think this object was? What makes you think that?\n• What questions do you have about the object? Where/How do you plan to find the answers to these questions?\n3. As a homework assignment, have the students explore two or three of the web sites about Costa Rican history and pottery listed in the Lesson Resources section. Instruct them to write a two- to three-paragraph response to the following prompt: Imagine that you are a native of Costa Rica in the time before the Spanish Conquistadors arrived and that you want to create your own ceramic effigy of an animal. Write a story in which you describe your adventures while you dig up the clay from a river bank, shape the effigy, and then fire it in a wood fire. Be sure to include in your story your reason(s) for your choice of animal for the effigy.\n4. Ask students to consider the type of binder they will use to put this work of art back together. Tell them to create a list of criteria for their binder and predict which material will work best. Have them consider the following questions.\n• How long does the binder need to last?\n• Does the material the object is made of require a special type of binder? Is it porous or smooth? Will contact with the binder change the chemical composition of the object?\n• What kinds of conditions will the binder need to withstand? Physical stresses from movement or vibration, temperature, humidity, light exposure?\n• Are there any other constraints that should be taken into consideration when choosing a binder, such as cost, availability, or temperature?\n• Can a binder be too strong?\nPhysical Science Variation\nAsk the students: How do you think glue holds things together? (by filling in the spaces between objects, by chemically reacting with the objects) Elmer’s glue says that it is water soluble; that means that the dried glue will dissolve in water. Do you think that there’s a chemical reaction going on when you use Elmer’s glue? (No, because it just dries out.) Rubber cement is another type of adhesive that holds objects together after drying. Adding alcohol or acetone (fingernail polish remover) will dissolve the rubber cement.\nSuperglue and B72 adhesive are examples of glues that bind objects together by reacting with the water/moisture that is present on the surface of the object. Do you think that there’s a lot of moisture on the surface of a clay pot? (No, it appears very dry. Most clay pots have to be fired in a kiln to convert them into a ceramic.) Do you think these two adhesives are going to form a strong or a weak bond with the pieces of clay pot? (probably a weak bond because there’s not very much water present)\nEpoxy is another type of adhesive that uses a chemical reaction to bind objects together. Unlike Superglue, epoxy doesn’t need any additional ingredient to form chemical bonds and actually generates heat while it is curing. As a conservator, would you want to use an adhesive that generates heat? Why or why not? (No, because the heat might damage the object.)\nTell students the following simulation will help them determine what kind of binder to use. Then give each group of students one small terracotta flowerpot (ideally painted with a design of some sort to simulate the finish on the art object), a towel or cloth, and a hammer. Instruct the students to cover the pot with a towel and break the pot into pieces with one strike of the hammer. Give them a variety of binders, such as Elmer’s glue, rubber cement, Super Glue, epoxy, and B72 adhesive (model airplane glue). Tell the students that they will have to use the scientific process to determine which binder is most effective for reconstruction of the object. Each group will need to create a hypothesis, develop their own test and criteria for judging the binder, make observations, record data, and determine results.

{"question":"Working on a data science project with chiller systems - what's the smart way to preprocess the temperature data to create a good predictive model? 🤔","answer":"The proper preprocessing approach for chiller temperature data involves several steps: 1) Remove data during start/stop operations when temperatures fluctuate and get noisy, 2) Exclude data when chiller status is off, 3) Calculate averages of preprocessed data for 1-hour and 24-hour periods, 4) Calculate mean and standard deviation of each KPI, 5) Remove outliers by keeping only data within 3 standard deviations from the mean, and 6) Identify known maintenance events to form the training dataset around them.","context":["Part 1 – The Machine Data – A Detailed Perspective of Steps for Machine Learning and Predictive Chilled Water System Analytics in Facility Applications\nZLATKO VASILKOSKI, CHIEF SCIENTIST, FACILITYCONNEX\nFacilityConneX Approach to Predictive Analytics\nHere we illustrate an effective FCX predictive methodology for organizations to diagnose and detect events that mandate the need for maintenance of their chillers. Our approach and analytics utilize different machine learning methods and domain knowledge to detect equipment degradation (chillers in this example), which requires maintenance, and perform diagnostics and prognostics.\nThe typical FCX approach to predictive analytics includes the following few steps:\n- Development of probabilistic/statistic predictive model from the given historical data\n- Developing and training relevant machine learning methods\n- Connecting these two with equipment domain knowledge\nChillers and Their Key Performance Indicators\nAir conditioning systems, and particularly chillers, consume a major share of the total energy usage in buildings. In this example – each chiller has two separate water loops, a condenser water loop and an evaporator water loop. In between is a refrigerant loop. The evaporator water loop is connected to the living space from which the heat is absorbed by the condenser water loop and released in the cooling tower that operates in the open.\nTo manage chiller operational and energy efficiency, several key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be identified, monitored and analyzed. The proper data analytics approach is to gather data for all the relevant KPIs and perform exploratory data analysis to narrow down the most relevant KPIs. To do this properly and eliminate any artifacts that may be present in the data we need to perform clever data preprocessing.\nPREPROCESSING THE DATA\nFor example, while observing the chiller data, it may be noticed that during the start and the stop operation of the chiller, the data fluctuates and gets very noisy. This data as well as the data when the chiller status is off should not be used in the training dataset used for creating the historically predictive model of the chiller. An example of this situation is illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe FXC cloud platform collects the chiller data every 15 minutes. A reasonable step in creating the predictive model is to calculate the average of the preprocessed data for a one-hour length period and for a 24-hour period. Once this is done for all the relevant KPIs, the mean and the standard deviation of each KPI are calculated. Based on the results, the data outliers are excluded from the training dataset by just keeping the data that falls within 3 standard deviations from the mean.\nThis step also involves identification of known maintenance events so that we can carefully form the training dataset around them.\nEXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS\nThe objective of exploratory data analysis is to identify the most important KPIs and draw conclusions from the physics involved for a given piece of equipment. One data science approach is to create a correlation table of the KPIs and see which KPIs have the strongest correlation.\nFigure 1. Condenser water temperatures, leaving in blue and entering in green. The chiller status of operations (on/off) is in red. It can be noted that during the start and the stop of operation of the chiller, the temperature data gets very noisy and fluctuates. This data as well as the data during the off status should not be used for creating the historically trained probabilistic model of the chiller.\nIt is desirable to gather data and perform all this analysis on as many pieces of same equipment as possible. By corelating a set of KPI’s for 3 chillers belonging to a FacilityConneX hospital customer, it can be noted that the strongest correlation is among the electric demand, the outside temperature, the chilled water flow and the leaving and the entering temperatures of the evaporator and the condenser water loop.\nAfter making all these steps and identifying these KPIs, for the creation of the train dataset for the predictive model, it is desirable also to create derived KPIs. For this particular case it is desirable to create the following derived KPIs that will be used for training the predictive model:\n- Electric demand in kW/Ton, which combines the electric demand and the water flow into a single KPI.\n- Condenser water temperature difference (entering – leaving).\n- Evaporator (or chilled) water temperature difference (leaving – entering).\nWhile the outside temperature can be kept as it is. In this case we identify the Electric demand in kW/Ton as independent variable that our model needs to predict, while the rest of the KPIs are the dependent variables in the model.\nOnce we have the subset of the derived KPIs, we still need to do some data preparation and cleaning based on the equipment domain knowledge and the physics related to the chillers. We would like to create a baseline of a predictive model that reflects the optimal chiller operation. Once we succeed in that, our model will be able to diagnose poor chiller performance and suggest predictive maintenance.\nTo do this, we need to restrict our training dataset to a range of optimal values which, in this case we took to be the value of the electric demand in kW/Ton smaller than 1. The equipment domain knowledge in this case suggests an optimal value of 0.6 for the electric demand in kW/Ton. This step finalizes the training dataset.\nIn Part 2, you will learn more about the Machine Learning Model and how to leverage the Predictive Results."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d41e4eaa-d528-4c68-9452-da5db4b6f25c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone interested in woodworking and sports history, what material similarities exist between the first basketball hoops and the nesting crosses project?","answer":"Both utilized wooden peach containers in their construction. The first basketball hoops were made from peach crates attached to a railing. The nesting crosses project, while more elaborate, also incorporated wood materials - specifically white oak for the outside cross and ash for the inside cross, with additional wooden elements like plywood backing and dowels for assembly.","context":["Nesting Crosses for Weddings\nThis pair of nesting crosses makes a great wedding gift, and is intended to be used in place of a unity candle or sand ceremony. Once the two crosses are joined (the bride and groom drive dowels into the ends of the cross arms), the only way to separate the two is to destroy the individuals. Kinda symbolic, huh?\nIt stands 141⁄4 \" tall and 101⁄4 \" wide.\nTake the extra step to choose woods that have meaning to the couple. For example, I chose white oak for the outside cross because it's the state tree of Illinois, where the bride was born. The ash for the inside cross came from scraps leftover from the altar furniture that was built for the groom's church several years ago. (I knew the guy who was building the furniture and asked for all his offcuts and was waiting for just the right project for them.)\nWhen the two crosses are joined, the couple can display the cross freestanding, on the stand used to display the\"outside\" cross during the ceremony, or hung on the wall by a sawtooth hanger.\nMaterials or Supplies\nMaterials or Supplies\nStart the outside cross at the head\nPlane stock for your outside cross to 1⁄2 \" thick and rip it to 1\" wide. (I found some white oak with diagonal grain lines that I used to create a \"radiating effect\" from the center of the cross, so I machined almost as twice as much stock as the project requires to give me lots of grain selection and to recut any pieces I mistakenly cut too short.)\nI built a simple clamping jig from two layers of 3⁄4 \" particleboard ripped to 11⁄4 \"--the desired width of the inside cross. That double-thick block was screwed to a base, and all jig parts were covered with clear plastic packing tape to keep the parts from sticking to the jig as they dried.\nThe head and arms are 4\" long (from the heel of one miter to the toe of the other) and the body of the cross is 8\" long heel to toe. I cut both side pieces shown here to identical length, then dry-clamped them into the jig as shown, using a machinist's square to ensure the toes of the miters were even. Then I measured and cut the end piece to fit in between the miters. I cut each end piece just a scosh long, then tested the fit and used a low-angle block plane and miter shooting board to trim it down for a perfect fit.\nApply glue to the miter joints and clamp as shown.\nRepeat for the arms and body\nAfter the glue dries, repeat the process for the arms and body of the cross, with the arms the same size as the head--4\" from head to toe. The body of the cross is 8\" from head to toe (so it protrudes 8\" below the arms). Note the grain lines radiating out from the intersection of the cross.\nNow, pull it all together\nWith all four lobes of the cross assembled separately, it's time to glue them all together to form the cross. I attached a couple more packing-tape-covered blocks to my jig, applied glue to the miter joints, and gently clamped them together as shown. The blocks keep the miter joints from slipping past one another.\nVoila! A holey cross\nNow, it's an inside job\nThe inside cross is made of solid stock joined in the middle with a half-lap joint. Start by ripping a 24\"-long ash blank to 11⁄4 \" wide, and plane it to 13⁄16 \" thick. Again, you may want to machine extra stock at the same time in case you cut the joint too loose. Check the fit of the blank in the recess in the outside cross and adjust if need be. Cut the crossbeam and upright to rough length.\nUse your tablesaw and dado blade to machine a dado in the face of the crosspiece that perfectly matches the width of the upright. With the upright fit in the slot, mark the location of crosspiece on the upright and cut the mating dado in the back of the upright, as shown.\nAssemble the inside cross\nKeeping the crosspiece centered in the outside cross, mark the ends of the crosspiece and cut them to fit. Likewise for the upright. When you're satisfied with the fit, remove the crosspiece and upright and glue them together.\nFit the back\nUsing a router and bearing-guided rabbeting bit, rout a 1⁄4 rabbet 1⁄4 \" deep inside the back of the outside cross. Cut a piece of 1⁄4 \" hardwood veneered plywood to fit inside the rabbet. I raised my tablesaw blade high to keep the stopped cut as vertical as possible, then finished the cut with a handsaw.\nGlue in the back\nUse a belt or disc sander to carefully radius the corners of the plywood back to match the rabbet. Glue the back in place. (The triangular chunk of particleboard is a scrapwood caul to allow clamping pressure in the middle of the cross.)\nFinish-sand both crosses\nI sanded up to 220-grit on both.\nPick your finishes\nI needed the bride and groom's input on this, since they were going to have to live with this symbol of their unity for the rest of their lives. So I used my leftover project stock and tested a number of finishes (including natural Danish Oil, Weathered Wood Accelerator, leftover custom stain from our kitchen cabinets, and more) that I already had on hand on both species. Ultimately, they decided on the kitchen cabinet stain for the outside cross and Danish oil for the inside cross.\nFinish it up\nHere's the final cross combo. I top-coated the outside cross with some rattle-can lacquer after staining.\nBoring the pin holes\nYou want the dowels to fit firmly in the pin holes but not so firmly that the bride and groom need a 3-pound sledge on the altar. So, after you get your dowels, drill test holes in scrap and test the fit of the dowel in the hole. I chose a bit that allowed my to push the dowel partway in with firm pressure, but so that I could still pull it out with a pliers.\nBe sure to do the math! You don't want the visible peg in the outside cross too off-center, but you also don't want to miss or just catch the edge of the inside cross. For my cross, I centered the hole 19⁄32 \" from the back edge of the outside cross, which was only 3⁄32 \" off center.\nWhen you drill the cross itself, clamp the crosses together before drilling, and bore just a little deeper than the dowel length--you don't want the dowel to stop before it's fully seated. I taped over the end of the workpiece to minimize tearout and protect the finished surface around the hole. I used a nylon stop collar on the bit to set the 2\" drilling depth.\nSand a slight taper on one end of each dowel to make insertion easier, and dip the other end in matching stain to minimize its visibility in the final project.\nOh! Almost forgot the stands\nAbout the time I finished, I realized I need to make some display stands for the crosses when they were on the altar during the wedding. This is some 1⁄2 \" thick white oak I ripped to 31⁄4 \" wide. I cut 3\" off one end for the base, cut the next piece about 7\" long, and the last piece about 4\" long, which became the back brace. In each middle piece, I plowed a 1⁄8 \" deep groove as wide as the outside cross upright in one, and as wide as the inside cross upright in the other. I then notched each base to fit into the groove.\nAssemble the stands\nHere's what they look like all glued together.\nThe final product\nAnd here's how the crosses looked in their stands. Once they're assembled, the inside cross stand is done (I may save it for the next wedding), but I sent the outside cross stand with the couple so they could display it freestanding if they want.","- 1 What was the first basketball hoop made out of?\n- 2 How did James Naismith invent the game of basketball?\n- 3 Why is a basketball hoop 10 feet?\n- 4 How can you tell if a hoop is 10 feet?\n- 5 Why is the basketball rim orange?\n- 6 Are you allowed to dribble with 2 hands?\n- 7 What is the safest shot in basketball?\n- 8 What are the 13 original rules of basketball?\n- 9 What is the oldest sport?\n- 10 Can you dunk 5 10?\n- 11 Who was the shortest player in the NBA?\n- 12 Is NBA rim bigger than college?\n- 13 What is the height of NBA ring?\n- 14 How tall is a basketball ball?\n- 15 Are NBA hoops higher?\nWhat was the first basketball hoop made out of?\nBasketball was basically invented to keep students active during long chilly months. The first hoop consisted of a peach crate attached to a ten-foot-high railing and players aimed a ball into it.\nHow did James Naismith invent the game of basketball?\nNaismith called his new game “ basket ball ” and wrote up 13 rules. Two peach baskets and a soccer ball were the equipment. Naismith put the baskets at each end of the gym, nailed 10 feet above the floor. On December 21, 1891, the game of basketball was born in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nWhy is a basketball hoop 10 feet?\nThe reason the basket is 10 – feet high is because that’s how high the track above the gym was where Naismith invented the game and nailed peach baskets to it. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s one of the great historical stories of the game, of course, but that’s hardly a reason to keep it from changing.\nHow can you tell if a hoop is 10 feet?\nHave one person climb the ladder and place one end on the tape measure at the front tip of the rim so it is even with the TOP side of the rim. Drop the tape measure straight down to the playing surface to check the distance. The tape measure should read 10 feet for regulation basketball, typically ages 11 and older.\nWhy is the basketball rim orange?\nEveryone else knows nothing about this sport. According to wiki answers, its because “the man who coached the first basketball game wore an orange shirt to every game and when he passed away in his honor they colored the hoop orange “.\nAre you allowed to dribble with 2 hands?\nNothing in the rulebook that says a player cannot start a dribble with two hands. A dribble can end when touching both hands simultaneously, but a single dribble is OK as long as you catch the ball.\nWhat is the safest shot in basketball?\nSafest shot in general is the free throw.

These include:\n- Parkinsonism – slowness of movement, increased rigidity in the arms and/or legs, problems with walking\n- Weakness or sensory changes affecting one side of the body\n- Problems with speech, swallowing, double vision or other “focal” neurologic symptoms\n- Loss of ability to perform learned motor movements\n- Inattention to visual or sensory stimuli on one side (e.g., ignoring these things on the left side of the body)\nLearn more about the treatment for Autoimmune Encephalopathy.\nDementia is the name for a group of brain conditions that make it harder to remember, reason, and communicate. Dementia is a descriptive term rather than a diagnosis. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer disease. Other types include vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. Years ago, dementia was often called “senility.” It was even thought to be a normal part of aging. We now know that it’s not normal. It’s caused by ongoing damage to cells in the brain.\nSymptoms differ depending on which parts of the brain are affected and the stage of the disease. The most common symptoms include:\n- Memory loss, including trouble with directions and familiar tasks\n- Language problems, such as trouble getting words out or understanding what is said\n- Difficulty with planning, organizing, concentration, and judgment. This includes people not being able to recognize their own symptoms.\n- Changes in behavior and personality\nDementia is a progressive disease. This means it gets worse over time. Symptoms differ for each person, but there are 3 basic stages. Each may last from months to years:\n- In the early stage, a person may seem forgetful, confused, or have changes in behavior. However, he or she may still be able to handle most tasks without help.\n- In the middle stage, more and more help is needed with daily tasks. A person may have trouble recognizing friends and family members, wander, or get lost in familiar places. He or she may also become restless or moody.\n- In the late stage, Alzheimer’s can cause severe problems with memory, judgment, and other skills. Help is needed with nearly every aspect of daily life.\nLearn more about the treatment of dementia.\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD), a common cause of dementia, is a group of disorders that occur when nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain are lost. This causes the lobes to shrink. FTD can affect behavior, personality, language, and movement.\nThese disorders are among the most common dementias that strike at younger ages. Symptoms typically start between the ages of 40 and 65, but FTD can strike young adults and those who are older. FTD affects men and women equally.\nThe most common types of FTD are:\nFrontal variant. This form of FTD affects behavior and personality.\nPrimary progressive aphasia. Aphasia means difficulty communicating. This form has two subtypes: Progressive nonfluent aphasia, which affects the ability to speak. Semantic dementia, which affects the ability to use and understand language.\nA less common form of FTD affects movement, causing symptoms similar to Parkinson disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease).\nThe cause of FTD is unknown. Researchers have linked certain subtypes of FTD to mutations on several genes. Some people with FTD have tiny structures, called Pick bodies, in their brain cells. Pick bodies contain an abnormal amount or type of protein.\nDamage to the frontal lobe of the brain may impact important functions. Common symptoms involve dramatic changes in behavior and personality. These may include:\n- An increased tendency to make socially inappropriate comments or actions\n- Decreased empathy, or new difficulties understanding how one’s actions may impact others\n- Difficulties with logical judgments or understanding the relationship between cause and effect\n- Changes in sexual behaviors\n- Aggressive behaviors or actions\n- Decline in personal hygiene, toileting habits, etc.\n- Severe mental rigidity\n- Language abnormalities, such as being unable to express language, find words or understand the meaning of words\n- Inattention, increased distractibility or a tendency to jump from one topic to another\n- Difficulty initiating or completing tasks\n- Significant changes in eating patterns\nIn addition to cognitive impairments, neurologic symptoms may occur including:\n- Parkinsonism: slowness of movement (bradykinesia), increased rigidity in the arms and/or legs, problems with walking (short stride length or a “shuffling” gait)\n- Muscle spasms and/or rippling of the muscles underneath the skin\nLearn more about the treatment for Frontotemporal Dementia.\nDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a form of progressive dementia caused by degeneration of the tissues in the brain. DLB may be genetic, but it is not always clear why someone develops it.\nPeople with DLB have a buildup of abnormal protein particles in their brain tissue, called Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are also found in the brain tissue of people with Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease (AD). However, in these conditions, the Lewy bodies are generally found in different parts of the brain.\nThe presence of Lewy bodies in DLB, PD, and AD suggests a connection among these conditions. But scientists haven’t yet figured out what the connection is.\nDLB affects a person’s ability to think, reason, and process information. It can also affect movement, personality and memory. DLB becomes more prevalent with age. It often starts when a person is in his or her 60s and 70s. DLB is progressive, which means it continues to develop over time. There are several types of dementia with different causes.\nThe main sign of DLB is a progressive decline in things like memory, thinking, and problem solving. This decline is enough to affect the ability to work and do normal daily activities. Although memory may be affected, it isn’t usually as impaired as in someone with Alzheimer disease.\nDLB is generally diagnosed when at least 2 of the following features are also present with dementia:\n- Changes in attention and alertness. These changes may last for hours or days. Signs of these changes include staring into space, lethargy, drowsiness, and disorganized speech.\n- Visual hallucinations. These hallucinations recur and are very detailed. They generally don’t bother the person having them.\n- Movement symptoms consistent with Parkinson disease (PD), such as slow movement, shuffling gait, rigidity, and falls. The person may also have tremors, but not as pronounced as in a person with PD with dementia.\nOther signs and symptoms seen in DLB include:\n- Sleep disorder that affects REM sleep, causing vivid dreams with body movement\n- Dizziness, feeling lightheaded, fainting, or falling\n- Urinary incontinence\nIn DLB, memory problems often occur later in the disease. DLB can be confused with other forms of dementia, but it also has unique features, such as hallucinations and delirium.\nLearn more about the treatment for Dementia with Lewy Bodies.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal thinking and memory (cognition) and dementia. Patients with mild cognitive impairment can have difficulty with memory, language, thinking and judgment that are greater than would be expected for their age. People with MCI may be at an increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease.\nPatients with a family history of Alzheimer’s and dementia are at greater risk for developing MCI. Other risk factors include age, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and hypothyroidism.\nLearn more about the treatment for mild cognitive impairment.\nVascular cognitive impairment is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer disease. It’s caused when decreased blood flow damages brain tissue. Blood flow to brain tissue may be reduced by a partial blockage or completely blocked by a blood clot.\nSymptoms of vascular dementia may develop gradually, or may become apparent after a stroke or major surgery, such as heart bypass surgery or abdominal surgery.\nDementia and other related diseases and conditions are hard to tell apart because they share similar signs and symptoms. Although vascular dementia is caused by problems with blood flow to the brain, this blood flow problem can develop differently. Examples of vascular dementia include:\n- Mixed dementia. This type occurs when symptoms of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s exist.\n- Multi-infarct dementia. This occurs after repeated small, often “silent,” blockages affect blood flow to a certain part of the brain. The changes that occur after each blockage may not be apparent, but over time, the combined effect starts to cause symptoms of impairment. Multi-infarct dementia is also called vascular cognitive impairment.\nThe effect of decreased or no blood flow on the brain depends on the size and location of the area affected. If a very small area in a part of the brain that controls memory is affected, for example, you may be “forgetful” but it doesn’t necessarily change your ability to carry on normal activities. If a larger area is affected, you may have trouble thinking clearly or solving problems, or greater memory problems that do change your ability to function normally.\nVascular dementia is caused by a lack of blood flow to a part of the brain. Blood flow may be decreased or interrupted by:\n- Blood clots\n- Bleeding because of a ruptured blood vessel (such as from a stroke)\n- Damage to a blood vessel from atherosclerosis, infection, high blood pressure, or other causes, such as an autoimmune disorder\nSymptoms of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) differ from the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Given the varied definitions of VCI, it is not surprising that clinical symptoms vary significantly in individual patients.\nThe symptoms of vascular dementia depend on the location and amount of brain tissue involved. Vascular dementia symptoms may appear suddenly after a stroke, or gradually over time. Symptoms may get worse after another stroke, a heart attack, or major surgery. These are signs and symptoms of vascular dementia\n- Increased trouble carrying out normal daily activities because of problems with concentration, communication, or inability to carry out instructions\n- Memory problems, although short-term memory may not be affected\n- Confusion, which may increase at night (known as “sundown syndrome”)\n- Stroke symptoms, such as sudden weakness and trouble with speech\n- Personality changes\n- Mood changes, such as depression or irritability\n- Stride changes when walking too fast, shuffling steps\n- Problems with movement and/or balance\n- Urinary problems, such as urgency or incontinence\nLearn more about the treatment for Vascular Cognitive Impairment.","How is Alzheimer’s Disease Treated?\nAlzheimer’s disease is a complex disease, and no single “magic bullet” is likely to prevent or cure it. That’s why current treatments focus on several different issues, including helping people maintain mental function, managing behavioral symptoms, and slowing Alzheimer’s disease.\nAlzheimer’s disease research has developed to a point where scientists can look beyond treating symptoms to think about delaying or preventing Alzheimer’s disease by addressing the underlying disease process. Scientists are looking at many possible interventions, including treatments for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, immunization therapy, cognitive training, changes in diet, and physical activity.\nWhat drugs are currently available to treat Alzheimer’s disease?\nNo treatment has been proven to stop Alzheimer’s disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved four drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease. For people with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s disease, donepezil (Aricept®), rivastigmine (Exelon®), or galantamine (Razadyne®) may help maintain cognitive abilities and help control certain behavioral symptoms for a few months to a few years. Donepezil can be used for severe Alzheimer’s disease as well. Another drug, memantine (Namenda®), is used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. However, these drugs don’t stop or reverse Alzheimer’s disease and appear to help patients only for months to a few years.\nThese drugs work by regulating neurotransmitters, the chemicals that transmit messages between neurons. They may help maintain thinking, memory, and speaking skills and may help with certain behavioral problems.\nOther medicines may ease the behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease: sleeplessness, agitation, wandering, anxiety, anger, and depression. Treating these symptoms often makes patients more comfortable and makes their care easier for caregivers.\nNo published study directly compares the four approved Alzheimer’s disease drugs. Because they work in a similar way, it is not expected that switching from one of these drugs to another will produce significantly different results. However, an Alzheimer’s disease patient may respond better to one drug than another.\nWhat potential new treatments are being researched?\nNIA, part of the National Institutes of Health, is the federal agency for Alzheimer’s disease research. NIA-supported scientists are testing a number of drugs and other interventions to see if they prevent Alzheimer’s disease, slow the disease, or help reduce symptoms.\nScientists are very interested in the toxic effects of beta-amyloid–a part of amyloid precursor protein found in deposits (plaques) in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Studies have moved forward to the point that researchers are carrying out preliminary tests in humans aimed at removing beta-amyloid, halting its formation, or breaking down early formation before it can become harmful. For example, in a clinical trial sponsored by NIA, scientists are testing whether “passive” immunization with an FDA-approved drug called IGIV can successfully treat people with Alzheimer’s.\nThe aging process\nSome age-related changes may worsen Alzheimer’s disease damage in the brain. Researchers think that inflammation may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease. Studies have suggested that common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) might help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but clinical trials so far have not shown a benefit from these drugs. Researchers are continuing to look at how other NSAIDs might affect the development or progression of Alzheimer’s disease.\nScientists are also looking at free radicals, which are oxygen or nitrogen molecules that combine easily with other molecules. The production of free radicals can damage nerve cells. The discovery that beta-amyloid generates free radicals in some Alzheimer’s disease plaques is a potentially significant finding in the quest to understand Alzheimer’s disease.\nHeart disease and diabetes\nResearch has begun to tease out relationships between Alzheimer’s disease and vascular diseases, which affect the body’s blood vessels. Some scientists have found that some chronic conditions that affect the vascular system, such as heart disease and diabetes, have been tied to declines in cognitive function or increased Alzheimer’s disease risk. Several clinical trials are studying whether treatments for these diseases can improve memory and thinking skills in people with Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment.\nA number of studies suggest that factors such as a healthy diet, exercise, and social engagement may be related to the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. For example, emerging evidence suggests that physical activity might be good for our brains as well as our hearts and waistlines. Some studies in older people have shown that higher levels of exercise are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Clinical trials are underway to study the relationship of exercise to healthy brain aging and the development of Alzheimer’s disease.\nScientists have also studied whether diet may help preserve cognitive function or reduce Alzheimer’s disease risk. Some studies have found that the “Mediterranean diet” is associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease. To confirm the results, scientists are conducting clinical trials to examine the relationship between specific dietary components and cognitive function and Alzheimer’s disease.\nStudies are looking into many other possible treatments, including hormones and cognitive training, to see if they might improve thinking skills in people with Alzheimer’s disease or even prevent Alzheimer’s disease in people who are at risk.\nWhat are clinical trials?\nPeople who want to help scientists test possible treatments may be able to take part in clinical trials, which are research studies that test the safety, side effects, or effectiveness of a medication or other intervention in humans. Study volunteers help scientists learn about the brain in healthy aging as well as what happens in Alzheimer’s disease. Results of Alzheimer’s disease clinical trials are used to improve prevention and treatment approaches."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2b1797b3-9031-41b9-82e8-b70ad51c668d>","<urn:uuid:0f294026-6a17-44dd-8369-19460ba33a23>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare the evidence for liquid activity between Mars's Coprates Chasma and Pluto's subsurface? I'm interested in understanding potential water presence on both bodies.","answer":"Both celestial bodies show interesting evidence of liquid activity. On Mars, researchers Harrison and Chapman found strong evidence for a past lake in Coprates Chasma, with features including benches at expected lake levels and fluvial erosion marks, suggesting a body of water comparable to Earth's Caspian and Black Seas. On Pluto, while there's no surface liquid, scientists theorize the existence of a subsurface ocean created by ancient impact heat. This ocean likely persists due to a feedback loop where freezing increases ammonia concentration, which acts as an antifreeze. This subsurface ocean could potentially drive icy plate tectonics and explain Pluto's unexpected geological activity.","context":["The more of Pluto’s surface we see, the more interesting landscapes it offers us to explore. Here’s a closer look at the landforms revealed so far, and what types of processes might have created them.\nThis beautiful animation of hitching a ride on New Horizons as it soared over Tombaugh Regio, the massive heart of Pluto, is beautiful, but what’s the science of the landforms revealed during the close-approach flyby on July 14, 2015. In it, we got our first look at the newly-named icy mountains Norgay Montes, and bumpy plains Sputnik Planum. Now we’re going to dive into the geomorphology of how these landforms might have been created.\nThe Norgay Montes and Sputnik Planum are in the southwest of Pluto’s Tombaugh Regio.\nWhen a geoscientist looks at a brand-new terrain, the first thing they do is look around for any landforms that look like something they might have seen before. So, what are we seeing?\nFirst, a warning: these are the initial, highly compressed images sent home by the failsafe downlinks. That means they have processing artifacts. We’ll get the lossless versions of these images later when New Horizons switches from primarily observing to primarily downloading data.\nAll the images were captured when the New Horizons spacecraft was just 77,000 kilometers (48,000 miles) from Pluto’s surface. Features as small as 1 kilometer (0.5 miles) can be seen.\nThe (Lack of) Craters in Tombaugh Regio\nWhen we took our first look at the geomorphology of Charon, we found plains, craters, cracks, hills, and a truly mysterious sunken mountain. While that was interesting, Pluto is getting even more attention by what it doesn’t have in its close ups: craters.\nMosaic of the Norgay Montes and Sputnik Planum are in the southwest of Tombaugh Regio seen from approximately 77,000 kilometers above the surface of Pluto. Image credit: NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI\nThe first thing that jumps out is an absence of craters, even with more of the Sputnik Planum to scour. Based on normal cratering rates, that dates the plains to being recently surfaced within the last 100 million years. For context, that’s younger than Appalachian Mountains. To be craterless, Pluto has to-be-determined active geologic processes resurfacing the world in the recent past. This is hugely unexpected. (Really: it left me flailing).\nA geologically active Pluto breaks our theories of activity on icy worlds. We thought the only way to get that kind of geological activity was tidal massage from a friendly neighbourhood gas giant. The closest Pluto has is Charon, its largest moon. Charon lacks the gravitational influence to jerk around Pluto’s interior enough to spur activity both because of its small size and because it is tidally locked. Being tidally locked means the two worlds always face each other as they dance around their mutual center of mass, minimizing tidal stresses.\nThat leaves rethinking how thermodynamics apply at the dwarf planet. Pluto should be too cold to be active, but it isn’t. The best options for revising our theories are that its initial heat source lasted longer than anticipated through a yet-to-be-described process, that heat was stored, or that the heat is used more efficiently.\nIf Pluto is made of the normal mix of silicate minerals for a rocky world in our solar system, then we’d expect that it’s radioactive elements have decayed enough to no longer be a significant heating source. It’s likely that Pluto and Charon collided in the past, the stability, circularity, and tidal equilibrium of their orbits indicate any collisions were a long time ago, so that isn’t a recent heat source either. But, there could be a loophole: the heat of impact could have created a subsurface ocean. Once a subsurface ocean forms on an icy world, it’s likely to stick around a long time due to a convenient feedback loop. Freezing increases the concentration of ammonia, a natural antifreeze that inhibits further freezing. A subsurface ocean could store a lot of heat, possibly even driving icy plate tectonics. This idea was predicted by astrophysicists Amy Barr Mlinar and Geoffrey Collins, who are hopping we find any evidence of ancient tectonic features on Pluto or Charon to support their theory of an impact-generated subsurface ocean.\nA Carbon Monoxide Bulge in Tombaugh Regio\nIn the first map of frozen carbon monoxide concentration shows one very distinctive bulge in the Tombaugh Regio. This matches up with the red half splitting the heart of Pluto from the enhanced color image released last week. The concentrations increase towards the center of the contoured bull’s eye.\nThe Ralph image detected a bulge of carbon monoxide in the western lobe of Tombaugh Regio. Image credit: NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI\nWe don’t know what this concentration means yet, nor why it’s happening only in Tombaugh Regio and no where else, but it is deeply suspicious that it’s also in a region that seems to be actively resurfacing.\nThe Icy Peaks of Norgay Montes\nAlong the boundary between the light heart of Pluto and the darker whale — now known as the Tombaugh Regio and Cthulhu Regio respectively — is a respectable mountain range. Norgay Montes are named for Tenzing Norgay, the sherpa who summited Mount Everest with Edmund Hillary in 1953.\nNorgay Montes from 77,000 kilometers away. Image credit: NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI\nThe spiked peaks jut up to 3,300 meters (11,000 feet) above the oddly-craterless plains. For context, those are mountains that are on par with the Rockies here on Earth, no rescaling necessary.\nThis is the first exposed bedrock (or more accurately, “bed ice”) of Pluto. We haven’t definitively nailed down its composition yet, but to hold such rugged topography, it needs to be hard. The current best-guess is water ice, which at Putonian temperatures is far harder than the methane and nitrogen ice.\nThe Bumpy Plains of Sputnik Planum\nThe sprawling plains north of Norgay Montes stretch up into the center of Tombaugh Regio. Now we’re seeing them in more detail, Sputnik Planum is getting decidedly more interesting. The plains are named for Sputnik 1, the original space explorer and the first artificial satellite.\nZoomed-in on oddly textured ground in Sputnik Planum.\nTalking about the Sputnik Planum is going to involve a lot of hand-waving. We’re in good company with our confusion — the New Horizons Geology and Geophysics lead Jeff Moore described these images as:\nThis terrain is not easy to explain. The discovery of vast, craterless, very young plains on Pluto exceeds all pre-flyby expectations.\nSputnik Planum from 77,000 kilometers away. Image credit: NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI\nThe coolest part of Sputnik Planum is easily the lack of craters indicates apparent resurfacing in the past 100 million years, the barest blink on geologic timescales.\nThe odd pattern texturing the plains is also fascinating. Sputnik Planum is divided into irregular shapes by narrow toughs. The segments are roughly 20 kilometers (12 miles) across. Some of the troughs are traced with a darker material, while others have clumps of hills. A few of the troughs have clumps of hills. They’re probably either pushed up from below, or are somehow erosion-resistent knobs.\nThe mission scientists have proposed two processes for creating this segments: one by cooling, the other by heating. When an area cools, thermal contraction creates roughly hexagonal segments like we see in mud cracks and columnar basalts. Alternately, these could be upwelled lumps from subsurface convection of frozen carbon monoxide, methane, and nitrogen.To me, the areas superficially resembles the patterned ground found in periglacial terrains here on Earth, but that’s not particularly helpful since how that landform is created is an ongoing geomorphological debate and it’s certainly not a freeze-thaw on Pluto.\nAn annotated look at the oddly textured ground of Sputnik Planum. Image credit: NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI\nClusters of pits etch some patches of the surface. These resemble the fields of pits formed when ice sublimates from a solid directly to an gas — see this for yourself by watching dry ice bubble into spooky fog.\nLong, dark streaks on Sputnik Planum may be evidence of wind and subsequent aeolian processes. Image credit: NASA TV\nElsewhere, long dark streaks stretch several kilometers (a few miles), all apparently aligned in the same direction off of larger dark regions. These may be windblown traces, produced as wind scours the surface of the icy plains. They could also be geysers, the sought-after evidence of cryovolcanism.\nThis is Just the Beginning\nWe’ve only gotten back the tiniest bit of data from the New Horizons probe: these are the merest handful of compressed images out of the hundreds of full, lossless images still aboard the spacecraft. Because the spacecraft can only observe the dwarf planetary system or point at Earth to downlink data, the mission is currently focused on maximizing science out of the flyby. Even so, these tantalizing hints keep producing more and more enigmatic landscapes.\nThe more we see of the surfaces of Charon and Pluto, the more geomorphic riddles we find to puzzle over. I don’t know what we’re going to see next, but I’m going to love finding out!\nCurious about Pluto but don’t know where to start in the deluge of New Horizons discoveries?

Landslide deposits of enormous size are visible at left, near the junction with Melas Chasma, and at various locations from center to right. Several smaller chasmata and catenae parallel Coprates Chasma to its south.\nCoprates Chasma (/ /) is a huge canyon in the Coprates quadrangle of Mars, located at 13.4° south latitude and 61.4° west longitude, part of the Valles Marineris canyon system. It is 966 km (600 mi) long and was named after a classical albedo feature name. It was named from the classical Greek name for the Dez River in Persia.\nNear 60° W is the deepest point of the Valles Marineris system (as well as its lowest point by elevation) at 11 km (36,000 ft) below the surrounding plateau. Eastward from here there is about a 0.03 degree upward slope before reaching the outflow channels, which means that if you filled the canyon with fluid, it would create a lake with a depth of 1 km (3,300 ft) before the fluid would overflow out onto the northern plains.\nKeith Harrison and Mary Chapman described strong evidence for a lake in the eastern part of Valles Marineris, especially in Coprates Chasma. It would have had an average depth of only 842 m—much smaller than the 5–10 km depth of parts of Valles Marineris. Still, its volume of 110,000 cubic miles would be comparable to Earth’s Caspian and Black Seas. The main evidence for such a lake is the presence of benches at the level that models show is where the lake level should be. Also, the low point in Eos Chasma where water would be expected to overflow is marked by fluvial features. The features look like the flow came together at a small point and carried out significant erosion.\nRecurrent slope lineae\n- \"Planetary Names: Chasma, chasmata: Coprates Chasma on Mars\" (in en). http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/1302;jsessionid=DF387ED174AF21E6F11F99C4D4044B62.\n- Cattermole, Peter John (2001).

In contrast, other cities typically manage stormwater through either combined sewer systems (in older cities) or separate storm sewer systems (MS4s in newer developments). Both approaches face challenges - Atlanta focuses on managing non-point source pollution and impervious surface runoff, while other cities must deal with either CSO events in combined systems or implementing water quality treatment in MS4s.","context":["Office of Watershed Protection\nTodd S. Hill, P.E., LEED AP, EnvSP\nThe Office of Watershed Protection is responsible for the development and implementation of the environmental compliance and inspection programs including natural resource management, water resources protection, water quality management, monitoring, and analysis, industrial pretreatment, stormwater compliance, permit and regulatory compliance, and regional water resource planning.\nWhat is a watershed?\nA watershed is the area of land from which all rainfall (runoff) drains into a body of water. A watershed is like a funnel—collecting all the water within the drainage area and channeling it into a waterway.\nThe City of Atlanta’s geography is unique in that it is one of the few cities to be located on a subcontinental divide. That means that rain that falls in the northern and western areas of the City drains into the Chattahoochee River and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico; while rain that falls in the southern and eastern parts of the City drains into the Ocmulgee River and, eventually, the Atlantic Ocean. The Chattahoochee River collects drainage from seven watersheds in the City including Long Island, Nancy, Peachtree, Proctor, Sandy, Utoy and Camp creeks. The Ocmulgee River collects drainage from three watersheds in the City including South River and Sugar and Intrenchment creeks.\nWhy Are Watersheds Important?\nHealthy watersheds are essential for providing clean drinking water, recreational activities and wildlife habitat. Additionally, most water pollution control efforts addressed point source pollution commonly associated with industrial activities and sewage treatment plants. While these regulations have become effective at controlling point source pollution, we have come to learn that non-point source pollution (stormwater runoff) is the leading cause of water quality problems.\nAs land in a watershed is developed, natural areas are converted to impervious surfaces such as streets, sidewalks and parking lots. Stormwater that would normally soak into the ground becomes runoff. While some stormwater runoff is normal, the increased volume of runoff associated with impervious surfaces can cause streambank erosion, flooding, property damage and even the loss of life. Additionally, this runoff can pick up pollutants such as sediment and chemicals and dump them directly to the streams and rivers we depend on to sustain life. Because land, and the water that runs over and through it, are intimately connected, a watershed approach to managing water quality is important. A watershed approach considers all the activities within a landscape that affect watershed health. A watershed approach is essential to protecting, restoring and maintaining healthy ecosystems.\nHow is the City Protecting Watersheds?\nThe City of Atlanta is committed to protecting our watersheds and improving the environment. Several efforts are under way to reclaim and protect Atlanta’s streams.\n• Greenspace Protection\n• Green Infrastructure\n• Streambank Stabilization\n• Flood Prevention\n• Storm Sewer Infrastructure Maintenance\nSoil Erosion and Sedimentation\n• Grease Management\n• Combined Sewer Overflow Tunnels\n• Industrial Pretreatment Program\n• Remote Monitoring Program\n• Fish Consumption Guidelines\nWhat Can I Do?\nThere are many things that you can do at home or work to help protect and enhance the health of our watersheds. The Metro North Georgia Clean Water Campaign web site has many excellent suggestions.\nSite Development Plan Review Division (land disturbance permits, plan review): 404-330-6249\nReport a stormwater or flooding issue: 404-546-0311\nFats, Oils and Grease Management: 404-546-1400\nOffice of Watershed Protection\nCity of Atlanta Department of Watershed Management\n72 Marietta Street, SW\nAtlanta, Georgia 30303","A city’s stormwater management goals are generally rooted in regulatory requirements for water quality under the Clean Water Act. City objectives and strategies vary based on the type and capacity of the sewer system, the risk of local flooding, and the need to comply with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits.\nSome cities discharge their stormwater into pipes that also receive and convey wastewater or sanitary sewer flows. These types of systems are called combined sewer systems and are most commonly found in older cities; new developments do not build combined sewer systems.\nCombined sewer systems are typically connected to wastewater treatment plants that then discharge treated water into a receiving water body. However, during heavy rains, water flows can overwhelm the infrastructure capacity. When pipes and treatment plants are unable to manage the flows, water is discharged directly into receiving water bodies without being treated, in an event called a Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO).\nDepending upon an agency’s permit requirements with EPA, the number of CSO events that can occur at each overflow point varies. Many agencies that have CSOs exceeding EPA’s overflow thresholds are utilizing bioretention facilities and other green stormwater infrastructure (with and without gray storage facilities) to come into regulatory compliance by reducing the volume of stormwater runoff that reaches the combined system, and therefore reducing the frequency and volume of CSO events.\nCurrent gray stormwater infrastructure guidelines require that stormwater runoff be collected and conveyed separately from sanitary sewer lines. In municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), stormwater runoff is often discharged into receiving water bodies with limited or no water quality treatment.\nMost cities have MS4 Permits which require new development and redevelopment projects to install water quality treatment facilities and/or flow control facilities prior to discharging runoff into receiving water bodies. The permits may also require retrofits to existing sites or streets to treat and reduce runoff.\nGreen stormwater infrastructure is a cost-effective way to come into compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as creating other ecological and social benefits. EPA strongly encourages the use of green infrastructure to manage stormwater and meet federal water quality requirements.1 Green infrastructure projects are generally designed to complement gray infrastructure systems performing a combination of volume management, water quality improvement, and flood control.\nSince the volume of stormwater runoff increases as impervious surface area increases, the two major strategies related to volume management are to increase pervious area or to divert runoff into the green infrastructure system. Green stormwater infrastructure systems are designed to convert surface area from impervious to permeable, and reduce the volume of runoff that reaches the sewer system or downstream water bodies, reducing the burden on gray infrastructure systems and infiltrating stormwater runoff directly back into the soil. Green infrastructure projects and programs set specific stormwater volume management goals, such as the first inch of rainfall on a given area.\nStormwater runoff from streets carries sediment, debris, chemicals, and pollutants (such as heavy metals from brake pads, oil dripping from engines, and grit from tires). Green stormwater infrastructure projects are designed to capture pollutants in runoff and prevent them from reaching downstream water bodies. Water quality treatment requirements vary based on the type of receiving water body (ocean, salt water bay, river, stream, wetland, or lake) as well as its existing condition. Green infrastructure projects often set a specific water quality goal, such as removing 80% of total suspended solids (TSS).\nEspecially heavy rainstorms can cause combined sewer overflow events as well as flooded streets, parking lots, private property, and basements. Green stormwater infrastructure programs aim to reduce peak flow rates and mitigate flooding. Cities may design to accommodate the high runoff flows and flood risks of a given peak storm event, such as a ten-year storm (a storm that has a 10% chance of occurring in any given year)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bf7bd19a-81dd-4cbf-9350-d6c0616a568b>","<urn:uuid:10175a4b-564b-49ad-be9e-f7aad535ddef>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What conservation strategies have been most effective in protecting endangered species in Asia?","answer":"Several effective conservation strategies have been documented in Asia. In Nepal, the Red Panda Network implements community-based conservation through eco-tourism initiatives, sustainable forest management, and awareness-building programs. These create income for local families through homestays and nature guide services while promoting environmental stewardship. Similarly successful approaches have been used for other Asian species - for example, government intervention and conservation organization partnerships helped increase Indian Rhino populations from under 200 to over 3,000. For Asian elephants, which number 40,000 to 50,000 in the wild, habitat preservation has been crucial, as it has been for giant pandas in China, where coordinated breeding programs have also increased the captive population from 100 to over 400 individuals.","context":["RED PANDA NETWORK (RPN) IS WELL INTO ITS SECOND YEAR OF EXPANDING PROGRAMS INTO WESTERN NEPAL AND THE LOCAL RESPONSE HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO SEE THE LIVELIHOOD BENEFITS OF CONSERVATION.\nThe mountain forests of Western Nepal are particularly important as they constitute more than half of the habitat available to red pandas in the country. In 2017, RPN launched conservation programs in Jumla, Jajarkot and Kalikot districts and is now in the process of extending to Dolpa, Rukum (East and West), and Rolpa.\nTo kickoff efforts in Rolpa (Thursday, March 7th) RPN organized a workshop, ‘Community-based Red Panda Conservation in Western Nepal’. The event was held in the district headquarters of Liwang and was coordinated in collaboration with the Human Rights Awareness Centre (HURAC-Nepal), RPN’s local partner organization in Rolpa. In attendance were representatives from the local District Coordination Committee, Sunchahari rural municipality, Divisional Forest Office (DFO), HURAC-Nepal, Rural Development and Awareness Society, and RPN. Attendees shared project information and discussed objectives.\nParticipants of workshop in Liwang, Rolpa.\nPresently, forests are highly fragmented in Nepal’s western complex. “The project will help to improve habitat connectivity through sustainable forest management,” said Saroj Shrestha, RPN’s Project Coordinator. He stresses the need for more data on red panda distribution and status of habitat in this region.\nThe first presence of red pandas in the Rolpa district (along with a study on parasitic infections) was confirmed by RPN in 2013. A national baseline survey conducted by RPN in 2016 estimated that nearly 53 percent of the country’s total red panda habitat is located in Western Nepal. A total of 24 districts reported the presence of red pandas during the survey.\n“Rolpa has the potential to become an ecotourism hub,” stated DFO officer, Krishna Prasad Dhakal, during the inception workshop. Krishna continues, “if we protect the red pandas.” He went on to state that the DFO is committed to cooperating in any way needed to achieve conservation goals.\nAnother workshop participant, Ash Bahadur Gurung, chairperson of Sunchahari Rural Municipality in Rolpa emphasized the need for collaborative awareness-building programs. “In some villages, people might kill and eat wildlife—including red panda—out of ignorance. We need to reach out and help them to understand the importance of rare wildlife found inside their forests,” Gurung said.\nEcotourism initiatives can make a huge impact when it comes to conservation. RPN’s red panda eco-trips create income for local families as travelers utilize homestay and nature guide services. These new sources of livelihood support are becoming sustainable alternatives to activities that exploit and degrade the forests. As the local economy strengthens a culture of environmental stewardship begins to flourish as people experience the benefits of conservation.\nRed panda habitat in Western Nepal.\nHomestay hostess in Nepal.\nThe two and a half year project launched in Rolpa will begin in two rural municipalities: Thawang and Sunchahari. RPN’s community-based red panda conservation project will also be initiated in neighboring Dolpa, Rukum-West and Rukum-East districts this year. These four districts increase RPN’s project coverage to seven districts in Western Nepal.\nAbout the Community Based Red Panda Conservation Project\nIn collaboration with local partner organizations, RPN began implementing the Community-based Red Panda Conservation Project in Western Nepal in 2017. Activities began in Jumla district, followed by Jajarkot and Kalikot in 2018. This project is now being expanding to four additional districts in Western Nepal: Dolpa, Rolpa, Rukum-East and Rukum-West. RPN’s major objectives in this area are to improve the status of red panda populations through community engagement, threat mitigation, and habitat restoration. Various interventions, ranging from conducting a detailed baseline study of red panda distribution and habitat, a school outreach campaign, awareness-building, sustainable forest management and promotion of sustainable livelihood alternatives—this includes improved cooking stoves, ecotourism, and organic farming—will be carried out in active participation with local communities.\nMedia workshop on combating wildlife crime.\nOn March 7th, 2019, RPN organized a half-day workshop on illegal wildlife crime for journalists and media staff in Liwang, Rolpa district. RPN worked alongside HURAC-Nepal in hosting 12 representatives from local and national media outlets. The meeting focused on illegal wildlife trade in Western Nepal and the role of media in reporting wildlife issues.\nWorkshop participants raised the issue of lack of red panda awareness and understanding of the species’ endangered status among rural communities in Nepal. They talked about how hunting wildlife for meat is common in many villages located in red panda habitat in Rolpa and neighboring districts. “Majority of the households use homemade guns and traps for hunting on a daily basis. Red pandas are among the wildlife hunted,” said Khem Budha Magar, a reporter with Annapurna Post.\nThey talked about the incident involving two orphaned red panda cubs raised by Lahari and Man Budhamagar of Rolpa District in 2016.\nThroughout the event, it was clear that attendees were interested in and passionate about reporting on wildlife crime and conservation. They also expressed their support for RPN initiatives such as ecotourism. “This workshop was important for understanding wildlife crime in Western Nepal. We hope to collaborate and cooperate with RPN to raise awareness of this issue,” said Mahesh Neupane, chairperson of Rolpa chapter of Federation of Nepali Journalists.\nLahari Budhamagar and red panda cub.\nRed Panda Network","Endangered and Vulnerable Species\n1864 in the wild\nA Vulnerable Species\nHow Endangered is a Species?\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List is the best determination of how endangered a species is.\nEndangered or Vulnerable Species\nPhotographed by Dakota Reflections\nAndatu at 1 month of age\nWay Kambas National Park, Sumatra, Indonesia\nCritically Endangered <100 in the wild\nWhooping Crane Adult with Juvenile\nAransas National Wildlife Refuge Texas\nCurrent Population over 800\nWhooping Crane in Flight\nBurleigh County, North Dakota\nAfter being pushed to the brink of extinction by unregulated hunting and loss of habitat to just 21 wild and two captive whooping cranes by 1941, conservation efforts have led to a limited recovery.

Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred habitat is tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest, swamps and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush predator at the top of the food chain. As a keystone species it plays an important role in stabilizing ecosystems and regulating prey populations.\nConservation Status- Near-threatened- 15,000 left in the wild\nPhoto of the Day for September 10, 2019\nThere are just over 2000 Bengal Tigers left in the wild in India.
