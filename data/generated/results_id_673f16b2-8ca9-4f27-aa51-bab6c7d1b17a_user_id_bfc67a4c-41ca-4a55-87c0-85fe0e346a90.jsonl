{"question":"Could you compare the employment eligibility requirements between F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) and EB-1 visa categories for international professionals? What are the key differences in their qualification criteria and duration?","answer":"F-1 OPT and EB-1 visas have distinctly different requirements and durations. F-1 OPT allows international students to work anywhere in the US for 12 months after degree completion, with STEM degree holders eligible for a 17-month extension (total 29 months). The work must be directly related to their field of study. In contrast, EB-1 visas are more stringent, requiring candidates to demonstrate extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business or athletics (EB-1A), be outstanding professors/researchers (EB-1B), or qualify as multinational managers/executives (EB-1C). EB-1 visas offer permanent residency rather than temporary authorization, and have specific requirements like professors needing tenure-track positions or executives having worked for a foreign affiliate within the past three years.","context":["EMPLOYMENT RESOURCES FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS\nAs a City College graduate you may want to gain some practical job experience in your major field of study.Finding a job in any country can be quite a daunting task and with the current economic environment in the United States, it can become even more challenging for international students.One of the first steps in obtaining a position in the United States is to have a thorough understanding of the process and procedures required for you to be able to obtain legal work.\nCommon Immigration Classifications with Employment Benefits\nF-1 is a status that allows an international visitor to study full time in the United States.This status has several employment benefits including the opportunity to work on City College or any CUNY campus, at an internship and full time after graduation.For information regarding employment authorization, see your International Student Adviser located in the Office of International Students and Scholars.\nÂ¨On Campus Employment\nInternational students with F-1 immigration status may be authorized to work on campus at any City University campus.Visit the Human Resources Department, Room 53 located in Shepard Hall to obtain more information.\nInternational students with F-1 immigration status may be authorized to work off campus in employment that is directly related to their major field of study.Part time during the Fall and Spring semesters when school is in session and full time during the January winter break and the summer annual vacation.\nÂ¨Full Time Employment After Program Completion\nInternational students with F-1 immigration status may be authorized to work anywhere in the United States on a full time basis after degree completion for twelve months.Students with a science, technology, engineering or mathematic degree may apply for a 17-month extension for a total of 29 months of employment.This employment benefit is Post-Completion Optional Practical Training.\nVisa Information and Resources\n- The U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) provides information on visas and work authorization.\n- The City College of New York Office for International Students and Scholars Services, provides advice and technical support to international graduate students at City College in obtaining and maintaining their non-immigrant visa status in the United States, including\n2.Employment Authorization Assistance\n3.Legal Advisement fir F-1 nonimmigrant Status Holders\n4.Travel (Visa/U.S. Re-entry)\nTips To Assist International Students in Preparing for the Employment Search\nIn the United States, it is your responsibility to find a job upon graduation.If you want to improve your chances in securing a job, please do the following\n1.Start the process of obtaining an internship or coop position at least 3 months prior to the time you want to start.(you must complete 1 full semester of studies before you can apply for an internship.)See your International Student Adviser for assistance.\n2.Start the process of searching for a full time job at least 8 months prior to graduation\n3.Apply for OPT during your final semester of enrolled coursework and get your temporary work authorization.\n4.Go to the Career Center to obtain assistance with developing a resume and cover letter that is tailored for the US market place.\n5.Meet with a staff member in the Career Center or attend a workshop on how the job application process works in the United States\n6.Seek assistance on how to successfully interview in the United States by attending an interviewing workshop, watching DVD's at the Career Center and signing up for mock interviews.\n7.Take time to learn the proper protocol when interacting with employers.

When the would-be immigrant has a choice, there are multiple considerations, including the likelihood of a particular type of petition being approved. However, one key factor to consider is preference.\nPreference is important because having a visa application approved is just the first step. The next is to wait for a visa number to become available and be issued to you. Preference determines how long you are likely to wait before receiving a visa number and the green light to begin working in the United States.\nEmployment-Based Visa Allocation by Preference\nThe first, second and third preference employment-based visa categories are each allocated 28.6% of available employment-based immigrant visas. Unused EB-1 visas spill over to the EB-2 category, and remaining unused first and second preference visas spill over to EB-3. The fourth and fifth preference categories each receive 7.1%.\nAt first glance, it seems as if first, second and third preference visa applicants are treated equally. The critical difference comes into play when the applicant is coming from a country with a high level of employment-based immigrant visa applications. In addition to the annual overall cap and allocation by preference, there is a cap for employment-based immigrants from a particular country. Since EB-1 applicants get first preference for those visas, lower-preference applicants from certain countries may wait a long time to be issued a visa number, even after successfully petitioning.\nTypes of Employment-Based Immigrant Visas\nEB-1 Visas for Priority Workers\nThe EB-1 first preference visa is granted to foreign workers who fall into one of three categories, all highly competitive:\nExtraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics (EB-1A)\nOutstanding professors and researchers (EB-1B)\nMultinational managers or executives (EB-1C)\nSpecial qualifications apply to each of the above groups. For example, a professor or researcher seeking an EB-1B visa must be relocating to pursue tenure, accept a tenure-track position or pursue a similar research opportunity at an institution of higher education. Similarly, an EB-1C visa applicant must have worked at least one of the past three years for a foreign affiliate, subsidiary, parent company or branch of the proposed U.S. employer.\nThe EB-2 second preference visa is issued to two types of workers:\nProfessionals with advanced degrees\nIndividuals with exceptional abilities in the arts, sciences or business\nAn EB-2 visa applicant must have a job offer, and a labor certification is required.\nThe third preference EB-3 visa is issued to the following types of workers:\nSkilled workers, meaning that a minimum of two years of training is required; the work must also not be temporary or seasonal in nature\nProfessionals with at least a U.S. baccalaureate degree or foreign equivalent\nOther workers, meaning unskilled labor requiring less than two years of training or experience; the work must not be temporary or seasonal\nUSCIS warns that, while the requirements for the EB-3 visa are less stringent, wait times can be long. That is especially true for those applying under the “other workers” category.\nEB-4 Special Immigrant Visas\nEligibility for an EB-4 visa is limited to workers of certain specific types, including religious workers, members of the armed forces, broadcasters and Afghan and Iraqi petitioners who translated for or otherwise assisted U.S. troops overseas.\nDepending on the circumstances, an employer may be required to petition on your behalf or you may be entitled to file your own visa petition.\nTalk to an Immigration Lawyer\nIf you’re considering seeking a green card through the employment-based visa process, a knowledgeable guide can be your best resource. Get help from an experienced immigration attorney as early as possible to ensure that you are choosing the most advantageous path for you.\nBeeraj Patel, Esq.\nLatest posts by Beeraj Patel, Esq.

{"question":"As I work on implementing privacy controls: Could you explain what are the key differences between mandatory and optional user data collection policies? For example, what happens when users refuse to provide information versus declining cookies?","answer":"When users refuse to provide personal information versus declining cookies, similar limitations apply but through different mechanisms. For personal information collection (like email and name), users have full approval rights and cannot be forced to provide information, though not providing it may limit their access to the site's full features. Similarly with cookies, users have complete control over acceptance, but declining them also results in limited site functionality since proper information won't be allowed for unverified users. Both cases respect user choice but come with functional limitations - users who don't provide personal information or accept cookies won't be able to access all site features, though the primary difference is that personal information is stored by the site while cookies are stored on the user's own device.","context":["It is highly important for a website to handle its user data and to verify whether a user is genuine or a fake/spam. Spam users are virtual threats to a site comprising their financial asset and user discreteness. To avoid such chaos, the site collects information about users and keeps it to itself for verifying the users. On to that, it will never disclose this information for gains to other third party spammers at any cost.\nCollecting personal information\nThe users who comment in the site’s post are required to use their email and name as a proof of identity. However, it is done completely on their full approval. Else their info is not taken by force(which is a serious offense against the law). Not providing user info might be a way when some users won’t be able to use site’s full features. The users who provide their info via comments, their info is taken for site monitoring.\nCollecting the non-relevant data.\nThe user’s info is what matters the most. This can be used to monitor when a user is visiting a site openly or secretly. The email and name are the relevant data. The non-relevant data collected includes users’ IP address, browser name, browser identity, server type(or computer generation/type), technical information etc. This can be used to verify a users’ identity whether he or she is genuine or not. It can also be used to see if any of the users are visiting the website unknowingly.\nCookies might be common for every user. These are small files which are inserted into their hard drive to keep records and track information about them(sometimes when a user is suspicious). This is also done in order to monitor a users’ activity on the site. Cookies are kept on websites for users to accept when they visit one. A user has full control and approval before accepting on to a cookie from a site. If not accepted they will not be able to accept full features of the site, as much proper info from the site won’t be allowed on an unverified user.\nProtecting the information collected.\nThe site completely takes control of the highly confidential information and doesn’t allow it to be disclosed to others at any cost. A site will never compromise a user’s discrete data for logical gains to third parties. At all.\nHow the data is protected.\nThe data collected from users is considered a high priority similar to the website’s security. Such kind of data is kept in highly secure networks or offline storage devices with a one-way connection. Multi-bit encryption are used (like 128 or 256bit grade uncrackable encryption techniques) with the administrator’s signature to protect the user data.\nCompliance for sharing user data.\nThe user data collected as mentioned before is never disclosed to any third party at any cost. The site takes full responsibility to protect it from any kind of data attack, data leak or warm attacks. The data which is (or might be shared) will be 100% free from any linkage or linking to any of users’ email, name, IP address or any other personal information which might prove useful for third parties.\nAcceptance Of these measures.\nBy using a particular site (or this one) and accepting cookies, you thus verify that you accept to the terms of the site and its measures to keep user data.
