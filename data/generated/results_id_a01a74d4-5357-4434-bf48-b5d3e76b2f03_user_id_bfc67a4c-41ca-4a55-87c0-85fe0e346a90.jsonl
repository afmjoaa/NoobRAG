{"question":"How does the preservation of Buddhist culture compare between the Cave of a Thousand Buddhas in China and modern-day Bhutan?","answer":"The Cave of a Thousand Buddhas in China is a 1,000-year-old complex featuring important Buddhist paintings, sculptures and scriptures, including the Diamond Sutra, spread across a half-mile length of caves in a sandstone cliff. Meanwhile, Bhutan maintains living Buddhist traditions, with over 90% of its population devoted to Lamaism (a branch of Buddhism) and daily life centered around Buddhist values and monasteries like the Paro Taktsang. The country's decades of isolation have helped preserve these Buddhist cultural elements, making it one of the best places to experience Far East Asian Buddhist culture, as if time has stopped long ago.","context":["When it comes to ancient texts, most are familiar with the big names: The Book of Kells, the Gutenberg Bible, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. But one that most people don’t know about is the Diamond Sutra — the world’s earliest dated and printed book.\nThe messages of this ancient text are just as powerful today as they were a thousand years ago. Here’s how to access the wisdom and transforming the power of this sacred sutra.\nWhat Is The Diamond Sutra?\nThe Diamond Sutra is an ancient Buddhist text discovered in Dunhuang, China in 1900 by a Daoist monk. It was found in a remote oasis on the edge of the Gobi Desert along an old outpost of the Silk Road.\nThe Diamond Sutra, along with thousands of other sacred scrolls and artifacts, was hidden in a shrine called The Cave of a Thousand Buddhas.\nThe Cave of a Thousand Buddhas, or Mogao Grottoes, is over 1,000 years old and is one of the most important Buddhist spiritual sites in China.\nThe site is a complex of (you guessed it!) one thousand caves dug into a sandstone cliff face. The entire labyrinth is half a mile in length and spans a height of 10 stories. Today, almost half of the caves have collapsed in on themselves or are filled with sand, but many are still accessible to the public.\nThis mysterious place is the home of some of the most powerful paintings, sculptures, and scriptures in Mahayana Buddhism.\nWhen Was The Diamond Sutra Printed?\nAlthough the Diamond Sutra wasn’t officially discovered until the 1900s, we do know how long ago it was created.\nThe Diamond Sutra was printed in 868 CE, during the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong.\nWhere Was The Diamond Sutra Printed?\nEven though sutras are ancient teachings of the Buddha, who lived and preached in ancient Nepal, the Diamond Sutra was printed in China.\nIt’s believed that Buddhism found its way to China through the trade routes of the Silk Road.\nWhere Is The Diamond Sutra Located?\nSo, where is this famous sacred text today? The Diamond Sutra currently lives in the British Library and you can even interactively peek through its pages online.\nThe British Library is a part of the International Dunhuang Project. This international collaboration seeks to make 100,000 manuscripts, paintings and artifacts from Silk Road sites available to the world via the Internet.\nWhat Is The Diamond Sutra All About?\nThe Diamond Sutra is one of the most important sacred texts in Mahayana Buddhism. It’s 6,000 words long and tells the story of a conversation the Buddha had with one of his disciples, Subhuti.\nIn Sanskrit, the Diamond Sutra is called the Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, which means, “The Perfect Wisdom that Cuts Like a Thunderbolt.”\nWe often refer to this sutra in English as the Diamond Sutra, because like a diamond or thunderbolt, the sutra’s wisdom is designed to slice through the materialism of the world to reveal powerful truths. Truths we can access and put to use in our everyday lives.\nSo, what did the Buddha and Subhuti discuss?\nWell, at the time, the Buddha was staying in Anathapindika’s grove with over 1,000 other monks. He and Subhuti proceeded to have a long conversation about a number of topics, including human impermanence and the nature of reality itself.\nPretty deep stuff, huh? Perhaps that’s why the Diamond Sutra is so famous. It’s quite possibly one of the most enigmatic lessons the Buddha taught.\nTrained scholars still argue over the true meaning of the Diamond Sutra.\nSome say it’s simply the Buddha’s lecture on the transient nature of the world. Nothing is permanent. Nothing is stable or fixed.\nBut other scholars argue that the true purpose of this sutra is to encourage us not to be bound by any idea at all—even the ones in the Diamond Sutra.\nHow Can I Use The Wisdom Of The Diamond Sutra In My Own Life?\nSo, what does a 1,000-year-old ancient scripture like the Diamond Sutra have to offer us today?\nThe lessons from this Buddhist sutra are timeless. Sutras are short passages that communicate powerful spiritual teaching. They’re as relevant and transformative today as they were a thousand years ago.\nDeborah King, Author of Mindvalley’s Be A Modern Master Program, explains that sutras are powerful devices for raising your inner consciousness to a higher level.\nThey are designed to be read and re-read, contemplated and meditated upon. They can be also used in yoga, spoken, or chanted out loud.\nAt first glance, they might look like poetry. But after a second or third reading, the truth of the message begins to surface.\nAn Illuminating Quote From The Diamond Sutra For Meditation\nThe best way to tap into the ancient power of this sutra is by exploring its passages. Even though this ancient text was originally written in Sanskrit, we have access to English translations to help us tap into its life-transforming messages.\nHere is one of the most powerful passages from the Diamond Sutra. Use it in meditation or print it out to put up on your wall. See if you can tap into its deeper meaning.\n“So you should view this fleeting world –\nA star at dawn, a bubble in a stream,\nA flash of lightning in a summer cloud,\nA flickering lamp, a phantom, and a dream.”\nSo, what does this passage mean to you?

highest mountain range in the world, hundreds of miles away from the shore of the Indian Ocean.\nToday, in the 21 century, Bhutan is still one of the most isolated and unknown to the world countries.More from Asia:\n- 5 Best Places to Visit in Indonesia\n- 8 Reasons to Visit Malaysia\n- 10 facts to know before moving to the Northern Mariana Islands\nFor example, the first car appeared in the country in 1962, television was banned until 1999, and the modern means of communication are now making first uncertain steps.\nWhen to visit Bhutan?\nApril, May, September and October offer the optimal combination of rainfall and temperatures.\nThis is probably the best time to visit Bhutan and the capital Thimphu.\nJune, July and August, the height of monsoon season, bring lovely temperatures but also plenty of rainfall.\nThe winter months from November till March are dry and very sunny but relatively cool.\nWhat not to miss?\nBe sure to visit Paro Taktsang Monastery, better known as “The Tiger’s Nest”, located on the steep slopes of the Himalayas.\nBecause of its architecture and scenic location, it is considered the top tourist attraction in Bhutan.\nExplore the city of Thimphu and its numerous attractions – the temple of Changangkha Lhakhang and its prayer wheels, the fortress-monastery Trashi Chhoe Dzong built in the 13th century, the giant statue of Buddha, the National Memorial Chorten and The Folk Heritage Museum.\nVisit the town of Punakha well-known for its fortress-monastery Punakha Dzong.\nThe magnificent building is a typical example of the architectural style “Dzong” that is so characteristic of the Buddhist countries in the region.\nTake the time to visit Trongsa, the main town in central Bhutan.\nSituated among the silence and timelessness of the wild Himalayan landscape, it is famous for the largest fortress in the country, Trongsa Dzong.\nBe sure to include in your holiday itinerary the town of Jakar, steeped in tranquility and Buddhist traditions.\nThe town with a population of about 16,000 people is located in the middle of a lovely valley nestled amidst the fresh and green mountainous landscape.\nIt is recommended to take the time to enjoy the natural beauty of Bhutan.\nAnd the best way to do this is to visit some of the national parks and other protected areas.\nAmong the most interesting places are the Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary that is known for its vast biodiversity, the Jigme Dorji National Park, established in 1975, the Royal Manas National Park, the first protected area in the country, and the Wangchuck Centennial Park, the largest national park in the country, established in 2008.\nRisks and inconveniences\nButane is a quiet country with low crime, even in the big cities.\nThe risk of being attacked and robbed here is negligible.\nThe main disadvantage of the country is the weakly developed infrastructure.\nFor the most part, the roads are not in very good condition, and in some places they are completely missing.\nPractically, in most of the country your mobile phone will be probably out of coverage, and internet access is still a rare luxury.\nOne or two months before you travel, visit your doctor and tell him that you are planning to travel to Bhutan.\nLearn more about how to take care of your health while in the country and ask for additional information about the most common diseases in the region – malaria and altitude sickness.\nIt is necessary to be cautious and prudent when in the wild, especially in areas inhabited by predators!\nSome of them, such as tigers, though extremely beautiful can be very dangerous in close encounters with humans!\nTraditional Bhutanese food brings the flavor of the Himalayas.\nAs a typical mountain cuisine, it is quite simple and yet extremely fragrant and spicy.\nMost specialities are traditionally flavoured with a lot of spices, especially chilli and saffron.\nIf you want to get to know the cuisine of Bhutan, it is recommended to try different types of white and red rice dishes.\nAs Bhutan is a typical mountain country, cheese is an integral part of the daily menu of most people.\nSince the locals are Buddhists, most dishes prepared according to traditional recipes are without meat, although some local meat specialties are well-known and loved, especially among tourists.\nBe sure to try yak meat, which is a traditional local delicacy, and dried beef.\nWhile in the country, it is recommended to try “Ema Datshi” – a kind of traditional dish with rice, cheese, peppers and sauce.\nDo not miss to drink also a cup of warm herbal yak butter tea (cow butter tea is also available).\nThis kind of authentic Bhutanese drink has a typical salty taste and is much different from the tea that most people are used to drink in Europe or America.\nBhutan falls within the tropical climate zone.\nHowever, the climate in the country is very diverse and is strongly influenced by the altitude that increases toward the north.\nFew countries in the world can boast such a huge climate diversity.\nFor example, the southernmost part of the country, located in the foothills of the Himalayas, along the border with India, enjoys year-round warm weather and high humidity with daytime temperatures ranging between 18 and 23°C in January and reaching to over 30°C in July.\nTo the north temperatures decrease with increasing altitude, and the climate gets temperate features.\nIn the capital Thimphu the daytime temperature varies between 12°C in January and 25°C in July.\nThe northern mountainous part of Bhutan experiences cold weather and year round low temperatures.\nThe high mountains in the north near the border with China are covered by eternal ice, and the temperature is negative no matter the season.\nThe precipitations that fall over Bhutan are very abundant during the monsoon season, which lasts from June to September.\nThe rest of the year is much dryer, but heavy rains are possible all year round.\nBhutan is a mountainous country, dominated by the jagged silhouette of the Himalayas.\nThere are many mountain peaks in the north that are over 7000 m.\nThe highest peak in the country, Gangkhar Puensum, rises to 7,570 meters in the clouds.\nMost of the mountains in the north of Bhutan are covered with eternal snow and ice.\nThe combination of height and harsh natural conditions makes this part of the country almost inaccessible.\nBetween thousands of meters high mountains meander deeply incised river canyons and secluded shady valleys.\nDark gorges remain away from the sun’s rays even at noon.\nIn low-lying areas at the foot of mountains can be seen emerald farmlands and tea plantations.\nOnly in the southern part of the country, along the border with India, there is a narrow, green and fertile plain, diversified by rolling hills and low mountains.\nHere is where the main rice paddies of Bhutan are.\nWith a large number of amazing national parks, the country’s nature is still very well preserved and truly unspoiled.\nApproximately 42% of the total territory is covered by protected areas (national parks, natural reserves, wildlife sanctuaries).\nHere you can find untouched and secluded places, home to tigers, Asian elephants, leopards, snow leopards, buffaloes, rhinos, mountain goats, black bears, and the symbol of Bhutan – the red panda.\nPractically every area of Bhutan’s public and social life has been influenced by the long decades of isolation.\nIf you are interested in the culture of the Far East of Asia, there is no better place to experience it from the mountainous kingdom.\nIt seems like time has stopped very long ago.\nAlthough among the poorest in Asia, the country is known as one of the happiest places in the world.\nThe population of Bhutan leads a quiet and modest way of life that is completely devoted to Lamaism (a branch of Buddhism), old traditions and timeless family values.\nMajor cities are missing, and practically more than 90% of the population lives in provincial rural areas and is engaged in agriculture and livestock breeding.\nTraditionally, the main crop grown in Bhutan is rice.\nAn important source of income for the local people is the producing of copra and rapidly growing tourism industry.\nIronically, the isolation of Bhutan is the main reason why so many tourists want to explore this forgotten and out of this world mountain paradise.\nOne of the typical features of Bhutan, a feature which prevents uncontrolled tourism development, is the limited number of visas issued to foreign tourists.More from

{"question":"How do rust fungi establish and maintain their dikaryotic state? I'm curious about the nuclear cycle mechanisms.","answer":"Rust fungi establish their dikaryotic state through spermatization between (+) spermatium and (-) receptive hypha. The dikaryotic condition is maintained through several stages: it begins in the aecium producing dikaryotic aeciospores, continues through dikaryotic mycelia that form uredia and urediospores, and persists until teleutospore formation. The dikaryotic phase ends when karyogamy occurs in mature teleutospores, creating a diploid nucleus (2n). This cycle is critical as rust fungi spend most of their life cycle in the dikaryotic condition, during which they cause maximum damage to their host plants.","context":["In this article we will discuss about:- 1. Introduction to Uredinales 2. Nuclear Cycle of Uridinales 3. Biological Specialization 4. Classification.\nIntroduction to Uredinales:\nThe Uredinales, or rust fungi comprise a large group of obligate parasites. They are called rusts, because of the rusty, reddish-brown colour of their spores, which are formed chiefly upon surfaces of host leaves and stems in pustular outgrowths (Fig. 261 A, D & E).\nIndividual species of rusts may have a very wide or a very limited range of hosts. Parasitism and specialization are so highly developed among them that thus far, except a few cases almost all attempts to grow them on artificial media have failed. Rusts are parasitic on seed plants or ferns. They cause great loss to crop, forest, and ornamental plants.\nNo other group of fungi is so injurious to plants useful to man. They are considered as one of the virulent plant parasites.\nSome rust fungi complete their life cycle on a single kind of host, they are known as autoecious rusts. But others require two unrelated hosts for the completion of life cycle, they are called heteroecious rusts. Most autoecious rusts are of relatively little economic importance, but the heteroecious ones cause some of the most destructive of all plant diseases.\nAmong the important heteroecious rusts are: white pine blister rust (Fig. 261G), Cronartium ribicola, which has currents and gooseberries (the genus Ribes), especially Ribes nigrum, as alternate hosts with white pine (Pinus strobus); and black stem rust of wheat, Puccinia graminis tritici has wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barberry (Berberis vulgaris) as alternate hosts.\nAmong the more common autoecious rusts are: hollyhock rust, Puccinia malvacearum on species of Althaea, Levatera, Malva, all genera of the Malvaceae; and flax rust, Melampsora lini on species of Linum.\nRust fungi do not produce fruiting bodies. Life cycle of most of them is extremely complicated. It usually involves as many as five kinds of spore forms which appear in a definite succession. The life cycle is thus polymorphic.\nThe five spore forms are:\nPycniospores (spermatia), aeciospores, uredospore’s, teleutospores, and sporidia (basidiospores).\nThese spore forms are also expressed as follows:\nStage 0 Spermogonial stage producing spermogonia bearing spermatia and receptive hyphae (n).\nStage I Aecial stage producing aecium bearing aeciospores (n+n).\nStage II Uredial stage producing uredia bearing uredospores (n+n).\nStage III Telial stage producing telia bearing teleutospores (n+n), 2n.\nStage IV Sporidial stage producing promycelium bearing sporidia (n).\nThe rust fungus producing either all the five spore forms or at least one type of dikaryotic spore in addition to the teleutospore, is referred to as a long-cycled or macrocyclic rust.\nMacrocyclic rusts again may be heteroecious (e.g., Puccinia graminis), which produces all spore forms on two unrelated hosts; or autoecious (e.g., Puccinia asparagi) whose all spore forms are produced on asparagus. The prefix ‘eu’ is sometimes attached to the generic name as a descriptive epithet, i.e., Puccinia graminis is an eu-Puccinia.\nWhereas in a short-cycled or microcyclic rust, the teleutospores are the only dikaryotic spores produced in the life cycle. The life cycle of rusts is said to be demicyclic in which uredospores are lacking; as in heteroecious forms in Cymnosporangium, and amongst autoecious forms in Xenodochus carbonarius.\nIt is believed that the heteroecious macrocyclic forms represent the primitive condition, and that the autoecious conditions arose later in evolution. It is also believed that forms with shorter life cycles arose during the course of evolution from macrocyclic ancestor.\nThe mycelium of rust fungi usually ramifies intercellularly in the host tissue sending haustoria in the adjacent cells and inducing malformations in the infected parts (Fig. 261B). The infection may be localized or systemic. The mycelium may be short-lived or perennial and consisting of well-marked phases that alternate: a monokaryotic phase and a dikaryotic phase.\nClamp connections have been found in the dikaryotic mycelium of very few rusts.\nThe monokaryotic mycelium develops:\nStage 0 (Spermogonial stage) and the dikaryotic mycelium whose activity is rather more predominating than the monokaryotic mycelium produces\nStage I (Aecial stage),\nStage II (Uredial stage), and\nStage III (Telial stage).\nIn the late telial stage karyogamy takes place. The Stage IV (Sporidial stage) is the one where meiosis takes place and mono: karyotic condition is established. In the Uredinales the sporidia fall into two compatible groups and are determined genetically by a pair of allelomorphs (A, a).\nThe dikaryotic condition is initiated in the late Stage 0. Craigie (1927) working on Puccinia graminis showed that the dikaryotic condition in rusts is achieved by the fusion of spermatia with receptive hyphae of opposite strains. Brown in 1932 found that in Puccinia helianthi, an autoecious rust, a dikaryotic mvcelium of uredosorus can induce aecial formation in a monokaryotic mycelium produced from a sporidial infection.\nSuch a process of diploidization of a monokaryotic mycelium by a dikaryotic mycelium is known as the Buller phenomenon. Later on Brown (1935) found evidence that in P. helianthi, the dikaryotic condition is also established by the fusion of monokaryotic hyphae of spermogonia of two opposite strains. In many rust fungi, only the aecial stage alone is known.\nAgain in many others, the uredial stage has been worked out. It has become necessary at present to name and classify the uredial, aecial and other non-telial forms of which the telial stage is not yet known. For convenience of reference they are classified under an artificial group ‘Uredinales Imperfecti’ in which are included the form-genera Caeoma, Aecidium, Petidermium, Roestelia, and Uredo.\nNuclear Cycle of Uredinales:\nIn all the rust fungi the dikaryotic condition (n +n) is rather more well represented than the monokaryotic stage (n). It is established by spermatization between a (+) spermatium and a (—) receptive hypha and vice versa. Immediately after dikaryotization, the dikaryotic hyphal connection that already existed between the teleutospore of Puccinia graminis spermogonium and protoaecium.\nThe protoaecium which showing promycelium and has become dikaryotic, develops into an aecium bearing sporidia. B. Telial column of dikaryotic hyphal cells. The aeciospores borne in the Cronartium sp. showing germinaaecium are also dikaryotic. The dikaryotic condition’s ting teleutospores.\nFurther continued through dikaryotic mycelia that are formed from the aeciospores. The dikaryotic mycelia induce infection in the host and produce uredia and urediospores which are also dikaryotic. The dikaryotic condition is further perpetuated by the development of telia and teleutospores. End of the dikaryotic condition comes with the development of teleutospores.\nThe teleutospores when young are dikaryotic and at maturity karyogamy takes place when they become diplophasic (2n). Meiosis of the diploid nucleus takes place during the teleutospore germination when the monokaryotic condition (n) is established.\nThe monokaryotic condition is represented by sporidia and continues up to the development of spermogonia, spermatia, receptive hyphae and finally the protoaecia with which the life cycle is completed.\nOf the stages 0 to IV, only the stages 0 and IV are monokaryotic while the rest of the stages I to III of the life cycle are dikaryotic with a very short diplophase. All rust fungi perennate in the dikaryotic condition either as mycelium or as uredospores or as teleut Dspores. But the teleutospores serving as perennating organs may also be in the diplophasic condition.\nBesides this, it is during the dikaryotic condition when maximum damage is caused to the host.\nBiological Specialization of Uredinales:\nSpecialization of parasitism is one of the outstanding characteristics of the rust fungi. Certain rusts may be confined to a single host species even variety, while others are capable of infecting many different hosts which may be related or unrelated. Again there are others, each of which is found on a large number of hosts.\nUpon its numerous hosts the fungus may show no morphological variation, yet attempts to inoculate from one host to another may uniformly produce negative results.\nSuch a biological specialization of parasitism has necessitated to introduce the term biological species. Hence a biological species be regarded as a collection of morphologically similar organisms or strains that differ in ability to produce infection in different hosts. The existence of biological species has been amply demonstrated among cereal rusts for example, Puccinia graminis.\nClassification of Uredinales:\nThe Uredinales are classified into three families on the basis of their teleutospore characteristics and behaviour.\nThe three families are: Coleosporiaceae, Melampsoraceae, and Pucciniaceae.\nKey to the families is presented below:\nA . Teleutospore germination by the formation of an external promycelium\nB. Teleutospores usually stalked, less commonly sessile, free or variously united but never form layers or crust Pucciniaceae\nBB. Teleutospores sessile laterally united forming crusts or cushions or columnar masses\nAA.

{"question":"What's the difference between an IP5X and NEMA Type 12 rating for dust protection? Need help figuring out which one is better for my workshop!","answer":"IP5X and NEMA Type 12 provide different levels of dust protection. IP5X offers limited protection against dust ingress with no harmful deposit, while NEMA Type 12 provides protection against circulating dust, falling dirt, and additionally protects against dripping non-corrosive liquids. According to the conversion table, NEMA Type 12 is equivalent to IP52, which actually indicates a lower level of dust protection than IP5X. This means that for specific dust protection, an IP5X rating offers better protection against dust ingress, though NEMA Type 12 provides additional protection against liquids.","context":["Rugged Rating Organizations and Standards\nRatings are set by various government agencies, industry groups and/or independent laboratories and are cited by manufacturers in order to establish a more exact degree of environmental protection and reliability. Some of the more common standards include:\nIP Ratings (Ingress Protection) Rating for Equipment and Enclosures\nA three-digit number established by the International Electrotechnical Commission, is used to provide an IP Rating to a piece of electronic equipment or to an enclosure for electronic equipment. The IP code indicates the level, or amount of the protection.\nThe three digits represent three different forms of environmental influence:\nThe first digit represents protection against ingress of solid objects.\nThe second digit represents protection against ingress of liquids.\nThe third digit represents protection against mechanical impact damage.\n(*The third digit is often omitted, resulting in a 2-digit IP Rating covering ingress against solid objects and liquids only).\nThe larger the value of each digit, the greater the protection from that influence. As an example, a product rated as IP573 would be better protected against environmental factors than another similar product that was only rated as IP432.\n|First Number (Solids)||Second Number (Liquids)||Third Number (Mechanical Impact)|\n|0||No protection||No protection||No protection|\n|1||Protected against solid objects over 50mm e.g. hands, large tools.||Protected against vertically falling drops of water or condensation.||Protected against 0.225 joule impact (150g @ 15cm).|\n|2||Protected against solid objects over 12mm e.g. hands, large tools.||Protected against direct sprays of water up to 15° from vertical.||Protected against 0.375 joule impact (250g @ 15cm).|\n|3||Protected against solid objects over 2.5mm e.g. wire, small tools.||Protected against direct sprays of water up to 60° from vertical.||Protected against 0.5 joule impact (250g @ 20cm).|\n|4||Protected against solid objects over 1.0mm e.g. wires.||Protected against water sprayed from any direction.

These guidelines specify allowable parts and environmental condition ranges that a tool or other device must be able to operate in to meet compliance.\nMIL-STD 810 E and F are generally accepted as the highest standard for ruggedized testing by mobile computer manufacturers.\nMIL-STD-810G testing is for a range of extreme conditions including 72\" drops, shocks, vibration, humidity, altitude, rain-, dust- and sand-resistance, temperature extremes and thermal shock. MIL-STD-810G, which was created in October 2008, supersedes MIL-STD-810F.\nMIL-STD 810 test method is used to generate confidence in the environmental worthiness and overall durability of material system design. The testing process follows guidelines which include program documentation, program roles, test standards and laboratory test method guidelines for all categories. The laboratory test methods are broken down into 24 categories. The required compliance test categories include:\n|Low Pressure (Altitude)||Method 500.4|\n|High Temperature||Method 501.4|\n|Low Temperature||Method 502.4|\n|Temperature Shock||Method 503.4|\n|Contamination by Fluids||Method 504|\n|Solar Radiation (Sunshine)||Method 505.4|\n|Salt Fog||Method 509.4|\n|Sand and Dust||Method 510.4|\n|Explosive Atmosphere||Method 511.4|\n|Acoustic Noise||Method 515.5|\n|Acidic Atmosphere||Method 518|\n|Gunfire Vibration||Method 519.5|\n|Temperature, Humidity, Vibration, and Altitude||Method 520.2|\n|Icing/Freezing Rain||Method 521.2|\n|Ballistic Shock||Method 522|\nBefore testing can begin, the item has to have environmental exposure, which means that the test item is run under standard ambient conditions to ensure the item is operating properly and to ensure pretest baseline performance data is collected.\nThe actual tests are carried out according to pre-defined test plans and criteria. The tests can be laboratory or natural environment field tests, or a combination, which ever applies. The test procedure is dependent on the environment tested. The procedure(s) and its execution provide the basis for collecting the necessary information.\nAfter completion of each environmental test, the post-test data is examined and recorded in accordance with material specifications and program guidelines. The results are compared with the pre-test data. The post test record includes: test sequence used, deviations from planned test program, performance data, test conditions and a signature of the test team, to name a few. A final test report will be created for each test which includes an analysis of the test results.\nYou may notice some products will carry a MIL-STD 810E rating and some may state they are MIL-STD 810F compliant. MIL-STD 810F is a revision of MIL-STD 810E. The tests and methods are basically the same but much of the standard has been rewritten to provide clearer direction. Many of the changes that can be found with the MIL-STD 810F are minor or administrative in nature, but technical changes and improvements can be found throughout (i.e. additional technical testing guidelines).\nIS (Intrinsic Safety)\nIS is a term representing the Hazardous Location classifications as described in the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) National Electrical Code (Article 500). The National Electrical Code (NEC) defines Hazardous Locations as those areas \"where fire or explosion hazards may exist due to flammable gases or vapors, flammable liquids, combustible dust, or ignitable fibers or flyings.\"\nAn intrinsic safety rating details the specific Hazardous Location in which an electrical device can be used without fear of electrostatic discharge that may cause an explosion.\nSUMMARY OF CLASS I, II, III HAZARDOUS LOCATIONS\n|CLASSES||GROUPS||DIVISION I||DIVISION 2|\n|I.

Fibers and flyings||Textiles, wood-working etc.||Handled or used in manufacturing||Stored or handled in storage|","What is IP Rating?\nIP rating, also known as International Protection Rating, is a standard that defines the degree of protection of an electrical device against various environmental factors. Think dust, moisture and liquids. The rating is expressed in two numbers, e.g. IP67.\nThe first number represents the degree of protection against solid matter such as dust, with numbers ranging from 0 to 6, with 6 offering the highest level of protection.\nThe second figure represents the degree of protection against liquids, with numbers from 0 to 9, where 9 provides the highest level of protection.\nlighting with IP67-classificatie like een LED hamburgerlamp for example, is protected against dust that could damage the device. It is also protected from immersion in water up to a depth of 1 meters for up to 30 minutes.\nIt is important to note that the IP classification system is only relevant to electrical devices. It is also important to check the classification of a device before purchasing it. This ensures that it meets your environmental protection requirements.\nWhat is the difference between each IP rating?\nThe specific level of protection provided by each IP classification is defined as follows:\nFirst digit (protection against solid materials):\n|IP coding:||Protection against:||Meaning:|\n|1x||Large objects||Protection against accidental, superficial contact with the hand. Protection against the penetration of solid objects larger than 50 mm|\n|2x||Medium-sized objects||Protection against contact with the finger. Touch-safe only for measuring devices. Protection against the penetration of solid objects larger than 12.5 mm.|\n|3x||Small objects||Protection against contact with an implement. Touch-safe only for measuring devices. Protection against the penetration of solid objects larger than 2.5 mm|\n|4x||Pointed objects||Protection against contact with an implement. Protected against contact with a wire. Protection against the penetration of solid objects larger than 1 mm.|\n|5x||Dust protection||Touch-safe because the housing is completely sealed. Not complete protection against dust but sufficient not to impede proper operation|\n|6x||Dust-free||Touch-safe because the housing is completely closed. Complete protection against dust.|\nSecond number (protection against liquids):\n|IP coding:||IEC:||Protection against:||Meaning:|\n|1||IP-X1||Drip seal type I||No damage if subjected to vertical drops|\n|2||IP-X2||Drip-proof type II||No damage if drops fall at an angle of 15|\n|3||IP-X3||Splashproof||No damage if sprayed (10 1/min) at an angle of -60° to 60|\n|4||IP-X4||Watertight||No damage if sprayed (10 1/min) at any angle|\n|5||IP-X5||Spray-proof||No damage if sprayed (12.5 1/min) at any angle|\n|6||IP-X6||Water-resistant||No water penetration if sprayed (100 1/min) at any angle|\n|7||IP-X7||Immersion-proof||No water penetration when immersed (30 min at 1 m)|\n|8||IP-X8||Waterproof||Remains usable under water under specified conditions|\n|9||IP-X9||Moistureproof||Remains usable at humidity levels over 90% or spraying under high pressure|\nWhich values are suitable for outdoor use?\nThe correct IP rating for outdoor use depends on the specific environmental conditions to which the device will be exposed. In general, an IP65 rating or higher is recommended for outdoor use. This is because it provides protection against low-pressure water jets from all directions and limited protection against dust. An IP67 rating provides even higher protection against both dust and water. This makes it suitable for outdoor use in harsh conditions such as heavy rain or near water. For example, if the device is used near a swimming pool or in a marine environment, a may IP68-classificatie, which offers protection against continuous immersion in water, are necessary.\nIt is also important to note that the IP classification system is only relevant to electrical devices. It does not protect against mechanical or other environmental factors, such as wind or temperature. So it is always best to consider all environmental factors when selecting an outdoor device."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a15af1e6-fde8-4514-b3ff-f5d192b1a575>","<urn:uuid:36d408e0-37ac-47c6-9d9b-5acf542a3d24>"],"error":null}

The low the pH the more acidic, and the pH the more alkaline.\nWhat are the building blocks of proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides?\nAmino acids link together to make proteins, fatty acids link to glycerol to make lipids, and monosaccharides link together to make polysaccharides.\nIf two proteins contain the same type and number of amino acids, but the order in which they link up is different, are the properties of the two proteins the same?\nWhat are enzymes, and for what purpose are they usually used?\nEnzymes are a special class of proteins that are used as catalysts.\nWhat is the \"lock and key\" theory of enzyme action?\nIt says that an enzyme has an active site that is shaped especially for the molecule that it must work on. The action that the enzyme takes cannot happen until the molecule attaches to that active site.\nPlease allow access to your computer’s microphone to use Voice Recording.\nHaving trouble?

{"question":"What safety considerations should be taken into account when using induction cooktops versus charcoal chimneys?","answer":"Induction cooktops are generally safer as they only activate when detecting metal pans, making them child-safe, and their glass surface doesn't get scorching hot. In contrast, charcoal chimneys require multiple safety precautions: avoiding dry grass areas that might catch fire, using heat-resistant gloves to protect from burns, being careful of flying sparks when pouring hot coals, and selecting appropriate lighting locations like dirt areas inside campfire pits. Additionally, induction requires less ventilation due to lower heat emission, while charcoal cooking needs proper ventilation and safe distances from flammable materials.","context":["There are tons of reasons you should know how to use a charcoal chimney! Whether you’re making Dutch oven recipes or using your little BBQ Smoky Joe, you’ll want a fast, safe, efficient way to start your coals and this gadget is one of the best camping gear items you can own!\nHow A Charcoal Chimney Starter Works\nThe chimney design uses a metal tube to hold unlit charcoal while it gets ignited from a small fire below.\nThe metal cylinder has two separate chambers, the larger one sits above a grate that holds the charcoal. The bottom chamber sits below the grate and holds the flammable material that lights the charcoal. The tube has air vents that facilitate the airflow required to light charcoal quickly without any chemicals or lighter fluid. The cylinder also has a handle that allows you to pour the hot charcoal (be careful of flying sparks) into your barbecue grill or on the cooking surface for your Dutch oven.\nAs the fire burns in the bottom chamber, the heat and flames rise through the tube and into the upper chamber to light the top coals. There are no tricks, the secret to the ingenious design is the airflow generated by the tube’s shape and airflow holes. A self-feeding fire is started with plenty of oxygen being introduced into the combustion process.\nSteps For Lighting Charcoal With A Chimney Starter\nStep 1. Choose your starting location and prepare your cooking equipment. Will you be using the coals for your charcoal grill or your Dutch oven?\nFind a location that is safe for lighting coals:\n- Avoid areas with dry grass that might catch fire.\n- We like using the dirt area inside our campfire pit.\n- We also use old cookie sheets as barriers between the fire and the ground (get more camp Dutch oven tips on this.)\n- Avoid concrete if you don’t want it to have burn marks on it.\n- If you are using a large grill, you can use the chimney starter directly on the charcoal grate (after you remove the cooking grate).\nStep 2. Load the charcoal into the upper chamber. Determine the amount of charcoal you’ll need for your recipe.\n- Your camp Dutch oven recipes will usually indicate a specific number of coals you need for cooking and baking at specific temperatures. If you’re converting one of your home recipes to cook at your campsite and only have a temperature for cooking, use this Dutch oven temperature chart to determine how many coals you’ll need.\n- You might need a full chimney if you are cooking with really high heat. That’s the case if you are boiling or deep frying in a Dutch oven as well as searing steaks that are grilled hot and fast.\n- You won’t need as much charcoal if you are simmering or baking in a Dutch oven as well as grilling chicken and veggies with a lower, slower cooking method. You’ll probably only need to fill the chimney half way for these recipes. Get Dutch oven temperature control tips.\nLump Charcoal vs Charcoal Briquettes\nYou can use either type of charcoal but I recommend briquettes for baking in Dutch ovens because of their uniform shape, size and heat generation which helps ensure evenly baked cakes, pies and casseroles.\nStep 3. Add the flammable material to the lower chamber in the bottom of the chimney. There are two popular options in materials:\n- Lighter Cubes\nWadded Sheets Of Newspaper vs Lighter Cubes\nMost people wad-up a few sheets of newspaper to start the charcoal. You’ll want to fill the lower chamber without stuffing it so tightly that it causes a problem with the airflow. You want to make sure their is no restriction caused by too much paper in the lower chamber but still has enough paper to fuel the ignition.\nParaffin wax lighter cubes are also great for starting the flame. Set one or two of them on the surface where you’ll be lighting the coals (inside your fire ring, on the ground, on your charcoal grate etc.)\nStep 4. Light the flame. Use a match or lighter to start the flammable material.\n- For newspapers, tilt the chimney slightly to the side, light the paper and return chimney to its upright position.\n- For lighter cubes, set cubes in the area, light them and set chimney over top of the cubes.\nStep 5. Wait for light ash. You’ll first see a small flame, then it will turn into bigger flames and the coals will eventually develop a gray ash. The entire process takes about 10-15 minutes.\nStep 6. Arrange coals and cook.\n- If you’re using the coals with a Dutch oven, the recipe should tell you how many coals should be placed below the oven and how many should be placed on top of the lid. I like using tongs to place the coals in the best position for that cooking process.\n- If you’re grilling with your coals, pour them on the charcoal grate in the proper position, direct or indirect heat, according to the recipe you are cooking. Then place the cooking grate in your grill and add the food.\nSafety Tip: When you are handling hot chimneys, grill grates and Dutch ovens, it is important to use heat-resistant gloves to protect your hands and arms from getting burned.\nBest Charcoal Chimney Starter\nWe have owned several different chimney starters and we use them all the time … on camping trips and in our backyard.\nThe Weber 7429 Rapidfire Chimney Starter is our favorite because…\n- It has two handles.\n- The stationary handle is easy to grip and does not get extremely hot because it is protected by the large heat shield.\n- The swinging handle allows you to comfortably carry the chimney and aim the hot coals to the exact position where you want to pour them.\n- It holds a good amount of charcoal.\n- Is made of quality materials with sturdy construction and stands the test of time with normal wear and tear.\nWhy You Shouldn’t Use Lighter Fluid\nStarters that use petroleum products can add an unappetizing flavor to grilled meats and vegetables. And, they typically cause charcoal to burn faster than desired. In addition to the undesirable taste, many people just don’t like the idea of ingesting food that was cooked with petroleum. Get more camping tips so your trips are as great as possible!\nAwesome Recipes Using Charcoal\nWhen we make Dutch oven camping recipes, we use campfire coals or charcoal briquettes. Here are some of our favorites:\nThis Mountain Man Breakfast is a hearty one-pot morning meal filled with meat, eggs, potatoes and cheese.\nThis Dutch Oven Meatloaf tastes amazing because of the beef and pork combination that is topped with bacon and a simple glaze.\nYou don’t need to have a smoker when you make these super-tender Camping Dutch Oven Ribs.\nThis classic camp dessert starts with a boxed cake mix that gets jazzed up to make a fantastically moist Dutch Oven Pineapple Upside Down Cake.\nYou can make camping grill recipes using a propane or charcoal grill. Some of our favorites include:\nThe soy and garlic flavors in this Grilled Halibut Fillet taste amazing and the recipe is fast to prep and cook.\nThis Grilled Flatbread With Prosciutto, Charred Tomatoes, Fresh Mozzarella And Basil makes a perfect appetizer or light meal.\nWe enjoy Grilled Potato Wedges with grilled burgers.

It is faster than a professional gas cooktop with a better simmer. It's easier to clean and vent, and fairly child safe.\nIn this article, you will learn all about the six best induction cooktops. You’ll see three brands you may know like years past, along with three newer names.\nWhy the change? Like every other appliance, buying an induction cooktop will be a problem due to availability issues.\nIn this list, you will have a few defaults to turn to if your favorite brand is not available. Also, you will learn the basics of induction, from how it works to the benefits.\nThen we will show you the best induction cooktops to consider, including the most reliable based on over 40,000 service calls completed by our service team last year. Lastly, we'll cover the answers to our clients' top five induction questions.\nLet's get started.Short on time? Get our free Induction Cooking Buying Guide\nHow Does Induction Cooking Work?\nUnlike the glass on a traditional electric cooktop, the glass on an induction cooktop does not get scolding hot. Instead, a magnet excites the molecules in the pan so that the pan itself becomes the cooking surface, bypassing the glass.\nFor this reason, induction is the most efficient cooking method as there is little loss of heat.\nBenefits of Induction Cooking\nThermador Freedom Induction Cooktop Installed on a Kitchen Island\nInduction is the most child-safe because the magnets need to sense metal to activate. Thus, your child can't accidentally turn it on.\nAs previously said, induction is faster than a professional gas cooktop or range. Induction boils faster and can hold a better simmer than an electric or gas cooktop.\nInduction is also the easiest to clean. Food can't be baked onto your cooktop since elements don't heat the glass.\nIt also does not require a professional ventilation hood like a gas cooktop because there is less heat emission.\nMassachusetts Residents Take Note: Induction complies with Massachusetts Make-Up Air Laws requiring Make-Up air over 400 CFM (Cubic Feet Per Minute), whereas professional gas does not. That is huge, by the way. You can use an existing hood for induction but not a professional gas cooktop.\nBest 36-Inch Induction Cooktops for 2022\nThe best-known premium brands are Miele, Thermador, and Wolf for good reasons. Typically, they offer the best features and are the most serious about premium appliances like induction.\nHowever, you should expect to wait for these brands. Overwhelming demand and kinks in supply chains have hurt even the best prepared.\nMiele KM6375 - $3,899\nMiele has produced induction cooktops for many years. The most popular is Miele's flush mount cooktop, the KM6375.\nMiele's induction cooktop has a great configuration with five cooking zones, allowing various pan sizes to fit on the cooktop. You have a 4-inch round burner to a 9 x 15-inch rectangular burner.\nIt also has a power boost setting like most other induction cooktops. However, with the Miele, two of these inductors are used simultaneously on the 9\" x 15\" burner providing an incredible 7700 watts of power. It requires a 50-amp connection.\nThis unit will connect to a Miele hood by Bluetooth to turn it on as you begin to cook. It also must be mounted flush with the countertop providing an incredibly modern, sleek look.\nAdditionally, it comes with a one-year warranty. Due to the flush mount requirements, having a warranty is ideal for newer countertops as advanced preparation is required.\nWolf CI365TF/S - $3,410\nOur chef’s favorite induction cooktop based on performance is Wolf. This Wolf cooktop features an 11-inch burner that can use up to 3700 watts of cooking power on the boost setting.\nThe four left burners can be \"bridged\" or connected in four ways to allow larger or odd-shaped pots and pans. No other brand offers a four-element bridge burner.\nYou can simultaneously utilize all four smaller burners, creating a 17\" x 17\" cooking surface. It’s great for using large pots for lobster or large roasting pans for searing.\nWolf’s induction cooktop has a melt setting on one of the burners for simmering or melting chocolate. This setting is like the simmer feature on all their gas ranges.\nYou can buy this cooktop with a full beveled stainless trim to provide extra protection to the glass surface, or it can have a complete flush installation. But you will need a great countertop manufacturer and installer.\nWolf's cooktop has a full two-year part and labor warranty (three years with Yale Installation). Also, an important note, this unit will require a 50-amp electrical connection.\nThermador CIT365YB - $3,599\nThermador has an entry-level model, but this high-end Freedom model lets you put a pan anywhere to maximize cooking space. With this flexible setup, you can use multiple 10-inch pans, a large griddle, or a Teppanyaki-style pan up to 16 inches long.\nIt has 17 power modes to help dial in the exact temperature, and in boost mode, it can utilize up to 3600 watts of power.\nThermador’s cooktop has numerous smart features, including a Move mode sensing your pan movement and maintaining the same power setting on the next burner. It also has a heat shift setting like a French top.\nThis cooktop features a two-year warranty and requires a 50-amp connection.\nNewer Induction Brands\nAlthough Wolf, Miele, and Thermador will always be in demand, these newer brands will fill the immediate void. They all have decent features, prices, and great availability. You won’t have to wait eight months for delivery.\nBeko BCTI36510 - $2,319\nBeko is a newer Turkish brand, but they are widely sold and popular in Europe. Their dishwashers and laundry are popular in this country. Then again, Beko, like LG, has managed its supply chain better than most.\nThe unit is simple but good, with the burner in the middle and two flex units on either side. Every burner is 3700 watts.\nFisher & Paykel CI365PTX4 - $3,499\nIn a sea of stainless-steel appliances, Fisher & Paykel stands out with some unique styling (of course, style is only a matter of opinion). Along with style, you have two powerful 5500-watt burners on this cooktop.\nMiele has the most power, but Fisher & Paykel has two of the fastest burners on this list.\nHaving these two 5500-watt burners means that you can operate the two burners at maximum power without sacrificing any heat from the other burners.\nFisher & Paykel offers a free five-year warranty on their appliances. However, five-year warranties can be an issue. Independent service companies do not typically repair appliances under warranty due to low reimbursement rates. So, you may not pay for service, but you may not find it either.\nSignature Kitchen Suite SKSIT3601G - $3,999\nWhat's so impressive about SKS (Signature Kitchen Suite) is its parent company LG. From reliability to availability, LG has been the best for the same reason. They produce more of their components, so they don't have problematic supply chain issues like other companies.\nBy producing motors and other major parts, LG has become the most reliable brand sold at Yale, with a service rate of only 4.4% within the first year versus 9.5% for the average.\nThe cooktop specifications are pretty good with a 7,000-watt burner and three 3700-watt burners. SKS has Wi-Fi to monitor the burners and sync to an SKS hood through their reliable ThinQ App.\nLastly SKS has a full three-year warranty.\nWhat to Consider When Buying an Induction Cooktop\nFirst off, your pans need to be magnetic (do not worry, most are), and if you plan to buy some new pots and pans, you do not have to spend a fortune buying special pans.\nIf a magnet sticks to the bottom, you are good to go. We recommend any grade 5 or better. Induction cooking surfaces work well with pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface.\nInduction Cooktops and Wall Ovens\nIf you plan on putting a wall oven below your induction cooktop, pay special attention to the manufacturer's specifications.\nOnly certain brands and models are approved to have an oven placed below in the same cabinet. Most can accommodate, but you always want to be sure.\nFor smart technology, you can sync your Miele or SKS cooktop to your ventilation hood, so it activates as soon as you turn on your cooktop. Smart is just basic for the moment on an induction top.\nAre Induction Cooktops Reliable?\nInduction cooktops require far less service than most appliances with a service rate of 6.1% within the first year of use. Induction cooktop reliability is excellent for all the major brands. The average appliance service rate is 9.5%.\nElectric, in general, has always been good because the burner is protected by glass. However, it's not an easy repair when you do need service. Check to make sure you have a capable service department in your area.\nInduction Cooktop Reliability from December 2020 to October 2021\nThese figures are based on a minimum of 20 cooktops sold per brand and over 400 total pieces.\nWolf and Thermador are the best on this list. Induction is 3% more reliable than appliances at 9.5% Then again, induction is under glass, so the chance for breakage is minimal. Most of these cooktops use 40-50 amps, so you want to plan your electrical properly.\nRead More: Most Reliable Induction Cooktops\nWhich Induction Cooktop Should You Buy?\nAll make compelling arguments for being the best cooktop. Of course, the best features now include availability because you can wait up to 15 months for appliances these days.\nThe Resident Chef at Yale loves the Wolf for its fast-heating response. It is the best cooktop for odd-shaped pans because of the four-burner bridge.\nMiele has the most power, while Thermador has the sensor moving the power when you move the pan. It is undoubtedly the most forward technologically.\nDo you take a chance on a newer brand? Fisher & Paykel has decent power and a five-year warranty. Warranties are great, but only if you get the unit repaired.\nSKS is an interesting choice because their parent company is so good. For a price with good features, then Beko should also be considered.\nIn your area, availability will probably cut this list in half. Then you want to choose features and who can fix induction near you.\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n1. Are induction cooktops better than gas or electric?\nInduction cooktops are better than gas or electric for a variety of reasons:\n- It is safer as the glass surface does not get hot (but there may be residual heat from the pan).\n- They require less ventilation due to less heat emission.\n- Cooking times are faster, saving energy and cooking time.\n- Response times are faster for specific recipes, and they will simmer lower.\n- Cleaning is easy because spills don't bake on.\n- Without a metal pan, induction can't activate. One of the values of this is a child can't power your cooktop by accident.\n2. Do induction cooktops use more electricity?\nInduction cooktops will also use less electricity due to their speed but will require higher watts and use 40-50 amps.\n3. How long do induction cooktops last?\nAs with most built-in appliances, the average lifespan of an induction cooktop should be around 10-15 years or more. The glass surface protects the working elements underneath, increasing its lifespan.\n4. What is Power Sharing?\nIn all the cooktops except BSH brands, if you turn on a burner on the highest level, it will \"share\" power with the burner behind it. So, that back burner will only be operating at 30% power, you can still warm food, but you are not cooking with both burners high in the same grid.\nFor an exact explanation, read Wolf's guide.\n\"For induction cooktops, boost mode boosts power on one element by diverting power from an adjacent element. If the adjacent element is on a high, the power output will be reduced. The power reduction is displayed on the power level indicator of the adjacent element. Illuminates when an element is in boost mode. Boost mode deactivates automatically after approximately 15 minutes of continuous operation and can be reactivated if desired.\"\n5. What is Power Boost?\nPowerBoost is for BSH brands such as Bosch, Gaggenau, and Thermador. It uses all the power of the back burner.\nFrom Thermador's Use and Care Manual:\n\"The PowerBoost function enables you to heat large quantities of water faster than when using [the] heat setting. This function can be activated for a cooking zone, provided the other cooking zone in the same group is not in use.\"\n6. Will induction affect your pacemaker?\nAlthough manufacturers claim induction is safe, you should check with the manufacturer of your pacemaker and your healthcare provider before making any purchase.\nRead our Induction Cooking Buying Guide for features, buying tips, and ratings of every available induction cooking product in the market.

Well drilling contractors dig or drill wells for water for agricultural or industrial use, or for drinking water for residences, businesses or communities. Shallow wells are occasionally made by driving (pounding) lengths of screen-covered piping into sand or soft soil until it reaches the water table.\nThe more common method is to drill with a truck-mounted rig, using an auger attached to lengths of piping. Typically, a pump with a submersible motor is then installed at the base of the pipes to supply water to the customer.\nCompanies engaged in MS water well drilling have very specific insurance needs that must be met if they are to remain in operation. The legal requirements regarding insurance policies vary depending on the state. However, it is not enough to simply have the bare minimum.\nIn order to ensure that your entire business operations, including your staff, equipment, and reputation, stay protected, you should be sure you have full and comprehensive water well drilling insurance Mississippi policy.\nWater well drilling insurance Mississippi protects your business from lawsuits with rates as low as $87/mo. Get a fast quote and your certificate of insurance now.\nKey Areas of Coverage Well Drillers Should Have\nRegardless of industry, there are a few key areas of coverage that all businesses should have. They may not be mandated by state legislation, but it is always advisable to opt for increased coverage to ensure you stay protected. These common areas include:\n- General Liability to protect you from third party claims of bodily injury or property damage. Drilling rigs are powerful and accidents can be costly.\n- Commercial Property to protect your buildings, products, tools, equipment, assets, information, and personal property. Property liability insurance also extends to third parties in most cases, covering their belongings and land should something go wrong.\n- Business Auto to cover any commercial vehicles. Many water well drilling companies opt for property and inland marine insurance, which often contains flow down-the-hole coverage and compensation for lost or damaged tools.\n- Commercial Umbrella to protect your company should a catastrophic liability claim render it impossible for you to conduct business at the same volume as you once could.\n- Workers Compensation to cover medical expenses and to compensate employees for lost wages if they get injured on the job.\n- Employers Practices Liability coverage to ensure you and your company have funds to defend yourselves against lawsuits and other employee-related claims.\nInsurance Needs For MS Well Drilling Companies\nIn addition to the basic insurance needs that all companies have, water well drilling companies have specific and unique concerns. If something goes wrong for one of these companies, the cost of any damage could be astronomical. Instead of risking it, and potentially losing your company, it is best to invest in extra insurance coverage.\nFlow breakout containment coverage and limited pollution coverage are two types of policies that all water well drilling companies should invest in:\n- Flow breakout containment coverage compensates companies for the costs they incur when containing any type of flow breakout, including the services, labor, and materials involved.\n- Pollution coverage is a must-have, as it protects you from paying financial damages caused by any accidental contamination or pollution affecting any water well drilling sites.\nAnother type of water well drilling insurance Mississippi coverage that water well drillers should have is inspection liability. It covers any errors or omissions made regarding work done in cooperation with water inspectors. For example, if there are any environmental concerns that arise as a result of a faulty or inadequate inspection, this type of coverage can compensate you for delays in work.\nData breach protection is another type of coverage that most companies should receive. Water well drilling companies in particular should consider this type of policy. Most companies in the industry have a lot of information about their clients. If a data breach or cyber-attack occurs, you could potentially lose that information, or have it stolen by unauthorized third parties. This type of technological coverage guarantees that you have the funds needed to secure your systems, notifying your clients, and settle any legal claims without going into debt or losing your company.\nMississippi Water Well Driller's Risks & Exposures\nPremises liability exposures at the contractor's office are generally limited due to lack of public access.\nAt the job site, excavation and construction pose numerous hazards. The area of operation should be restricted by barriers and proper signage to protect against trips, slips and falls from debris, equipment, or uneven ground. Construction sites create an attractive nuisance hazard, especially if work is close to residential areas.\nDigging can result in cutting utility cables, damaging property of the utility company and disrupting service to neighboring residences or businesses. Absence of detailed procedures to determine utility locations and to research prior uses of the land before digging may indicate a morale hazard.\nIn certain areas, upfront testing is imperative as deep drilling may take place near natural gas pockets that can explode unless controls are in place.\nCompleted operations exposures may arise from the failure of the well to supply the water expected. Submersible pumps are expensive to replace.\nWorkers compensation exposures can be high. Back injuries, hernias, sprains and strains can occur from lifting, material handling and work with hand tools. Overturn of equipment can result in severe injury or death from crushing or suffocation. Cumulative exposure to the high-decibel operations may result in permanent hearing impairment.\nUnderground hazards may arise from striking objects or utilities, collapse of retaining or holding walls, mudslides, landslides, underground water, and sinkholes. Any contact with utilities, specifically electrical cables or gas lines, can cause injury from explosion, electrocution, or inhalation of caustic substances.\nThe absence of good maintenance, proper use of basic safety equipment, such as steel-toed shoes, hearing and eye protection, and strict enforcement of safety practices may indicate a morale hazard.\nProperty exposures at the contractor's own location are usually limited to an office and storage of materials, equipment, and vehicles. The equipment and material in the yard is not normally susceptible to damage by fire or weather, but may be subject to vandalism.\nWelding equipment, if any, presents a heavy fire exposure and should be conducted away from flammables. Any flammable chemicals or oxygen tanks must be properly labeled, separated, and stored in approved containers, cabinets, and rooms.\nCrime exposures are from employee dishonesty. Background checks, including criminal history, should be obtained on each employee prior to hiring. Ordering, billing, and disbursement should be handled as separate duties with reconciliations occurring regularly. There should be appropriate procedures in place when employees accept payments off site.\nInland marine exposures include accounts receivable if the driller offers credit to customers, contractors' equipment taken to job sites, and valuable papers and records for customers' and suppliers' information. Drilling equipment can be large and difficult to transport without adequate loading, tie-down, and unloading procedures.\nGround at the construction site may be uneven. Equipment may strike underground objects, strike utility cables, fall into holes or pits, slip or fall into mud, water, or sinkholes, be damaged in rock, land or mud slides, or burst into fire from overload. Equipment left at job sites may be targets for theft and vandalism.\nCommercial auto exposures can be high due to the transport of materials, machinery, and equipment. All drivers must be well trained and have valid licenses for the type of vehicle being driven. MVRs must be run on a regular basis. Random drug and alcohol testing should be conducted.\nVehicles must be well maintained with records kept in a central location. Since the drilling rig is normally truck-mounted, much of the actual drilling falls under the auto liability hazard rather than premises liability. Some of the driving may be done on temporary access roads, increasing the risk of collision and overturn.\nWhat To Look For In An Insurer\nWater well drilling companies need to be incredibly picky when looking for an insurance provider.

They can work on smaller projects directly with a home owner, usually specializing in renovations or remodels.\nIn business insurance speak, often called 'artisan contractors' or 'casual contractors', they are involved in many aspects of construction and contracting work – and include various trades and skills. Carpenters, painters, plumbers, electricians, roofers, tree trimmers, landscaping are just a few examples. They may do roofing, fencing, drywall, tile work and many other trades that involve skilled work with tools at the customer's premises.\nAn artisan contractor performs a single trade or job, and each has its own specialized liability needs with its own exposures to risk and accidents. Contractors liability insurance can offer coverage for bodily injury, property damage, advertising injury and medical payments.\nMost artisan contractors should have commercial general liability at the very least, but many need broader coverages - like an umbrella to increase their limits of liability, inland marine policy to protect their tools, workers compensation if they have employees, and even commercial auto if they use vehicles for business purposes.\nMinimum recommended small business insurance coverage: Business Personal Property, Employee Dishonesty, Contractors' Equipment and Tools, General Liability, Employee Benefits Liability, Umbrella Liability, Automobile Liability and Physical Damage, Hired and Non-owned Auto & Workers Compensation.\nOther commercial insurance policies to consider: Building, Business Income with Extra Expense, Earthquake, Flood, Leasehold Interest, Real Property Legal Liability, Accounts Receivable, Builders Risk, Computers, Goods in Transit, Installation Floater, Valuable Papers and Records, Cyber Liability, Employment-related Practicesand Stop Gap Liability.\nRequest a free Water Well Drilling Insurance Mississippi quote in Aberdeen, Amory, Baldwyn, Batesville, Bay St. Louis, Beechwood, Biloxi, Booneville, Brandon, Brookhaven, Byram, Canton, Carthage, Clarksdale, Cleveland, Clinton, Columbia, Columbus, Corinth, Crystal Springs, D'Iberville, Diamondhead, Ellisville, Escatawpa, Florence, Flowood, Forest, Fulton, Gautier, Greenville, Greenwood, Grenada, Gulf Hills, Gulf Park Estates, Gulfport, Guntown, Hattiesburg, Hazlehurst, Hernando, Holly Springs, Horn Lake, Houston, Indianola, Iuka, Jackson, Kosciusko, Latimer, Laurel, Leland, Long Beach, Louisville, Lucedale, Lyman, Madison, Magee, McComb, Meridian, Mississippi State, Morton, Moss Point, Natchez, New Albany, New Hope, Newton, Nicholson, Ocean Springs, Olive Branch, Oxford, Pascagoula, Pass Christian, Pearl, Pearl River, Petal, Philadelphia, Picayune, Pontotoc, Poplarville, Richland, Ridgeland, Ripley, Saltillo, Senatobia, Southaven, St. Martin, Starkville, Tupelo, Tutwiler, University, Vancleave, Verona, Vicksburg, Water Valley, Waveland, Waynesboro, West Hattiesburg, West Point, Wiggins, Winona, Yazoo City and all other MS cities & Mississippi counties near me in The Magnolia State.\nAlso find MS local small businesses by General Liability Class Code and learn about Mississippi small business insurance requirements for general liability, business property, commercial auto & workers compensation including MS business insurance costs.

{"question":"How did US Army nurses serve in WWII combat zones, and what career opportunities are available to them after service?","answer":"During WWII, US Army nurses served closer to front lines than ever before, working in field hospitals, evacuation hospitals, hospital trains, ships, and as flight nurses on medical transport planes. Their skill contributed to an extremely low post-injury mortality rate of less than 4% among American forces. After service, Army Nurse Corps officers have numerous career options including positions at federal institutions like the VA, large nonprofit health systems like Ascension (76 hospitals across 24 states), academic positions at nursing schools, and opportunities at major medical centers like Kaiser Permanente.","context":["Germany: At the National Socialist first party congress held at Weimar, Germany, Hitler's personal authority over the party is accepted by the majority and his position of party Fuhrer is formally approved.\n1937 — , July 4\nSpain: Day 353 of 985 of the Spanish Civil War.\n1938 — , July 4\nSpain: Day 718 of 985 of the Spanish Civil War.\nCBI - China: Day 363 of 2,987 of the 2nd Sino-Japanese War.\nDay 24 of 139 of the Battle of Wuhan.\n1939 — , July 4\nUSA: Lou Gehrig gives his famous \"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.\" speech.\nCBI - China: Day 728 of 2,987 of the 2nd Sino-Japanese War.\nDay 21 of 68 of the Battle of Tianjin.\nCBI - Mongolia: Day 55 of 129 of the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, a border dispute between the Soviet Union and Japan.\n1940 — , July 4\nUK: Winston Churchill receives his first standing ovation in the House of Commons as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom after delivering a speech justifying the attack on French warships.\nAtlantic: German Stukas and motored torpedo boats attack a British convoy south of Bournemouth, England, near Portland, sinking 5 merchant ships.\nETO - UK: The Dame of Sark, ruler of the island of Sark in the English Channel, surrenders to German troops.\nETO - France: In direct response to the devastating British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, the Vichy French government of Marshal Pétain breaks off diplomatic relations with Britain.\nMTO - Egypt: Italian bombers raid on Malta and at Alexandria.\nMTO - Algeria: The British sub HMS PANDORA sinks the French gunboat RIGAULT DE GENOUILLY off Oran.

{"question":"How different are the facial expressions et nonverbales for happiness vs sadness across les cultures du monde?","answer":"Facial expressions for happiness (like smiling) and sadness (like frowning) are universal across cultures worldwide - they are displayed and interpreted similarly regardless of cultural background. These are among the few nonverbal cues that do not vary cross-culturally, while most other forms of nonverbal communication (like touch, space, and gestures) have different meanings in different cultures. The universality of basic emotional expressions through facial displays makes them a reliable way to recognize fundamental human emotions across cultural boundaries.","context":["Using Nonverbal Communication Effectively\nResearch suggests that communication is as much as 93 percent nonverbal. That is, communication relies far more heavily on what is unsaid, rather than the words used. Researchers have identified 10 areas of nonverbal communication. It's important to note that the messages embedded in most of these vary cross-culturally, while others are universal.\nFacial displays are the facial expressions people make when sending their messages. These include furrowing and raising of the eyebrows, smiling, frowning, scowling, and others. Smiling and frowning are universal signs of happiness and irritation/sadness when used genuinely, though their intentional use for particular purposes can vary cross-culturally. Facial displays are important for identity, attraction, and emotion.\nCoupled with facial displays, eye behaviors comprise a great deal of nonverbal messaging behaviors. This includes eye contact, as well as eye expressions. The degree to which eye behaviors contribute to nonverbal communication may be represented by the old proverb \"the eyes are the windows to the soul.\"\nMovement and gestures constitute all other body movements. This category includes the hand and arm gestures we make to accompany speech, or, at times, to replace speech. An example of this is the hostile gesture of \"flipping the bird,\" which has a meaning unto itself and needs no words to accompany it for the recipient to fully understand the sender's intention. This category also includes posture, which can speak volumes about a person's self-image and degree of self-confidence.\nThe category of touch is known to researchers as \"haptics.\" The amount and location of touch can provide indications to the degree of intimacy between two people, though such indications vary cross-culturally. For example, in the U.S., it is widely acceptable to touch someone on the shoulder in professional or other non-intimate contexts, though in some cultures the shoulder area is considered sacred and any touch there is considered highly intimate. Appropriate locations of touch also vary across co-cultures. For example, on the athletic field a pat on the derrière from the coach to a player is completely acceptable and means \"good job,\" but the same touch in the classroom from a teacher to a student is highly inappropriate -- and can land that teacher in jail! Touch conveys affection, care giving, power and control, aggression, and ritual.\nNonverbal cues in the voice are known to researchers as \"vocalics.\" These cues cover a wide range of categories, including volume (loud or quiet), pitch (high or low), inflection (variations in pitch), tone (reflecting emotion or mood), speed or rate, use of filler words (e.g. \"like,\" \"ya know,\" \"um\"), accent, articulation (clarity of speech), and use of silence to convey meaning. Most of these areas vary by the demands of the social context in which we find ourselves.\nThe study of smell as a nonverbal cue is known to researchers as \"olfactics.\" Smells can influence our moods and our memories, thus affecting our communication behavior. Smells often accompany specific emotions and play a role in sexual attraction. We often intentionally manipulate our own smells, and those of our environments, with commercial products in an effort to communicate a more positive message of ourselves and our space.\n\"Proxemics\" is the study of space. Each culture has its own defined expected space \"bubble\" for its inhabitants. In many Asian cultures, for example, where physical space is limited due to large populations in small land areas, the people are accustomed to -- and comfortable with -- a far smaller individual space \"bubble\" than are those of us in the West. That is, while in the West we are comfortable with a conversational distance of approximately two feet, people in the East are comfortable with a much shorter distance.The reverse is also true; in some Middle Eastern cultures, the comfortable conversational distance between mixed genders is much greater -- as much as five to six feet. As the amount of space between two people decreases or increases, that is an indication of the degree of intimacy between those two people. In close, highly intimate relationships, such as partners, family, and close friends, participants tend to be comfortable with very small space bubbles, while professional relationships or those between strangers demand much greater distance.\nWhether intentional or not, we tend to place great value on personal appearance. More attractive people are perceived to possess many positive characteristics, including honesty and intelligence; and more attractive people tend to have higher self-esteem and date more frequently than their less attractive counterparts. We tend to place a high value on physical appearance when making assessments about others, whether we intend to or not. Appropriate attire for an occasion also fits within this category. If you wear a low-cut, sequined evening gown to a traditional job interview, you won't likely get the job!\n\"Chronemics\" is the use of time, and sends important nonverbal messages. No matter what time you may arrive for an appointment, that says something about you. Are you 30 minutes early? Ten minutes early? Three minutes early? Exactly on time? Three minutes late? Ten minutes late? Thirty minutes late? Whatever time you arrive suggests two things: It sends messages of the value you place on the appointment and the person with whom you have the appointment, and your (perceived) position of power relative to the person you're meeting. You wait to see the doctor; the doctor doesn't wait to see you. Consider also the length of time between a first date and a phone call requesting a second date. What do you think of the man who calls a woman for a second date on his drive home from their first one? What do you think of him if he waits two weeks? Two months? When we consider the differences in the messages sent by each scenario, we can more clearly understand the importance of the nonverbal messages sent by our use of time.\nThe use of artifacts is the final category for discussion of nonverbal communication, and includes the things we surround ourselves with. This is the car we drive (or don't), the home we live in, and its furnishings and decorations. We often make these decisions consciously, as intentional reflections of ourselves and our preferred tastes. What we may not consciously realize is that we're using these artifacts as nonverbal channels of self-expression. Color also falls under this category, as colors influence our moods and disposition. There is a reason prison walls are not painted red: Red promotes aggressiveness and there would be regular riots!\nNonverbal communication essentially falls within these 10 categories. It supplements our verbal communication, replaces it, or contradicts it. Nonverbal communication has several essential functions, which we will see in a moment.\nFunctions of Nonverbal Communication\nThe first function of nonverbal communication is in managing conversations. We invite conversation with our nonverbal communication cues. As an example of this, imagine you are at a party and see someone you wish to speak with. What do you do to let them know you'd like to engage in conversation? You may decrease the physical distance between you by moving closer. Perhaps you make eye contact, or perhaps you \"accidentally\" bump into her. Research suggests the three nonverbal cues especially relevant for inviting conversation are proxemics, personal appearance, and eye contact.\nIn addition to inviting conversation, we also manage conversation with nonverbal communication. We tend to use eye contact, gestures and tone of voice as turn-taking signals (a signal that you're wrapping up your speaking turn and turning the floor over to the other person, or that you wish to speak). For example, we might raise a finger to signal that we either would like to speak, or that we are not finished speaking. Research suggests we tend to use eye contact more when listening than when speaking, so when we're ready to give the other person a turn to speak, we might re-establish eye contact. Changes in tone of voice can signal changes in the conversation. For example, in English we tend to let the pitch of the last few words drop as an indication that we are finished with our speaking turn, or rise as an indication that we have posed a question.\nWe also use nonverbal cues when ending conversations. When we feel it's time to end a conversation, we might express it directly through the words we choose. Another option is to use leave-taking behaviors, which are nonverbal signals that you are ready to end the conversation. Research suggests these typically include changes in eye behavior and posture, most notably breaking eye contact. Since we tend to maintain eye contact when listening, breaking eye contact would be an indication that we are ready to stop listening. We also tend to angle our posture away from our conversation partner when we are ready to leave the conversation, and toward the direction we wish to go.\nOur emotions can influence our behavior in numerous ways. For example, when we're angry, we may be less patient than usual, and when we're nervous, we may tend to be more withdrawn or cautious. The ability to interpret another's emotions by his or her nonverbal cues can help us better interact with that person. The two most common nonverbal channels of emotional expression are facial expressions and vocalics. The face is where most of us \"wear\" our emotions. An important consideration is that emotional displays on the face vary little across cultures, making facial displays of emotion virtually universal. Another remarkably expressive channel of emotional expression is the voice. We can often \"hear\" a person's emotion --- not in what they say, but in how they say it. Research has shown that anger, surprise, happiness, fear, and affection tend to result in a higher-than-normal vocal pitch, while emotions of disgust, boredom, and extreme grief tend to lower the vocal pitch. Also, fear tends to markedly increase vocal speed, anger tends to slightly increase it, sadness tends to slightly decrease it, and disgust tends to markedly decrease our vocal speed. Our speech becomes faster when we're excited, but slower when we're content.\nOther nonverbal channels also contribute to emotional expression. For example, hostile emotions such as anger, disgust, envy, and jealousy often result in door-slamming and teeth-gritting, as well as decreasing proximity and closing distance in an aggressive manner. These emotions also tend to lead us to distance ourselves in terms of time, staying away from the person for a while. Sadness and anxiety are often conveyed through slouched posture, slow movement, excessive fidgeting, and frequent head-scratching or picking lint off your shirt. Happiness and affection tend to lead us to wish to spend more time with others, to enhance our physical appearance, to give gifts, and to engage in mutual eye contact with those in our surroundings.\nCommunication plays an important role in relationship maintenance, and nonverbal communication is especially important for key features of relationships. These include attraction and affiliation, power and dominance, and arousal and relaxation.\nImmediacy behaviors (e.g. flirting) convey attraction or affiliation. Flirting is often marked by increased eye contact, close proximity, playful touching, and expressive vocal tones to indicate interest. The role of nonverbal cues in established relationships continues to bear importance, and is often marked by hugs, kisses, hand holding, and softer and higher-pitched vocal tones. Whether with romantic partners, family, or friends, these behaviors help reinforce feelings of affiliation, intimacy, and love.\nPower is the ability to affect another's behavior, and dominance is the actual exercise of that potential. Nonverbal cues are often used to mark a person's power and status. For example, supervisors touch subordinates far more often than subordinates touch supervisors, and a person in a position of power is far more likely to keep a less powerful person waiting, than vice versa. A certain look can convey dominance, such as that from a teacher to a student, or a parent to a child. Some people use silence as a way of silencing others. These are some examples of how nonverbal behavior can be used to control the behavior of others.\nArousal means the increase of energy, and can be primarily experienced either positively or negatively. Consider relating an exciting success or a real scare. When arousal is positive, it is experienced as excitement. This is marked nonverbally by increased eye contact, more laughter, faster speech, higher vocal pitch and volume, and closer proximity to others. When arousal is experienced negatively, it is anxiety. This is marked by fidgeting and random movement, nervous smiling and laughter, increased gestures, higher vocal pitch and speech rate, and more filler word usage.\nArousal's opposite is relaxation, which is decreased energy. When accompanied by positive emotion, it is contentment. This is marked by increased smiling, more relaxed posture, and increased eye contact and proximity with those around us. When accompanied by negative emotion, relaxation is depression, and is marked by decreased smiling, less frequent eye contact, and use of fewer gestures.\nAs you can see, nonverbal communication plays significant roles in our lives. Nonverbal cues convey meaning in a variety of contexts, and strongly help to define and manage our relationships with others. The roles of nonverbal communication are not limited to those mentioned in this sectioc. Rather, as we see in a later lesson, nonverbal communication cues have even farther-reaching use and are employed in additional circumstances.\n- The Effects of Emotions on Communications\n- How to Be Assertive and Confident in Your Communication without Being Aggressive\n- Targeting Your Message for Effective Communication\n- Communication Studies: Interpersonal Perception\n- The Benefits of Social Relationships\n- Applying The Process for Making Decisions\n- Career Management: The Value of Mentorship\n- How to Identify the Right Solution for the Right Problem in Decision Making\n- Collaborative Teams Life Cycle\n- The Process of Copywriting in Search Engine Optimization\n- Foundations of Various Reasoning Skills\n- Unhealthy Self-Esteem Signs\n- Career Coaching: Helping Clients Interview\n- Defining and Planning the Principles of Corporate Finance\n- Career Management: Leveraging the Performance Appraisal","Nonverbal Communication: What’s it all about?\nCommunication is critical to continued human development throughout our life span. It is what allows us to share thoughts, feelings, wonderings, and knowledge with others. Whether you are a verbal or nonverbal communicator, the vast majority of communication we do is through nonverbal channels.\nSo if nonverbal communication makes up a substantial portion of our communicative experience, what does it involve? Many of us associate facial expression and gestures with nonverbal communication, but these are not the only two types involved. There are, in fact, eight different types of nonverbal communication:\n- Facial Expression\nThis makes up the largest proportion of nonverbal communication. Large amounts of information can be conveyed through a smile or frown. The facial expressions for happiness, sadness, anger, and fear are similar across cultures throughout the world.\nCommon gestures include pointing, waving, and using fingers to indicate number amounts.\nThis includes factors such as tone of voice, loudness, inflection, and pitch. Tone of voice can be powerful. The same sentence said in different tones can convey different messages. A strong tone of voice may indicate approval or enthusiasm, whereas the same sentence said with a hesitant tone of voice may convey disapproval or lack of interest.\n- Body Language and Posture\nA person’s posture and movement can also convey a great deal of information. Arm crossing or leg-crossing conveys different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting them. Body language is very subtle, and may not be very definitive.\nThis refers to personal space. The amount of space a person requires depends on each individual’s preference, but also depends on the situation and other people involved in the situation.\n- Eye Gaze\nLooking, staring, and blinking are all considered types of eye gaze. Looking at another person can indicate a range of emotions including hostility, interest, or attraction.\nThis refers to communicating through touch. Haptics is especially important in infancy and early childhood.\nOur choice of color, clothing, hairstyles, and other factors affecting our appearance are considered a means of nonverbal communication.\nBy the time most children are one year old, they are experts in nonverbal communication. They have spent the whole first year of their lives making their wants and needs known, as well as sharing their experiences through nonverbal channels. Around the time of their first birthday, they add the next layer to their dynamic communication repertoire with the verbal piece. Even with the addition of verbal communication, nonverbal expression continues to be the main mode of communication for children as they add more and more words to their vocabulary. Even after children are talking in sentences, nonverbal communication continues to add meaning and structure to the messages being sent and received.\nThis use and understanding of nonverbal communication becomes automatic for ‘neuro-typical’ children. It is so automatic that many of us are completely unaware that we employ facial expressions and gestures, or that we are using this information to enhance the words we are hearing from our communication partner. We continue to use this mode of communication throughout life.\nThink about the word “no,” which can be interpreted in many different ways depending on the nonverbal communication that is being conveyed along with the word. If we say “noooo” with a wrinkled nose and a questioning tone or funny voice, this could convey that we are unsure or don’t really believe what we are hearing. If we hear someone say “NO!” with a loud, or harsh voice, we can interpret that they person is angry or wants an action to be terminated. If someone asks you if you would like a drink, you may answer with “no”; but your tone of voice will most likely be even with little inflection, and your face may just be neutral. In each of these examples the person was saying “no,” but there were three different meanings being conveyed. Without nonverbal communication, it would be difficult to know how to interpret the word.\nMany children with autism spectrum disorders have difficulty interpreting multiple modes of communication, and because of this they often miss the nonverbal communication piece that allows accurate interpretation of what is said. In the examples provided above, most children with autism spectrum disorders would only hear the word “no” but miss the nonverbal pieces which help to interpret which “no” is being communicated. This misinterpretation can lead to frustration on the part of both the communicator and the child who is struggling to understand what is happening. At other times, the child may interpret a facial expression, tone of voice, or gesture but not hear the words that went with the nonverbal, which again results in miscommunication. These breakdowns make it difficult for the child to make sense of his/her world.\nWorking to improve the use and understanding of nonverbal communication is essential for a person with an autism spectrum or neurological disorder. In most cases, working to improve nonverbal communication is the best place to begin improving communication abilities. Expanding the ability to use and understand nonverbal communication provides the necessary foundation for building meaningful dynamic communication. Just as a neuro-typical infant begins by communicating nonverbally, going back and teaching this mode of communication for children who may have missed this step is the foundation for productive communication throughout life.\nTeaching nonverbal communication should be done in a natural way that makes sense for each individual child. Telling a child, “look at my face,” or showing a child several pictures of people’s faces and having him/her identify the emotions he sees is not a natural way to work on nonverbal communication. Spending time doing activities with the child where the adult uses very little verbal communication, but is communicating through nonverbal channels, is an effective way to begin introducing nonverbal communication. Playing games where you have changed the rules slightly so as to use only nonverbal communication can also be a fun and more natural way of working on nonverbal communication. For example, you might play Simon Says, using a made up signal for when Simon says to do something. Playing charades can also be a fun way to work on nonverbal communication in a natural context. Take a walk with your child; but instead of saying, “hey look at that dog,” you might pause, point and vocalize, “oh” with a rising inflection to draw attention. There are many ways to work on nonverbal communication that can be explored and used to build this critical foundational piece of communication."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0637f2e6-3980-4557-9a57-bae4bde12305>","<urn:uuid:c71350e4-52d7-451b-9ed7-6f32c8c5a3f6>"],"error":null}

It is commonly served alongside corn or boiled sweet potatoes.","context":["Peru boasts a diverse landscape spanning 1500 miles of endless Pacific coastline, subterranean jungles of the Amazon, and the magnificent Andes mountains featuring the Inca Trail which leads to the citadel of Machu Picchu in the Cuzco cloud forest. Visitors to this beautiful South American country will also experience culinary delights not found anywhere else in the world. Historic sites transport visitors back thousands of years to the ancient Incan civilization and the Spanish conquest of the 1500’s. Pack your hiking shoes, a good camera and plenty of memory discs and prepare to encounter countless photographic opportunities while traversing Peru’s awe-inspiring geography and multifarious terrain.\nThe Peruvian Cuisine\nThe Peruvian people are passionate about their indigenous cuisine. While Peruvian food consists primarily of maize (corn) dishes, rice, eggs, soups and stews, most of Peru’s 25 regions are also recognized for specific flavors and dishes.\n- Lomo Saltado – This is a very popular dish made with strips of steak which are sautéed in a blend of soy sauce, garlic, vinegar, onions, chilies, and tomatoes. The flavorful mixture is often placed on a bed of lettuce and served with chips (French fries).\n- Peruvian Ceviche –This beloved Peruvian dish is prepared with bites of fresh, raw white fish which have been marinated and ‘cooked’ in the acidity of lemon and lime juice, and blended with onions, Peruvian spices and chilies. Ceviche is served in a variety of ways, often alongside corn or boiled sweet potatoes.\n- Cuy – If you or your children have ever owned a pet guinea pig, you would perhaps choose to skip this dish. Cuy is the Peruvian translation for guinea pig. The Andean culture of Peru, Ecuador and other South American countries often raise the these animals in their homes; Cuy are considered an important part of the country’s food supply.\n- Pisco – This high-proof brandy is a favorite Peruvian alcoholic beverage. Often made in the wine-producing regions of Peru and Chile, Pisco is frequently mixed in cocktails such as an Algarrobina, Chicano de Pisco, or a Cupid’s Cup. A favorite beer among Peruvians is Cusqueña Premium Peruvian beer which is primarily produced in the town of Sacha near Arequipa, Peru.\nPeruvian Geography and Landmarks\nFrom the primeval Amazon Rain Forest to Machu Picchou, an ancient Incan city in the rugged Andes mountain range, to the narrow, arid plains lining the Pacific coastal region, Peru’s terrain is as diverse and interesting as the country’s ethnic and social demography.\nMachu Picchou – Peru’s most prominent attraction is Machu Picchou, a spectacular ancient city of the Incas which remained undiscovered by invading Spaniards in the 1500’s. This urban creation located in the Amazon Basin is a magnificent maze of giant walls, ramps and terraces. Machu Piccho is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and is listed as one of the New7 Wonders of the World. It is recommended to visit this ancient city early in the morning in order to capture premium photographs without the tourist throngs. Visitors can readily hire a guide at the entrance to enhance their grand and acquire historic and cultural facts on the city.\nMancora – A popular site for surfing lovers, Mancora is located on the north coast in Peru’s Piura Region and is considered the country’s trendiest beach. With over 30 resorts and numerous restaurants and nightclubs, this town of only 10,000 residents attracts thousands of sun worshippers, travelers and surfers each year.\nNazca Desert and Nazca Lines – This amazing series of immense line drawings was created between 200 BC and 700 AD. Located between Nazca and Palpa on the north coast, the drawings feature monkeys, fish, llamas, lizards, and humans. The observation tower along the Pan-American Highway provides visitors with an incredible view of three of the figures. The ideal way to see and photograph the lines is via one a Cessna Flight Tour, which can be booked at your hotel.\nThe Sacred Valley – Located in the beautiful yet daunting foothills of the Rio Urubamba Valley, the Sacred Valley is replete with ancient villages and historic lore. Located in the Cusco region near Machu Picchu, it was the primary area for corn (maize) production, and was once considered the heartland of the Inca Empire. Archaeology lovers do not want to miss a tour of the Sacred Valley.\nWith a history of civilizations that spans thousands of years, the Peruvian people have fastidiously preserved the cultural and geographic diversity which make this country so fascinating. Cobblestone streets designed by the Spanish Conquistadors have been protected and preserved for the future. The ancient city of Machu Pichu reminds travelers of the impenetrable Inca Empire. The mystical lines found in the Nazca Desert remain unexplained today. While Spanish is Peru’s primary language, the traditional dialect of Quechua is still utilized by the highland Indians of the Andes. And lying just outside of Puerto Maldonado in eastern Peru, the primeval habitats and natural resources found within in the subterranean jungles of the Amazon maintain an unrivaled biodiversity.\nIn the words of J.R.R.

If you choose some functions to gain quick access to in this setting as soon as you turn your camera off the camera goes back to what it was before so when its turned back on you’d have to reset the functions again.\nP – Program Mode\nThe “P” mode means Program. The camera will pick your shutter speed and F-stop. Please note: you still have to pick your ISO and many other settings like white balance, color style, etc.\nTV – Shutter Priority Mode\nThe “Tv” mode means Shutter Priority. You will pick the shutter speed and the camera will pick the F-Stop. Please note: you also have to pick the white balance, ISO, color styles, etc. This would be helpful is you are hand holding and want to make sure your camera will not shoot below the shutter speed of 1/125 of a second so that you don’t get motion blur.\nAV – Aperture Priority Mode\nThe “Av” mode means Aperture Priority. You will pick your F-Stop and the camera will pick the shutter speed. This is where you control your depth of field so if you want to make sure you have nice shallow depth of field at say F 1.4 on a 50mm lens, then you would set you camera here. Please note: you also have to pick the white balance and ISO, color styles, etc.\nM – Manual Mode\nAnd now for my favorite shooting mode, “M” for manual. This is where you have total control and have to tell the camera all the settings.\nB – Bulb Mode\n“B” stands for Bulb and means that when the shutter release button is pressed the entire time you are holding down that shutter release button the camera is taking a picture, the shutter is open the entire time. This is used mostly for night photography and obviously on a tripod.\nC1, C2, C3 – Custom Modes\nThe other modes on my dial above, C1, C2, C3, are for the user to make custom settings and then save them for later use. The camera will retain these settings that you program after you turn off the camera, unlike the CA mode mentioned above.\nI suggest to use these semi-automatic shooting modes when you simply don’t have the time to shoot manually. These modes can work well under certain conditions – which usually are landscapes and portraits outside. With shooting food these automatic settings can be difficult to get good exposures with and usually have to be combined with other settings like Exposure Compensation to get a good exposure.\nIf you have been shooting in these semi automatic modes and have not looked at your other settings like ISO, white balance and color style I suggest you look at them right now and see what they are set to. Often times the default will have these settings set to “automatic”. But if you discover that they are not set to “automatic” this could explain if you are having issues with white balance or issues with exposures in general, if you discover your ISO is set to 1600 for instance. As I’ve mentioned before I am never a fan of putting settings to automatic when I’m shooting food in the studio, especially the white balance and ISO because every time you take a shot these settings will shift which will alter the color and quality of your shots and give you inconsistent results frame by frame.\nNow is the time to see what your color settings are set to on your camera. These are called different things on different cameras. Canon cameras calls this setting “Picture Style”. Nikons call this “Set Picture Control”. This setting is for people who will not use a computer to do any image editing at all. We are going to do some editing, so we don’t want the camera to adjust these settings. Make sure for both brands you are set to “Neutral”.\nHappy Shooting friends!\nIf you liked this post, please share it and sign up below so you don’t miss the next one."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d6f69a19-51e3-482e-bc8e-0477647e5e04>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do stability features compare between Alpine downhill vs Telemark ski equipment? Looking for differences in heel binding and control mechanisms.","answer":"Alpine and Telemark skiing equipment have key differences in their stability features. Alpine skiing uses fixed heel bindings and non-flexing boots, while Telemark equipment features free heel bindings where the heel is not locked to the ski and boots can flex at the toes. The free heel binding in Telemark skiing allows greater boot separation (forward and back), which increases stability. This design provides more front-to-back stability when using free heel bindings, particularly beneficial when skiing powder or uneven terrain. Additionally, Telemark equipment doesn't require switching bindings between uphill and downhill modes since the heel always stays free, unlike Alpine gear.","context":["Trip Selection Help\nOur guide to help you choose the right trip\nFirst, decide what you want to do …\nFor a full explanation of the three different forms of skiing, please visit our Skiing Information pages.\nOn- and off-piste freeheel downhill skiing (i.e. not only Telemark turns) and touring on Alpine terrain (day tours or hut-to-hut). Uplift is used on all courses. Shaped, wide or 'fat' Telemark skis and plastic boots are the norm. Skins and other specialist equipment are needed on touring options.\nDay tours, coaching sessions or multi-day tours using cambered, metal-edged skis and leather or soft plastic touring boots. Waxes are usually used and skins only for bigger climbs. Terrain is gentle to moderate, depending on the week. Skiing is usually on way-marked routes but sometimes through untracked snow. Only the easiest tours have machine-prepared trails.\nAlpine (Downhill) skiing:\nFor those on downhill or Alpine ski equipment we offer courses for off-piste skiing, coaching in touring techniques and tours in Alpine terrain (day tours or hut-to-hut). Uplift is used on all courses. Shaped, wide or 'fat' skis are the norm, fixed heel bindings and non-flexing boots. Skins and other specialist equipment are needed on touring options.\nInstruction in Telemark, Alpine or Nordic techniques and skills. Usually held within ski areas, using on- and off-piste slopes or Nordic trails, as relevant to the course. 5 x half days instruction (and 5 x half days 'free'!) with a 6th 'free' day – or as detailed for some specialist courses. Video analysis will be available on most of the courses in the Alps.\n'Off-piste Adventure' and 'Off-piste Total Adventure' weeks include 5 full days of coaching and leadership with the 6th day free.\nWhatever your level, you will be coached only with others of a similar ability. Choosing the correct level means you can maximize enjoyment and progress. Courses of more than one level may run during a week. This allows couples/friends of different ability to come on the same week.\nLed by appropriately qualified instructors, leaders or mountain guides depending on venue or terrain, for the full period of day tours or multi-day, hut-to-hut tours, with coaching tips included 'en route'.\n'ALL MOUNTAIN' COURSES\nOur standard instruction weeks based in a ski area but with the emphasis on developing your skiing performance for all snow conditions, slopes and speeds – the all-rounder week for skiing the whole mountain. Our most popular course has a strong focus on your skiing versatility and adaptability, whatever the technique and your level; going off-piste (close to the piste) will usually be a part of these weeks, weather and snow conditions permitting.\nABILITY SPECIFIC GROUPS: If an 'All Mountain' course is advertised as, say, for Levels 1 – 4 this does not mean all abilities will be mixed together in one group. We always ensure that all clients ski in an appropriate ability group and, in any one week, there could 2, 3 or even 4 'sub-groups' within the 'All Mountain' course, each 'sub-group' being ability and/or pace specific.\nTELEMARK & ALPINE SKIERS: We include skiers on Alpine/Downhill equipment on these 'All Mountain' courses as well. Over recent seasons we have found this works well and we ensure that both Alpine and Telemark skiers receive equal and appropriate instruction. Typically early in the week Alpine and Telemark skiers will be in the same group focusing on the same techniques e.g. snowplough and parallel turns. Later in the week the group will be split so Telemark skiers can focus on learning/developing Telemark techniques whilst Alpine skiers will maintain the focus on improving their parallel skiing skills. No one is compromised and everyone improves.\nThe focus of these courses is on being able to ski any snow that is not groomed or made from snow cannons, i.e. that snow beyond the piste markers. To quote Sir Arnold Lunn, the inventor of slalom skiing and promoter of lift-served skiing in the Alps in the 1920s and 30s: 'for excitement the piste is perhaps the best, but the beauty and variety and subtlety of skiing is only known to the expert on natural snow'. We'll show you how to adapt and enjoy 'the beauty and variety and subtlety of skiing' in this challenging but supremely rewarding environment.\nGETTING READY FOR OFF-PISTE: The quickest way to develop your skiing skills ready for off-piste is to do an 'All Mountain' course. The 'All Mountain' weeks establish sound fundamentals for your skiing and these fundamentals are essential for speedy and satisfying development of your off-piste skiing. Weak fundamentals that are challenged by skiing off-piste too soon will result in relatively slow and frustrating development and with a relatively high likelihood of having a negative experience. The 'All Mountain' weeks do include off-piste skiing as well as on-piste – this allows those fundamentals to be strengthened in a controlled and structured way and also for those first turns in the off-piste to be successful and for it to be a positive experience.\nOFF-PISTE SKILLS COURSES: We run two types of off-piste instructional course: 'Off-piste Improvers'' and 'Off-piste Performance'. These are suitable for different levels of off-piste ability (see Planner). These courses focus on technique, skills and tactics for off-piste skiing. We may spend some time on-piste, e.g., to work on a particular skill which is easier to 'take on board' in a less challenging environment.\nOFF-PISTE SKIING WEEKS: We also offer 'Off-piste Adventure' and 'Off-piste Total Adventure' weeks which include 5 full days coaching/skiing in a 6 day ski week. Weeks that are offered as 'Day Tours' will include 6 full days of skiing with leadership. As well as coaching in off-piste skills, these weeks will also include substantial amounts of time skiing relatively remote off-piste itineraries (possibly with short sections of skinning to reach them) and half- or full-day tours. The 'Off-piste Adventure' weeks will typically have 3 x ½ day coaching sessions in the 5 days and will be for those who feel they want a bit more input, to develop knowledge, skills and confidence. The 'Off-piste Total Adventure' weeks are designed for the most proficient skiers and any coaching time is on 'as needed' or 'by request' basis. Both options are more about 'doing' and less about talking! Each of these weeks is slightly different and full details are given in the Trip Details. The 'Day Tours' week will involve significantly more amounts of skinning and may not have any lift-served skiing – refer to the Trip Details for full information.\nTELEMARK & ALPINE SKIERS: We have found that these off-piste specific courses work extremely well whether ski equipment is Telemark or Alpine/Downhill. As we are focusing on skills, strategies and tactics for off-piste skiing, it is not significant what the technique (or equipment) is; more important is developing the adaptations that are needed for that technique to achieve confidence and success off-piste. A mixed group of Telemark and Alpine/Downhill skiers then works perfectly well. It is also very interesting to compare and contrast performance of those on different equipment.\nTWO WEEK COMBINATIONS\nSome of our weeks are programmed to make a two week holiday feasible without any great logistical problems and that will make a natural progression from one to the next. There are many trips listed in the website which, when put together with a second week, will attract special 'combo' prices. This is most easily done by linking two weeks when we are at the same resort and then choosing a course in the first week followed by a second week's course that is, typically, more advanced than the first week's. Examples would be:\nIn the Alps:\n'All Mountain' followed by an 'Off-piste Intro'\n'Off-piste Performance' followed by an 'Off-piste Adventure'.\nContact us for any other combination you would like to consider and benefit from a saving of at least £100 over the two weeks!\nWEEKS FOR FRIENDS SKIING AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND/OR ON DIFFERENT SKI EQUIPMENT\nThese weeks are for couples, partners and groups of friends, who have differing aspirations and abilities but want to enjoy being on holiday together at the same venue. Any week in our programme with a wide-ranging ability level stipulation and with alternative courses will be suitable for those couples and groups of varying levels and skiing interest, such as on-piste and off-piste (and in separate groups for coaching appropriate to ability level).\nA trend over the last three or four seasons has been more couples and groups coming on the same week but on different equipment i.e. some on Telemark and others on Alpine ski equipment. Since The Off-piste & Telemark Ski Company is so unique in being able to offer top quality instruction and leadership across three skiing disciplines (Telemark, Alpine and Nordic) we are unusually (or even, uniquely!) well-placed to provide this facility – many couples have commented on how refreshing this has been and how it has really added so much to their winter holidays.\nWe are flexible and accommodating with our instruction to ensure both Telemark and Alpine skiers receive appropriate and complete attention and time. Follow this link for more information about how this works.\nDecide on your ability level:\nDecide on a date:","June 18, 2019\nFree the Heel. More Thrills for Downhills.\n“It feels like you’re floating through the snow,” says John Janssen, University of Calgary Outdoor Centre, Telemark program coordinator/instructor and rental equipment manager.\nTelemark, the original down - hill skiing, is a cool technique developed in the 19th century in Norway’s Telemark region, that’s now enjoying a resurgence in popularity. The thing that differentiates telemark from other types of alpine skiing is that the heels are not locked on to the ski with a binding. This allows greater boot separation—forward and back—increasing stability. Weight is transferred from one ski to the other, resulting in a graceful arcing turn.\n“The sheer fluidity of the turn is why people telemark. It’s a feeling that you can’t get from downhill skiing,” Janssen says. “Learning this technique will give you the stability to feel more confident in your skiing. It helps you develop better balance on your skis.”\nAccording to Janssen, learning to telemark appeals to cross-country skiers interested in learning a better technique for going downhill or when venturing out into the backcountry; and it would also be of interest to downhill skiers wanting to try something different.\nThe telemark technique allows you to “gain much more stability front to back when using free heel bindings,” Janssen says. He notes that cross-country skiers can use it to gain greater stability and control on steeper downhills or when going around sharp corners.\nAnd when skiers head out into the backcountry on telemark gear, they are more stable when skiing powder or uneven terrain. Another advantage, compared to alpine gear, is that you don’t have to switch your bindings back and forth from uphill to downhill mode, because your heel always stays free.\nTelemark gear features a lightweight binding that allows the heel to move while the toe of the boot remains attached to the ski. Boots are made from hard plastic, with the ability to flex at the toes. The skis are wider than cross-country skis, with more sidecut and metal edges, and are made out of fibreglass with a foam or wood core.\nTo take up telemarking, you’ll need both instruction and practice. The Outdoor Centre offers novice and intermediate telemark skiing courses, taught by CANSIcertified telemark instructors. You can rent all the equipment needed as well – boots, skis and poles, plus skins if you’re going into the backcountry. Course prerequisites are good cross-country skiing skills or downhill/alpine skiing experience.\nWhen learning to telemark, Janssen says, the most efficient place to do so is at a ski resort, because you can make so many more runs in a day at a resort.\n“It’s much easier to learn the technique on groomed slopes.” You don’t need to be super athletic or coordinated to telemark, he adds. “It’s like learning any skill - you practice and become good at it.”\nWhen you take up telemarking, you’ll be in good company. There is a whole community of telemark enthusiasts and clubs out there. You can join organizations such as Alberta Telemark and Telemark Ski Canada, and enter racing competitions.

The program uses video modeling and includes a peer generalization component for social skills practice.","context":["Here is a sampling of the projects and initiatives the ASERT Collaborative is working on to help address unmet needs in Pennsylvania. These are being implemented on a small scale in one or more of the ASERT regions with a goal of expanding each project in the future.\nAdult Diagnostic & Assessment Clinics\nThis project involves developing and expanding autism diagnosis and assessment clinics specifically targeting the older adolescent/adult population. There will be a focus on more in-depth assessment of mental health co-morbidities (e.g., anxiety, depression, personality) and neuropsychological factors (e.g., executive functioning, memory, learning, attention). An increase in accurate identification of ASD for young adults and adults will lead to better treatment outcomes.\nAutism Life Care Model (ALCM)\nAutism Life Care Model (ALCM) emphasizes comprehensive, evidence-based care approached in a systematic manner throughout an individual’s lifetime. The goal is to create a comprehensive system of care to support an individual, his/her family, and the community throughout critical phases of development, beginning with the transition to adulthood. An additional goal is to ensure that individual and family needs are thoroughly considered in a coordinated manner and that necessary services and training are in place to meet these needs.\nLife Coach for Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder\nLife Coaches are professionals who guide adults with ASD through the complex social, academic and employment environments in their community. Each Life Coach will develop individualized life plans based on exploratory interviews with the individuals culminating in a life map and action plans to accomplish the person’s personal and professional goals. Based on the results of exploratory interviews and other diagnostic testing, the Life Coach will help the individual access existing community resources as warranted, i.e., the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, Adult Basic Education and/or other academic endeavors, Social Security, Office of Disabilities, Housing Authority, etc.\nClub House Model for Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder\nTraditionally the Club House is a model of psychosocial rehabilitation for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness. The philosophy of the Club House emphasizes, Work Ordered Day, Employment Programs, Social and Recreational Programs, Community Support, Reach Out, Decision Making and Governance. ASERT has begun research and development of a model of support based on the Club House that specifically meets the unique needs of adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. A pilot program is running in the Western region with the goal of future expansion. The ultimate goal is to identify the Club House with psychosocial rehabilitation components as sustainable support service for adults with ASD across the state.\nAdult and Adolescent Multimedia Social Skills\nThe Multimedia Social Skills Groups are projects which consist of two social skills groups, one for teens (ages 13 to 17 years old) and the other for young adults (ages 18 to 30 years old) who have high functioning autism or Asperger’s Disorder. This intervention has been found to improve social skills for individuals with high social anxiety and self-perceived social deficits. These social skills groups include skills building (e.g., how to make and keep friends, dating and relationships, employment-specific social skills) paired with video modeling and a peer generalization component for social skills practice. Social Skills groups are currently running in the Central region with the goal of expanding to sites statewide. The adolescent social skills group project will focus on developing training materials for professionals to deliver this intervention, which has been effective in improving social fluency for individuals with high social anxiety."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d2a89661-0ecd-4fc4-99e3-9bfd761f019f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the safety considerations for both warehouse storage systems and temperature control equipment?","answer":"For warehouse storage systems, safety is paramount and requires maintaining racking to the highest standards per manufacturer recommendations and legislative requirements. Safety features include floor anchoring, pallet support bars, and column guards. The design process must involve health and safety management from conception to implementation to design out risks. For temperature control systems, safety considerations focus on refrigerant compatibility and handling, with some refrigerants requiring professional handling and safety gear. Both systems need regular maintenance to prevent accidents - racking must be checked for damage and load-bearing capacity, while HVAC systems need inspection for leaks and mechanical wear. Material compatibility, proper insulation, and flammability risks must be considered for both systems to ensure workplace safety.","context":["How available warehouse space is used determines warehouse efficiency, and failing to ensure this can have a significant impact on profit margins. Maria Highland examines the challenges…\nThe warehouse was once considered to be the back end of business and now it has now shifted position. An efficient warehouse is now at the forefront of any successful logistics operation. It is no longer simply a place of storage and instead takes its place as an indispensable core component. A successful warehouse operation is governed by product availability and visibility.\nRacking and shelving is responsible for warehouse storage density, visibility and the speed of retrieval processes. It can either increase or decrease the efficiency of your logistics operations. Managing director of BITO Storage Systems, Edward Hutchison, says that “racking and shelving plays a key role in maintaining the flow for highly accurate order picking and can generate cost savings by eliminating the need for outside storage, handling and transport which will reduce costs and improve productivity.” Correspondingly, behind every successful warehouse operation, stands an efficient racking and shelving system.\n“Customers want racking that is adaptable,” says Hutchison. “This starts with the racking’s basic components: the uprights and beams. Bolted frame components will allow a fast exchange of damaged components. Uprights need to be available in a range of widths and different material thicknesses to allow an ideal upright geometry for frame heights of over 20 metres and bay loads as heavy as 40 tonnes. Flexibility comes with drop on components such as steel, mesh decks, steel or chipboard panels used either with or without support bars, in this way a shelf level can be created to store goods of any size and shape.”\nMike Alibone, business development & marketing manager at SSI Schaefer, says that companies should aim for racking and shelving that offers stability, adjustability and capacity. The loading (in terms of weight) must also be taken into consideration, as it will inevitably determine the design choice. How the racking and shelving affects the equipment specification and the floor on which the structure will be built is also important.\n“There is a science behind choosing and installing both pallet racking and shelving which is fit for purpose and that ‘purpose’ may have a multitude of parameters associated with it,” says Alibone.\nBefore it can begin to address operational needs, successful racking and shelving must be fit for use. If racking and shelving is physically unsuitable for its proposed use, whether it cannot bear the weight, the loading, or withstand warehouse conditions, it can impair warehouse efficiency.\nHutchison says: “A customer should satisfy itself that the racking and shelving company offers the required quality and capabilities, that it can manage the type of project in hand and bring it in on time and on budget”. He suggests that customers “pay attention to the quality of the materials used in the racking and shelving and how they stand up to the rigours of everyday warehouse operations. For example, galvanising and epoxy coating ensures high corrosion resistance and guarantees a long service life for all components.”\nGood quality racking and shelving systems can also improve warehouse safety- a common issue in the warehouse. Alibone says: “When operating in a racking/shelving-based environment safety is of paramount importance. All storage systems should be maintained to the highest standard in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and legislative requirements. Such issues of safety can be overcome by ensuring the involvement of health and safety management throughout the whole design process- from conception through to realisation.\n“This involvement in the early stages with the design team is crucial to ensure risks are designed out and that the solutions provided can be operated and maintained safely.” Racking and shelving that poses minimal risks and increases safety will also help to avoid any work place accidents, which can have costly repercussions both financially and in human terms. Floor anchoring, pallet support bars and column guards can improve the safety of the racking and shelving structure.\nInvesting in good quality racking shelving may tick all the boxes when it comes to safety, flexibility and suitability, but how can racking and shelving improve warehouse efficiency?\nHutchison says that most manufacturers and retailers look for “racking and shelving that will help them to ensure that when items leave their warehouses and distribution centres, they are in the best condition, they have been accurately picked, they are well packed and the customer gets exactly what he wants on the day he wants it. They want a storage system that meets their requirements precisely and is designed to gain maximum productivity.”\nFor example, SEC Storage has designed and implemented a tailor-made storage system for the International Logistics Group’s new warehouse, which accommodates five clients from the beauty and fashion sector. SEC storage needed to come up with a solution that would allow the replenishment of a variety of products ranges, such as lingerie, clothing and cosmetic products, alongside seamless picking and despatch. The “primary solution for the facility is a single tier rack supported picking structure that maximises cubic capacity in over fifty per cent of the warehouse. The system is designed around specific client package types, which could include anything from a BDCM1 box to a flat, lingerie box or footwear. By standardising the bay aperture between all the varying sizes, capacity is maximised within the system,” says Dean Kahl of SEC Storage.\nProductivity has been optimised in the warehouse as “the system has been designed by considering pick rates and travel distances. The compact installation means that the travel distance of each warehouse operative has been significantly reduced when compared to the same storage capacity being achieved over a single level, ” says Kahl. SEC Storage’s racking solution saves warehouse space as “the nature of the rack supported structure also means that packing stations have been incorporated into the system on the ground floor”, therefore the remaining “space can be converted to picking levels at a later date to boost capacity according to demand. Further packing stations have been installed on the first floor, allowing for simultaneous packing during peak periods,” says Kahl.\nStorage density can also increase warehouse productivity. This is an important customer requirement when choosing suitable racking, as optimising space is key in any logistics operations and can ensure that your warehouse is working to its maximum capacity. “For manufacturers it’s about consolidating their raw materials or components on site as close to the assembly line as possible. This safeguards production – reducing stoppages due to product not being in the right place. It will also eliminate the duplication of stock, thus reducing stockholding. Saving on floor space is also critical in Omni-channel retail facilities. They require a large number of pick spaces for a broad range of SKUs and will be handling a mixture of slower and faster goods – often all in a single system,” says Hutchison.\nHaving racking and shelving with a higher storage density not only increases productivity and efficiency, but also saves energy running costs. SSI Schaefer provides high-density storage solutions such as Mobile Racking, which can minimise the building footprint by up to 45 per cent. “A significant reduction in energy loss (and utility bills) also ensues, due to the correspondingly-smaller roof structure reducing air escape. The other cost savings of a smaller, more efficient Mobile Racking warehouse include a 35 per cent lower overall investment in construction costs and a reduction of up to 49 per cent in utility costs,” says Alibone.\nAlibone also recommends multi-tier shelving, which features low leg loads and “can be constructed more rapidly, needs less head room and typically results in a saving of 30 per cent over a mezzanine-based system offering the same storage capacity.” Alibone also says that the “flexibility in the multi-tier shelving design also enables it be tailored to meet floor slab capacities in existing buildings, while the lightweight shelves make it easy to rapidly adapt the storage location to changes in stock profile.”\nSometimes, increasing your warehouse efficiency requires adding a personal touch and going that extra mile. “Businesses expand and distribution operations grow, the problem of how to store more product in an extendable system, which also allows rapid access and the flexibility to accommodate an ever-changing stock profile, becomes more acute,” says Alibone. The future of racking and shelving thus turn to tailored solutions.\n“The latest developments tend to evolve from customers requesting bespoke solutions”, says Hutchison. BITO have already begun to tailor their products to suit the needs of their client. “BITO was approached by a major online retailer that wanted a shelving product of a set width and a set depth that didn’t exist,” says Hutchison.\n“The retailer also wanted dividers to be spaced so that they would suit a robotic picking system. We had to manufacture a bespoke design to suit its specific requirements. So everything on the shelving system is completely bespoke. The client was able to bring their own staff to test it and adjust it.”","Image credits: Airlogix\nTemperature control is a primary management aspect for all warehouses. Since the vast, generous interior space is ideal for commercial and industrial uses, it is important to ensure optimum temperatures for both the stored goods and the employees who work there. Heating and cooling such an area can be quite expensive, especially if there are specific temperature controls for each inventory type. Your overall warehouse HVAC costs can be split into your choice of HVAC units, installation costs, and ongoing maintenance – all of which contribute to a fully functional HVAC system. In this article, we will browse through some average costs and discuss how to keep your numbers as low as possible while maximizing the HVAC output.\nWarehouse HVAC costs\nThe cost to heat or cool a warehouse is generally high in terms of energy consumption and maintenance – considering the total square footage that needs to be heated or cooled. All of this massive space can actually be divided into the usable square footage that requires HVAC systems and the remaining square footage that is mostly idle or unoccupied. So, there is always some energy loss associated with warehouse HVAC systems because of the amount of space we are dealing with.\nIn general, warehouse HVAC costs take up around 30% of the total operational costs required for a warehouse. The more specific and complex the requirements, the higher the costs – and this entirely depends on your intended commercial or industrial expectations for the available space. Usually, warehouse types can be categorized into a general storage warehouse, a cold storage warehouse, and an office warehouse – so your total costs will differ according to your specific application.\nFollowing an example from Strong Building Systems, let us look at some average numbers for a 5000-square-feet warehouse, which is typically the ideal size for small and medium commercial purposes. Small warehouses tend to be categorized as shell structures because of their basic spatial arrangement that does not include lighting or HVAC, so they cost around $19-$25 per square foot during construction. In comparison, if the warehouse HVAC and other key amenities are included, you will be working with a construction budget of $55-$70 per square foot. Therefore, you can expect your warehouse plus HVAC construction costs to range between $275,000 to $350,000 in total.\nApart from the size of the warehouse itself, various factors can affect your total HVAC costs. For example, cooling systems rely on different refrigerants that need to be compatible with your choice of HVAC pipes. You also have to consider if the refrigerant is harmful and requires professional handling and safety gear – all of this will increase your total warehouse HVAC costs. Material compatibility, suitable insulation, flammability risks, and personnel training are all essential cost considerations for anyone running and managing a warehouse.\nSimilarly, HVAC specifications that are more demanding and technical in nature will add to your overall costs. This is particularly true for cold storage warehouse systems that have heavy-duty expectations for their cooling and ventilation units. They also rely on a backup power supply that can seamlessly resume the cooling process in case of a system failure – which is exactly the kind of risk you should be prepared for while storing perishable goods. Therefore, setting up the HVAC infrastructure for such warehouses is generally quite expensive.\nYour warehouse HVAC team will include specialized HVAC estimators apart from installers and maintenance experts. Before finalizing your budget, make sure to request detailed estimates to understand the general breakdown of your warehouse HVAC costs. Such a cost breakdown usually includes elements like:\n- Digital takeoffs for your HVAC systems\n- Materials and associated quantities\n- Vendor pricing\n- Hardware, equipment, and fixtures such as pipe fittings, ducts, hangers, elbows, and similar accessories\n- Labor charges\n- Permit charges\n- Costs for drawing plans and HVAC layouts\nBy receiving itemized quotes, you can compare your selected bids more efficiently and understand how much value is added per square foot of your warehouse. Cost breakdowns are also useful for finding out how different materials and hardware compare depending on your applications, expected loads, safety aspects, and warehouse compatibility. They also highlight the permit charges you will most likely incur, so this will be a great opportunity to confirm a code-compliant project regardless of your new construction or renovation needs.\nWays To Bring Down HVAC Costs\nDon’t Delay The Stitch In Time\nRoutine maintenance programs are crucial for the efficiency and operability of your warehouse HVAC systems. If you want your expensive setup to last longer, it is important to schedule preventive maintenance down the road with your HVAC contractors. This includes checking for leaks, replacing damaged parts, cleaning or replacing filters, cleaning all the vents, removing debris buildup, and so on. Dust and debris buildup will not only cause mechanical wear and tear, but it will also leave you with an overworked HVAC system that is bound to collapse.\nBy investing in scheduled maintenance programs (say at least $50 or so per month depending on your HVAC performance), you can allow your HVAC infrastructure to stay updated, which prevents the chances of system failures, business downtimes, and hefty losses such as inventory damage. After all, a stitch in time saves nine!\nWatch Out For The HVAC Enemy: Leaks\nLeak detection is a key aspect of all HVAC maintenance programs, so we decided to give it the undivided attention it deserves. Some common sources of HVAC leaks include damaged ductwork, frequently opening and closing doors/windows, a lack of insulation, and broken connectors. By inspecting your HVAC ductwork regularly for leaks, you can address energy efficiency issues that you might be facing – as leaks are the root causes of inadequately heated or cooled warehouse interiors. If you notice that your warehouse temperatures are suspiciously different, it means that your HVAC systems are not performing to the best of their potential, and this is your cue for a thorough leak inspection. It can be difficult to conduct leak inspection and detection considering the large scale of a warehouse structure, which is why this area of maintenance can be costly – but definitely not costlier than the high energy bills you will otherwise pay.\nEven though all of the vast warehouse space increases the scope for leaks, there are basic preventive measures you can take to overcome this problem and retain the heating or cooling more efficiently. For example, you can enhance your warehouse’s temperature control by sealing off known leaks and investing in proper insulation barriers. This also depends on the number of doors and windows your warehouse has. Each time you open a door or a window, you compromise the ambient heating or cooling levels because all of that built-up climate quickly escapes the warehouse. This causes your HVAC systems to go on a repetitive loop trying to compensate for the lost air – which is not very energy efficient. Therefore, to preserve your HVAC integrity as well as your warehouse HVAC costs, consider installing quick-close doors that seal properly and use vinyl curtains as an extra barrier.\nHelp Your HVAC Get Smart\nIt is never too late to switch to automated controls, and in the spacious world of warehouse HVAC, automation will be your best choice for keeping the costs down.\nFor example, you can use sensors and smart thermostats to automate schedules and HVAC cycles depending on occupancy and other applicable factors. In this way, your installed units will only work when needed and automatically switch off once the desired temperatures are achieved. Compared to units running 24/7 in a warehouse, this is a much smarter way of regulating the indoor climate and automatically turning off the system when it is not needed – which also gives the individual units more time to rest, and this extends the overall lifespan of your warehouse HVAC.\nWarehouses can immensely benefit from zoning as well. By creating smart zones within your warehouse space, you can decide which areas require dedicated heating or cooling and which areas have more flexibility in terms of temperature controls. Zoning can help you set individual climates for both high-traffic areas as well as inventory-specific areas that need a strict temperature regulation to preserve the goods. Automation technologies allow businesses to plan their HVAC allocations more effectively and avoid wasteful consumption, so you can never go wrong by updating to smart controls and zones – especially if you are already updating an old HVAC infrastructure from scratch.\nPlanning energy-saving strategies can help you manage your warehouse HVAC costs better and be more conscious about the ongoing performance. This is why preventive maintenance should be discussed as part of your initial HVAC consultations with estimators and contractors. Instead of pushing routine inspections to the end, you should make sure that you hire contractors who also offer future maintenance services and take the effort to break these down early on during cost allocations. In this way, you will have both a current budget to work with and a clear idea of how much future expenses you can incur during your HVAC’s lifespan."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0d6dc58a-43f6-4660-858f-5ff5fde0fe0d>","<urn:uuid:60866ebb-c79a-49a0-a6c3-8b4090d9fe20>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Por qué Panga ya Saidi challenges coastal migration theory? Why is this location's archaeological evidence important for understanding human evolution? 请解释一下。","answer":"Panga ya Saidi challenges the coastal migration theory because despite being only 9 miles from the coast, there is no evidence that its inhabitants depended on coastal resources. Instead, they relied on inland resources from tropical forest and grassland ecosystems. This undermines the hypothesis that early humans primarily used coastlines as 'superhighways' for migration out of Africa. The site's significance lies in showing that early humans were more adaptable and capable of thriving in inland habitats, causing archaeologists to reconsider the role of East African coastal hinterland and forests in human evolution, which were previously considered marginal.","context":["There’s evidence human beings have occupied the city of Damascus in Syria for 11,000 years. But that’s nothing compared to the Panga ya Saidi cave network in Kenya’s Rift Valley. Ruth Schuster at Haaretz reports that its 1,076-square-foot main chamber has been occupied by Homo sapiens for 78,000 years.\nA new study published in the journal Nature Communications offers a testament to how human technology and culture have changed over that time.\nThe cave sits in a unique spot, an ecotone where grassland and coastal tropical forest meet. Because of that, occupants of the cave could exploit the resources from both environments. The location also spared the cave from climatic fluctuations over the centuries. While drought may have impacted the savannah or the forest at certain times, the international and interdisciplinary team of researchers found the site of Panga ya Saidi seems to have received plenty of precipitation. That may explain why humans decided to stick around more or less continuously since finding the spot.\nThe oldest artifacts found in the cave are Middle Stone Age toolkits dating back around 78,000 years. A distinct change occurs in newer layers that emerged 67,000 year ago in the Later Stone Age, where toolkits become much smaller, showing a switch in technologies. However, following layers dating back 60,000-50,000 years reveal a mix of tool types, which pushes back against the idea posited by archaeologists that change happens during technological “revolutions” where a new technology is quickly and widely adopted.\nThe jewelry that the cave dwellers wore tells its own story of change. The earliest bead ever discovered in Kenya, dating between 67,000 and 63,000 years ago, comes from the cave. Beginning 33,000 years ago beads made from shells plucked from beaches along the Indian Ocean about 9 miles away became the accessory of choice. Around 25,000 years ago, ostrich shell beads became all the rage, before the seashells came back into vogue around 10,000 years ago. Other decorative or ritual objects such as carved bones and chunks of red ochre were found throughout the layers, which also indicate that there were no significant cultural or cognitive “revolutions” at the Panga ya Saidi site. Taken together, the tools and decorative artifacts paint a picture of a culture that changed slowly over time.\nAnother important find at the cave is what wasn’t there—lots of seafood. “Despite being relatively close to the coast, we do not have evidence that the hunter-gatherer populations occupying the cave were in any way dependent on coastal resources,” co-author Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History tells Schuster. “Instead, they were reliant on inland, terrestrial resources in their tropical forest and grassland ecosystem.”\nThat adds to growing evidence that early humans did not simply follow coastal resources. Instead, it shows humans were adaptable and able to survive in inland habitats as well. “The finds at Panga ya Saidi undermine hypotheses about the use of coasts as a kind of 'superhighway' that channeled migrating humans out of Africa, and around the Indian Ocean rim,” Petraglia says in the press release.\nProject principal investigator Nicole Boivin of Max Planck predicts this knowledge will cause a shift in the way human evolution is understood. “The East African coastal hinterland and its forests and have been long considered to be marginal to human evolution so the discovery of Panga ya Saidi cave will certainly change archaeologists’ views and perceptions,” Boivin says.\nPeople only stopped living in Panga ya Saidi in the relatively recent past reports Schuster, though it is still used by locals for religious ceremonies and burials."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:44279a7a-4a25-4596-9f81-0f8aeaecee2e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the transmission frequencies of the 500-12 PLB and a COSPAS-SARSAT EPIRB?","answer":"Both devices operate on similar frequencies. The 500-12 PLB operates on 406 MHz, 121.5 MHz, and 243 MHz, while COSPAS-SARSAT EPIRBs work on 406.025 MHz and 121.5 MHz bands. Both systems are compatible with the COSPAS-SARSAT search and rescue satellite system.","context":["The 500 series of Personal Locator Beacons or Survival Emergency Locator Transmitters offers a wide range of options to suit any requirement. The 500 series of Personal Locator Beacons has been chosen by a wide customer base, including armed forces, commercial airlines, off-shore helicopter operators, life raft manufacturers and ejection seat manufacturers.\nFor all the 500 series Personal Locator Beacons, Techtest has obtained full certification to aircraft standards so these products should not be confused with inferior quality beacons intended for hobby use.\nThe 500-1 Personal Locator Beacon is a compact light-weight unit operating on 121.5 MHz and 243 MHz and has been favoured by customers requiring a small beacon for many years.\nThe 500-12 Personal Locator Beacon is designed to work with the COSPAS-SARSAT search and rescue satellite system and features 406 MHz as well as 121.5 MHz and 243 MHz distress signals. It also incorporates a speech function which allows survivors to have two way voice communication with a rescue craft. In addition to the normal aircraft approvals the 500-12 also has full Boeing and Airbus approvals making it the natural choice for commercial airline operators due to its compact size and low weight.

It is tracking equipment that transmits a signal on a specified band to locate a lifeboat, life raft, ship or people in distress.\nAN EPIRB is a SECONDARY means of DISTRESS alerting which is to say that it comes later in the hierarchy of alerting SAR authorities in case of distress. It is mandatory to carry one EPIRB on every ship and two EPIRBS for all Registered ships (and other types of vessels).\nTypes Of EPIRB\nCOSPAS-SARSAT– EPIRBS under the COSPAS-SARSAT system work on the 406.025 MHz and 121.5 MHz band and are applicable for all sea areas.\nINMARSAT E – 1.6 GHz band is the one which this EPIRB works on. These are applicable for sea areas A1, A2 and A3.\nVHF CH 70 – This works on the 156.525 MHz band and are applicable for sea area A1 only.\nHow Does An EPIRB Work?\nThe device contains two radio transmitters, a 5-watt one, and a 0.25-watt one, each operating at 406 MHz, the standard international frequency typically signalling distress, 406MHz. The 5-watt radio transmitter is synchronised with a GOES weather satellite going around the earth in a geosynchronous orbit.\nAn EPIRB transmits signals to the satellite. The signal consists of an encrypted identification number (all in digital code) which holds information such as the ship’s identification, date of the event, the nature of distress and chiefly, the position.\nA UIN is a Unique Identifier Number that is programmed into each beacon at the factory. The UIN number consists of 15 digit series of letters and numbers that make up the unique identity of the beacon. The UIN is on a white label on the exterior of the beacon. The UIN is also referred to as the Hex ID.\nThe Local User Terminal (satellite receiving units or ground stations) calculates the position of the casualty using Doppler Shift (is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave (or other periodic events) for an observer moving relative to its source).\nThe LUT passes on the message to the MRCC (Mission Rescue Co-Ordination Centre). Furthermore, the MRCC is responsible for the SAR ops and oversees the execution of the rescue mission.\nIn case the EPIRB is not compatible with a GPS receiver, the geosynchronous satellite orbiting the earth can pick only the radio signals emitted by the radio. The location of the transmitter or the identity of the owner cannot be deduced in this case.\nThese satellites can only pick up trace elements of such signals and they can only give a rough idea of the location of the EPIRB. A signal of 406MHz is treated as an emergency signal as per international standards.\nThe signal could help you in locating the transmitter even if it is 3 miles away. The vessel or the individual in distress could be identified if the EPIRB is registered. If an emitter transmits signals of 121.5 MHz, the rescuer or concerned party can reach the lost person even if they are at a distance of 15 miles. The accuracy of reaching the target could be magnified if an EPIRB also contains a GPS receiver.\nUsing an EPIRB\nThe EPIRB needs to be activated to emit signals. This could be done by pushing a button on the unit, or it could happen automatically if and when it comes in contact with water. The latter variety is known as hydrostatic EPIRB; the quality makes hydrostatic EPIRBs the best choice for sailors because they could be automatically activated in case the ship or vessel meets an accident and finds itself in deep waters.\nThe point to be kept in mind is that EPIRB needs activation to be operative, and this could happen only when it emerges from the bracket it is placed in. This could be done manually or it could happen automatically, as said earlier. The device is essentially battery-operated. This helps because power is the first entity to be affected in case of a calamity.\n- 12 Volt battery.\n- 48 hours of transmitting capacity.\n- Normally replaced every 2 to 5 years.\nIt is possible that the EPIRB might get activated by mistake by an individual onboard. In order to prevent a chain of SAR operations in motion it is imperative that the EPIRB false transmission is cancelled. In case the EPIRB is falsely activated, the nearest coast station or RCC (Rescue Co-Ordination Center) must be informed immediately of this event and as mentioned, cancel it.\nThe cancellation intimation must also be sent to the appropriate authority (for example, DG Shipping for Indian Registered Ships or for ships plying in India waters when the false alert is transmitted). The shipowner and/or the agent must also be informed.\nThe EPIRB should be tested once a month to ensure operational integrity. The procedure to do so is as follows :\n- Press and release the test button on the EPIRB.\n- The red lamp on the EPIRB should flash once.\n- Within 30 seconds of pressing the button, the strobe, as well as the red light, should flash several times.\n- After 60 seconds of operation, the EPIRB will switch off.\nMaintenance of EPIRB\nThe EPIRB must be inspected visually for any defects such as cracks.\nIt is advisable to clean the EPIRB once in a while with a dry cloth.\nWhile cleaning, the switches must be specifically checked.\nThe lanyard of the EPIRB must be neatly packed into the container of the EPIRB without any loose ends dangling about.\nThe expiry date of the battery must be checked to cover the immediate as well as the next voyage at the least.\nSend the EPIRB back to the service agent or the supplier if the EPIRB fails the monthly checks.\nChange the battery onboard if the facilities are available or send it to the servicing agent if there isn’t.\nIf the EPIRB has been used in an emergency, it must be returned to an authorised service agent for a battery change.\nIn the event that the HRU has crossed its expiry date, the HRU ought to be replaced on board and HRU must be marked with an expiry date 2 years into the future.\nPLBs (Personal Locator Beacons)\nPLBs are basically EPIRBs but for individual entities. These are used to indicate distress for an individual not in the proximity of emergency services. PLBs work in the same as EPIRBS and transmit on the COSPAS SARSAT satellite system in the 406.025 MHz frequency. PLBs are much smaller in size as compared to an EPIRB. They work all across the world, at sea as well as on land.\nOnce activated, PLBs transmit for a minimum of 24 hours; while the battery life on an EPIRB is at least double (a minimum of 48 hours). An EPIRB is registered to a vessel, whereas a PLB is registered to an individual.\nThe EPIRB is one of THE MOST important emergency pieces of equipment available onboard in the case of distress. Their care, testing and maintenance must be given considerable time in order that they function at their optimum level when the situation arises.\nRead more : Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:051277dc-e8a8-4f23-ad7a-6f457177fa4f>","<urn:uuid:8aab7a46-8b94-4caa-8d7e-76fc761fcea2>"],"error":null}

We look at Offending in the context of negation: taking the play out of the play to create an awareness about theatre. In the same slant, director Liu Xiaoyi exploits the 'audience' as a subject to confront the audience.\nTrue to the disclaimers about the denial of a play, we do not immediately see any. We hear the cast's conversations with the director being broadcast over the sound system in real time, including surtitles that are typed spontaneously.\nThe first 'happening' that we see is the backstage crew pulling out the benches and installing the audience seats. On hindsight, it is quietly phenomenal. Most of us, who are sprawled on the vinyl floor, have to migrate to the remaining half of the theatre space. We are forced to confront the vacant audience seats – absent of audience. Or if you look around, you may see the ones who decide to take the time to run to the toilet, chit-chat or snack, they are also 'absent'.\nIn the spirit of Peter Handke, who has hoped to bring the audience's awareness to what a play is by trying to pull off a form of \"anti-theatre\", Liu's rendition of Offending has eloquently materialised the play's tagline \"you will see no play.\" In the original script, Handke has the performers actually try to offend the audience by verbally abusing them (i.e. You jerks, you hoodlums, you scum of the melting pot). It would have been startling in the 1960s, but listening to an onslaught of profanities would have little effect on the 21st century audience, who by now would less likely be disturbed by experimental or alienation gimmicks. Liu has taken the insulting to a deeper psychological level, preserving the essence of Handke's play and created a whole new script whose structure sits atop Handke's play.\nLiu's play unveils the mechanism of theatre: showing the audience the process of 'making' this play through the cast's absurd discussions, and literally revealing the structures that makes up the theatre space, thereby fulfilling the motion in Handke's text that “everything we could see with our eyes in this theatre has no other representations of itself”.\n40 minutes into the show, the seats are up, but we are still sitting on the floor. Is this an insult? Or the theatre-maker is urging us to rethink our role in theatre? It is interesting to note that we are presently occupying the space that conventionally belongs to the actors – otherwise known as the 'stage'. No one seems to notice though. The crowd is getting noisier with impatience or because they increasingly feel at ease, I cannot tell. Amidst the racket, we see Ang Gey Pin weaving cautiously through the crowd, clearing a narrow path for herself. She clumsily summarises the 'play', criticises the ridiculous conversations that took place over the sound system, which were not put into action anyhow. She speaks on 'behalf of the audience'. She reasserts her status as an 'audience' by explaining that she has been sitting here all the while 'watching' the play. She claims that she is 'on the side of the audience', and empathizes with us because she does not agree with what the director and her fellow cast are doing. Here you go – I present to you the offended audience member.\nCoincidentally, Ang is the only cast who seems to be acting, made apparent by her deliberately archaic and stiff movements, and her over-the-top outbursts. This falls in line with the accusations that Handke wrote against the audience: “You were born actors/Play-acting was in your blood/You are accomplished actors/You ivory-tower artists”.\nAt long last, we are motioned to take the seats. The play has come to an end, and it is announced that a post-show dialogue will follow. When the lights went out, two bright green 'EXIT' signs on either side of the room aptly announces the end of the show. There is a buzz in the crowd, people genuinely look like they want to ask questions. Well, the joke is on us – here comes the insult to the privilege of being an audience. We hear pre-recorded canned questions being 'asked' over the sound system, with silent pauses for you to complete their sentences arbitrarily. In the original script, the curtain falls after the audience starts leaving in the midst of roaring taped applauses and canned reactions. In this rendition, it is a brilliant move by the director to include the fictitious post-show dialogue as a finishing touch.\nLiu has expanded upon Handke's use of paradox in the play by having an audience who is unable to successfully carry out its role as an audience – there is no play to be watched, and we are not occupying the audience seats. The stripping away of the conventional definitions of an audience is further accentuated by the empty audience seats. And the identity is challenged again by an actor who claims that she embodies the traits of an audience.\nLiu has updated Handke's script pass the expectation of the original script written in the 1960s that was in response to the state of bourgeoisie in the theatre scene. He has created a spectacle without pictures in response to the normalcy of the passive audience.\nAbout Emergency Stairs\nEmergency Stairs is a yet-to-be-formed nonprofit, intercultural, experimental theatre company in Singapore. They believe that theatre is revolutionary, revolution is experimental, and experimentation is subversive. Theatre continually destructs and constructs our perceptions towards art, life and the world. Time, space and body are the basic elements of this revolution. They will approach intercultural dialogue openly, deconstruct the works of our predecessors boldly, and reconstruct the theatre of the future confidently.\nOffending the Audience is their debut production.\nOffending the Audience 冒犯观众\npart of Huayi – Chinese Festival of Arts 华艺节 2017\nperformed by Emergency Stairs 避难阶段\nDate: 12 Feb 2017, Sun\nVenue: Esplanade Theatre Studio"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d71a04bc-fe1b-4e65-bb06-c35e02406db2>","<urn:uuid:74b9abed-4393-4d07-be51-2f1514f29fae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the GravityLight produce electricity to power its lighting? Really curious about the mechanics!","answer":"The GravityLight produces electricity through a simple mechanical process: when a weight is manually raised and then allowed to fall, it turns the shaft of an electric motor via a gearbox. This falling motion creates a voltage across the motor's terminals. This process provides enough potential energy to generate approximately 30 minutes of lighting.","context":["Recently we were contacted by the GravityLight™ team regarding a very interesting project they are working on, an alternative to kerosene lamps that is powered only by gravity. Kerosene lamps are still commonly used in the developing world, despite the numerous financial and environmental repercussions.\nThe concept of the GravityLight is elegantly simple. A weight is manually raised and as it falls it turns the shaft of an electric motor via a gearbox, creating a voltage across the motor’s terminals. This straightforward act provides the system with enough potential energy to provide approximately 30 minutes of lighting.\nAs they are conducting a rigorous and thorough design process, GravityLight asked if Precision Microdrives could assist them in their attempts to fully characterise their DC motor and subsequently gain a better understanding of their overall system. As Precision Microdrives has a wealth of equipment and expertise we performed a number of tests in order to characterise the DC motors used, including a 132-100 Miniature Core 32mm DC Motor which will be installed in Gravity Light’s own testing equipment.\nWe currently have facilities in Hong Kong, London and Shenzhen, capable of tests such as Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), Acceptable Quality Level (AQL), motor burn-in time, dynamic torque profiling, geometric characterisation, and more!\nOur Hong Kong office offers the most advanced testing using a newly constructed torque dynamometer. The DC motors were not only characterised under normal operation in both directions, but the test equipment was also adapted to characterise the electric motors when operated as generators to simulate the intended real-world use.\nThe first step was to fully characterise the motors used in the Gravity Light equipment, both the driven motors/generators and the 132-100 test motor.\nThe industry standard for characterising electric motors is typically to take measurements at a no-load condition and a nominal loading greater than the rated load. However, as the GravityLight team were after a greater level of accuracy we conducted a more thorough analysis.\nWhile dynamically adjusting the torque, three different relationships were observed:\n- Current vs Torque\n- Efficiency vs Torque\n- RPM vs Torque\nThe second testing procedure involved characterising the motors when used as a generator. Two identical motors were used, one to act as the driving motor (simulating the falling weight) while the other was the Device Under Test (DUT). By measuring the input and output voltage and current it is possible to calculate the input and output power, of course, this makes it possible to calculate the overall efficiency of the system based on the change in power.\nPrecision Microdrives has been proud to be involved with the GravityLight project, all of the motors tested were found to perform very closely to their specifications. The output power of the GravityLight might be relatively low (you would need over 20 million of them on the highest power setting to produce the same amount of power as a 2MW wind turbine!) but it’s important to remember it is being used to light only a single room at a fraction of the cost of a kerosene lamp with no cost of fuel. This feat of engineering is especially advantageous because the user needs to manually lift the weight, the lower the power consumption the less frequently they need to lift it.

{"question":"Could you compare how automation benefits both warehouse and office building operations?","answer":"Both settings benefit from automation in different ways. In warehouses, automation through conveyor systems, automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS), and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) helps reduce labor costs and improve efficiency in tasks like picking and packing. In office buildings, automated features and remote control systems enable better building management through web-based systems that allow immediate response to system notifications and tenant requests, while automated HVAC and lighting controls can reduce lighting energy by up to 50% by adjusting based on daylight availability and occupancy.","context":["The layout of a warehouse plays a critical role in determining its efficiency and productivity.\nA well-designed warehouse layout can help businesses maximize their use of space, reduce costs, and improve overall performance. In this article, we will explore some strategies for optimizing warehouse layout to maximize space and efficiency.\nThe Importance of Warehouse Layout Optimization\nWarehouse layout optimization is essential for businesses looking to improve their warehouse operations. A well-designed layout can help businesses:\n- Maximize the use of available space\n- Improve inventory management\n- Reduce labor costs\n- Increase productivity and efficiency\n- Enhance safety and security\nBy optimizing their warehouse layout, businesses can improve their bottom line and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n3 Key Considerations for Warehouse Layout Optimization\nWhen optimizing warehouse layout, businesses should consider the following factors:\nEffective inventory management is critical to the success of any warehouse operation. When optimizing warehouse layout, businesses should consider factors such as inventory turnover, storage requirements, and order processing times.\nBy designing a layout that maximizes the use of available space and minimizes the distance traveled by workers, businesses can improve their inventory management and reduce costs.\nWorkflow and Process Design\nThe layout of a warehouse should be designed to optimize workflow and process design. This includes factors such as the placement of equipment, the location of storage areas, and the flow of goods through the warehouse.\nBy designing a layout that minimizes the distance traveled by workers and reduces the number of steps in the order fulfillment process, businesses can improve their efficiency and productivity.\nSafety and Security\nWarehouse layout optimization should also take into account safety and security considerations. This includes factors such as the placement of fire exits, the location of hazardous materials, and the use of security cameras and access controls.\nBy designing a layout that prioritizes safety and security, businesses can reduce the risk of accidents and theft, protecting both their employees and their assets.\n5 Strategies for Warehouse Layout Optimization\nHere are some strategies for optimizing warehouse layout to maximize space and efficiency:\nUse Vertical Space\nOne of the most effective ways to maximize space in a warehouse is to use vertical space. By installing high-density storage systems such as pallet racking, businesses can store more inventory in less floor space.\nAdditionally, mezzanine levels can be added to increase storage capacity without expanding the footprint of the warehouse.\nImplement Lean Principles\nImplementing lean principles can help businesses optimize their warehouse layout and improve efficiency. This includes strategies such as reducing waste, minimizing inventory, and optimizing workflow.\nAutomation can help businesses optimize their warehouse layout and improve efficiency. This includes strategies such as using conveyor systems to transport goods, implementing automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS), and using autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to perform tasks such as picking and packing.\nBy automating tasks, businesses can reduce labor costs and improve efficiency.\nSlotting is the process of assigning products to specific storage locations based on factors such as demand, size, and weight.\nBy implementing slotting, businesses can optimize their warehouse layout and improve efficiency. This includes strategies such as placing fast-moving items closer to the shipping area and grouping similar items together to reduce the distance traveled by workers.\nUse Data Analytics\nData analytics can help businesses optimize their warehouse layout and improve efficiency. By analyzing data on inventory levels, order processing times, and worker productivity, businesses can identify opportunities for improvement and make data-driven decisions. This includes strategies such as using heat maps to visualize the flow of goods through the warehouse and using predictive analytics to forecast demand and optimize inventory levels.\nWarehouse layout optimization is critical to the success of any warehouse operation.

Cooper, PE, LEED AP, Managing Principal, Harley Ellis Devereaux, Southfield, Mich.\nKurt Karnatz, PE, CEM, LEED AP, HBDP, HFDP, President, Environmental Systems Design Inc., Chicago\nKent W. Peterson, PE, FASHRAE, LEED AP BD+C, BEAP, Vice President/Chief Engineer, P2S Engineering Inc., Long Beach, Calif.\nCSE: What unique requirements do office building HVAC systems have that you wouldn’t encounter on other structures?\nPeterson: One unique requirement of an office building is the flexibility requirement of the building HVAC system to be reconfigured four or five times over the life of the system.\nKarnatz: The need to support multiple and diverse occupancy needs is the most common difference between other types of buildings.\nCooper: Office building systems have more diversity in occupancy schedules, required ventilation rates, and functionality. Available equipment space is consistently being challenged to yield higher net to gross square footage. Engineered systems want to be high efficiency, but also with reasonable initial cost. Finally, office buildings are driving simplicity of design. Limited building management resources are encouraging the design community to look at sophisticated systems to meet the functional needs, which are easy to monitor and control.\nCSE: How can automated features and remote system control benefit office building clients?\nKarnatz: Remote monitoring is certainly becoming a very important part of lean building operations and management and will continue to grow. Remote oversight of building system operation provides an opportunity to continuously monitor and respond to load and system changes. It can provide predictive and preemptive information to better respond to the operational and maintenance needs of a system.\nCooper: When building management resources are limited, automation and remote control are keys to making these facilities run. Through Web-based management systems, building occupants can provide input on system performance and, likewise building management who may be responsible for multiple facilities can respond immediately to system notifications and tenant requests. The result is improved responsiveness and a more satisfied tenant community.\nPeterson: Office buildings experience a wide range of occupant diversity throughout the day. Today’s HVAC and lighting controls have the capability of reducing lighting levels when daylight is available or turning off lights when rooms are not occupied. This can result in 50% less lighting energy on an annual basis.\nCSE: What is the most important indoor air quality (IAQ) issue you typically address in these projects, and how do you address it?\nCooper: Ventilation rates, with varying occupancy and space function, is one of the key issues we see on our projects. In high-density spaces requiring large amounts of ventilation air, dedicated outside air units used in conjunction with energy recovery wheels and demand-controlled ventilation help offset energy consumption. Underfloor displacement air delivery systems are an effective way to get just the right amount of ventilation air where and when you need it. Understanding how fresh air is introduced into the building and managing the quality of the outdoor air through appropriate filtration systems is essential. MERV-13 or better filters are typically utilized for this purpose, with positive results.\nPeterson: The most important IAQ issue is to provide the proper amount of ventilation air throughout the range of operation of the building. We always provide airflow measurement of the outside air with demand-controlled ventilation in densely occupied spaces to optimize IAQ and energy efficiency for the building.\nKarnatz: Occupant comfort is enhanced in environments that feel vibrant and fresh. Today’s systems that support higher air change rates and lower thermal asymmetry are able to deliver consistent indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and occupant satisfaction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:697c224e-c1b1-4a91-90bf-92d7b8e9cec3>","<urn:uuid:47fabe6a-d661-4a46-9aa8-80b49579da40>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do warm-ups enhance performance in both structured exercise routines and home workouts? Please explain the key benefits.","answer":"Warm-ups enhance performance in multiple ways across exercise settings. They increase muscle flexibility by improving blood flow to muscles, making joints and tendons less stressed and reducing the risk of strains and pulls. They also prepare the cardiovascular and nervous systems by gradually increasing heart rate and helping mind-body coordination. Additionally, warm-ups improve overall performance through increased strength, speed, and flexibility while reducing post-exercise soreness. They raise body temperature for optimal performance and increase endurance by reducing lactic acid buildup, allowing longer and more effective workouts.","context":["Exercises you can do at home\nIt is recommended that you work your way through the exercises in the order shown. Alternatively, you can pick just the sections that interest you.\nTo ensure you are looking after yourself throughout this exercise programme, please read the below points before getting started:\nYou - make sure you are prepared for exercise, wearing light and comfortable clothing and appropriate footwear. Check-in with your body, do you have any aches or pains to look after during exercise today?\nThe Environment - set-up your space, check you have enough room, remove items from the floor that may cause you to trip, check the room temperature is appropriate.\nThe Activity – you know your body, choose an activity you are comfortable with, participate at your own pace and to a level that suits your fitness.\nRemember to start the exercise with gentler activity (warm-up) and cool down in the same way. Drink water before, during and afterwards to remain hydrated and take breaks during your exercise if you need.\nTry some exercises on the go - after you have had a go practising these exercises a few times, you could start to incorporate them into daily activity or walks.\nexercises on the go\nExercise types: Warm Up | Static Balance | Dynamic Balance | Strength | Walking | Warm Down\nThe purpose of the warm-up is to gradually get your muscles and cardiovascular system prepared for exercising.\nTake a seat and make sure you sit forward in your chair, nice and upright, with your feet flat on the floor – this is our starting position.\nLift your toes off the ground, then back to the starting position, and lift your heels off the ground and back to the starting position. Repeat this for 15 seconds. Now, keeping your heels on the ground, tap your toes from side to side. Repeat this for 15 seconds.\nDo a marching movement sitting in your chair. Start slowly and build up speed. Remember to swing your arms! Do this for 30 seconds.\nFoot and arm switch\nSitting forward on your chair, place one foot under your seat with just your toes on the floor and the other foot flat on the floor in front of you. Have your arms at your sides and ensure that they are straight. Swing your arms up so they are level with your shoulders and at the same time switch the position of your feet. Bring your arms back down to your sides and at the same time switch your foot position back. Keep repeating for 30 seconds.\nSeated star jump exercise\nExtend both legs out in front of your body on a 45-degree angle (can either put feet on the ground or above ground). At the same time extend your arms like you are doing a star jump. Bring your limbs back to the starting position. Keep repeating for 30 seconds.\nKnee lift punching exercise\nLift one knee up and punch the air in front of you with your opposite arm. Swap sides and keep alternating for 30 seconds.\nTry and do these exercises for the recommended duration. If you can't, that is OK - do what you can manage and try to gradually build up from there.\nLooking straight ahead, stand with your feet touching each other and flat on the floor with your knees slightly bent [30 seconds]. Optional: Reach up high with one or both arms as if you were getting something off a high shelf. This variation raises our centre of gravity which makes balancing more challenging!\nStand with one foot in the instep of your other foot so your feet are touching [30 seconds]. Swap feet position and repeat [30 seconds].\nTandem (Heel-Toe stance)\nBring one foot so the heel is touching the toe of the other foot [30 seconds]. Swap your foot position and repeat [30 seconds].\nLift your left foot off the ground and either rest your left foot against your right leg or lift it just off the ground in front of you which is a little bit more challenging [30 seconds]. Swap feet so you’re lifting your right leg off the ground and repeat [30 seconds].\nForward lean exercise\nStand with your feet close together and keep your legs and back straight. Now lean forward as far as possible, maintaining the straight body position. The main things to focus on are keeping your heels down, leaning from the ankle and NOT the hips, and really gripping your toes into the ground to prevent yourself from falling forward. Try and hold this pose for 5 seconds. Push down firmly through your toes/soles of your feet to bring your body back to the starting position. Repeat this exercise for 1 minute.\nTap the Clock exercise – right leg\nStand to the right-hand side of your chair with your feet together and hold the back of your chair with your left hand if needed. Pretend that you are standing directly in the middle of a large clock which is lying on the ground, the 12 directly ahead of you. Lift your right foot so it is either lightly touching the ground or slightly off the ground. Bend your left knee – this is the starting position. The goal is to touch all the numbers on the imaginary clock with your right foot and after each touch return to the starting position. You can tap either on the ground or hover your foot just off the ground. Tapping further away makes this exercise harder, closer to you is easier. The goal is to build up your strength, balance and endurance so you can get all 12 numbers touched without resting in less than 1 minute! When tapping the numbers 7 to 11, you’ll have to cross your right leg in behind and/or in front of your left leg.\nTap the Clock exercise – left leg\nNow we’ll do the same exercise again but using our left leg. Stand on the left-hand side of your chair. Lift your left foot so it is either lightly touching the ground or slightly off the ground. Bend your right knee – this is the starting position. Repeat this exercise with your left leg, and work around the clock in reverse order. Try to get all 12 numbers touched without resting in less than 1 minute.\nAim to do 8-12 repetitions per leg. Alternatively, do what you can manage and try to gradually build up from there.\nHip flexor muscles\nThese muscles work to lift your leg up off the ground in a forward direction which is important when you’re walking!\nAction: Stand slightly to one side of your chair. Keeping your legs straight, extend one of your legs so it is out in front of you and off the floor. Hold it in the extended position briefly then lower your leg back to the starting position.\nThe hamstring muscles are responsible for your hip and knee movements in walking, squatting, bending your knees, and tilting your pelvis.\nAction: Bend your leg so one of your heels ends up close to your bum (or as close as is comfortable for you). Pause when flexed before slowly lowering your leg back to the start position. Note: This exercise may cause cramps for some people. If this happens to you, don’t flex your leg as much).\nThese are powerful muscles which help you get up from a chair, and play an important role when you’re walking, climbing stairs and squatting down.\nAction: For this exercise lift one leg off the ground keeping it bent. Now extend your leg out in front of you, so it is straight, and your foot is off the floor. Hold it in the extended position briefly then lower your leg back to the starting position.\nRear leg raises\nThis one is for your bum muscles which are called your glutes. These muscles are important as they affect your ability to stand from a squatted position, climb stairs and walk uphill.\nAction: Extend your left leg backwards and focus on squeezing your glutes muscles. Ensure that you are keeping your left leg and your back nice and straight. Hold briefly at the end of your range of motion and return your leg back to the starting position.\nSide leg lift\nThis exercise strengthens your hip abductors which are necessary for staying stable when walking or standing on one leg.\nAction: Raise your left leg out to the side, keeping it straight and your toes pointed forward. Pause at the end of the movement before slowly lowering your leg back to the start position.\nCalf and toe raises\nThese exercises help to strengthen your lower leg muscles which play an important role in walking.\nAction: Rise up onto your toes as high as you comfortably can, pause, then lower yourself down to the start position. Then lift your toes up off the ground so only your heels are on the ground and hold that position briefly. Keep alternating these movements.\nSit to stands\nThis is a good exercise to assess your leg strength.\nAction: Stand in front of your chair as if you were going to sit down. Placing your arms across your chest or straight out in front of you, begin to bend your legs to slowly sit down. Keep your back straight. Sit down on your chair and then stand back up. Try and avoid using your arms if you can – if you need to use your arms that is OK but have the goal of using them less as your leg strength improves.\nAim to do each exercise for 45 seconds and increase the duration as you improve.\nAim to lift your knees up nice and high and swing your arms!\nMake sure you have space to your left and right. Take a step to one side. Do the same with your other foot and bring your feet together. Make each side-step slightly wider than shoulder-width. You should feel your hip muscles working through this exercise.\nTake a small step forwards and diagonally with your left foot, and a small step forwards and diagonally with your right foot, then bring your feet together so they are touching. Keep repeating this sequence but alternate which foot you lead with. Do this exercise quickly with fast feet and light steps.\nHip Flexor Stretch\nPlace one foot in front of the other about a walking strides distance apart. Both toes point forwards and knees slightly bent. Tilt your hips up towards the ceiling and lean backwards and up to get a stretch in your back-hip. Swap feet position and repeat for the other hip. You can do this one standing up or sitting on the edge of your chair.\nLift your right leg up off the ground and make circles with your ankle in a clockwise direction (5 seconds). Now rotate it the other way (5 seconds). Now point your toes to the ground…and now your heel to the ground. Keep repeating this for a few repetitions (5 seconds). And let’s swap legs and do the same thing. Lift your left leg up off the ground and rotate your ankle in a clockwise direction (5 seconds). Now rotate it the other way (5 seconds). Point your toes to the ground…and now your heel to the ground. Keep repeating this a few more times (5 seconds).\nSit forward on your chair and straighten your right leg keeping your heel on the ground and toe in the air. Bend your left leg. Lean forward at the waist. You should feel a stretch in the back of your straight leg (5 seconds). Straighten up at your waist and repeat for 5 seconds – try and stretch a little further than before but make sure you aren’t feeling any pain. Repeat with your other leg.\nRotate your shoulders to your righthand side and hold the stretch for a few seconds before returning to the starting position. Rotate to your left, hold the stretch for a few seconds and return to the starting position. Keep repeating for 30 seconds.\nLean to one side of your chair so you feel a nice stretch in your side. Hold for a few seconds then return to the starting position. Lean to the other side, hold for a few seconds and return to the starting position. Keep repeating for 30 seconds.\nExtend your arms out to your side and level with your shoulders (like a scarecrow). Move your arms behind you – you should feel a nice stretch in your chest.\nLower back stretch\nSlowly bend forward at the waist as far as you can comfortably go. Allow your spine to lengthen and relax your neck. Now slowly extend back to an upright position. Do this stretch a couple of times.\nUpper back stretch\nHold your arms up and out in front at shoulder height. Turn your palms so they face each other and interlock your fingers. Relax your shoulders so they’re not scrunched up near your ears. Extend your hands until you feel a stretch. You can drop your head between your arms to increase the stretch. Hold for 10 seconds.\nPlace your arms at your sides and lift your shoulders as if you were shrugging, now roll your shoulders forwards to make small circles which gradually get bigger (10 seconds). Now rotate them backwards starting small and getting bigger (10 seconds).\nRotate your head to look to your right-hand side… and back the other way to look to your left. Now place one ear to your shoulder (5 seconds). Repeat on the other side (5 seconds). Repeat a few times.\nSit upright in your chair, nice and relaxed. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in. Hold… and slowly release your breath. And again, take a deep breath in. Hold… and slowly release. One more time … deep breath in, hold… and slowly release your breath.","How often do you follow your fitness instructor or gym trainer’s recommendation to warm up before your main workout? If hardly, you aren’t alone. It turns out that most people do not warm up before they exercise!\nThe warming-up process is regarded as a crucial part of every workout, which is why fitness experts place much emphasis on it. Warm-up times typically depend on the intensity of the workout. It might not take more than a few minutes, but warming up can help reduce stress on the heart and muscles. When doing warm-ups, you should target all the muscles that you will engage during the training session.\nIf you need more convincing as to why you should take some moments out before your exercise to warm up, here are 5 wonderful benefits of warming up you should consider:\n1) Warm-ups increase muscle flexibility\nAs your body gets warmer, your muscles become more flexible because more blood flows to them. As a result, your joints and tendons are less stressed. Joints that are well lubricated and warm will allow you to perform sudden movements more easily. Furthermore, this greatly reduces the chance of acute injuries as well as overuse injuries.\nWhile there is unfortunately no warm-up that can prevent serious sports injuries such as bone fractures, a quick 10- to 15-minute warm-up can effectively minimize strains and pulls, along with overuse injuries like tendonitis.\n2) Warm-ups prepare the nervous and cardio systems\nOne key advantage of warming up is that you prepare your cardiovascular system for physical activity. When your muscles are stimulated by movement, your heart pumps blood at a faster rate. Warming up can thus reduce the risk of high blood pressure by easing your cardiovascular system into those higher demands.\nFor your workout to be safe and efficient, both your brain and body must be working together. Warming up helps you to re-adjust your mind and body from whatever activity you were doing prior to your workout. Thus the warm-up prepares you for a more physically, or even mentally, challenging activity than you might usually be engaged in during your work or while sitting behind the wheel.\n3) Warm-ups improve your performance\nThe mental aspect of warm-ups allows you to focus on the training session ahead. Also, warming up can help you perform better in terms of strength, speed and flexibility, allowing you to ‘get into the zone’ with greater ease. Furthermore, you will experience less soreness after exercising when your body is able to handle the demands you place on it.\n4) Warm-ups raise your body temperature\nThe body produces its peak performance when it is at a slightly higher temperature. A warm-up can help increase your body’s core temperature in cold weather or early in the morning. As a plus, studies also suggest that a higher body core temperature may result in more calories being burnt!\n5) Warm-ups increase your endurance\nWhen you have an excessive amount of lactic acid in your blood, your body is inclined to give up on exercising. During the first few minutes of an exercise session, your body may build up lactic acid if you do not warm up properly, giving yourself the worst possible start to your workout. Warming up, however, adjusts your energy systems, resulting in less lactic acid buildup. This allows you to work out harder and longer!\nSo the next time you embark on your workout, keep in mind these benefits of warming up and ace your exercise!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:89bfffe0-26f0-4476-b88a-cb263ab3c750>","<urn:uuid:91fe86d1-982b-48d9-8d9f-c853f2ba1b94>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the Clan Currie's name evolve from its original Gaelic form MacMhuirrich to its modern spelling?","answer":"The name evolved during the fall of the Gaelic order in the 18th Century when English began to pervade Gaelic-speaking areas. As people found old Gaelic names difficult to pronounce, MacMhuirrich (pronounced MacVurich) was gradually anglicized through various forms including MacMureach, MacVurich, and MacCurry, eventually becoming the present-day Currie and related spellings like Curry and Currey.","context":["The Clan Currie, anciently Clan MacMhuirrich,\nhas a long and honorable history. They are one of the earliest constituted\nClans of the Scottish Highlands. In his book \"Scottish Clans and\nTartans\", Scottish author and historian Ian Grimble writes \"The\nHerbridean name of Currie is the corrupt English form of the MacMureach,\none of the most ancient and distinguished names in Scotland's history.\nThrough the MacMhuirrichs, the Literary Torch in the Western Isles was\npreserved for generations. They were recognized as the most illustrious\nbody of learned men who were specialists in the heroic literature and\ngenealogy of the ancient Gaelic world\".\nAccording to Derek Thompson, Professor of\nCeltic Literature, Glasgow University, the origin of the name Currie dates\nfrom the fall of the Gaelic order in the 18th Century. During this period,\nthe English language began to pervade what had been purely Gaelic speaking\nareas. There followed an influx of people who found the old Gaelic names\nodd and difficult to pronounce. Consequently, many old Highland names were\nanglicized or an English name was chosen that had the faintest resemblance\nto the sound of the Gaelic one. The name MacMhuirrich [pronounced\nMacVurich] began to appear in many forms including MacMureach, MacVurich,\nand MacCurry and eventually took on the form of the present day Currie and\nother related spellings such as Curry and Currey.\nOrigins of the Clan\nIn his book, \"The Clans of\nScotland\", noted anthropologist and author Dr. Micheil MacDonald outlines the early history of\nClan Currie. \"The founder of the race was Muiredach O'Daly [1180 -\n1222 AD], an outstanding poet of his time, who had studied at the famous\nIrish Colleges. O'Daly's ancestry, which is fully recorded in the Office\nof Genealogies and Arms in Dublin Castle, show's his family's descent\nthrough the Royal race of Ireland back to Conn of the Hundred Battles, the\n110th High King of Ireland in 177 AD. This officially acknowledged\ngenealogy confirms the Currie family as one of the oldest traceable\nfamilies in Europe\".\nMuiredach O'Daly was a member of the most\nfamous family in the Celtic world, the family of O'Daly. The O'Dalys were\nestablished in their literary role as a bardic family by the 12th century.\nWhen Mael Iosa Ua Da, Muiredach's great grandfather, died in 1185, he was\ndescribed in the contemporary Irish annals as Ollamh of Ireland and\nAccording to Seumas MacManus in \"The\nStory of the Irish Race\", Muiredach was highly respected as the\nKing's Poet at the court of Cathal Crodhearg of Connaught. However, he was\nforced to flee to Scotland in 1213 after making an enemy of the powerful\nchief of the O'Donnels, whose steward had arrogantly demanded rent from\nthe Royal Bard. O'Daly's response was swift and final - splitting the\nsteward's head in two with a battleaxe. Then, in traditional bardic\narrogance, expressed his surprise over the ensuing fuss in a poem:\nTrifling our quarrel with\nA clown to be abusing me,\nAnd me to kill the churl,\nDear God, is this a cause for enmity?\nHe arrived in Scotland in 1213 and settled\nin Islay, the stronghold home of Donald, Lord of the Isles and grandson of\nSomerled, the Celtic-Norse founder of the Kingdom of Innesgall. The\naddition of the famed Bard to his court brought Donald additional prestige\nand the two men became great friends. Donald became the founder and\nnamefather of Clan Donald, and Muiredach of the MacMhuirrichs: the\ncontracted Scots Gaelic patronymic Mhuireadhaigh son of Muiredach.\nMuiredach's fame and stature as a poet was without parallel in Gaelic\nScotland where he held an honored and revered position. The native Scots\nclaimed Muiredach as their own as shown by the title bestowed him\nMuiredach Albanach or Muiredach of Scotland.\nAt least twenty poems are ascribed to\nMuiredach, and it is significant that one of them can be seen from its\ncontents to provide supporting evidence that he took part in the Fifth\nCrusade. This 13th century poem has been perpetuated for all time in the\nRoman Catholic Church of Saints Peter and Paul at Arrochar near the very\nspot where the poem was composed:\nLo, tearful I sit on this\nNo Longer light-footed and strong.\n'Tis a far cry, Saints Peter and Paul,\nTo Rome from the head of Loch Long.\nA footnote is added to the poem, which\nreads \"Repeated by the Pilgrim Muiredach Albanach at the head of Loch\nLong in Argylshire when he returned from Rome\". Recent archaeological\nexcavations on Islay have produced a 13th century pilgrim’s\nbadge, which could only have been acquired on such a pilgrimage to Rome.\nSuch were the already ancient origins of\nScotland's longest learned dynasty. Naturally, it attached itself to the\nLords of the Isles when these maintained a virtually independent Gaelic\nprincipality in medieval Scotland. Muiredach's sons and their sons held\nthe office of Hereditary Bards and Historians to the Lord of the Isles,\nand later to Clan Donald.\nNineteen years after the death of Muiredach,\nDonald, Lord of the Isles passed away and his son, Angus Mor, was\ninaugurated as the first MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, by Niall, the first\nMacMhuirrich. From this point on throughout the existence of the MacDonald\nLordship of the Isles a MacMhuirrich Bard performed this office at each\nsuccessive Lord's inauguration.\nAt the decisive battle of Harlaw in 1411,\nwhen the Lord of the Isles sought to enforce his claim to the lands of the\nEarldom of Ross against the Stewarts, it was Lachlann Mor MacMhuirrich\n[1370 - 1438] who composed the incitement to battle. The clan motto since\nthat day has been Inspire To Victory. The epic war poem took several hours\nto recite, igniting the troops to combat and calling upon their lineage\nback to their earliest ancestors to lead them to victory:\nO’ Children of Conn of the Hundred\nNow is the time for you to win recognition.\nO’ raging whelps,\nO’ sturdy heroes,\nO’ most sprightly lions,\nO’ battle-loving warriors, O’ brave firebrands,\nThe Children of Conn of the Hundred Battles.\nO’ Children of Conn, remember,\nHardihood in time of battle.\nAfter the Fall of the Lordship of the\nNiall Mor MacMhuirrich is the first who\nappears under Clanranald patronage, and the earliest dateable poem from\nhis pen belongs to the year 1613. The Clanranald bards produced the\nlargest collection of MacMhuirrich writings. Niall MacMhuirrich [1637 -\n1726], the last of the bardic race, chronicled the wars of Montrose in the\nlast body of Gaelic prose to be written in Scotland in the ancient Irish\nscript style. When he died in 1726, the bardic order became extinct in\nThe Currie Tartan\nThe Currie tartan came into existence in\n1822 at the time of George IV's State visit to Edinburgh. That year, Lord\nAlexander MacDonald, 10th Baronet of Nova Scotia, Chief of the MacDonalds\nof the Isles, granted to James Currie of Balilone and Garrachoran, the\nright to use the Lord of the Isles tartan as the basis for his own family\nThis grant was reconfirmed on August 22,\n1971 to the last of the Balilone line of Currie’s, Col. William McMurdo\nCurrie by Lord MacDonald, the Right Honourable Godfrey James Macdonald of\nMacdonald, High Chief of Clan Donald. The grant states:\n\"I Godfrey James Macdonald of\nMacdonald, Lord, Macdonald, take pleasure in granting to you the right to\nuse the Lord of the Isles Tartan, with certain heraldic differences, as\nyour own Family Tartan. The difference to consist of two tinctures from\nyour own Coat-of-Arms, namely Black and Gold, the same to constitute a\nguard to the darker green square of the basic Lord of the Isles Tartan.\nThis is done in recognition of you as the present Representer of the\nHighland Family or Clan of Currie, anciently Clan MacMhuirrich, who of old\nwere the Historians to the Lords of the Isles. This confirms an earlier\ngrant of August 1822 made by Sir Alexander of Sleat, 10th Bart\nand 2nd Lord Macdonald giving to your great-great-grandfather,\nJames Currie of Balilone and Garrochoran the right to this aforesaid\nIn his book, \"The Clans of\nScotland\", noted Scots tartan expert, anthropologist and editor of\n\"Scots Kith and Kin\", Dr. Micheil MacDonald confirms this\nhistory, \"Some vassal clans which served the Lordship of the Isles\nbefore its annexation in 1493 claim the right to tartans from that\nconnection. The Currie variant of the old \"Lord of the Isles\"\ntartan was granted by the 2nd Lord MacDonald, as direct\ndescendant to the last Lord of the Isles in 1822. It was confirmed by the\npresent Lord MacDonald in 1976 to the most recent of a long line of\nMacMhuirrich chiefs, Colonel William McMurdo Currie, 22nd Laird\nof Balilone and 30th Chief of Clan MacMhuirrich\".\nSwatches of both the original 1822 tartan\nand a more recent (ca. 1976) sample are registered at the Scottish Tartans\nSociety in Pitlochry and at the Glencoe Museum in Glencoe, Invernesshire.\nThe tartan remained in a restricted state,\ni.e. solely for the use of the Balilone and Garrachoran line of Currie’s\nuntil 1991. This explains the virtual absence of the tartan from many of\nthe standard tartan publications, which have never maintained complete\ncatalogs of the vast array of registered tartans. The tartan was adopted\nas the official tartan for the entire clan in 1992.\nColonel William McMurdo Currie of Glasgow,\nScotland was last of the Balilone and Garrachoran line of Currie’s.\nCurrie was raised in Glasgow and attended the Royal College of Science and\nTechnology, as well as the Glasgow Art School.

{"question":"Compare the challenges facing bells in Delft's Old Church versus modern city churches - what limits their use?","answer":"The Trinitas bell in Delft's Old Church is limited by structural concerns - its powerful chime causes such heavy vibrations that regular use could damage the monument, especially given the tower's existing structural issues (it leans 1.20 meters west and 1 meter north). In contrast, modern city churches face environmental limitations - their bells are increasingly drowned out by urban noise pollution, particularly traffic, making them barely audible in cities like Amsterdam, whereas historically these bells were designed to be the loudest sounds in their communities.","context":["If you were standing by the Lion’s Gate, in the Old City walls of Jerusalem, you might hear this call to prayer:\nIf you were standing in New Delhi, more than 3,000 miles away, you might hear this one, the same idea shaped by its location:\nThese are two of close to 200 sounds collected by Cities and Memory, a field recording and sound art project, for its newest and largest collection, Sacred Spaces. The collection includes sounds of prayers, bells, churches, temples, organs, and songs, recorded in 34 countries and organized both by geography and category. You can listen to calls to prayer from around the world, discover the resonances of organs across the U.K., or compare the sounds of a shamanic chant in Peru, a prayer wheel in Kathmandu, and a quinceañera mass in Mexico.\nThe Sacred Spaces collection began after the U.K.’s Churches Conservation Trust asked Stuart Fowkes, the project’s founder, to document some of the sounds of the churches they care for. Some of these historic churches date back to the 1100s and 1200s, and they’re no longer actively used. Fowkes would coax some sound out of the organs, some 20 feet tall, and a few times got to ring the church bell.\n“You go into these old churches, and there’s just a rope,” he says. “You start to pull on it, and the whole church fills with the sound of this ringing bell. You realize that even with a single bell, it’s much harder than it looks, because you have to get the rhythm exactly right, otherwise you get this weird stuttering effect. You have to get into the groove of it. It’s surprisingly hard work.”\nFowkes realized quickly that the project of capturing the sounds of Christian spaces in England could be expanded far and wide around the world. He was expecting the project would draw out the differences among the world’s religions, but instead he found that the collection of sounds highlighted their similarities. A church bell and a call to prayer serve the same function—organizing people’s days, telling them when it’s time to pray.\nAt the same time, though, these sounds are specificity tied to the place where they’re from. The bells of Villa del Conte, for instance, are so familiar to the people living in this small town in northern Italy that they can distinguish the sound of that bell from any other, says Fowkes. “It’s like an auxiliary heartbeat or the fingerprint of the town,” he says.\nOne of the features of Cities and Memory is its remixed “memory” versions of each sound clip, reimagined by a sound artist. These versions are meant to invoke the possibilities of places meshed with memory and personality: One person’s experience of a place or sound doesn’t necessary match with another’s. Even the most universal sound is filtered through an individual experience.\nThe inputs we get these days are different than in the past, though, and some of the sacred sounds collected here are in danger of being drowned out. In Pendock, England, the medieval town that once surrounded the church has disappeared, and the building stands near a motorway. When Fowkes went inside the church to record its organ, the sounds of the motorway intruded on the recording, even through the stone walls of the church. And at the Westerkerk, in Amsterdam, the church bell was barely audible over the sound of the traffic.\n“Think about bells in the Middle Ages,” says Fowkes. “The bell would be the loudest sound, outside the sound of a battle or an earthquake that anyone had ever heard. The bell was designed to be the loudest possible sound. Now, you go to a modern city, and the bell is barely audible over traffic.” When we listen to the world, it roars. In some of these sacred spaces, it’s still possible to hear the sounds associated with contemplation for hundreds of years.","bell and the skewed tower of the old church in Delft\nThe first parish church of Delft, the old church, was built around\n1200. In front of the church a 75 meters high tower, with brickwork\nspire and four turrets, was built in 1350. Even during its\nconstruction, the tower was plagued by subsidence. This could be\nbecause the water in the Oude Delft had to be redirected to make way\nfor the existing church. The tower therefore was probably built on a\nfilled-in canal. Throughout the ages, the leaning tower has been the\ncause of considerable alarm to many an inhabitant. The tower leans 1.20\nmeters to the west and 1 meter to the north.\nTwo unique bells hang from a heavy oak bell cage in the fourth loft in\nthe tower of the Oude Kerk (Old Church). These are the Trinitas bell\ndating from 1570 and the Laudate bell dating from 1719. The Trinitas\nbell, or Bourdon bell, is the most exceptional of the two, weighing\nalmost nine tonnes (!). The Bourdon can still be heard each day,\nalthough somewhat modestly, when a hammer chimes the hour and\nhalf-hour. The Bourdon is only rung on very special occasions such\nas, for example, the funeral of a member of the Dutch royal\nfamily. The powerful chime of the Bourdon causes such heavy vibrations\nthat regular use could damage the monument.\nIn this problem for the studygroup, we try to model the effect of\nringing the extremely heavy bells inside the leaning tower with\nmathematical methods. Is it possible to analyze the effect of ringing\non the stability of the tower and on the occurance of damages in the\ntower ? Is there resonance ?\nModeling a skew beam with a heavy pendulum can be mathematically\ninteresting, because of the possibility of a chaotic behavior. But is\nthis model too simple ? Should one include damping ? How does one model\nancient stone constructions ?\nTo be able to work on this problem, it is necessary to collect detailed\ninformation about the old church (height, width, weight of bells,\nposition of bells, other relevant issues). It is known, for example,\nfrom scaled drawings of the construction, that the backside of the\ntower is heavier than the leaning fore side (more stones are used in\nthe backside part). Also the heaviest bell is placed on the backside.\nThe body of the tower has four floors and a thirty meters high spire,\nin which again four floors. The lowest tower room can be reached via a\nshort porch, built after 1500, the now closed passages left and right\nto the aisles are still recognizable. It is obvious that these were\nmade when the tower was already leaning over.\nIn the northern aisle is a spiral staircase. The first floor\naccommodates the large wrought-iron clockwork (1605); it is out of\norder now. The much smaller clockwork that took over in 1885 is also\nout of order and is now placed inside the old one. The present\nclockwork is placed at its appropriate place near the clockfaces. In\nthe northwestern corner of the tower, at second floor level, is a\ncharter chamber with an old iron door. It is said that here Balthasar\nGerards, the assassin of Prince William of Orange, was locked\naway. The third floor only heightens the tower. After all, it was\nimportant to be able to place the bells as high as possible. The fourth\nfloor is the ´klokkenzolder´ (bell attic). Here stands a robust oak\nframe from the 16th or 17th century, in which the bells rest.\nTo see a photo of the skewed tower please click photo 1.\nA close up of the skewed tower, click photo 2.\nAt this image you will find some (repaired) cracks on\nFor drawings of the achitectures of the old church please click drawing 1,"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8c0c5ef3-0f29-4b3b-9763-b15e4dda6625>","<urn:uuid:e6a071d3-3a5c-4b7f-888a-110ebabeee94>"],"error":null}

That’s why we regularly review our policies to make sure that — similar to the laws that govern civil society — they reflect the changes that occur both on and off our platform. To be clear: the vast majority of content on YouTube does not violate our guidelines. But we still check for gaps that may have opened up or hunt for emerging risks that test our policies in new ways.\nAs we work to keep our policies evolving with the current landscape, our guiding focus is around one major goal: preventing egregious real-world harm. This doesn’t mean that we remove all offensive content from YouTube, and we generally believe that open debate and free expression leads to better societal outcomes. But we’re careful to draw the line around content that may cause egregious harm to our users or to the platform.\nThis can include physical harm. For example, when claims that linked 5G technology to the spread of COVID-19 resulted in damage to cell towers across the United Kingdom, we moved quickly to make them violative. Or it could mean significant harm to democratic institutions, which is why we don’t allow claims that aim to mislead people about voting — including by promoting false information about the voting times, places or eligibility requirements.\nWe also work closely with NGOs, academics, and relevant experts from all sides and different countries to inform this policy review. They help flag new concerns, or bring a deep understanding to complex topics that are prone to consistent change. For example, we established our COVID-19 misinformation policy at the start of the pandemic alongside health authorities like the Center for Disease Control and World Health Organization. Later, as their guidance shifted to ease mask and social distancing restrictions, we updated our policies around content that questioned the efficacy of masks and social distancing.\nOnce we’ve identified an area where a policy update is needed, that’s where our Trust & Safety team comes in to develop a tailored solution. We start by assessing a few things. How commonly found is this specific type of harmful content on YouTube (and what’s its potential to grow)? And how is it managed under our current Community Guidelines?\nThen we watch dozens or even hundreds of videos to understand the implications of drawing different policy lines. Drawing a policy line is never about a single video; it’s about thinking through the impact on all videos, which would be removed and which could stay up under the new guideline. Following this comprehensive review, the team shares various options for policy lines, making sure to detail examples of videos that would be removed or approved for each (as well as different enforcement actions, like removal vs. age-restriction).\nA top choice is selected from those draft options and then goes through further rounds of assessment. At this stage, we’re looking to understand whether the proposal can meaningfully achieve a few key goals:\nIf we’re satisfied that we’re hitting these targets, an executive group made up of leads across the company reviews the proposal. Final sign-off comes from the highest levels of leadership, including YouTube’s Chief Product Officer and CEO. If at any point there is consistent disagreement between teams about where we’ve drawn the line, the policy is sent back to the drawing board.\nThroughout the policy development process, we partner closely with a range of established third-party experts on topics like hate speech or harassment. We also work with various government authorities on other important issues like violent extremism and child safety.\nPartnerships are especially critical to support policy enforcement for regional issues, where language or cultural expertise is often needed to properly contextualize content.\nExperts help us forecast how global events could cause harmful content to spread across our platform, including uncovering gaps in our systems that might be exploited by bad actors, or providing recommendations for new updates. And like with COVID-19, they provide input that helps us adapt policies in situations where guidance can change quickly.\nThese partnerships are also especially critical to support policy enforcement for regional issues, where language or cultural expertise is often needed to properly contextualize content. For example, we worked closely with experts in 2021 during the coup d'état in Myanmar to identify cases where individuals were using speech to incite hatred and violence along ethno-religious lines. This allowed us to quickly remove the violative content from our platform.\nPeople often think about content moderation as reactive in nature — that we only take content down when it’s flagged by our systems or people. In reality, the bulk of our work focuses on the future. There’s a long process that’s designed to give our teams visibility into emerging issues before they reach, or become widespread on, our platform.\nThat valuable visibility is driven by our Intelligence Desk, a team within YouTube’s Trust & Safety organization. These specialized analysts identify potentially violative trends — whether new vectors of misinformation or dangerous internet challenges — and the risks they pose. They’re also regularly monitoring ongoing threats like extremist conspiracy theories, both tracking their prevalence across media and evaluating how they morph over time.\nThese insights then feed into thinking through how current or future policies would manage these new threats. For example, based on evidence gathered by the Intelligence Desk, we updated our hate and harassment policies to better combat harmful conspiracy theories on our platform.\nThe implementation of a new policy is a joint effort between people and machine learning technology. In practice, that means in order for a policy to be successfully launched and enforced, people and machines need to work together to achieve consistently high levels of accuracy when reviewing content.\nWe start by giving our most experienced team of content moderators enforcement guidelines (detailed explanation of what makes content violative), and ask them to differentiate between violative and non-violative material. If the new guidelines allow them to achieve a very high level of accuracy, we expand the testing group to include hundreds of moderators across different backgrounds, languages and experience levels.\nAt this point, we begin revising the guidelines so that they can be accurately interpreted across the larger, more diverse set of moderators. This process can take a few months, and is only complete once the group reaches a similarly high degree of accuracy. These findings then help train our machine learning technology to detect potentially violative content at scale. As we do with our content moderators, we test models to understand whether we’ve provided enough context for them to make accurate assessments about what to surface for people to review.\nAfter this testing period, the new policy can finally launch. But the refinement continues in the months that follow. Every week, our Trust & Safety leadership meet with quality assurance leads from across the globe (those responsible for overseeing content moderation teams) to discuss particularly thorny decisions and review the quality of our enforcement. If needed, guideline tweaks are then drafted to address gaps or to provide clarity for edge cases.\nOnce models are trained to identify potentially violative content, the role of content moderators remains essential throughout the enforcement process. Machine learning identifies potentially violative content at scale and nominates for review content that may be against our Community Guidelines. Content moderators then help confirm or deny whether the content should be removed.\nThis collaborative approach helps improve the accuracy of our models over time, as models continuously learn and adapt based on content moderator feedback. And it also means our enforcement systems can manage the sheer scale of content that’s uploaded to YouTube (over 500 hours of content every minute), while still digging into the nuances that determine whether a piece of content is violative.\nFor example, a speech by Hitler at the Nuremberg rallies with no additional context may violate our hate speech policy. But if the same speech was included in a documentary that decried the actions of the Nazis, it would likely be allowed under our EDSA guidelines. EDSA takes into account content where enough context is included for otherwise violative material, like an educational video or historical documentary.\nThis distinction may be more difficult for a model to recognize, while a content moderator can more easily spot the added context. This is one reason why enforcement is a fundamentally shared responsibility — and it underscores why human judgment will always be an important part of our process. For most categories of potentially violative content on YouTube, a model simply flags content to a content moderator for review before any action may be taken.\nWe’re driven in all of our work to live up to our Community Guidelines and further our mission to allow new voices and communities to find a home on YouTube. Success on this front is hard to pin down to a single metric, but we’re always listening to feedback from stakeholders and members of our community about ways we can improve — and we continuously look to provide more transparency into our systems and processes (including efforts like this blog).\nFrom July through September of this year ... for every 10,000 views, between 10 and 11 were of content that violated our Community Guidelines.\nTo measure the effectiveness of our enforcement, we release a metric called our violative view rate, which looks at how many views on YouTube come from violative material. From July through September of this year, that number was 0.10% – 0.11%, which means that for every 10,000 views, between 10 and 11 were of content that violated our Community Guidelines.\nWe also track the number of appeals submitted by creators in response to videos that are removed (an option available to any Creator on YouTube), as this helps us gain a clearer understanding about the accuracy of our systems. For example, during the same time period mentioned above, we removed more than 5.6 million videos for violating our Community Guidelines and received roughly 271,000 removal appeals. Upon review, we reinstated about 29,000 appeals.\nAnd while metrics like appeals, reinstatements, and our violative view rate don’t offer a perfect solution to understand consistency or accuracy, they’re still pivotal in benchmarking success on an ongoing basis.\nCommunity Guidelines are concerned with language and expression — two things that, by their very nature, evolve over time. With that shifting landscape, we’ll continue to regularly review our policy lines to make sure they’re drawn in the right place. And to keep our community informed, we’ll be sharing further how we’re adapting in the months ahead.","Content moderation often boils down to posts taken down and users banned. But are these the right numbers to be paying attention to? In the first blog post of a two-part special, Nick Sainsbury, Kinzen’s Head of Product, explains the risk of focusing on ‘inward-looking metrics’ and why it's time for better ones.\nAround the world, the question of how content moderation policies are created and enforced is a hot topic. The smartest lawmakers from Canada to the United Kingdom are trying to answer the question of who gets to make the rules and what responsibilities they have to the general public. But, amidst all the legal definitions and political threats, there is little discussion about how we measure whether the changes in policy and their enforcement worked.\nFocusing on the right metrics is not a nice-to-have; it is essential to being able to operate platforms at scale. Several, including Facebook, have even done independent audits about how they measure the efficacy of moderation. They understand that optimising for the wrong number can lead to harmful secondary consequences.\nThey also know, to coin a quote misattributed to Einstein, that not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted. For example, the fact we know how many harmful pieces of content were taken down from a platform doesn’t mean we know the thing we care about — how much harm that content led to. Right now, the numbers that Trust and Safety teams have to measure the impact of their work are simple and process-driven.\nAt Kinzen, we have been considering what the right key performance indicators (KPIs) are to measure the job of protecting communities from disinformation and dangerous content. And we think there’s a case for more ‘outward looking’ metrics.\nThe majority of metrics are inward-facing\nHaving worked on customer support solutions in the past, I’ve always found the operations of content moderation teams pretty similar to that of customer support teams.\nCustomer support was long seen as a cost of doing business that should be limited and reduced. Metrics were operational and cost-focused. They didn’t tell an effective story about how important customer support was to the retention and expansion of customers. That changed with Net Promoter Score (NPS), which helped transform how businesses view their customer support organisation. Excellent customer support is now a strategic pillar for many successful and growing companies.\nAs we know, there is no shortage of important metrics for content moderation teams to optimise. However, when you take a closer look, it’s clear that they are mostly inward-facing and operational:\nThe question is: Is there a metric or set of metrics that can help make the often invisible impact of policy creation and moderation visible in the same way NPS has done for customer support?\nIs there a way to measure the true impact of Trust and Safety teams and their work?\nMetrics that focus on reducing exposure to harmful content\nSocial media networks appear to be taking a ‘better measurement, better management’ approach with several platforms recently introducing new ways of measuring removal and reducing harmful content.\nYouTube published a blog post in April 2021 detailing how they optimise their operations around a metric called Violative View Rate (VVR) This approach takes a sample of all video views in a period and then classifies them as violative (i.e. goes against policies) or not. A violative view rate per 10,000 is calculated as a percentage and used over time to assess whether exposure to policy violating content is going up or down.\nA great metric encourages the right behaviours and what is interesting about VVR is that it isn’t purely about removal. Instead, it focuses on the viewer and their experience. It also leaves open the possibility that the largest improvement in VVR might come from changing how the recommendation system handles violative content, rather than any moderation process. As a measure, it aligns nicely with the mission.\nHowever, that’s not to say VVR is perfect. YouTube’s policies often change, as do how they are enforced. It means that the VVR from two years ago might not be comparable with the VVR today.\nSeveral platforms, including TikTok, also focus on ‘proactive’ action, that is performing a moderation action before a user report has been submitted on a piece of content. This metric is useful because it aligns different units and creates a shared responsibility for reducing harm. Although a score like this can lack transparency and takes additional effort to align different stakeholders, we know from our own experience at Kinzen that it results in better policies and higher accuracy.\nAlthough there is no single consensus about a ‘golden metric’, these combined scores provide a more robust method for measuring the prevention of abuse and hate online and are generalisable to almost any social media or content hosting platform.\nOperational metrics measure the ‘how’. Measuring policy violation provides insights into the ‘what’. These metrics fail to measure whether the activities are achieving the ‘why’ of trust and safety or content moderation; which might be best described as ‘to safeguard users while promoting an inclusive environment’.\nIn Part 2, Nick will be exploring how the jobs-to-be-done framework could usefully complement existing ways of thinking about moderation metrics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ed34dcd6-2fb1-48c7-a1da-307baf891647>","<urn:uuid:3be8d313-4b1e-4301-b1ab-04f035ae3101>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Cold weather affect both mortar and shingles - which material work worse in cold?","answer":"Asphalt shingles perform worse in cold weather compared to mortar. According to the documents, asphalt shingles will not seal properly if installed in temperatures at or below forty degrees Fahrenheit, as they need warmer temperatures to activate their sealant. In contrast, mortar is noted to set up best in temperatures between 50 and 80 degrees, and while cold weather isn't ideal, the documents indicate that proper mortar installation can be achieved by following the correct mixing and application procedures.","context":["- Roofing & Siding >\n- How To: Repoint Brick Walls\nHow To: Repoint Brick Walls\nRepointing brick walls and chimneys with new mortar will not only enhance their beauty, but ensure that they remain secure, stable, and sound for years to come.\nBrick houses are hard to damage. Anyone familiar with The Three Little Pigs knows that. Inevitably, however, there comes a time when the mortar between bricks begins to degrade. The process of repair, known as repointing, is pretty easy (if a bit time consuming). Undoubtedly, it’s a smart thing to do. That’s because crumbling mortar, if not fixed, allows water to seep in between the bricks, causing them to swell and crack and become generally blow-downable.\nHere’s how to keep your brick walls standing tall.\nStep 1: Remove The Old Mortar\nRepointing is all about out with the old and in with the new—and working in small sections. You don’t want to remove all of the old mortar from a wall at once, because you may weaken its integrity. So, working along the wall in an area about three- to five-feel wide, remove the old mortar from both the horizontal and vertical joints. To ensure you don’t damage the bricks, you can use a cold chisel or handheld grout saw to tap it out. You can also use another hand tool known as a joint raker. If you’re confident in your abilities, you can use a 4-inch angle grinder, but be careful not to cut into the brick. You’ll want to remove the mortar to a depth of about 1/2 inch. Use a whisk broom, wire brush or hose to remove all the dust and wear a respirator to keep debris out of your lungs.\nStep 2: Wet The Wall\nGive your brick wall a good soaking with a hose and let it sit overnight. This will ensure that the bricks and old mortar are hydrated and that they don’t suck the water out of the new mortar you’ll place between them the next day. When you are ready to put in the new mortar, lightly spritz the bricks one more time before beginning.\nStep 2: Mix The New Mortar\nIf your house is less than 50 years old, you will likely be safe using standard portland cement mortar to refill the spaces between your bricks. If your abode is older than that however, you’ll want to use a different mix, consisting of lime and sand. This is what was originally used in brickwork and it’s best to use the same mix as a replacement. That’s because portland cement mortar is very hard when it dries and can cause older bricks to crack. The lime mix acts almost like disks between vertebrae in the spine: it cushions the brick and moves along with the wall as it flexes. If you want to be sure you’re using the correct mortar replacement, you can check with a mason specializing in restoration work, or you can send a sample to be analyzed to a company like LimeWorks. Otherwise, a general rule of thumb is to make a mortar mix from 6 parts fine white sand, 2 parts lime and 1 part white portland cement.\nRelated: Brick Chimney Repair (VIDEO)\nNo matter the mortar mix you use, be sure to make it in small batches as it hardens quickly. Place the ingredients in a wheelbarrow and mix to a frosting-like consistency whereby the mortar holds its peaks when you draw it upwards with a trowel.\nTip: Mortar sets up best in temperatures between 50 and 80 degrees, so you might want to do this project in the cooler months of the year.\nStep 3: Insert The New Mortar\nPick up some mortar on a large trowel and then, using a pointing trowel, work smaller amounts into the horizontal and vertical gaps between the bricks. You might find it easier to fill the vertical joints with a tool known as a margin trowel. Use the flat edge of the trowel to even out your work and scrape off any mortar you get on the face of the bricks.\nStep 4: Clean Up\nWait about an hour until the mortar has hardened a bit, then scrape off any mortar that’s remained on the brick face. You can do this with a sturdy wire brush, but be sure to use a horizontal sweeping motion so as to not pull the new mortar out of the joints. For the next three to four days, give the wall a daily misting to allow the mortar to dry slowly and not crack.\nAll in all, it’s a tedious, detailed job and you may find yourself huffing and puffing during it, but you’ll soon be satisfied that nobody and nothing will be blowing your brick house down anytime soon.","How Long Do Asphalt Shingles Last?\nIf you have recently had an asphalt shingle installation, you will naturally want to know how long your roof will last. If you have an asphalt shingle composition roof, you can expect your roof to last about twenty years. This estimate, of course, depends on the climate and prevailing weather patterns of where you live. If your area has a history of hurricanes or severe weather events, this may impact the overall roof lifetime of your roof system. It will also be important to consider the amount of roof maintenance that your roof receives. It is important to conscript a professional roofing company for regular roof inspections. With great roofing maintenance and a a proper roof installation, you can expect great roof longevity.\nAre Asphalt Shingles Good?\nAsphalt shingles are exceedingly popular in North America. That is because they are endlessly versatile in terms of colors and shape. Asphalt shingles are also relatively easy to install and quite affordable. For these reasons, property developers and homeowners have welcomed asphalt shingles on to their homes and properties. They also have a good standard roof lifetime. While asphalt shingles don’t last as long as a metal or tile roof, they remain a popular and affordable standard in the roofing industry.\nWhat Are the Best Asphalt Shingles?\nQuality is very important when it comes to asphalt shingles. Please read over the following list of recommended shingles to learn more about high-quality asphalt shingles.\n- GAF Marquis WeatherMax shingles.\n- CertainTeed XT 25.\n- Owens Corning Supreme AR.\n- Tamko Heritage Vintage.\nWhile these shingles are certainly highly recommended, your local professional roofer will likely have some exceptional selections for you to choose from. You should be a discerning consumer and learn about your roofing material before it gets installed on your roof.\nWhat is the Difference Between Architectural Shingles and Asphalt Shingles?\nAre you wondering what the difference is between architectural shingles and asphalt shingles? If so, you are not alone. Many people look at shingles and wonder what the differences are. Please allow this distinction to be made here. Three-tab shingles have one shingle tab size and shape that consists of three separate tabs that are twelve inches wide. These tabs are coated with asphalt in order to shed water. Architectural shingles are characterized as laminate or dimensional. They come in different sizes and shapes and are considered a premium roofing product.\nHow Long Do 30-Year Architectural Shingles Really Last?\nWhile 30-year architectural shingles have a defining title, it is important to consider roofing maintenance and the prevailing climate and weather patterns of your area. According to leading resources online, the expected service life of a thirty-year product is approximately twenty-five years. Of course, the best way to find out the current condition of your roof is to consult with a professional, insured\nAre Asphalt Shingles Energy Efficient\nIf you are looking for energy-efficient roofing material, you may want to pass over asphalt shingles. This is because even in a lighter color, asphalt shingles do not perform well in comparison with other roofing materials in the industry. Asphalt shingles are very good at absorbing heat and are poor at reflecting it.\nWill Asphalt Shingles Seal in Cold Weather\nIf shingles are installed in cold weather, they will not immediately seal until warmer temperatures are present. The sealant will need to activate. If temperatures are at or below forty degrees Fahrenheit, it will impact the sealant. Your professional roofing contractor will have experience with shingle installations and will have some thoughts about installing shingles in different weather patterns and temperatures.\nWho Invented Asphalt Shingles\nAre you wondering who invented asphalt shingles? In terms of revolutionary inventions, asphalt shingles are a modern marvel. The official inventor of asphalt shingles is American Henry Reynolds. Henry Reynolds hailed from Grand Rapids, Michigan. The asphalt shingles he produced first were used in 1903. Asphalt shingles were generally used in America by 1911. Asphalt shingles were so successful that by 1939 eleven million squares of shingles were being produced. Since then, asphalt shingles have come to revolutionize and dominate the roofing industry in North America.\nWhy Do Asphalt Shingles Curl\nAre your asphalt shingles curling? If so, you will need to contact a professional roofing contractor. That is because you could have a problem with inadequate venting. The air that is taken in your roof is displaced through higher parts of your roof. Without proper venting moisture and heat could become trapped in your attic. The heat that is added additionally to the bottom side of your shingles can cause them to wear prematurely. They will fade and curl.\nIf you would like to discuss your asphalt shingles in Baltimore, MD, our team is here to assist.

{"question":"How do material consumption patterns compare between global development and urban sprawl regions in terms of their environmental impact?","answer":"Both global development and urban sprawl show concerning patterns of increased resource consumption with negative environmental impacts. According to global data, raw material use rose during the 20th century at about twice the rate of population growth, with every 1% GDP increase corresponding to a 0.4% rise in raw material use. This has led to environmental issues like habitat destruction and biodiversity loss. Similarly, in urban sprawl areas, resource consumption is amplified through increased automobile dependency - for example, Atlanta, with a high sprawl index of 57.7, shows significantly higher resource consumption through vehicle emissions, producing billions more pounds of carbon monoxide annually than less sprawled cities like Philadelphia (sprawl index 112.6), despite having a smaller population. Both patterns demonstrate unsustainable resource use that threatens environmental quality.","context":["Sustainable Materials Management Basics\nOn this page:\n- What is Sustainable Materials Management?\n- A Life Cycle Perspective\n- Sustainable Materials Management Program Strategic Plan\nWhat is Sustainable Materials Management?\nSustainable materials management (SMM) is a systemic approach to using and reusing materials more productively over their entire life cycles. It represents a change in how our society thinks about the use of natural resources and environmental protection. By examining how materials are used throughout their life cycle, an SMM approach seeks to:\n- Use materials in the most productive way with an emphasis on using less.\n- Reduce toxic chemicals and environmental impacts throughout the material life cycle.\n- Assure we have sufficient resources to meet today’s needs and those of the future.\nHow our society uses materials is fundamental to our economic and environmental future. Global competition for finite resources will intensify as world population and economies grow. More productive and less impactful use of materials helps our society remain economically competitive, contributes to our prosperity and protects the environment in a resource-constrained future.\nU.S. and global consumption of materials increased rapidly during the last century. According to the Annex to the G7 Leaders’ June 8, 2015 Declaration, global raw material use rose during the 20th century at about twice the rate of population growth. For every 1 percent increase in gross domestic product, raw material use has risen by 0.4 percent. This increasing consumption has come at a cost to the environment, including habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, overly stressed fisheries and desertification. Materials management is also associated with an estimated 42 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to find more productive and sustainable ways to extract, use and manage materials, and change the relationship between material consumption and growth, has grave implications for our economy and society.\nSustainable Material Management’s Life-cycle Perspective\nBy looking at a product's entire life cycle—from materials extraction to end-of-life management—we can find new opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, conserve resources, and reduce costs. For example, a product may be re-designed so it is manufactured using different, fewer, less toxic and more durable materials. It is designed so that at the end of its useful life it can be readily disassembled. The product’s manufacturer maintains a relationship with its customers to ensure best use of the product, its maintenance and return at end-of-life. This helps the manufacturer identify changing needs of their customers, create customer loyalty, and reduce material supply risk. Further, the manufacturer has a similar relationship with its suppliers, which helps the manufacturer respond more quickly to changing demands, including reducing environmental impacts along the supply chain.\nLearn more about the potential benefits of a lifecycle approach to materials management in Sustainable Materials Management: The Road Ahead\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a technique to make more informed decisions through a better understanding of the human health and environmental impacts of products, processes, and activities. This can include an evaluation of the air, water, land, and energy consequences of a product or process, and possible alternatives.

The following three strategic priority areas chosen as the focus for EPA’s future SMM efforts present significant opportunities to achieve environmental, economic and social results:\n- The Built Environment -conserve materials and develop community resiliency to climate change through improvements to construction, maintenance, and end-of-life management of our nation’s roads, buildings, and infrastructure\n- Sustainable Food Management -focus on reducing food loss and waste and\n- Sustainable Packaging -increase the quantity and quality of materials recovered from municipal solid waste and develop critically important collection and processing infrastructure.\nIn addition to these strategic priorities, EPA will continue work in other SMM emphasis areas, including sustainable electronics management, measurement, life cycle assessment and international SMM efforts.","Presentation on theme: \"Hazardous to our Health: The Effects of Urban Sprawl on the Environment and its Inhabitants Erin Anderson-Ruddon Kayla Arslanian.\"— Presentation transcript:\nHazardous to our Health: The Effects of Urban Sprawl on the Environment and its Inhabitants Erin Anderson-Ruddon Kayla Arslanian\nHazardous to our Health: The Effects of Urban Sprawl on the Environment and its Inhabitants Sprawl has four dimensions: a population that is widely dispersed in low density development, rigidly separated homes, shops and workplaces, a network of roads marked by huge blocks and poor access, and a general lack of well-defined thriving activity centers or downtowns (Ewing, Pendall, and Chen 2002). We hypothesize that urban sprawl is harmful to the environment and that the environmental degradation suffered increases health risks in these areas of sprawl.\nUrban Sprawl & Air Pollution Air quality is greatly affected by sprawl. Motor vehicles are the leading source of air pollution. In areas of sprawl, destinations are far apart, creating a dependence on automobiles to get from destination to destination. The need to make more car trips increases the average person’s daily miles driven.\nAir Pollution & The Sprawl Index The sprawl index categorizes areas according to their level of sprawl. A standard deviation of 50 separates a high area of sprawl, from an average area of sprawl, from a low area of sprawl (Sturm and Cohen 2004). For example, Atlanta, GA, an area of very high sprawl has an index of 57.7 whereas Chicago, IL, a denser city has an index of 121.2. For every 50 unit decrease in standard deviation on the sprawl index (more sprawling), there is a 1.96 miles/day increase in driving per person. For every 25 unit increase in standard deviation on the sprawl index (less sprawling), there is a 5.4 miles/day decrease in driving per person. This shows that people in more sprawling areas drive longer distances, more often than those living in areas of relatively low sprawl.\nAutomobiles & Air Pollution Because inhabitants in areas of great sprawl have to drive longer distances more frequently, they burn more fuel than persons living in areas of lesser sprawl. The advent of sprawl could threaten the current positive trend of cleaner air.\nAutomobiles & Air Pollution Automobiles account for: 30% of all oxides of nitrogen (any gaseous form of nitrogen) emitted into the air. 30% of all hydrocarbon emissions. The main component of fossil fuels, hydrocarbons combust when fuel is burned, releasing chemicals such as methane and benzene into the atmosphere. Benzene is a known carcinogen. 32% of all carbon emissions.\nAutomobiles & Air Pollution Automobiles account for: 30% of all oxides of nitrogen (any gaseous for of nitrogen) emitted into the air. 30% of all hydrocarbon emissions. The main component of fossil fuels, hydrocarbons combust when fuel is burned, releasing chemicals such as methane and benzene into the atmosphere. Benzene is a known carcinogen. 32% of all carbon emissions. In areas where sprawl is high, cars account for a greater number of these pollutants. For example, in Atlanta, vehicles account for 58% of all nitrogen oxides and 47% of all hydrocarbon emissions (Frumkin, 2002).\nUrban Sprawl & Ozone Sprawl affects a region’s ozone levels. Ozone is a photochemical smog created then organic gases (specifically VOCs, nitrogen oxides, heat and sunlight interact (Goldman 2001)). Though ozone is necessary in the stratosphere to protect earth from the sun’s UV rays, in the troposphere it degrades air quality, and is considered a pollutant. Currently, over 90 metropolitan areas regularly exceed ozone standards. The EPA attributes 50% of smog precursors to motor vehicles (Benfield, Raimi and Chen 1999).\nUrban Sprawl & Ozone Land use patterns affect levels of ozone. In sprawling environments, individuals release more VOCs and nitrogen dioxides into the atmosphere, both of which are components of ozone. Table 1: Average daily VOC and NOx emission rate for compact and disperse cities (Borrego, Martins, and Tchepel et al 2006).\nSprawl Index & Ozone Every 25 unit increase in the sprawl index (less sprawling) relates to a 7.5 parts per billion decrease in maximum ozone levels. Ozone levels between the most sprawling regions and the least sprawling regions differ by 41 parts per billion (Ewing, Pendall, and Chen 2002).\nUrban Sprawl & Ozone Urban sprawl not only contributes to higher ozone levels, but ozone also covers more area in sprawling regions: Figure 2: Ozone concentrations (relative to background ozone levels) at 2pm in alternate city structures (Borrego, Martins, and Tchepel et al 2006).\nUrban Sprawl & Ozone Ozone affects more people in areas of greater sprawl: Table 2: Population affected by ozone concentrations (Borrego, Martins, and Tchepel et al 2006). Again, because individuals living in sprawl produce more VOCs and nitrogen oxides daily, as a result their ozone levels are higher, cover more area, and affect more people than compact cities. This is because individuals in compact cities produce less VOCs and nitrogen oxides. Thus, their ozone levels, area and population affected by ozone are not as greatly impacted by ozone pollution.\nCarbon Monoxide Analysis Sprawling regions also emit an alarmingly large amount of carbon monoxide. Combining demographic information and data collected on how much carbon monoxide an average car emits, we can see how dangerous sprawl is for air quality. The EPA estimates that the average car annually produces 22g CO for every 12,500 miles driven (EPA, 1997). This means that the average car produces.00176g CO for every mile driven (22g CO/12,500).\nCarbon Monoxide Analysis It is also recorded the average person in the Atlanta metropolitan area travels 34.1 miles/day, whereas the average person in the Philadelphia metro area dives 16.9 miles a day, and the average Chicago metro inhabitant dives 19.9 miles per day (Frumkin, 2002). On the sprawl index, Atlanta’s score is has a 57.7 (very sprawly), Philadelphia’s is 112.6 (average sprawl), and Chicago’s is 121.2 (higher sprawl).\nThe Atlanta metro area has nearly two million less people then the Philadelphia metro area, yet Atlanta emits around two billion more pounds of carbon monoxide yearly. Chicago’s metro area has twice the population of the Atlanta metro area, and Atlanta still produces more than one billion pounds of carbon per year. The differences seen are attributed to sprawl: individuals living in sprawl drive more frequently and drive than those living elsewhere, and the impact this car dependency has on the environment will be detrimental.\nWater Pollution Urban development in watersheds (an area drained by a river or some other body of water) can greatly alter the composition of a river, which can in turn affect water quality This section focuses on two watersheds—the Schuylkill watershed and the Waquoit Bay watershed—and examines how sprawl impacts these two bodies of water.\nSchuylkill River, PA The Schuylkill River has some of the highest dissolved solute concentrations of all water sources in the northeast—it has the highest nitrate levels and the second highest chloride levels (Interlandi and Crockett 2003). The Schuylkill also had the fastest increase for nitrate, chloride and residuals over all other watersheds in the northeast (Interlandi and Crockett 2003). This suggests that development in the Schuylkill watershed negatively impacts the river.\nSchuylkill River, PA From 1982 to 1997, developed land in the Schuylkill watershed increased from 21.5% of the total watershed land area to 28.5%—over 34,000 hectares of forest and agricultural land were urbanized. This change in land use resulted in a 31% increase in developed land. When sprawling occurred in the watershed and developed land increased by 31%, chloride levels increased 37% in that same time period (Interlandi and Crockett 2003).\nWaquoit Bay, MA The Waquoit Bay is located in Cape Cod, MA, and like the Schuylkill watershed, the Waquoit Bay watershed has seen a recent burst in urban development. The predominant source of nitrogen in the water comes from atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use and wastewater disposal. in the 1980s, the major source of nitrogen changed from atmospheric deposition to wastewater, reflecting the increase in urbanization in the Waquoit watershed (Bowen and Valiela, 2001).\nWaquoit Bay Between 1938 and 1990, when most urbanization occurred in the area, nitrogen inputs into the Waquoit bay watershed increased twofold (Bowen and Valiela, 2001). In 1990, wastewater accounted for 22% of the bay’s total nitrogen delivery, whereas in the mid-century, it only accounted for 2%. Thus, nitrogen from wastewater increased ten-fold during the period of urban sprawl in the watershed.\nHealth Hazards of Sprawl The harmful effects that sprawl has on air and water quality have implications for human health. AIR Nitrogen oxides can react with numerous compounds to form acid and other particles Particles can inflict damage to lung tissue which can cause or worsen respiratory diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis\nHealth Hazards of Sprawl - Air VOCs release hydrocarbons, some of which are carcinogenic Carbon monoxide affects the central nervous system, causing visual problems, reduced ability to work or learn, and difficulty performing tasks At extremely high levels, carbon monoxide is poisonous and can cause death (EPA, 2006).\nWater Related Hazards Nitrogen Through water pollution, increased nitrates in the water can cause methmeglobenemia in infants under six months. Blue baby syndrome because the hemoglobin goes from being ferrous to ferric (FE 2 + to FE 3 + ). This is an oxidizing reaction—thus, the hemoglobin’s ability to carry oxygen is lowered, making the infants blue. This syndrome is potentially fatal\nWater Related Hazards Storm runoff currently 5,529 water bodes in the US are impaired by pathogens (Gaffield, Goo, Richards et al 2003). The insecticides in runoff that infect water have carcinogenic effects in humans. The amount of disinfectant (such as chlorine) can also have a carcinogenic effect. The EPA estimates that ingestion of drinking water with disinfectant byproducts is responsible for 1100-93000 cases of bladder cancer each year (Gaffield, Goo and Richards et al 2003).\n(Gaffield, Goo and Richards et al 2003). Impaired Water Bodies in the USA\nGeneral Health Hazards Sprawl categorically makes people less healthy. The overall sprawl index significantly predicts the number of chronic medical conditions and of physical health-related quality of life of the residents in the area. Greensboro, NC San Fran, CA 46.8 148.6 190 181 46.8 44.2 1.35 1.14\nSprawl Index (Abridged) As a region’s sprawl index increases by 25 points, the number of residents suffering from various chronic conditions decreases (Sturm and Cohen 2004). Sprawl Score5075100125150 Arthritis291274259243228 Trouble Breathing 6459544945 Abdominal/Diges tive Problems 9285797368 Migraine/Chroni c Headaches 145137130123116 Urinary Tract Issues 6660545945\nCONCLUSION America will undoubtedly continue to develop, thus, action must be taken to ensure that further development is not hazardous to the environment and to its inhabitants. It is necessary that that future designs must be eco-friendly, and moreover, must consider the health of its residents.\nWorks Cited: An Introduction to Indoor Air Quality: Organic Gases (Volatile Organic Compounds - VOCs).

{"question":"How do air purifiers improve indoor air quality through their filtering mechanisms, and what potential health concerns should users be aware of when operating them alongside humidifiers?","answer":"Air purifiers improve indoor air quality by circulating air through filters that trap air-borne pollutants like smoke, dust, and pollen. HEPA filters specifically can remove 99.97% of particles larger than 3 microns. However, when operating alongside humidifiers, users should be aware that humidifiers can encourage the presence of microscopic organisms including mold, bacteria, minerals and allergens. Studies by the EPA and CPSC found that humidifiers, especially ultrasonic and impeller types, can emit harmful particles into the air. To minimize health risks, humidifiers should only be used when necessary, with distilled or demineralized water, and cleaned regularly.","context":["Page Table of Contents\nWhich One Do You Exactly Need?\nWhether you’re fighting allergies or not, one thing is clear: we all want and need a fresher air in our homes. Despite of what one may think, the pollutants aren’t just outside, but inside our home too.\nUsing home devices that clear up the air or suck in moisture should be on your essential list next time you go shopping. Once you get there, you may find yourself in a pickle. Should you get an air purifier or a humidifier? Do you also need a dehumidifier?\nWhen we take a look at the air purifiers and dehumidifiers, we realize that they’re both made to reduce allergens in a room, making it more comfortable for anyone dealing with asthma and allergies.\nIn the case of air purifier, the device circulates air through a filter, trapping air-born pollutants and irritants (smoke, dust, and pollen). The dehumidifier is good for reducing the humidity levels in the air as it sucks in moisture. This way, it’s able to kill mold and microbes that attract moisture.\nThe air purifier is able to circulate air through a filter, eliminating the air borne pollutants, which a dehumidifier cannot do. Furthermore, the air purifier may reduce the risk for mold developing, removing the spores from the air. As it’s not able to control humidity in your home, chances are the mold is going to come back if there’s too much moisture. This why you should also use a dehumidifier as it’s the only device able to eliminate excessive moisture from your home. Even if it’s not going to clear or filter air, it’s still going to help eliminate specific allergens. A dehumidifier is going to keep dust mites and mold at bay as they thrive in humid environment. Once the humidity levels drop to more than 50%, most allergens are going to die.\nOn the other hand, humidifiers are designed to add water to indoor air, increasing the relative humidity of your home. For instance, during cold season, the dry air is going to lead to chapped skin or various respiratory issues. You may add moisture to the air with a humidifier, reducing the dryness of your skin and alleviating breathing problems. Once you add humidity to the indoor air is going to lower the static electricity and reduce the risk for your wooden furniture to crack.\nIn a nutshell, if you like a fresher air in your home, the air purifier is the best way to get it. Most unpleasant smells in a home are caused by pets, smokers or other factors and a good air purifier is going to eliminate the smells from your home. You should also use one if someone in your family is struggling with asthma or allergies, as some types or air purifiers are able to eliminate the allergens floating in the air.\nWhen there’s too much moisture in your home, the dehumidifier is the best choice and it can work just fine along with an air purifier. If you want to add more moisture as the air is too dry, the humidifier is going to be the best new addition to your home.\nThe air purifier is designed for circulating and filtering air. It’s able to trap dust, smoke and various allergens, leading to a fresher and healthier air in your home. You should use one no matter if you’re dealing with asthma or allergies as breathing a cleaner air is good for everyone’s lungs.\nThe dehumidifier is made to lower the moisture content in the surrounding area. You should use one if the humidity level is higher than 50%. This type of device isn’t filtering air per se, but it reduces the development of mold and dust mites, which may cause allergic reactions in the first place. Therefore, a dehumidifier is good to have for a healthier environment- just as long as the humidity level is higher than 50%.\nIf we take a look at the variety, we notice that there are several types for both the air filters and the dehumidifiers. You should do due diligence and seek the best model that fits your needs. Even if the main purpose is the same, the way they get it is different and the efficiency may vary too.\nYou should get an air purifier if you have someone in the family struggling with allergies or asthma. Get one if you simply want a fresher air inside your home.\nGet a dehumidifier when you have to reduce the allergic reactions caused by mold, mildew and dust mites or there’s too much moisture in your home. Either way, we all want to breath a fresher and healthier air any given day.\nWhen it comes to babies, we all know that they’re the most precious human beings in the world so keeping them safe and sound is fundamental for all of us. No matter which type of parent you are, we all have to agree that we’re thinking of their best interest. Using an air purifier or a humidifier is on that list, but does our baby really needs it? Does he needs both? Can you use both? Let’s take a closer look and see if we can get to a conclusion.\n- Does your baby need an air purifier?\nNo matter the type of air purifier you’re deciding to go with, the main purpose is the same: filtering the air and giving you a fresher and healthier air. There are plenty of air pollutants out there that aren’t good for anyone, baby or not.\nMany of the pollutants are difficult to avoid and quite common. You’re going to find particulate matter like dust in any home. The effects are pretty unpleasant: nausea, dizziness, sinuses and you want your baby away from that.\nA good quality air purifier is going to be able to remove most of the small particles from the air and you should get one in your home. You should focus on removing pet dander (if you have any pet), dust and various irritants. If you’ve just renovated your home, get an air purifier that is better for removing gaseous pollutants.\nIf you’re really stressed out about the airborne irritants, you need to get an air purifier with a pre-filter and a HEPA filter too. The HEPA filters trap the small airborne allergens, the main cause for scratchy throats, itchy noses and headaches. Add an activated carbon filter if you’re also dealing with pervasive odor in your baby’s room.\n- Should you also use a humidifier?\nWhen it comes to the moisture level in a room, an air purifier has no ability whatsoever. If the humidity in your home is just fine, you shouldn’t worry about it all\nHowever, when the humidity is too low (this is a common situation during the colder season), a humidifier is the best solution. Luckily for all of us, the air purifier isn’t able to remove any moisture from the air, so it’s never going to make the air dryer than it is.\nA humidifier is going to add the moisture the nursery’s air really needs. When the humidity is too low, your baby may develop reactions similar to those caused by airborne particles. Get a digital hygrometer to check the air’s humidity in your home. A normal level should be ranging between 30% and 50%. Should it be lower than that, get a humidifier and pay attention to your baby. If the reactions don’t disappear, chances are you’re also going to need an air purifier.\n- Can you use both in your baby’s nursery?\nThe air purifier works just fine along with a humidifier and either of them is going to reduce the performance of the other one. You can use them for cleaning the air and adding moisture to the nursery air.\nRemember to take good care of them so they don’t lose their efficiency. Clean the humidifier on a regular basis and change the HEPA filters on the air purifier every six months or so.\nBoth air purifiers and ionizers are made to eliminate various contaminants from your house. The filtration air purifier simply uses a different air-cleaning technology than the one used by ionizer. Let’s see the details for a better understanding.\n- How does a filtration air purifier work?\nIn the case of mechanical filtration purifiers, the air is passed through a filter material which is going to trap allergens and pollutants (smoke, animal dander, dust, pollen). The HEPA filters are able to remove no less than 99.97% of particles larger than 3 microns. When a filter isn’t true HEPA, it may still trap pet dander and dust, allowing smaller particles (pollen and spores) get through. There are air purifiers that also use an activated carbon filter which is removing some of the odors and gaseous pollutants.\n- Are ionizers different in any way?\nIonizers are going to release negatively charged ions into the air and they’re going to share the charge to pollutant particles. Soon enough the particles are going to stick to each other/to various objects in the room, settling out of the air.\nIonizers are efficient for removing small particles (bacteria is one good example) from the air, but they’re not as effective as mechanical filters when it comes to trapping larger particles (dust, dander). This is why ionizers aren’t the best option for anyone struggling with allergies or asthma.\n- What are their limitations?\nAir purifiers are good for eliminating air borne contaminants and the models based on mechanical filter/electrostatic precipitators are going to purify the air that passes through the unit. Some of the allergens and pollutants are going to settle out of the air and onto the surfaces in the house, thus avoiding the purifier and remaining in the room.\nIn addition, ionizers and electrostatic purifiers produce ozone which irritates the lungs and aggravates the symptoms in asthma and other respiratory conditions.\nEven though the both devices clean the air from impurities, they do use different methods for clearing out the air. The more you know about each of them, the easier is going to be for you to decide which type of device you need for your home.\n- No filter vs. filter\nAn ionizer is sending out electrically charged ions that attach to the impurities. Once they’re attached, the particles are going to be too heavy to still remain in the air so they’re going to fall onto the floor. Some ionizers come with a collection plate so the particles are going to be attracted to it. You’re going to have to clean the plate later on.\nThe HEPA air purifier is going to suck air into it, through a very fine and dense physical filter which is able to trap airborne contaminants. The device is giving back fresher air into the room. When it’s on, the device is going to constantly repeat the whole process, eliminating contaminants from the house.\nThe HEPA air purifiers manage to actually trap the airborne contaminants, which is something that ionizer simply cannot do. In addition, in the case of the ionizer, the particles may be kicked back up into the air as you’re walking through the room. It’s a never-ending cycle of impurities that are removed from the air, coming back later on. The collection plates may help, but they’re not making ionizer perfect.\n- Design and style options\nUnfortunately, when it comes to design and style options, the ionizers definitely lose the fight. Most of the models out there are vertical units and thin, which makes them easy to place in corners. There are also compact, small and square which are even easier to place.\nIonizers do have a modern appearance and even futuristic at times. They’re made to sit on the ground/table so finding a wall mountable model is pretty much impossible.\nOn the other hand, HEPA air purifiers come in various shapes and sizes. Finding a model that matches the décor of your room is not challenging at all and you may also go with a wall mountable model.\nThe variety of colors and styles is another winning point for the HEPA air purifiers. It’s never going to be difficult to find one that doesn’t just do what you need, but also looks the way you like. This is something you’re not going to get from an ionizers and you should settle with the functionality, most of the time.\n- The coverage area\nThe big downside for the air purifiers that use HEPA filter is the area that they can cover, which is smaller than the one of ionizer. Even the largest air purifier with HEPA filter isn’t going to be able to cover a large business space.\nA regular ionizer is able to purify an air space up to 3,500sq.ft., which is huge. No air purifier with HEPA filter is going to be able to cover that kind of space completely on its own.\n- The costs\nWhat you pay is what you get and you do need to open up your wallet when getting a HEPA air purifier. Having said that, most HEPA air purifiers out there are more expensive than most ionizers.\nEven the cheapest HEPA air purifier is going to cost three times more than a regular ionizer. Make sure that the HEPA air purifier is what your home really needs.\nAs if the initial cost wasn’t enough of a spending, taking care of a HEPA device is going to cost you more too. As it uses a physical filter, you’re going to have to replace it on a regular basis, so that it doesn’t lose its efficiency.\nApart from the models that come with a collection plate, ionizers don’t need a physical filter so the maintenance costs are really low. Even in the case of models with collection plates, you’re still going to pay less as the plates are washable and reusable.\n- The conclusion\nMake sure you give a good thought about your needs and take a look at your wallet as well. It’s not all the time that you definitely need a HEPA air purifier in your home, so give it a thorough thought. If no one in your family is having allergic reactions or asthma, an ionizer may keep the air in your home healthy and clean enough. At the same time, don’t hesitate to spend the extra buck for the HEPA air purifier when the health of your loved ones is at stake.","As global concerns around air quality grow, it’s not surprising that people want to know how best to keep their indoor air clean and their loved ones safe.\nThere is quite a broad and diverse range of devices available on the market today, all of which aim to help improve air quality in your home or office. Humidifiers and air purifiers are two devices specifically designed to enhance breathing spaces.\nCan you use a humidifier and air purifier in the same room? Yes, you can safely and effectively use a humidifier and an air purifier at the same time and even in the same room without any major issues. While one affects the level of moisture in the air, the other affects the quality of the air.\nIn this article, we will explain the roles of each and what options might be best for you and your specific needs.\nWhat Does a Humidifier Do?\nIf you’ve ever lived near the coast or traveled around South East Asia during the summer months, you are probably no stranger to humidity.\nEven if you have never experienced such extremely high levels of humidity, you are still probably familiar with that balmy, uncomfortable feeling that you sometimes get in the summer.\nHumidity is merely the amount of moisture in the air. While humid conditions can be quite uncomfortable, the absence of moisture can be equally so.\nIn the winter months, as it gets colder, the air tends to get drier. This, along with factors such as indoor-heating and reduced ventilation, can leave your house with very low moisture levels (source).\nThis aridity is where a humidifier comes into play. This device helps to dispel dry air by adding moisture to a room.\nSo if you do find that the air in your home gets too dry, then you may consider investing in a humidifier.\nHumidifiers and Health Benefits\nHumidifiers have a number of health benefits that can counter the adverse reactions brought on by dry air.\nA lack of moisture in the air invariably leads to a lack of moisture in your body, which can cause symptoms such as a sore, scratchy throat, nose bleeds, and itchy eyes.\nHumidifiers can help keep airways in the body functioning correctly. When our airways dry out, their functions are compromised, as the mucus membranes need to remain moist.\nA decline in moisture can affect both the hair and the skin. As our skin is over 60% water and needs to absorb moisture from the air, excessive aridity can cause the skin to crack and hair follicles to break (source).\nIn addition to helping keep our airways moist and our skin hydrated, humidifiers can aid with the following conditions:\n- Sinus-related issues such as congestion and runny nose.\n- Dry skin and itching.\n- Allergy-related symptoms: hay fever, sneezing, & itchy sinus passages.\n- Nose bleeds caused by dry air.\n- Sore and dry throat.\n- Ease the symptoms of colds and flu.\nHow Do I Know if I Need a Humidifier?\nYour decision to invest in a humidifier or not will depend on the humidity levels in your home, as well as your body’s response to moisture decline.\nThe EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) recommends that you keep the humidity levels between 30%-50% (source).\nIf you live in a frigid, dry area, you may struggle to maintain this level of moisture without a humidifier, especially in the winter months.\nOne way of checking the humidity levels in your home is to buy a hygrometer, which is a specially-designed device for measuring the moisture in a room (source).\nSome humidifiers come with a built-in hygrometer. A hygrometer is something to look out for when purchasing a humidifier because you don’t want to let a room get too humid. High humidity can cause problems such as mold, bacteria, and dampness.\nOn a separate note, if you do have problems with high humidity levels, you can look into a dehumidifier, which reduces moisture.\nIf you don’t feel the need to invest in a hygrometer, then you can look out for other signs. The presence of static electricity and peeling wallpaper are both indications that the humidity levels in your home may be too low.\nHumidifiers and Health Concerns\nBoth the EPA and the CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) have conducted studies on the health concerns of humidifiers.\nAs humidifiers do increase moisture in a room, they can also encourage the presence of microscopic organisms, which include things such as mold, bacteria, minerals, and allergens.\nThe EPA and CPSC have found that while all types of humidifiers have the potential to emit harmful particles into the air, two kinds of humidifiers are more likely to do so: namely, the ultrasonic humidifier and impeller humidifier.\nUltrasonic humidifiers generate a mist by releasing ultrasonic sound vibrations. While impeller humidifiers, also known as “cool mist” humidifiers, create a cool mist utilizing fast rotating disks.\nThese humidifiers are more of a risk because of how they create the “cool mist.” The mechanisms essentially pound the water into mist. However, these same mechanisms cannot discern between water and particles such as minerals, mold, and bacteria (source).\nWhile the water is aerosolized to create a fine mist that we breathe in, so are the harmful pollutants, resulting in potential respiratory problems.\nIf you do own a humidifier, you may have noticed a fine white powder in your home. The minerals in the water cause this, and that’s why it’s important to be mindful of the water you are using in your humidifier.\nIf you are concerned about the risks of running a humidifier in your home, there are a few things that you can do to help ensure that you don’t experience any health problems.\n- Only use your humidifier when absolutely necessary\n- Do this by keeping a watchful eye on the humidity levels in the room\n- Try to only use distilled and demineralized water in your humidifier\n- Boiled water is also safer than plain tap water\n- Change the water in your humidifier frequently\n- Clean your humidifier twice a week with natural detergents\n- Use the manufacturer’s guide to install and maintain the device\nWhat Does an Air Purifier Do?\nUnlike humidifiers, which control the level of moisture in the air, an air purifier controls the quality of the air. They can clean the air of any unwanted substances that may be polluting your home.\nThey work in two ways, either by purifying the air through the use of a filter system or by using another method such as ionization, UV, or ozone (source).\nAir purifiers help to eliminate contagions such as mold, dust, spores, and other harmful particles that are circulating in the air. Purifiers that use filter systems simply filter the pollutants out while the methods are a bit more complicated.\nDo I Need an Air Purifier?\nThere are several reasons you may wish to invest in an air purifier. One reason may be that you have a high level of pollutants in your home.\nOther reasons you may be considering an air purifier is if you have indoor pets, if your house is poorly ventilated, or if you are in the vicinity of paints/chemicals.\nIt’s important to remember that the reach of an air purifier does not extend further than the space in which you place them. Hence, it’s a good idea to consider several units throughout the house or to place them strategically in the common areas.\nHumidifier or Air Purifier: Do I Have to Choose?\nAs you can have a humidifier and an air purifier working in the same room at the same time, you don’t really have to make the hard choice. However, it may be prudent to consider whether you need them both.\nUnlike humidifiers, air purifiers can be used all year round. It is only when the air in your home is dry that you really need a humidifier.\nHowever, based on the potential health risks of having a humidifier, the addition of an air purifier may help to ensure that the humidified air gets cleaner and any pollutants are removed.\nWhile they both have very different functions, they make quite a good team. Air purifiers filter the humidified air and can help to remove the aerosolized pollutants that were released by the humidifier.\nWhat Type of Humidifier Do I Need?\nIf you’ve decided in favor of a humidifier, here are the options available to you. We can largely divide these into two categories: central humidifiers and console/portable humidifiers.\nA central humidifier system is a fancier and pricier option. It is very convenient as HVAC technicians build these into your home’s central system.\nAs such, you can have total control over the humidity level in your home without worrying about separate units for each room. They also pose a lower risk of harmful contaminants such as molds and also require less cleaning (source).\nConsol and Portable Humidifiers\nConsol and portable humidifiers are a more practical option if the cost is an issue for you. Unlike a central system, console and portable humidifiers require that you move them around from room to room.\nThey can be cumbersome if they are large; however, with a portable humidifier, you don’t have to worry about humidity levels in a room where you don’t want any extra humidity, such as the bathroom.\nYou can break the types of humidifiers down even further into four sub-categories.\nThis system works by pushing air through a wet filter or belt. People in the market for a humidifier frequently seek out this model because they are more affordable.\nEvaporators are only available as consol/portable models and so have to be moved from room to room.\nAs discussed, this humidifier produces a “cool mist” by rotating disks. Like the evaporator models, impeller humidifiers are popular because they are reasonably priced.\nImpeller humidifiers come as console/portables, and you can also use them in a single room at a time.\nThis humidifier system uses electricity to generate steam, which then cools down before it dispels it into the air. These humidifiers are affordable and run a low chance of producing mold.\nYou should always use stem humidifiers, if bought as a portable or console device, with caution. The hot water inside, which makes the steam, can be dangerous for pets and small children (source).\nAlso, because it uses steam, it runs the risk of over-humidifying a room and requires more frequent cleaning.\nThis humidifier generates a cool mist through ultrasonic sound waves. They are affordable and safe for households with pets and children.\nHowever, they do require frequent cleaning and run a higher risk of dispersing pollutants into the air.\nAll of these humidifier options have their pros and cons. It really depends on your budget, time, and household situation.\nIf you’d like to know more about humidifiers in today’s market, Consumer Reports has put together a convenient guide to buying a humidifier.\nWhat Type of Air Purifier Do I Need?\nIf you live in an area with high humidity and do not require a humidifier, then you may only want to invest in an air purifier.\nIn addition to the two main methods of air purification, there are five other models available on the market today.\nFilter Air Purifier\nFilter air purifiers use HEPA filter technology. HEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particulate Air filters. The standards define these filters by their ability to filter out 99.97% of particles bigger than 0.3 microns (source).\nThe filter can last up to 4 years before you have to replace it, and it is a very effective air purifying system. However, it is quite heavy on energy.\nIf you are interested in the various types of air filters and their abilities, you may like to read about the benefits of a MERV 8 filter.\nCarbon Air Purifier\nA carbon air purifier uses a carbon filter to purify the air, and activated carbon has a long history of use for purification purposes.\nCarbon filters do their best work when it comes to foul odors, cigarette smoke, and unfavorable gases. The downside of the carbon air filter is that they aren’t very effective at filtering out allergens and other microorganisms.\nIonic Air Purifier\nThe ionic method of air purification is a bit more scientific. It involves a negatively charged ion that uses a kind of magnetism to attract particles such as dust and spores (source).\nHowever, ionic air purification cannot eliminate germs or foul smells, and they run the risk of re-contaminating a room. As such, this method is a less effective method of air purification.\nOzone Air Purifier\nThe ozone air purifier method of air purification involves the production of a chemical called ozone. Ozone air purifiers are very good at removing odors.\nHowever there is some debate around the safety of ozone air purifiers as ozone, in large quantities, can be quite dangerous to human health.\nIt may cause adverse reactions such as coughing and also aggravates asthma. Some countries have even gone so far as to ban the use of ozone air purifiers (source).\nUltraviolet Light Air Purifier\nUV light works to kill bacteria and other germs. However, these air purifiers work best in conjunction with another method, preferably filter, as UV light cannot target odors or allergens.\nAir purifiers all have their strengths and weaknesses. It really just depends on what you are looking for and what kinds of pollutants you want to target.\nIf you’d like to see which air purifiers are available on the market right now, Consumer Reports has made a list of the Best and Worst Air Purifiers of 2020.\nHumidifier/Air Purifier Combos\nSince the demand for humidifiers and air purifiers has grown, a recent development on the market has been a humidifier/air purifier combo device. If you are looking to invest in both, then why not consider getting them in one convenient unit?\nChoosing to buy a combination system can help save on cost, space, and energy usage (source). It can also help ease respiratory issues and make your living space a lot more comfortable.\nOne further point in favor of the combination option is that their separate parts perform together cohesively.\nIf you do decide to have two separate units, you need to make sure that one doesn’t negatively impact the function of the other. For example, you wouldn’t want the air filter to get damp because it is too close to the humidifier.\nWhat Factors to Consider When Buying a Humidifier or an Air Purifier?\nWe’ve discussed the various options available on the market concerning the different kinds of humidifiers and air purifiers. Now let’s look at some of the factors to take into consideration before going out and buying one.\nAs with most things in life, the cost is often a significant factor. If you are looking to install both devices, then it may be a smart idea to invest in a combo system as it will most likely work out to be cheaper.\nYou also need to consider which devices use more energy. Air purifiers that use a HEPA system can draw quite a bit of power. Consider looking at energy-efficient models that will save you money in the long run.\nWe’ve discussed the health benefits and possible side effects of both humidifiers and air purifiers. In the end, it may be wise to forgo cost in terms of the healthy options for you and your family.\nNoise is a significant consideration, especially if you have a baby or small child who is sensitive to sound.\nMake sure that the system you decide to buy isn’t too noisy; white noise can be pleasant, but something that wakes up a sleeping baby is a definite no-no.\nAs with health, safety should be a priority. If you purchase a portable system, make sure that it is in a secure place and cannot be knocked over by an animal or child.\nAlso, be aware of factors, such as hot water, concerning humidifiers, and even electrical cable. Make sure you take all the proper precautions and ensure you install the units properly.\nWe are all busy, so you may not want to add another job to the already long list. It may be tempting to look for a machine that doesn’t require too much maintenance/cleaning.\nHowever, bear in mind that these machines do need regular cleaning to work correctly and not cause any adverse effects. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure that you clean the system frequently and adequately.\nAll units require frequent cleaning; however, you may be able to purchase a model that is easier to clean, thus saving you time.\nIf a central-system isn’t in your budget, you need to consider the kind of coverage that you will get from a console/portable device.\nThis means factoring in the size of the room as well as how many rooms in your house you think would require a humidifier and air purifier.\nHumidifiers and air purifiers can work alone or together to improve the overall quality of the air inside your home.\nWhile they do work well as individuals, together, they can act to improve respiratory problems, eliminate harmful pollutants, and make your living space much more comfortable."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c12e3263-9acf-43e0-a390-627e72d3e942>","<urn:uuid:1c84f16c-b413-4947-b7e0-52afe24b3969>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which artist has more works on display: Bernini at the Borghese Gallery or Raphael at the Vatican Museums?","answer":"Bernini has more works on display, with at least 6 major pieces at the Borghese Gallery (including David, Apollo and Daphne, The Rape of Proserpina, and others), while at the Vatican Museums, Raphael is primarily known for his frescoes in the Raphael Rooms, with 'The School of Athens' being his most recognized work there.","context":["The Vatican Museums Tour\nBuon giorno! The A Road Retraveled Vatican Museums Tour continues with a visit to the Pinacoteca (art Gallery), Gallery of the Tapestries, Gallery of the Maps and the famous Raphael Rooms.\nIf you haven’t seen Part 1 yet, please CLICK HERE to watch part 1 of the Vatican Museums Tour.\nThe Vatican Pinacoteca (art Gallery) is rich in art with masterpieces by Giotto, Raphael, Caravaggio, Leondardo da Vinci, and many of history’s greatest artists. The collection that now takes up 18 rooms was established by Pope Pius VI, with a collection of only 116 pieces and it grew to 460 precious paintings through donations and purchases.\nThe museums also include the Gallery of the Tapestries. This is a collection of various 15th and 17th century Flemish tapestries inspired from drawings made by Raphael’s students depicting the life of Christ. They were first displayed in the Sistine Chapel in 1531, and then moved to this gallery in 1838. To preserve these aging tapestries the gallery is kept in near darkness and flash photography is not permitted.In the video you will see a special effect created on one of the Tapestries that gives you the feeling you are “being watched”. See for yourself!\nAmong favorite is the Gallery of the Maps…. 40 maps were frescoed on the walls depicting Italian regions and Papal territories as they were known in the late 1500’s when the maps were created. At the entrance you start with the boot of Italy and walk your way up to the Alps.\nIn the video you will see how the maps are grouped on both sides of the walls and the precious designs created by the artists. You will also see how the richly decorated ceiling different periods of the church’s history are represented in relation to the maps.\nThese are the Papal apartments chosen by Pope Julius II as his residence. The Pope commissioned Raphael and his school to fresco the rooms in 1508. They were finished in 1524.\nThe Raphael rooms consists of: The Constantine Room, The Room of Heliodorus, The Room of Segnatura, and Room of the Fire in the Borgo.\nIn the video you will learn about the amazing stories told in the frescoes in the rooms and purpose the Rooms held.\nThe most recognized fresco everyone comes to see is “The School of Athens” – 50 figures comprised of the 50 most famous thinkers and philosophers and their students are inside a Renaissance temple said to have been inspired by Bramante’s designs for the new St Peter’s Basilica. In the center is Plato and his student Aristotle. Each holds their respective books, and discussing idealism versus realism: Plato idealistically points up, and Aristotle realistically points down to Earth. Other figures in the fresco are Socrates (Plato’s teacher), Pythagoras, Euclid (or Archimedes), Ptoleme, Zoroaster, Diogenes, Heraclitus.In the video you will learn which instruments these philosophers and thinkers hold and use, and which figures were actual portraits of contemporaries of the times (such as Michelangelo, da Vinci and Raphael’s own self portrait!)

David – Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nOther famous sculptures of David – including the renowned one by Michelangelo – show David just after his victory over Goliath.\nBut Bernini’s piece on display in the Borghese Gallery shows him mid-flow in action. Just about to raise his sling to kill the bad giant, this stunning piece created in 1623 shows David in motion and is truly a must-see, standing at 170cms high.\nBernini’s artwork at the Galleria Borghese is a masterpiece!\n2. Apollo and Daphne – Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nBernini surely knocked out some gems. The next must-see Gallery Borghese sculpture is another one of his works.\nCommissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, it stands right in the center of one of the rooms in the museum. Apollo and Daphne is placed there strategically, as the statue has been made to be able to view it from any angle, so it makes for a stunning focal point.\nIt stands at 95 inches (243 centimeters) high and was completed in 1625.\n3. Venus Victrix – Antonio Canova\nA statue that shows no other than Napoleon Bonaparte's sister is sure to be worth a look.\nLounging on the couch, she echoes the goddess Venus. Bonaparte’s sister Pauline was married to Camillo Borghese, who took it upon himself to commission the sculpture in 1805 so that we can see what she looked like to this day!\n4. The Rape of Proserpina – Bernini\nNumber 4 for a masterpiece that stands in Room 4 in the museum (The Room of the Emperors).\nThe Rape of Proserpina by Pluto is a stunign masterpiece, most notably for the way that Bernini was able to make the hard cold marble look like soft flesh.\nLook at the part of the sculpture where Pluto's hands are grasping Proserpina’s flesh – it is truly remarkable.\n5. Bust of Cardinal Borghese – Bernini\nYou’ll find this sculpture of the late Cardinal Borghese by Cardinal Scipione commissioned for himself (being the extremely modest man that he was).\nIt is a very lifelike sculpture – you can almost hear him talking – but this artwork is dedicated to the man that is the founding father of the impressive Borghese Gallery Artworks.\n6. Sleeping Hermaphroditus – Bernini (copy)\nThis fascinating sculpture by Bernini is actually a copy of the real one that is to be found in the Louver.\nBut it is still pretty interesting. Hermaphrodites were a popular subject in the Hellenistic times, but for us the most interesting part is that Bernini managed to make cold stone marble look like a soft and comfy mattress on which to sleep!\n7. Statuettes of Black Hunters – Campi\nThe statuettes are found in the Stanza del Gladiatore, the hunters are both holding birds of prey. One has a dog at his feet, the other one has a lion.\nIt is generally accepted that the statues were commissioned to be placed together, as they are both looking in the same direction. They were completed in 1650 by Campi.\n8. Marcus Curtius Throwing himself into the Chasm – Bernini’s father – Bernini!\nLegend has it that Marcus Curtius threw himself into a huge hole that had opened up in the Roman Forum after a massive earthquake in a bid to save the city.\nIt worked, and the hole closed up around him. He sacrificed his life to save Rome. This relief/sculpture was created by another Bernini – Pietro. He is the father of our other beloved Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\n9. Candelabrum – Unknown from the 2nd Century AD/ restored by Antonio D’Este\nYou usually see the older artworks and sculptures on display in the Vatican museums, but the Borghese Galleries also have their fair share.\nOne such piece is this interesting 2nd Century AD sculpture. This was actually recreated in the 19th century using parts of the original and more modern additions. It is a hark back to the ancient with a modern twist.\n10. Aeneas, Anchises, And Ascanius – Bernini\nThis sculpture is located in room VI of the Borghese Gallery and depicts Aeneas and her flight out of Greece with her father into exile in Italy.\nLegend has it that her lineage eventually leads to Romulus, the founder of Rome. So whilst this sculpture is one of Bernini’s least known works, it is no less of an important one for the locals.\n5 Wall and Ceiling Paintings at Borghese Gallery\nPaintings too feature heavily on display amongst the Galleria Borghese Artworks.\nLet’s check out the top 5 wall and ceiling paintings in this amazing museum.\n1. The Deposition – Raphael\nThis is another very famous piece of art on display amongst the Galleria Borghese artworks.\nShowing Jesus following His removal from the cross on the way to the tomb, it was commissioned after the death of Atalanta Baglioni’s son in the early 16th century.\nAnd eventually made its way into the hands of Cardinal Scipione Borghese and is on display as part of an altar in the Borghese Gallery.\n2. Sacred and Profane Love – Titian\nCreated in 1514 this Renaissance painting draws curiosity from all who view it.\nOne clothed woman and one nude sit on a fountain, and a baby is crawling on the fountain in the background.\nIt is the subject of much debate as to what the meaning of the painting actually is. However, it is generally believed that the painting was commissioned by a local councilor to celebrate his new marriage.\nThe lady on the left, clothed, is thought to represent marriage, with the nude on the right perhaps representing Venus, the goddess of love.\n3. Young Sick Bacchus – Caravaggio\nCaravaggio's Young Sick Bacchus is amongst some amazing artwork at the Borghese Gallery and Museum. But it needs to be seen to be believed. The painting is teeming with symbolism.\nFor example, it was painted when Caravaggio wasn’t feeling great himself in 1593, and art commentators call out the grapes in his hand that show signs of decay, compared to the ripe and plump fruit sitting on the counter.\n4. Susanna and the Elders – Peter Paul Rubens\nThe Biblical story of Susanna comes to life in this stunning painting. Susanna is innocently taking a bath, when some dirty old men come to spy on her.\nIn the Bible story, the men are eventually put to death because they accused her of adultery. In the Rubens artwork from 1607, Susanna can be seen being surprised by the men, who are encouraging her to remain silent.\n5. Danaë – Correggio\nThe King of Argos daughter Danae is on display here. In Greek mythology, she had been imprisoned in a golden tower and was eventually rescued by Jupiter.\nThe painting shows the exact moment that angels and Jupiter come to her rescue. The painting was completed in 1531 and became known as one of the first mannerist styles of painting.\nThe Borghese Gallery Mosaics\nThe Borghese Gallery Mosaics are a collection of 5 impressive mosaics brought to the museum by Cardinal Scipione and are one of the most amazing features of the museum.\nThe Gladiator Mosaics\nLocated in the Salone of the Galleria Borghese these different mosaic scenes were uncovered at a different location in 1834 and transferred to the museum.\nThe story of gladiator fights is told across several scenes, with the name of each Gladiator shown beside them.\nInterestingly, you can also tell who died in the fight, and which Gladiators became victors. Those who won have a little “vic” beside their name.\nGet Tickets For Famous Artworks In Borghese Gallery Museum\nBe careful when visiting the Borghese Galleries!\nTickets are limited and are only offered for certain time slots.

{"question":"mechanics of bunion formation vs hammertoe development - explain anatomical differences","answer":"Bunions and hammertoes have distinct anatomical formation patterns. Bunions occur when the big toe bone shifts inward towards other toes, causing enlargement of the base joint connecting to the foot, often due to genetic predisposition or wearing tight shoes like high heels that shift body weight towards the toes. In contrast, hammertoes develop when the toe buckles, causing the middle joint of the affected toe to protrude outward. Both conditions can be aggravated by tight-fitting shoes, but they affect different parts of the toe structure - bunions impact the base joint while hammertoes involve the middle joint of the toe.","context":["September Articles 2015\nSport Related Foot And Ankle Injuries\nFoot and ankle injuries are common among people who participate in sports. Several factors contribute to this. They include failing to stretch or warm up properly, not wearing the proper type of shoe and not taping or providing other types of support for the ankle or foot. The most common foot and ankle injuries suffered by people involved in sport are plantar fasciitis, ankle sprains and Achilles tendon damage or ruptures. If not treated properly they can lead to permanent disability.\nPlantar fasciitis is a painful condition. It is inflammation of the plantar fascia, the thick fibrous band of tissue running from the heel to the base of the toes. There are several effective treatments for this ailment. Doctors often proscribe rest, massages, stretching, night splints, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroids or surgery usually in that order. The most effective treatment for plantar fasciitis is orthotics, such as foot supports. Surgery is occasionally used as a last resort.\nThe Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the body. It connects the calf muscles to the heel bone. Running, jumping and walking all impact this tendon. Two common injuries to the Achilles tendon are tendonitis and a rupture of the tendon. Tendonitis is inflammation in the tendon often caused by an increase in the amount and intensity of stress placed on it. It can either be treated non-surgically with rest, ice or anti-inflammatory medication or surgery may be required. A rupture (tear) of the Achilles tendon can be treated by placing the lower leg in a cast for several weeks or with surgery. Many physicians feel surgery is the better option because it lowers the risk of re-ruptures. Both methods require 4 to 6 months of rehabilitation.\nAnkle sprains are the most common sports related foot and ankle injury. A sprain occurs when the ligament holding the ankle bones and joint stretches beyond its normal range. It can be treated non-surgically with a combination of rest, ice wrapped around the joint for 30 minutes immediately after injury, compression by a bandage and elevating the ankle above the heart for 48 hours. This combination is referred to as RICE. Severe ankle sprains in which the ligaments are torn may require arthroscopic or reconstructive surgery followed by rehabilitation\nTreating these injuries is relatively simple if they are identified and addressed early. Many athletes dismiss the initial aches and pains associated with injury as just soreness or tired muscles. Their first response is usually to try to work through it. This can lead to serious problems. Many minor injuries are made far more serious when athletes continue to put strain and pressure on them. That attitude can change a mild strain into a serious strain and a minor tear into a rupture. Athletes should have unusual aches and pains evaluated by a skilled, licensed medical professional.\nDealing with Stress Fractures of the Foot and Ankle\nStress fractures occur in the foot and ankle when muscles in those areas are weakened from too much or too little use. When this happens, they stop cushioning the foot and ankles from the impact of hitting the ground. Because there is nothing to protect them, the bones of the foot begin to absorb the full impact of each step someone takes. The added stress causes little cracks to form in the bones that are under the most pressure. These cracks are called stress fractures.\nStress fractures are common for individuals whose daily activities cause high levels of impact on their feet and ankles. Individuals who run, play tennis or basketball, or practice gymnastics tend to experience these fractures more frequently. Anyone is susceptible to this problem, though. Individuals who are normally sedentary and suddenly begin an intensive high impact work out may get stress fractures. This is because their muscles are not strong enough to handle and cushion the intensity of their activity. Osteoporosis may also cause someone to get stress fractures, because the disease weakens an afflicted person's bones and makes it easier for them to break down.\nThe pain from these fractures will occur in the general area of the fracture. It may be intermittent or constant, and will cause sharp or dull pain along with swelling and tenderness. Engaging in any kind of activity, high impact or otherwise, will aggravate the pain. If the intensity of the activity increases before the stress fracture has properly healed, it can cause a full fracture. This is a much more serious problem, and will probably prevent you from applying any pressure on the foot at all.\nTreatment can vary depending on the individual and the degree of injury. The primary way to treat a stress fracture is to rest the hurt foot. Some fractures will heal quickly with only a little bit of rest, while others may require a long rest period and the use of crutches. Under certain circumstances, surgery may be required to install support pins around the fracture to assist in healing.\nIn order to avoid getting stress fractures, make sure to get plenty of calcium and Vitamin-D. They will help to keep your bones strong, and make them less likely to break under pressure. If your new exercise regimen is running or some other kind of high impact activity, set incremental goals on a weekly basis so you can build up muscle strength. For example, if you plan to walk every day, you could ride a bike on some days to take the stress off of your feet. Make sure to wear supportive shoes to better protect you feet.\nIf you begin to experience any symptoms of stress fractures, you should stop exercising and rest. If the symptoms do not go away, see an orthopedic specialist. Remembering these tips can help you prevent stress fractures to your foot and ankle, and allow you to continue living normally.\nExercise for Your Feet\nWhether your feet are over-worked or under-worked, chances are they could benefit from some special attention. Even those who exercise regularly probably do not spend any time strengthening their feet. This can be just as rewarding as strengthening the rest of the body, since the health of your feet affects the health of the rest of the body as well, especially the ankles, legs, and spine.\nFor those who might not have any idea on how a foot-specific exercise might be conducted, there are several workouts that are fairly easy to perform in the comfort of your home. One of the easiest is the toe rise, also known as the tip-toe. This exercise involves standing on the tip-toes for a count of 15 then resting the feet on the ground. This process should be repeated a minimum of three times a day in order to strengthen the feet.\nToe pick-ups strengthen the feet by working them in a very different way. In this exercise, small items are picked up using the toes in order to strengthen the muscles on the upper part of the feet. Once again three sets should be performed, with the item in question being held for 15 seconds then dropped. Items that may be picked up using the feet include marbles and even stationery, which works wonders for the toes and the surrounding muscles.\nYet another simple workout is the ankle pump. This can be done either upwards or downwards, but for the workout to be most effective both can be incorporated into the routine. As the term suggests, this involves lifting the foot off the floor and flexing the toes either towards the shin or towards the ground. This movement puts the feet and ankles through a large range of motion which works muscles.\nLast but not least, feet should be stretched so that the muscles can relax and recuperate. This can be done by placing both feet off the floor and bracing oneself against the wall at a 45 degree angle. This ensures that the feet and ankles are adequately stretched once the workout is complete.\nIn short, giving the feet a good workout every now and then is important in order to avoid problems such as plantar fasciitis, as well as to warm-up or cool-down after running or vigorous walking. Foot exercises may be followed by a good foot massage which encourages circulation in the feet as well as muscle relaxation.\nA bunion is an enlargement of the base joint of the toe that connects to the foot, often formed from a bony growth or a patch of swollen tissues, and is caused by the shifting of the big toe bone inward towards the other toes. This shift can cause a serious amount of pain and discomfort and the area around the big toe will become inflamed, red, and painful.\nBunions are most commonly formed in people who are already genetically predisposed to them or other kinds of bone displacements. However, even if you do not have a history of this in your family, you can still develop bunions if you are wearing improperly fitting shoes, such as trying to cram your feet into high heels, or by running or walking in a way that causes too much stress on the feet. High heels are a major culprit in the formation of bunions because not only do they push the big toe inward, but your body weight and center of gravity is shifted towards the edge of your feet and your toes, which can cause bone displacement.\nBunions are quickly and easily diagnosed by podiatrists. However, because of their nature, they can appear similar to arthritic conditions or gout, so sometimes a blood test is required to fully diagnose a bunion. A full radiological or x-ray exam could also be done by a podiatrist to examine the bone structure of your feet. One thing that is looked for specifically is an enlargement of that base joint or evidence of the big toe bone being pushed inward.\nOne of the first things to do if you have bunions is to get a larger, wider shoe that can remove pressure from your toes. This usually means that high heels should be eliminated from use for a period of time to allow the bunion to heel. Oftentimes, eliminating the pressure placed on a bunion is enough to eliminate the pain involved with them, however, pain can persist in some instances and anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed. If the pain is too severe, steroid injections near the bunion or even surgery may be required. Orthotics for shoes may also be prescribed which can alleviate the pain of bunions by removing pressure from them. However, these methods simply stop the pain of bunions but do not correct the problem at its source.\nAs previously mentioned, surgery may be an option to completely eliminate your bunions. Surgery is done to reposition the toe bones so that they no longer face inward. This can be done by removing a section of bone or by rearranging the ligaments and tendons in the toe to help them align properly. Even after the surgery, it may be necessary to wear protective shoes for a while to ensure that the bunions do not return.","Anatomy of the foot\nThe foot is 1 of the most complex parts of the body, consisting of 26 bones connected by numerous joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The foot is susceptible to many stresses. Foot problems can cause pain, inflammation, or injury, resulting in limited movement and mobility.\nWhat are the different types of foot problems?\nFoot pain is often caused by improper foot function. Improperly fitted shoes can worsen and, in some cases, cause foot problems. Shoes that fit properly and give good support can prevent irritation to the foot joints and skin. There are many types of foot problems that affect the heels, toes, nerves, tendons, ligaments, and joints of the foot.\nThe symptoms of foot problems may resemble other medical conditions and problems. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.\nWhat are heel spurs?\nA heel spur is a bone growth on the heel bone. It is usually located on the underside of the heel bone where it attaches to the plantar fascia, a long band of connective tissue running from the heel to the ball of the foot. This connective tissue holds the arch together and acts as a shock absorber during activity. If the plantar fascia is overstretched from running, wearing poor-fitting shoes, or being overweight, pain can result from the stress and inflammation of the tissue pulling on the bone. Over time, the body builds extra bone in response to this stress resulting in heel spurs. Treatment options may include:\nAnti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprofen\nProper stretching prior to activity\nProper footwear or shoe inserts\nSurgery (for more severe, prolonged conditions)\nWhat is a corn?\nCorns are yellowish, callus growths that develop on top of the toes. Corns develop because of abuse or stress. Often, a corn develops where a toe rubs against a shoe or another toe. Corns can cause extreme discomfort and pain. Treatment may include:\nTrimming the corn by shaving the layers of dead skin\nApplying pads around the corn area\nWearing larger shoes to comfortably fit your foot without rubbing\nTo avoid corn development, always purchase footwear that fits properly.\nWhat is a bunion?\nA bunion is a protrusion of bone or tissue around a joint. Bunions may occur at the base of the great toe or at the base of the little toe, and often occur when the joint is stressed over a period of time. Women are more frequently affected because they may wear tight, pointed, and confining shoes. Bunions can also be a result of arthritis, which often affects the big toe joint.\nTreatment of bunions may vary depending on the pain and deformity. Treatment may include:\nWearing comfortable, well-fitting footwear (particularly shoes that conform to the shape of the foot and do not cause pressure areas)\nSurgery (for pain, not for cosmetic purposes)\nApplying pads to the affected area\nMedications, such as ibuprofen\nWhat is Morton neuroma?\nMorton neuroma is a buildup of benign (noncancerous) tissue in the nerves running between the long bones of the foot. Morton neuroma occurs when two bones rub together and squeeze the nerve between them. Most often, neuromas develop between the bones leading to the third and fourth toes. Morton neuroma often causes swelling, tenderness, and pain. If the pain becomes severe, it may cause tingling, numbness, and burning in the toes. It usually occurs after standing or walking for a long period of time. Treatment for this condition may involve rest and/or a change in footwear that does not restrict the foot. If the problem persists, cortisone injections and/or surgery may be considered.\nWhat are hammertoes?\nA hammertoe is a condition in which the toe buckles, causing the middle joint of the affected toe to poke out. This condition is often aggravated by tight-fitting shoes that put pressure on the hammertoe. Often a corn develops at this site. Treatment for hammertoes may include:\nApplying a toe pad specially positioned over the bony protrusion\nChanging your footwear to accommodate the deformed toe\nWhat is an ankle sprain?\nAn ankle sprain is an injury to the foot's ligaments in the ankle. Ligaments are tough bands of elastic tissue that connect bones to each other. Ankle sprains may occur if the ankle rolls, turns, or twists beyond its normal range of motion. Ankle sprains may be caused by awkward foot placement, irregular surfaces, weak muscles, loose ligaments, or wearing shoes with spiked heels. The symptoms of a sprain will depend on how severely the ligaments are stretched or torn, but usually include swelling, pain, or bruising. Treatment will depend on the severity of the sprain, but may include:\nResting the ankle\nWrapping the ankle with elastic bandage or tape\nIce pack application (to reduce inflammation)\nElevating the ankle\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen to help reduce the pain and inflammation\nGradual return to walking and exercise\nA walking cast (for moderate sprains)\nSurgery (for severe sprains)\nWhat is a foot fracture?\nWith 26 bones in a single foot, almost any of them can be broken. Many fractures do not require surgery, or even a cast, as they will heal on their own with some support. When a foot is fractured, the site of the fracture usually is painful and swollen. The site of the fracture will determine the course of treatment, if necessary, including the following:\nAnkle joint fractures. These fractures may be serious and require immediate medical attention. Ankle fractures usually require a cast, and some may require surgery if the bones are too separated or misaligned.\nMetatarsal bone fractures. Fractures of the metatarsal bones, located in the middle of the foot, often do not require a cast. A stiff-soled shoe may be all that is needed for support as the foot heals. Sometimes, surgery is needed to correct misaligned bones or fractured segments.\nSesamoid bone fractures. The sesamoid bones are 2 small, round bones at the end of the metatarsal bone of the big toe. Usually, padded soles can help relieve pain. However, sometimes, the sesamoid bone may have to be surgically removed.\nToe fractures. Fractures of the toes normally can heal with or without a cast.\nWhat is foot pain?\nFoot pain can be debilitating to an active lifestyle. Foot pain can have many sources, from fractures and sprains to nerve damage. Listed below are 3 common areas of pain in the foot and their causes:\nPain in the ball of the foot. Pain in the ball of the foot, located on the bottom of the foot behind the toes, may be caused by nerve or joint damage in that area. In addition, a benign (noncancerous) growth, such as Morton's neuroma, may cause the pain. Corticosteroid injections and wearing supportive shoe inserts may help relieve the pain. Sometimes, surgery is necessary.\nPlantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is characterized by severe pain in the heel of the foot, especially when standing up after resting. The condition is due to an overuse injury of the sole surface (plantar) of the foot and results in inflammation of the fascia, a tough, fibrous band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the base of the toes.\nPlantar fasciitis is more common in women, people who are overweight, people with occupations that require a lot of walking or standing on hard surfaces, people with flat feet, and people with high arches. Walking or running, especially with tight calf muscles, may also cause the condition.\nTreatment may include:\nIce pack applications\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications\nStretching exercises of the Achilles tendons and plantar fascia\nAchilles tendon injury. The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the human body. It connects the calf muscle to the heel bone. However, this tendon is also the most common site of rupture or tendonitis, an inflammation of the tendon due to overuse.\nAchilles tendonitis is caused by overuse of the tendon and calf muscles. Symptoms may include mild pain after exercise that worsens gradually, stiffness that disappears after the tendon warms up, and swelling. Treatment may include:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications\nSupportive devices and/or bandages for the muscle and tendon"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6a3233c7-a9fe-47da-817f-a2b265e6c218>","<urn:uuid:d40e2a44-ff13-4968-9746-8fc1ed1887a5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which infection has a clearer diagnostic process - toxocara or giardia?","answer":"Toxocara has a clearer diagnostic process. It can be diagnosed through basic blood tests that show very high levels of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell that attacks parasites) when larvae travel through the body, followed by specific antibody tests to confirm the toxocara infection. For giardia, the diagnosis is less straightforward since many people (up to 60% in some US regions) can be asymptomatic carriers, having the parasite present without showing disease symptoms, making it harder to determine who needs treatment.","context":["Parasites can be subtle, and you don't need to travel to the jungle to become infected with a parasite. Simply going to the park or hiking in the woods can be enough. Few doctors can recognize common symptoms or problems as parasitic infections. Doctors will also need lab tests and exposure histories to find these sneaky parasites. However, not all doctors are trained to look for parasites. Infectious disease specialists are best qualified to diagnose and treat these conditions.\nHere are three parasites to watch out for:\nToxocara is a dog or cat roundworm that can accidentally infect humans. Typically these worms live in the gut of your pet. The eggs of the parasite are released in poop that can infect the soil. The tiny larvae within the egg live a long time in the soil, silently waiting for the next animal to pick them up. They are regularly found in city parks, sandboxes and areas of dirt where pets poop on a regular basis. The southeastern US has the most cases.\nHumans are exposed to toxocara by playing in the dirt – either in the park or in their own gardens. The eggs can get on our hands or under our nails. If we put those hands in our mouth, eat before washing our hand or get our fingers too close to our faces, we can accidentally put the eggs into our body. Children are particularly at risk since they are not the best at washing their hands.\nToxocara can cause fever, flu-like symptoms, swollen liver, wheezing, cough and shortness of breath. Sometimes it can cause seizures, behavioral changes or poor appetite. These widespread symptoms correspond to where the small larvae travels throughout the body. This condition is called visceral larva migrans. Visceral means organs, larva means worm hatchlings and migrans means traveling in many directions.\nHowever, there are more subtle versions of toxocara that can be much more difficult to diagnose. Covert toxocaraiasis may just cause abdominal pain, poor appetite, isolated wheezing or coughing. The worm can travel into the eye on its random journey in the body. The retina can become very inflamed and the center part of the eye can get cloudy. This is called ocular toxocara.\nTo diagnose a toxocara infection, your doctor should start with basic blood tests, including blood counts. When the larva travels through the body, your eosinophils increase to very high levels in your blood. This is a major clue that disseminated parasites are causing the problem. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that attack parasites. Specific antibody tests for toxocara can then pinpoint this worm as the cause of the infection.\nTo treat the infection, there are several pill antibiotics that kill toxocara. Both mebendazole and albendazole are commonly used. Treatment usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks. If there is eye involvement, doctors use steroids to calm the inflammation. The patient may need surgery to clean the center part of the eye. Sometimes people need multiple rounds of both antibiotics and steroids to treat relapses.\nTo prevent a toxocara infection, make sure to wash your hands after working in the yard or playing in the dirt. Treat your pets on a regular schedule for roundworms. Pregnant dogs should also be treated so their litters do not get infected. And be sure to scoop your pet’s poop!","Diarrheal illnesses due to infections are common throughout the world. Most are short-lived and do not lead to any serious complications. It may be caused by a number of different organisms, like viruses and bacteria. One of the most common of these organisms is a protozoan known as Giardia lamblia. However, many people who are infected with the Giardia parasite never develop symptoms but may carry the parasite in their bowels for long periods of time.\nWhat is Giardia and giardiasis?\nGiardia is a microorganism known as a protozoan. The correct name for giardia is Giardia lamblia. It is a single-celled organism like bacteria but there are some internal differences between these organisms. Therefore bacteria and protozoa are considered as different types of microorganisms. Giardia lamblia is one species of protozoa. Giardiasis is the term for the disease caused by Giardia lamblia. This disease is primarily a diarrheal illness in that the Giardia protozoan mainly affects the bowels and therefore causes bowel-related symptoms.\nHow common is giardiasis?\nGiardia lamblia is quite a common protozoan found in the gut of humans. In fact it is the most commonly identified parasite in stool samples. but it does not mean that all people who test positive will develop diarrhea. Many people are carriers – they have the parasite (Giardia lamblia) in their gut but do not have the disease symptoms (giardiasis). This can be as high as 60% in some regions of the United States.\nOverall giardiasis is most frequently seen among children. As a water-borne infection, it is not only limited to developing nations where water quality and sanitation may be poor. Giardiasis affects a person of any age but children are at the greatest risk, mainly due to contact in daycare centers. The incidence of giardiasis peaks in late summer to early fall.\nCauses and Spread of Giardiasis\nGiardiasis is caused by Giardia lamblia protozoa. It is similar to many diarrheal illnesses that can be caused by other human intestinal parasites. The infection arises when the cysts of the Giardia parasite is ingested. It is a water-borne infection meaning that the parasite is found in water that is ingested either intentionally or accidentally.\nWater sources may vary – rural streams or lakes, wells, tap water, swimming pools and whirlpool spas can all be a problem. However, the problem is greater where the water source is not properly treated and there is poor sanitation. Cysts in the feces of people who have the infection can then contaminate water and the parasite may be spread to others.\nThe infection can also be transmitted through food, if contaminated water is used to wash foods that are then eaten raw or inadequately cooked. Another way that the Giardia parasite may be spread is from one person to another. This occurs when a person comes into contact with another person’s feces. It is often a problem in day care center where children may come into contact with soiled diapers.\nThe Giardia cysts found in water and feces is responsible for the infection. These cysts are the more hardy form of the parasite. It is resistant to a range of environmental stresses – cysts can survive in cold water for several months. Once the contaminated water is consumed, the other form of the parasite known as the trophozoite emerges. It is usually in the small intestine that the trophozoite emerges from the cyst through a process known as excystation.\nEach cyst produces 2 trophozoites. The trophozoites then multiply within the bowels. Some are attached to the intestinal wall while others are free within the intestinal lumen. As the trophozoites travel through the bowels to the colon it becomes encysted. These cysts as well as trophozoites are passed out of the bowels in the stool. Even after the diarrhea subsides, Giardia cysts are still present in the stool.\nInfection depends to some degree on individual immunity. The infective dose varies from one person to another. Ingesting 25 cysts leads to a 100% infection rate. This means that any person who ingests at least 25 Giardia lamblia cysts will be infected. Once in the digestive tract, the parasite impairs absorption of nutrients in the bowels and leads to diarrhea through several ways.\nThe inner lining of the intestinal wall becomes more permeable when the parasite attaches to it. The villi of the intestines become flattened and the activity of digestive enzymes is affected. Therefore nutrients cannot be properly absorbed in the bowels. The parasite also affects the the normal bowel bacteria which is important for proper bowel health. This leads to a bacterial overgrowth. Collectively these effects result in diarrhea that is typical of giardiasis.\nSigns and Symptoms\nNot all people who are exposed to Giardia cysts will become ill. Many people are asymptomatic carriers. This means that they do not have any disease symptoms but can still transmit the disease to others. From those infected people who develop symptoms, some will have milder symptoms while others will have very severe symptoms. The signs and symptoms of giardiasis are not significantly different from other types of infectious diarrhea. It includes:\n- Diarrhea: Stool may vary from water and foul smelling diarrhea to very soft and greasy.\n- Excessive belching with offensive smelling and tasting gas.\n- Nausea, bloating and abdominal cramps.\n- Malaise (general feeling of being unwell) and fatigue (extreme tiredness).\n- Weight loss due to the loss of water as well as impaired absorption of nutrients.\nAs with any diarrheal illness there is the risk of dehydration if the condition is not properly managed.\nHow long to recover?\nIt takes anywhere between 1 day to 2 weeks after ingesting the cysts for the symptoms to arise. This is known as the incubation period. The symptoms last from 10 days to 4 weeks. In some people it can last longer and there may be instances where the symptoms clear up but recur later. People with weakened immune systems may experience chronic diarrhea that is often difficult to treat.\nTreatment of Giardiasis\nPeople who have giardia but do not not have any symptoms usually do not require treatment. In fact most people with symptomatic Giardia infection will recover on their own even without treatment. However, in severe cases or high risk cases treatment is essential. The treatment of giardiasis requires the use of antibiotics such as:\n- Metronidazole (most commonly used)\n- Nitazoxanide (used for children due to liquid form)\n- Paromomycin (for pregnant women although the cure rate is lower)\nGiardia lamblia infection does not require any special diet. Some people develop secondary lactose intolerance after the symptoms subside but this is temporary. Nevertheless those giardiasis patients who are experiencing lactose intolerance should avoid milk and dairy products so as not to trigger diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms.\nAlthough a special diet is not necessary, proper rehydration is crucial in order to prevent dehydration. Commercially prepared oral rehydrating solutions (ORS) are the better option, as it contains the optimal concentration of solutes to prevent worsening of the diarrhea. When rehydration cannot be done through the mouth (orally), then intravenous (IV) fluid administration may be necessary."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6f95f341-a943-463a-b530-548fb5b52090>","<urn:uuid:a2b674d8-2924-423b-a078-932e2d9fc7ac>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why did the Green River Formation develop such extensive oil shale deposits during the Eocene epoch? The stratigraphic sequence suggests remarkable organic preservation.","answer":"The Green River Formation developed extensive oil shale deposits due to ideal lake conditions that supported thriving blooms of blue-green algae. These algae spread across many parts of the lakes as a thick scum of green filaments and strands. Over several million years, enormous amounts of algal debris sank to the bottom and were incorporated into the lake sediments. Through time, these algae-rich sediments were transformed into what became the largest oil shale resource on Earth.","context":["Fossil Fly from Kemmerer, Wyoming\nLocation: Kemmerer, Wyoming\nSelf collected in May, 2018!\nStory of the Green River Formation\nRocks of the Green River Formation contain a story of what the environment was like about 50 million years ago in what is now parts of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming (see map below). At that time, forces within the Earth were almost finished with the job of uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and the landscape consisted of rugged mountains separated by broad intermountain basins.\nStreams draining the steep mountains carried large amounts of sand, silt, mud and dissolved minerals into lakes that occupied the intermountain basis. Over time the sand, silt and mud began infilling the lakes. The dissolved minerals altered the chemistry of the lake waters. Abundant plants grew on broad swampy areas that developed around the margins of the lakes.\nOil Shales and Coals\nThe Green River climate was moist and warm - perfect for rapid plant growth. This allowed a dense community of plants to spread across the swampy areas along the lake margins. These plants dropped a steady supply of leaves, branches, seeds and woody materials into the swamp waters. The water cover of the swamp protected the plant debris from decay and it accumulated rapidly. The plant debris layers grew thicker and more extensive over time. Eventually the layers of plant debris were buried and transformed into coal seams.\nConditions in the lakes were also ideal for thriving blooms of blue-green algae. They spread over many parts of the lakes as a thick scum of green filaments and strands. For several million years enormous amounts of algal debris sank to the bottom and were incorporated into the lake sediments. Through time the algae-rich sediments were transformed into the largest oil shale resource on Earth.\nIn some parts of the lakes, sediments were deposited in very thin layers known as varves (see photo). A thin layer of dark-colored sediment was deposited during the growing season, and a thin layer of light-colored sediment was deposited in winter. The varves ranged in thickness from a fraction of a millimeter to a few millimeters each. Some of the most detailed and highly preserved fossils are contained in varved sediments composed of very fine-grained lime mud. When these thinly layered rocks are split, the smooth bedding surfaces often reveal a delicately-preserved fossil. Millions of Green River fossils have been collected by amateur and professional collectors. They are now in collections, exhibits and museums around the world. Photographs of a number of specimens are presented on this page. These photographs are from the archive of the National Park Service.\nThe Green River Formation is best known among paleontologists for its superbly preserved fossil fish. Some slabs of the Green River Formation contain hundreds of individual fish and likely represent an instantaneous die-off. Dozens of fish species have been identified. One species, Knightia, a small fish usually less than six inches in length, is especially common. Specimens of Knightia have made their way into thousands of fossil collections around the world.\nAn abundance of fossil plants have been found in sediments that accumulated along the edges of the lake. Palm leaves, ferns, and sycamore leaves are very common fossils of these Green River swamp sediments. Fossil of turtles, bats, birds, mammals, snakes, and crocodiles have also been found in the Green River Formation.\nAge of the Green River Fossils\nDetermining an accurate age for a rock unit can be very difficult. However, rocks of the Green River Formation have been dated to within a few million years through the analysis of volcanic mineral grains.\nVolcanoes in what is now Yellowstone to the north and the San Juan volcanic field to the south produced occasional ash clouds that dropped thin layers of volcanic ash into the calm lake waters. These ash layers were preserved and contain tiny mineral grains that crystallized during the volcanic eruption. Researchers have collected samples of these ashfall layers and through analysis have determined the crystallization date of the tiny volcanic grains. They indicate that the lakes are about 50 million years old and span a time interval of several million years during the early to mid Eocene Epoch."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b0a5a7c4-f7f7-4c4a-b11b-86467d33a506>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which requires more precise alignment: multi-color t-shirt screen printing or PCB silkscreen printing using Liquid Photo Imaging (LPI)?","answer":"LPI PCB silkscreen printing requires more precise alignment, as it can achieve line widths as small as 4mil and needs higher precision to work with lesser board spacing. In comparison, while t-shirt screen printing does require careful registration of screens for multi-color prints to avoid misalignment and distortion, it operates at a much larger scale dealing with fabric materials and doesn't require the microscopic precision needed for PCB component identification and circuit tracing.","context":["Add: 6 floor, 6/A building, Xifa Yongqi science park, Tiezai road, Xixiang town, Baoan district,Shenzhen,China\nTel : 0755-27348887\nFax : 0755-27349876\nE-mail : firstname.lastname@example.org\nSimon / 2021-02-05\nA simple analogy from which to observe a silkscreen would be observing a map, especially a countered map. We know that the various features are labeled on the map; otherwise, it would make no sense to see the lines without a label. For a feature to be easily identifiable, there must be an accompanying name or standard symbol to denote it.\nWhen it comes to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), the silkscreen is the ink layer that provides printed information to identify the various circuit points, components, marks, logos, warning symbols, etc. The silkscreen is mostly applied on the components side since it's economically more viable than if applied on the solder side. There are some PCBs you'll find with a silkscreen on the solder side.\nThe silkscreen employs a highly formulated epoxy ink. It is also necessary that the ink be non-conductive. For these reasons, the ink is usually available in a few colors, i.e., white, black, yellow.\nWhen applied as per standards, a detailed silkscreen makes the work easier for both the engineer and the manufacturer. All components can be identified easily, and circuits efficiently traced.\nYou can already guess what information the silkscreen provides. The silkscreen is, however, not a functional part of a PCB. The information displayed include:\nReference designators for identifying the part's location\nTest points designators\nBoard identification numbers\nThe polarity of the different parts\nLogos and manufacturer or version numbers\nThere are basically three common methods of PCB silkscreen printing. These methods differ in aspects such as overall cost, time to complete the printing, the available board spacing, and the printed circuit board material to be used. Each method has its uniqueness, which determines where that particular method can be applied.\nThe common PCB silkscreen printing methods are:\nManual Screen Printing\nLiquid Photo Imaging (LPI)\nDirect Legend Printing (DLP)\nThis is the oldest of the three methods and happens to be the least expensive. However, this method is limited to line widths not less than 0.007\", or when the registration tolerance is at 0.005\". A stencil made of text and traces is used to direct the epoxy ink through. The traces are usually nylon-made. Next, the laminate is placed in the baking oven to cure the ink.\nThe main advantages of manual screen printing are the ease and low costs associated with this method.\nThere are significant limitations, however. First, the method requires bigger board spacing to accommodate the large text size.\nPad clearance is also bound to be troublesome in manual screen printing.\nLastly, it takes long, typically years, to master the art of manual screen printing. It's surely not for the faint-hearted.\nIf the minimum line width required is 4mil, LPI can be applied. If you're conversant with solder mask application, you may already know how LPI is done.\nGenerally, the laminate is coated with an epoxy layer. The epoxy layer, in this case, has photodecomposition properties. The laminate is then exposed to ultraviolet light so that the silkscreen sketch impression is transferred to the plate(s). These plates are then allowed to cure, and the screen developed afterward.\nThis method has higher precision than the manual printing process, allowing for silkscreen application in boards with a lesser spacing. White color is the most preferable in LPI. You also need more ink for this process compared to the other two methods. In case you really want to economize on the board space, you can sacrifice the long setup time associated with LPI.\nDLP is quite expensive as compared to the other silkscreen printing methods. The method employs the same principle as an inkjet printer, but one guide by a CAD application.\nThe printer inscribes the board with acrylic ink as per the commands the user inputs to the software. Once done, the board is then exposed to ultraviolet light for curing and development. The acrylic ink may produce illegible impressions on silvery finishes.\nThis method's main selling points are the record short time it takes to print the board and the accuracy that surpasses the other two methods. The only issues with DLP are the inability to produce readable text on silvery material, and the unreadable text that's usually produced when the text height is reduced below 0.02\".\nIt's now evident that the method you choose should help you save as much as possible on the overall costs and time. Depending on your project, choose appropriately.\nThe production of a PCB involves multiple processes, which together make the finished board. The process of solder masking also involves several sub-processes, such as PCB silkscreen printing. However, PCB silkscreen is a very sensitive, delicate, and sophisticated of the four main sub-processes.\nIf the whole process was broken down into individual steps, we get about 32 steps. Some of the steps can be grouped together to form a functional step. By so doing, we get six broad categories. They are:\nDesigning with EAGLE\nAfter the final artwork design is ready, there is no better way of getting it ready for printing than preparing it with EAGLE, a CAD software dedicated to silkscreen printing.\nThe design work is supposed to be done in the silkscreen section, which is part of the PCB design module.\nFrom the software interface, you can see the yellow rectangle shapes. This represents the outline of the silkscreen. In most EAGLE versions, the silkscreen outline is located just above the package dimension (grey color). Once in the silkscreen window, the rest of the design can be completed.\nEAGLE allows you to place the different labels by just selecting and naming them.\nAfter the design work, proper board preparation needs to be carried out to make a quality product.\nThe first thing here is to choose the type of board to use. The board material is usually the focus here. Once selected, the board is then cleaned before undergoing a tape-rolling process. Board handling completes the preparation process.\nThe PCB design (already printed in black on transparent paper) is then carefully placed on the silkscreen. The way you place the silk fabric will be the same way that the text or marks will imprint on the PCB board.\nOne precaution here is that you should never let the paper PC design paper shift the position. To be sure, always secure the design firmly with clear tape.\nThe next thing is turning the silkscreen and the attached design(s) so that the latter faces down. Then cover the now top side with a dark (opaque) manila paper or cardboard. Shine an ultraviolet light beam from below (onto the attached design) for about 15 minutes to fully develop the outline.\nA jet of water is then used to clear the emulsion part to reveal the now developed silkscreen.\nThis series of steps achieve the actual printing of the silkscreen. The board is properly mounted onto the machine. The printing process begins until the CAD software has printed the whole design onto the board.\nThis process involves first positioning the etched PCB under the silkscreen fabric while ensuring total alignment of the board and the design on top. The PCB is then secured with stoppers at the sides to prevent any movement during application.\nA squeegee is then used to administer an even layer of photosensitive ink at the top of the silkscreen. The ink is then dried for about 10 minutes in a drying oven so that the impressions are well imprinted.\nEven though at this point the printing has already been completed, the right handling methods are indispensable. This is why the entire process is so about the handling procedures so that the silkscreen printing does not degrade the PCB.\nTo ensure that the writings are legible and the marking visible to the naked eye, inspection is done at every stage.\nThis is the final step of silkscreen printing, where the finished product's readiness for use is ascertained. When the PCB passes the inspection, the silkscreen process can be declared complete.\nTraditionally, the manual method of using a stencil to directly ink the board surface was preferred. Currently, LPI and DLP silkscreen printing methods are more common.\nAs mentioned earlier, LPI requires the most prep time but provides the highest resolution for both text and markings.\nOn the other hand, DLP is the fastest printing method but uses acrylic ink with limited usage.\nWith three methods to choose from, engineers and manufacturers can now optimize cost and time by choosing the appropriate method.\nOne of the things that can be identified from a silkscreen is a testing point. The silkscreen thus points the engineer to the point where he should make measurements. This facilitates troubleshooting and testing. The engineer will then be able to determine and verify the device's performance. Warning symbols and part numbers can also be used during testing.\nThe purpose of making a silkscreen is to facilitate testing and identification during assembly. Here are a few tips to ensure the silkscreen achieves the desires function:\nDo not use non-CM approved fonts. Some fonts may still be available in the software but be hard to print on the board.\nTo avoid contrast issues with the solder mask color, stick to either black or white colors.\nTo avoid imprinting over components, stick to the contract manufacturer's (CM) dimensional guidelines.\nYou have learned what silkscreen printing is, what it entails, and how it is done. It's also evident that it's a rather delicate process, which may add value or render the board useless. This knowledge places you in a better place whenever having a PCB silkscreen-printed for you.\nAdditionally, you can now choose the best printing method with certainty, depending on cost, accuracy, and time.","Screen Printing Supplies for Beginners\nIf you’re new to screen printing, there are a few essential supplies you’ll need to get started. Here’s a breakdown of the key items you’ll need and their functions.\nPhoto Emulsion Kit: This kit is essential for creating stencils on your screens. It typically includes photo emulsion, sensitizer, and emulsion remover.

Make sure to choose ink that is specifically designed for fabric printing to ensure durability and washability.\nSqueegee (multiple sizes): A squeegee is used to push the ink through the screen and onto the shirt. Having multiple sizes allows you to work with different screen sizes and designs.\nAluminum Screen (20″x24″): The screen is where the design is transferred and allows the ink to pass through onto the fabric. Aluminum screens are durable and provide a smooth printing surface.\nPalette Knife: This tool is handy for mixing and handling ink. It allows for precise ink application and helps in achieving the desired consistency for printing.\nBlank T-shirts: You’ll need a supply of blank t-shirts to practice and create your designs. Look for high-quality shirts that provide a good surface for printing and come in various sizes to accommodate different designs.\nBy having these essential supplies, you’ll be well-equipped to start your screen printing journey and create your own custom designs on t-shirts and other fabric items.\nMastering the Art of Screen Printing Shirts\nScreen printing at home is a feasible DIY project that can yield professional-looking results. The process involves transferring ink onto a substrate (such as fabric or paper) through a mesh screen. While it may seem daunting at first, with the right materials and a bit of practice, it can be a rewarding and cost-effective way to create custom designs.\nTo get started with screen printing at home, you will need a few key materials:\n- A screen with a mesh fabric stretched over a frame\n- Photo emulsion and sensitizer\n- A light source for exposing the design onto the screen\n- Squeegees for applying the ink\n- Screen printing ink\n- Substrate to print on (e.g., t-shirts, posters)\nThe process of screen printing involves several steps:\n- Coating the screen with photo emulsion and allowing it to dry\n- Placing a design or stencil onto the screen and exposing it to light\n- Rinsing the screen to reveal the design\n- Securing the substrate and screen together\n- Applying ink to the screen and using a squeegee to spread it evenly\n- Lifting the screen to reveal the printed design\n- Curing the ink to set the design permanently\nHere are some tips to keep in mind when screen printing at home:\n- Practice on scrap fabric or paper to get the hang of the process before working on your final project\n- Ensure that the screen is properly coated and exposed to achieve crisp designs\n- Use a well-ventilated area and protect your work surface to avoid making a mess\n- Clean the screen promptly after use to prolong its lifespan\nScreen printing at home can be a fun and fulfilling way to create personalized items and artwork. With the right materials and a bit of patience, you can achieve professional-looking results from the comfort of your own home.\nThe Process of Screen Printing T-Shirts Explained\nScreen printing involves a meticulous process to ensure that the colors align perfectly during printing. This begins with the registration of screens, where each screen is carefully aligned to match up with the others. Registration is crucial to avoid any misalignment issues that could result in a blurred or distorted final product.\nOnce the screens are registered, the printing process begins. Each color is applied separately, with the ink being pushed through the screen onto the fabric or surface. This method allows for precise color control and the ability to create vibrant, multi-colored designs.\nAfter the printing is complete, the fabric or surface goes through a large dryer. This step is essential for curing the inks and ensuring that they are permanently set. The high temperatures of the dryer effectively bond the ink to the material, making it resistant to fading or washing out.\nLife hack: When choosing a screen for printing, consider the mesh count – a higher mesh count will result in finer details, while a lower mesh count is better for bold, solid designs.\nThe longevity of screen printing – A closer look at its durability\nScreen printing is a unique method of printing on garments that offers long-lasting results. Unlike transfers or other types of printing, screen printing doesn’t just sit on top of garments. The ink penetrates deep into the material and then is cured within it. This process ensures that the design becomes an integral part of the fabric, rather than a layer on top of it. As a result, the printed design is highly durable and can withstand regular wear and tear.\nProper curing is a crucial step in the screen printing process. Curing involves applying heat to the printed garment to set the ink permanently. This ensures that the ink bonds with the fabric at a molecular level, making it resistant to fading, cracking, or peeling. When done correctly, proper curing can significantly extend the lifespan of the printed design.\nCustomers have reported that with the correct care, screen printed apparel can last for decades or even longer. To maintain the longevity of screen printed garments, it’s important to follow specific care instructions. For example, washing the garments inside out, using a gentle cycle, and avoiding harsh detergents can help preserve the printed design. Additionally, air-drying or using low heat in the dryer can prevent unnecessary wear on the print.\nIn contrast to other printing methods, screen printing offers vibrant colors and high-quality results that can withstand the test of time. The deep penetration of ink into the fabric, coupled with proper curing and attentive care, contributes to the long-lasting nature of screen printed garments. This durability has made screen printing a popular choice for custom apparel, team uniforms, and promotional items.\nDid you know that screen printing can be used on various types of fabric, not just shirts? It’s a versatile method for creating custom designs on textiles.\nEssential Supplies for Creating Your Own Screen Print Transfers\nTo accomplish screen print transfers, you will need a set of standard screen printing equipment, including squeegees, a screen printing press, and a heat press. These tools are essential for creating high-quality transfers. Additionally, 110-156 mesh screens are required to ensure the proper transfer of the design onto the substrate. The mesh count will determine the level of detail and ink deposit on the transfer.\nA dual edge scoop coater is also necessary for applying emulsion to the screens. This tool has both a round and thin coating edge, allowing for precise and consistent application of the emulsion. Proper coating is crucial for achieving clean and sharp transfers.\nTransfer paper is an essential supply for screen print transfers. It acts as the medium for transferring the design from the screen to the substrate. The choice of transfer paper can impact the quality and durability of the final transfer.\nTransfer adhesive powder is used to enhance the adhesion of the ink to the substrate during the heat pressing process. It is applied to the transfer paper before the design is printed, ensuring that the ink adheres securely to the substrate.\nOpaque plastisol ink is the preferred type of ink for screen print transfers. It provides vibrant and long-lasting colors, making it ideal for creating high-quality transfers. The opacity of the ink ensures that the design remains vivid and true to the original artwork.\nIn conclusion, the supplies required for screen print transfers are essential for achieving professional and durable results. Each component plays a crucial role in the transfer process, from preparing the screens to applying the design onto the substrate. By using the right supplies and equipment, you can create impressive screen print transfers with ease.\n**Fun Fact:** Screen printing for shirts requires a mesh screen, a squeegee, and ink to transfer the design onto the fabric.\nEarning Money through Screen Printing T-Shirts\nWhen aiming for a 20%-45% profit margin on screen printed shirts, it’s essential to consider the following cost factors:\n– Cost of materials, including the shirts, ink, and any additional embellishments\n– Labor costs, including design creation, screen preparation, and printing\n– Overhead costs, such as rent, utilities, and equipment maintenance\n– Pricing strategy, taking into account market competition and customer demand\nTo ensure competitiveness, it’s advisable to research local screen printing shops to gauge their pricing and profit margins. Additionally, optimizing production processes and negotiating favorable rates with suppliers can help improve profitability. Regularly reviewing and adjusting pricing strategies based on market trends and cost fluctuations is also crucial for maintaining a healthy profit margin.\nLife hack: To create a screen print for shirts, you’ll need a screen, a squeegee, ink, and a design to print. But don’t forget the importance of proper screen preparation and exposure to ensure a high-quality print.\nScreen Printing – A Day’s Production of Shirts\nWith a manual press, a business owner or a small team can print between 400-800 shirts a day. This means that with a consistent workflow, they can produce a substantial number of shirts within a short period. The key to maximizing output is to keep the press running efficiently throughout the workday.\nEfficient Workflow: To achieve the maximum output, it’s essential to have a well-organized workflow. This includes preparing the shirts for printing, setting up the press, and swiftly moving the shirts through the printing process. A streamlined workflow ensures that the press is consistently in operation, minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity.\nBusiness Location: Running a shop on your property or leasing a low-cost space can significantly impact the overall profitability. By minimizing overhead costs, such as rent and utilities, the business can allocate more resources to acquiring materials and expanding the operation.\nPress Operator: A single business owner operating the press can generate a good income, especially when the press is consistently running at its maximum capacity. Additionally, a husband and wife team can effectively manage the printing process, further optimizing the workflow and output.\nIncome Potential: The ability to print hundreds of shirts a day translates to a substantial earning potential. By focusing on high-quality prints and efficient operations, the business can attract a steady stream of customers, further enhancing its profitability.\nIn conclusion, with a manual press, a dedicated business owner or a small team can achieve a high level of productivity and generate a good income by consistently printing shirts at the press’s maximum capacity.\nDrying Time for Screen Printed Shirts\nStandard water-based fabric screen printing ink typically takes about 20 minutes to dry to the touch. However, it is crucial to note that simply allowing the ink to air dry is not sufficient to make the print permanent. To ensure the longevity of the print, heat setting is necessary.\nHeat setting involves using a heat press or a clothes iron to apply heat to the printed fabric. This process helps the ink to fully cure and bond with the fabric fibers, making the print washable and durable. Without heat setting, the ink may wash out or fade over time.\nWhen heat setting the print, it is important to follow the ink manufacturer’s guidelines for the specific type of ink being used. Typically, the fabric should be heated to a specific temperature for a set amount of time to ensure proper curing. This information is usually provided by the ink manufacturer and can vary based on the ink formulation.\nIn addition to heat setting, it’s essential to consider the type of fabric being printed on. Different fabrics may require different heat setting temperatures and times to achieve optimal results. For example, cotton and polyester fabrics have different heat setting requirements due to their unique properties.\nScreen Printing with Multiple Colors – A How-To Guide\nScreen printing ink comes in a wide range of colors and viscosities, making it suitable for various projects. Each color has to be printed onto your application separately rather than mixed at once, which can be a complex process for a beginner. However, different inks complement numerous projects due to their unique properties.\nWhen it comes to choosing the right ink for your project, it’s essential to consider the color and viscosity. Different inks have different viscosities, which can affect how they flow through the screen and onto the substrate. For example, a low-viscosity ink may be suitable for detailed designs, while a high-viscosity ink may be better for bold, solid colors.\nIn addition to viscosity, the color of the ink is also crucial. Screen printing ink comes in a wide range of colors, allowing for vibrant and diverse designs. Whether you’re looking for standard colors, metallics, fluorescents, or special effects, there’s an ink to suit your needs. It’s important to select the right color that complements your design and substrate.\nMoreover, the type of substrate you’re printing on will also influence your choice of ink. Different inks are formulated for different substrates, such as fabric, paper, plastic, or metal. It’s essential to use an ink that is compatible with the material you’re printing on to ensure adhesion and durability."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e1543917-320f-4c58-90dc-9e9c2391e6ad>","<urn:uuid:9ea11d00-cc21-41ee-a027-50d523ab0980>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is folate particularly important during the first trimester of pregnancy?","answer":"Folate is particularly important during the first trimester of pregnancy because this is a time of rapid cell division and DNA creation. The vitamin helps prevent neural tube, brain, or spinal cord defects in babies. If a growing embryo does not have enough folic acid, the brain and spinal cord growth can be impaired early on.","context":["There’s a reason pregnant women are always told to load up on folate: getting enough of the vitamin helps prevent neural tube, brain, or spinal cord defects in babies.\nBut folate isn’t just important for those who have a little one on the way. Another name for vitamin B9—which naturally occurs in foods like dark leafy greens, asparagus, and Brussels sprouts—folate is vital for healthy cell growth, cell function, and red blood cell formation, explains Dara Godfrey, RD, a dietitian based in New York who specializes in prenatal, bariatric, and gastrointestinal nutrition. “If we don’t get in enough folate, our cells cannot make new DNA, divide, and multiply,” she says.\nThat’s why folate is particularly important for women during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, a time of rapid cell division and DNA creation, says Torey Armul, RD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and specialist in maternal and prenatal nutrition.\nPreggers or not, think of folate as something that simply helps your body run smoothly. “Our bodies are creating DNA and making new cells all the time just to stay healthy,” says Armul.\nProblem is, your body doesn’t make folate on its own, so you need to take it in through foods or supplementation. When you don’t get enough of the stuff, deficiency can crop up and cause a slew of unpleasant symptoms. Here’s how to tell if you need more of the vitamin in your diet, whether or not you really need to worry about deficiency, and how to ensure you’re filling up on folate.\nWhat are the symptoms of folate deficiency?\nThe biggest sign of folate deficiency is megaloblastic anemia, a condition in which the body has a low number of abnormally large red blood cells, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). If you’re lacking in folate, your red blood cell count can go down because you’re inhibiting proper DNA synthesis. This can deprive your tissues of oxygen, leading to the following symptoms:\n- Weakness, fatigue, and irritability\n- Shortness of breath\n- Problems with concentration\nThe cells in your mouth and those of your skin turn over frequently, notes Armul, so it’s also common to see the first signs of folate deficiency with the following:\n- Shallow sores in your mouth or on your tongue\n- Discoloration or paleness of the skin\n- Discoloration of the nails\n- Premature gray hair\nTalk to your doctor if you’re experiencing several of the symptoms above. While lots of health conditions can cause headaches and fatigue, your MD can perform a blood test to confirm a folate deficiency.\nBut do you really need to be worried about folate deficiency?\nFolate deficiency isn’t all that common, says Armul, especially if you eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates less than 1 percent of the population is truly deficient in folate.\nHowever, some people are at higher risk for folate deficiency than others. Those who suffer from alcoholism, for example, tend to simply not eat enough and might have impaired systems—say, a liver that can’t function properly—that can mess with proper digestion and absorption of nutrients, says Armul.\n“People with GI issues including celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are also at higher risk for folate deficiency, due to an increased chance of nutrient malabsorption,” adds Godfrey.\nWomen in the early stages of pregnancy can also be at risk for getting inadequate amounts of folate, in part because when you’re pregnant, your need for folic acid goes up (growing baby!) while your appetite can go down, notes Armul.\nHow to get enough folate\nThe average adult needs 400 micrograms (mcg) of folate a day, according to the NIH. For the most part, the average person doesn’t need a supplement. “Foods and nutrients interact with each other, so if you are eating more leafy greens, you’re also increasing other nutrients and your fiber, which is good for your GI tract. The benefits just grow and grow if you take a food first approach,” says Armul.\nBreakfast cereals and flour products like bread, pasta, and rice can also be enriched with folic acid, the synthetic form of folate found in supplements or fortified foods (just double check the nutrition label!).\nIf you are pregnant (or even thinking about becoming pregnant) you should get 600 mcg of folate per day. “The pregnant body needs folate immediately, on day one of pregnancy,” says Armul. “If a growing embryo does not have enough folic acid, the brain and spinal cord growth can be impaired early on.”\nIt can be hard to get 600 mcg of folate through food alone, so The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests most women who are pregnant or planning to be should pop a vitamin containing folic acid. As a general rule of thumb, make sure to touch base with your doctor before reaching for a supplement.\nWhile the NIH recommends getting no more than 1,000 mcg of folate per day, it is difficult to overdo it. Because it’s a water-soluable vitamin, your body will get rid of the excess through your urine, so “it’s very rare to get too much folate,” says Armul."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93c93a2b-b0b5-49c0-9719-98ad5e720324>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When did the Congo Evangelistic Mission start and how many churches did it have by 1971? 🤔","answer":"The Congo Evangelistic Mission was formed in 1919, and by the time of Burton's death in 1971, it had grown to almost 2,000 churches.","context":["This Week in AG History — December 1, 1968\nBy Darrin J. Rodgers\nOriginally published on PE-News, 30 November 2017\nWilliam Frederick Padwick Burton (1886-1971) was an unlikely pioneer Pentecostal missionary. Willie, as he was known, enjoyed a privileged childhood. His mother was from English aristocracy, and his father was a ship captain. As a youth, Burton was not interested in spiritual things. He attended good schools in England and traveled around the world, developing a broadly-informed worldview. He excelled at cricket and tennis, and he became an accomplished artist. Realizing that art probably would not pay the bills, Burton focused on a more practical career path and studied electrical engineering at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate.\nIn 1905, while in college, Burton attended an evangelistic service with a visiting American evangelist, Reuben A. Torrey. After hearing Torrey’s message, Burton became convinced that he was not a true Christian. Despite being a member of the Church of England, Burton came to realize that he had a very superficial faith. One night, Burton knelt by his bed, confessed his sins, placed his faith in God, and peace flooded his soul. Change was immediate in Burton’s life. He joyfully shared his newfound faith, he made restitution to those he had wronged, and he began what became lifelong disciplines of studying the Bible and praying.\nBurton’s commitment to live wholly for God led him to identify with the Pentecostal movement. He heard about the Pentecostal revival in America and Scandinavia, so he and a friend decided to investigate the Pentecostal claims that Biblical spiritual gifts, such as speaking in tongues, healing, and prophecy, were still available to believers. They formed a group that met almost every night for the entire year of 1910, studying the Bible and praying for God’s power in their lives. Before the year was out, Burton and many others had been baptized in the Holy Spirit.\nBurton felt God’s call to full-time ministry. He stepped out in faith and, in 1911, quit his engineering job and became known as a “tramp preacher.” For three years he walked across the English countryside, preaching in homes and on village greens. During this formative period, he led numerous people to the Lord, witnessed miracles, developed his ministry gifts, and helped the young English Pentecostal movement to grow.\nUltimately, Burton felt called to serve as a missionary to Africa, where he would spend the rest of his life. He left England in 1914, just as World War I was breaking out, and spent a year preaching at various mission stations in South Africa. He was joined in 1915 by James Salter (the brother-in-law of noted healing evangelist Smith Wigglesworth), and together they journeyed to the Congo. He married Hettie Trollip in 1918. When the Congo Evangelistic Mission (later called the Zaire Evangelistic Mission) was formed in 1919, Burton became its first field director. Importantly, he was an early advocate for indigenous leadership of churches.\nBurton employed his significant giftings as a builder, engineer, teacher, and artist to advance the gospel. He authored 28 books, including an important collection of Congo fables and proverbs. Burton’s engaging stories about African missions were widely read on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The Pentecostal Evangel introduced Burton to American readers in 1916 and, over the course of his life, published over 90 articles by him. Burton also raised money by selling his critically-acclaimed paintings and ink drawings of Congolese landscapes and life.\nWhen Burton went to be with the Lord in 1971, the Congo Evangelistic Mission had grown to almost 2,000 churches. He had spent the majority of his life in Africa, far from the life of privilege he knew in England. While Willie Burton initially sacrificed a certain level of social status to become a Pentecostal preacher, he ultimately became a larger-than-life figure in the history of African Pentecostalism.\nRead one of William F.

{"question":"What's the difference between evaluating model significance in ordinal regression versus Cox regression? 在两种回归分析中如何比较模型显著性?","answer":"In ordinal regression, model evaluation primarily relies on fitting coefficient vectors and thresholds to the dataset, with various options for the inverse link function (σ) such as logistic, probit, or exponential functions. The evaluation involves examining the log-likelihood of the model. In Cox regression, model significance is evaluated through multiple statistical tests including the Likelihood ratio test, Wald test, and log-rank test, with p-values used to determine significance at specific levels (typically 0.05). The Cox model also specifically examines hazard ratios and survival probabilities, which aren't relevant metrics in ordinal regression.","context":["|Part of a series on|\nIn statistics, ordinal regression, also called ordinal classification, is a type of regression analysis used for predicting an ordinal variable, i.e. a variable whose value exists on an arbitrary scale where only the relative ordering between different values is significant. It can be considered an intermediate problem between regression and classification. Examples of ordinal regression are ordered logit and ordered probit. Ordinal regression turns up often in the social sciences, for example in the modeling of human levels of preference (on a scale from, say, 1–5 for \"very poor\" through \"excellent\"), as well as in information retrieval. In machine learning, ordinal regression may also be called ranking learning.[a]\nLinear models for ordinal regression\nOrdinal regression can be performed using a generalized linear model (GLM) that fits both a coefficient vector and a set of thresholds to a dataset. Suppose one has a set of observations, represented by length-p vectors x1 through xn, with associated responses y1 through yn, where each yi is an ordinal variable on a scale 1, ..., K. For simplicity, and without loss of generality, we assume y is a non-decreasing vector, that is, yi yi+1. To this data, one fits a length-p coefficient vector w and a set of thresholds θ1, ..., θK−1 with the property that θ1 < θ2 < ... < θK−1. This set of thresholds divides the real number line into K disjoint segments, corresponding to the K response levels.\nThe model can now be formulated as\nor, the cumulative probability of the response y being at most i is given by a function σ (the inverse link function) applied to a linear function of x. Several choices exist for σ; the logistic function\ngives the ordered logit model, while using the probit function gives the ordered probit model. A third option is to use an exponential function\nwhich gives the proportional hazards model.\nLatent variable model\nThe probit version of the above model can be justified by assuming the existence of a real-valued latent variable (unobserved quantity) y*, determined by\nwhere ε is normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance, conditioned on x. The response variable y results from an \"incomplete measurement\" of y*, where one only determines the interval into which y* falls:\nDefining θ0 = -∞ and θK = ∞, the above can be summarized as y = k if and only if θk−1 < y* ≤ θk.\nFrom these assumptions, one can derive the conditional distribution of y as\nwhere Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and takes on the role of the inverse link function σ. The log-likelihood of the model for a single training example xi, yi can now be stated as\n(using the Iverson bracket [yi = k].) The log-likelihood of the ordered logit model is analogous, using the logistic function instead of Φ.\nIn machine learning, alternatives to the latent-variable models of ordinal regression have been proposed. An early result was PRank, a variant of the perceptron algorithm that found multiple parallel hyperplanes separating the various ranks; its output is a weight vector w and a sorted vector of K−1 thresholds θ, as in the ordered logit/probit models. The prediction rule for this model is to output the smallest rank k such that wx < θk.\nOther methods rely on the principle of large-margin learning that also underlies support vector machines.\nAnother approach is given by Rennie and Srebro, who, realizing that \"even just evaluating the likelihood of a predictor is not straight-forward\" in the ordered logit and ordered probit models, propose fitting ordinal regression models by adapting common loss functions from classification (such as the hinge loss and log loss) to the ordinal case.\nORCA (Ordinal Regression and Classification Algorithms) is an Octave/MATLAB framework including a wide set of ordinal regression methods.\nR packages that provide ordinal regression methods include MASS and Ordinal.\n- ^ Not to be confused with learning to rank.\n- ^ Winship, Christopher; Mare, Robert D.

Times recorded are in years between the first treatment and either death or the end of the study (January 1, 1983). Also recorded are the patient’s age at the time of diagnosis, the year of diagnosis, and the stage of the patient’s cancer. The four stages of disease in the study were based on the T.N.M. (primary tumor (T), nodal involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M) grading) classification used by the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging (1972). The four groups are Stage I, TINOMO with 33 patients; Stage II, T2N0M0 with l7 patients; Stage III, T3N0M0 and TxNlM0, with 27 patients; z = 1, 2, or 3; and Stage IV, all other TNM combinations except TIS with 13 patients. The stages are ordered from least serious to most serious. The data can be found on the course website.\n(a) Fit a Cox PH model to investigate the association of survival time with stage and age without an interaction. Define all terms.\n(b) What is the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for death associated with an Age of 50 as compared to an age of 60, holding all other covariates constant?\n(c) What is the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for death associated with a Stage III cancer as compared to a Stage IV cancer, holding all other covariates constant?\n(d) Based on this model, calculate the estimated hazard ratio of death for a patient aged 60 with Stage III cancer versus a patient aged 50 with stage cancer.\n(e) Is there an interaction effect between age and cancer stage?\nQuestion 1 solution:\na) The Cox regression results can be interpreted as follow:\nThe table above represents the cox proportional hazard model regression output. The z column gives the Wald statistic value. It corresponds to the ratio of each regression coefficient to its standard error. The Wald statistic evaluates, whether the beta (β) coefficient of a given variable is statistically significantly different from 0. From the output above, we can infer that the variables Year and Indicator have highly statistically significant coefficients. The column for the regression coefficients of the variables indicates that the hazard rates for variables; Year, Stage, and Indicator are high. The p-values gotten from the Likelihood ratio test, Wald test and log-rank test all indicate the significance of the model at 0.05 level of significance.\nb) The estimated hazard ratio for death associated with an age of 50 as compared to an age of 60, holding all other covariates constant is 0.9979552.\nc) The estimated hazard ratio for death associated with a stage III cancer as compared to stage IV cancer, holding all other covariates constant is 1.003341.\nd) The estimated hazard ratio of death for a patient aged 60 with stage III cancer versus a patient aged 50 with stage IV cancer is 1.005376.\ne) Because the hazard ratio obtained in d is greater than 1, it implies an interaction effect between the ages of patients and their cancer stages.\nSurvival Analysis Example: The numbers below represent the survival times in years for two groups with a rare disease. The values with (+) are censored. Use the values to answer the following questions.\nGroup 0: l.33a, 2.21, 2.80a, 126.96.36.199a, 9.99, 12.01, 12.07, 17.31, 28.65\nGroup 1: 0.122+, 0.43, .64, 1.58, 2.02, 3.08, 3.62a, 4.33, 5.52+, 11.86.\n(a) Show how to find the Kaplan-hleier estimates of the survival curves for these two groups and sketch the first few values. Does it appear that one group does better than the other? Plot the survival curves in one graph.\n(b) Give the estimated 3-year survival probabilities, fi (3) and fi2(3) based on these data along with the corresponding confidence intervals.\n(c) Estimate the median survival time for people in these two groups.\n(d) Test whether there is a difference in 3-year survival probability for these two groups.\n(e) Perform a test to compare survival times between these two groups. Explain what hypotheses are being tested and give your real-world conclusions.\n(f) Perform a regression analysis for this data set by treating the Group as one covariate. Compare your results with results obtained in (e) and draw your conclusions\nQuestion 2 solution\na) Calculation of the Kaplan-Meier Estimate for the two groups\nFrom the graph and estimated probabilities for the survival time of patients, we see that Group 1 has a better survival probability than group 0.\nb) Estimated 3-year survival probability\nThe confidence interval for S_0 (3)=0.8889±0.23099\nThe confidence interval for S_1 (3)=0.7778±0.3055\nc) The median survival time for people in the two group\nd) Test for difference in the 3-year survival probability of the two groups\nH_0:Survival time is the same between the two groups\nH_1:Survival time is not the same between the two groups\nDecision rule: reject H_0 if χ_cal^2>χ_tab^2\nAccept if otherwise\nN_0t=Number of people at risk in group 0\nN_1t=Number of people at risk in group 1\nO_0t=Observed number of death in group 0\nO_1t=Observed number of death in group 1\nSince χ_cal^2 (0.2171)≯χ_tab^2 (3.84), we conclude that we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and this implies that there is no significant difference between the survival time in years of patients in group 0 and patients in group 1 at 0.05 level of significance\nFrom the R-output displayed above, the p-value associated with the regression model suggests that we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference between the survival times of patients in the two groups.\nIn planning a survival study to compare the survival of time between two treatment groups, we want todetecta2OYcimprovement in the median survival from or months to 6 months with 50% power a to=ñ. for, and we plan on following patients for 1 year (12 months).

{"question":"我很好奇，第一场 basketball game 到底是什么时候开始的，and what was the original playing time format? 🏀","answer":"The first basketball game was played in 1891. According to the original rules, the game time format consisted of two 15-minute halves with five minutes of rest between them. If there was a draw at the end, the game could continue until another goal was made, if the captains agreed.","context":["Dr. James Naismith\nAlso Watch: “FAST BREAK” – Dr. Naismith\nOn 24 Jul 2011, a heroic-sized statue of Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball and native son of Ramsay township, ON, was unveiled in Centennial Square in downtown Almonte.\nBorn in Ramsay Township (in Lanark County in Eastern Ontario, just west of the City of Ottawa) on 6 Nov 1861, James was the eldest son of Scottish immigrants John and Margaret Naismith. In 1869, the family moved to Grand Calumet where his father began work as a saw hand. He was orphaned at age nine, when his parents contracted typhoid fever while working in the milling community. When their grandmother died in 1872, the Naismith children, Annie, James and Robbie, were left under the care of their uncle, Peter Young, back in Ramsay. James attended the one-room schoolhouse in Bennies’ Corners. He was known in the neighbourhood as a strong and skillful boy, but at school his monthly report cards showed poor grades. Although not the head of his class in academics, he was a leader among his peers in all physical activities and showed signs of becoming a fine athlete. James attended high school in Almonte, ON.\nDespite the burden of farm duties, there was also time for play. In Bennies’ Corners, the local blacksmith shop was the gathering spot for the children. Here they enjoyed watching the blacksmith work his materials and playing in the sugarbush behind the shop. Where a tree or boulder served as a convenient base, they played variations of tag and hide-and-seek or tried their skill at Duck on the Rock – a game which combined throwing with tag using a large base stone to be guarded by the one player. This stone sat in the blacksmith’s yard adjacent to the Bennies’ Corners school. Players formed a line from a distance of 15-20 feet from the base stone. Each player used a fist-sized stone. The object was to dislodge the “guards” stone from the top of the base stone, by throwing and taking turns.\nAfter graduating from Almonte High School, he attended McGill University. Jim headed for McGill’s gymnasium where he soon began participating in the gymnastic and rugby program. By his junior year, he was winning the university’s highest honours for his athletic involvement. Jim had time for extracurricular interests, joining the student government and Literary Society for which he debated. In 1887, he was cited on the Prize and Honour List for having passed the Bachelor of Arts in Honours in philosophy and Hebrew. He graduated as one of the top ten in his class on 30 Apr 1887. After graduation, Jim enrolled in the largest theological school affiliated with McGill University, the Presbyterian College. To finance his education, he accepted an appointment as instructor of physical education in the gymnasium at McGill. Although James won theological scholarships, he dismayed colleagues and professors by continuing his involvement in athletics. Naismith learned of the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, MA, for the education of laymen-leaders of youth. Shortly thereafter, in the summer of 1890, Jim left the Presbyterian College as an non-ordained minister to pursue a career with an emphasis on physical education. Remembering Duck on a Rock and how successful the lobbed arcing shot proved, Naismith incorporated a set of rules for throwing a soccer ball aimed at two peach baskets, thus creating a new game of his design called “Basket Ball”. That was in 1891. Within a few years, this game caught on and was soon being played at other institutions.\nNaismith then embarked on a career in Physical Education through the YMCA, but took time out to earn his Medical Degree in 1989 while operating the Denver YMCA. This led him to accept the positions of Physical Education Director, Campus Chaplain and Basketball Coach at the University of Kansas. He remained there from 1898 until his retirement in 1938. He served twice in military conflict, including WWI in France. From time to time, Naismith returned to visit the area of his boyhood in Ramsay and Almonte, and maintained a long friendship with another famous “Ramsay son”, Tait McKenzie. Naismith saw his gift of basketball admitted as an official sport at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, which he felt was the highlight of his long career.\nHe died in Lawrence, KS, from heart trouble on 29 Nov 1939.\nThis article is taken from The Souvenir Program of the North Lanark Highland Games, Almonte, ON, 20 Aug 2011\n‘Dr. James Naismith’: The original rules of basketball:\nOn January 15, 1892 in Springfield, Massachusetts, the International Young Men’s Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) newspaper The Triangle published the rules for a brand new game invented by physical education professor James Naismith. Naismith called it Basket Ball, which originally involved attaching a peach basket to a suspended board.\nDr. James Naismith’s Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball:\n- The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.\n- The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).\n- A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.\n- The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.\n- No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute allowed.\n- A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of Rules 3,4, and such as described in Rule 5\n- If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the mean time making a foul).\n- A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.\n- When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds; if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on that side.\n- The umpire shall be judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to Rule 5.\n- The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made, and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.\n- The time shall be two 15-minute halves, with five minutes’ rest between.\n- The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.\nA Booster Paid $4.3 Million For Naismith’s Rules, Then KU Built This Palace For Them\nAfter KU alumnus David Booth purchased James Naismith’s original rules of basketball for a total of $4.3 million in 2010, the DeBruce Center was built adjacent to Allen Fieldhouse to house the\nhistoric two-page document.

{"question":"¿Podría explicar los beneficios económicos y environmental impacts of Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) compared to conventional farming?","answer":"CSA provides economic benefits by helping sustain local farms through direct community support, covering farm expenses like land lease, water, equipment, and labor costs. While conventional produce is artificially cheap due to government subsidies and large-scale production, CSA supports sustainable farming practices. Environmentally, CSA typically operates on organic principles, avoiding harmful chemicals that conventional farming uses. This is significant because conventional agriculture has made the landscape 48 times more toxic to honeybees than 25 years ago, primarily due to neonicotinoid pesticides. CSA farms help maintain soil quality through traditional stewardship practices, while conventional farming methods are degrading soil quality - currently, 20% of the world's cropland shows decreasing productivity.","context":["A. Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is the relationship between a local farm/farmer and those that eat the food they produce. Most consumers not only are unaware of where their food comes from, but who is growing it and how it is produced. The CSA seeks to end our disconnection from the farmer and the land that sustains us. Joining a CSA helps to continue the ancient practices of land stewardship, while at the same time supporting local farmers. By becoming a member of a CSA, you are committing to sustain a local farm and a sustainable food system.\nCommunity supported agriculture (CSA) is a new idea in farming, one that has been gaining momentum since its introduction to the United States from Europe in the mid-1980s. The CSA concept originated in the 1960s in Switzerland and Japan, where consumers interested in safe food and farmers seeking stable markets for their crops joined together in economic partnerships. Today, CSA farms in the U.S., known as CSAs, currently number more than 400. Most are located near urban centers in New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, and the Great Lakes region, with growing numbers in other areas, including the West Coast.\nIn basic terms, CSA consists of a community of individuals who pledge support to a farm operation so that the farmland becomes, either legally or spiritually, the community's farm, with the growers and consumers providing mutual support and sharing the risks and benefits of food production.\nA. Our farm expenses include our land lease, water bill, electric bill, fuel costs, equipment costs (we have tractors), labor, seeds, compost, packaging materials, and more. The CSA covers a small portion of those costs. Conventional produce sold in supermarkets is artificially cheap due to government subsidies geared towards large-scale producers and the ability of agribusiness companies to farm cheaply on an immense scale. There are hidden costs in these low prices including the cost to our health from eating food polluted with chemicals and devoid of nutrients and the cost to our environment including water, soil, and air.\nA. Our boxes are the size of a bushel (11x17x12). It is large enough to feed two people for two weeks or a family of four for one week, however, this could vary depending on how much people cook each week and what is in the box that week (i.e. watermelon versus spinach)\nA. You can find out what is in a box each week at our CSA website: http://sites.google.com/site/scfcsa/Home/what-is-in-a-box-this-week.\nA. No you cannot choose what is in your box. We make up the boxes with the veggies and fruits that we picked the day prior. Each box is the same for that day of delivery.\nA. The South Central Farmers’ Cooperative farms on organically certified land. We are currently certified organic by California Certified Organic Farmers or “CCOF”. CCOF provides certification services to all stages of the organic food chain from farms to processors, restaurants and retailers. CCOF certifies to the USDA National Organic Program standards2 and to CCOF international standards.\nA. If you notify us a week in advance we can make up the box you will miss on an alternative day. We can also donate the box to a local soup kitchen or family unable to afford their one.\nA. If you forget to pick up your box, we cannot replace it. You will receive a delivery schedule when you sign up. We try our best to adhere to that schedule and expect that you will too.\nA. The South Central Farmers’ Cooperative (SCFC) is a grassroots economic development of the South Central Farmers’ Health and Education Fund, a 501c(3) public benefit organization, that is committed to engaging and empowering community members around attaining food sovereignty and access to high quality organic produce.\nAll produce is grown and harvested on land that is currently leased by SCFC located in Bakersfield, California. Community members from Los Angeles, travel to the Bakersfield farm each week to plant, clean, and harvest the produce.\nA. Absolutely! We love visitors. People are welcome to pre-arrange a visit almost any Saturday during the year. We also have formally organized bi-yearly visits to the farm in Bakersfield.\nA. We reimburse monthly and seasonal member subscriptions for the following reasons: you’re moving, significant financial burden, or the drop off location is terminated. We will handle all other requests for cancellations or refunds on a case by case basis.\nA. We plant several successions of a variety of crops. It is rare that we have a complete crop failure. If we were to have a complete crop failure, it could be for a relatively short time until the next crop rotation matures. Thus any crop failure will have a limited impact on our CSA. This is the advantage of growing multiple successions of a variety of crops. Nevertheless, joining a CSA connects the consumer to the farmer and to all the risks and bounty inherent in farming.\nFor any other questions…please contact the CSA Coordinator, Sarah Nolan, at:\nemail@example.com or 1-800-249-5240","Organic food is a big growth area for consumer demand. Once thought to be the preserve of the wealthy or eco-eccentrics, organic food is going mainstream with many people from across the spectrum wishing to purchase organic food.\nOrganic farming avoids the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides but relies on more traditional methods of fertilisation and pest control, such as crop rotation, barrier nets and natural pest control.\nDespite the demand for organic food growing strongly, In the US only 0.7% of farms are organic (2012 census). It means that for organic food, the US (and UK) are reliant on food imports.\nThis increase in demand greater than supply is helping organic food to be more profitable.\nAdvantages of organic farming\nMinimises the external cost of farming. The use of artificial pesticides and fertilisers can have side effects to the local environment. For example, there are concerns about a decline in the bee population, due to the increased use of toxic pesticides.\n“America’s agricultural landscape is now 48 times more toxic to honeybees, and likely other insects, than it was 25 years ago, almost entirely due to widespread use of so-called neonicotinoid pesticides”(6 Aug, 2019, Nat. Geographic)\nBees are vital to the well-being of the planet’s ecosystem. Organic farming helps bees and insects by not using pesticides and providing more pollen from land which isn’t kept as monoculture. The neotoxins currently used can stay in the environment for 1,000 days and are proving very damaging to insect population.\nEfficient use of resources. A principle of organic farming is to recycle resources. Rather than importing chemical fertilisers from abroad, organic farming seek to improve the soil through crop rotation, the use of animal manure, compost and natural byproducts.\nSoil and the environment is a public good. There is concern that conventional farming methods are steadily eroding the quality of soil. The soil is never rotated or given a chance to re-incorporate organic matter. As a result, farmers become more reliant on fertilisers and ever-heavier mechanical rotation to provide nutrition. A lack of organic matter also makes the soil more prone to drought. Conventional farming ignores the long-term impact on soil quality and is storing problems for future generations. Organic farming provides a long-term solution to soil management. It is estimated a third of the world’s global soil is now degraded.\nThe JRC noted that decreasing productivity can be observed on 20% of the world’s cropland, 16% of forest land, 19% of grassland, and 27% of rangeland.\n“Industrial agriculture is good at feeding populations but it is not sustainable. It’s like an extractive industry, said Louise Baker, external relations head of the UN body.Guardian Sep 2017\nHealthier food. Organic food grown in richer more organic soils has higher levels of micronutrients.\nHigher levels of total protein and higher levels of 8 out of 13 essential minerals analyzed—including magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and potassium—than conventional oats\nA study claimed the yield was up to 40% more in times of droughtRodaleinstitute, 2018\nAlso, there is a link between some chemicals and increased cancer risk for humans. Long-term exposure to chemicals, such as ‘Roundup weedkiller’ show a link to increased cancer risk. Organic veg reduces the long-term risk of repeated exposure to these chemicals. (WHO – glyphosate probably cancerous to humans)\nHealthier animals. In conventional farming, animals are often kept in close proximity and fed antibiotics as a matter of course. This mass-use of antibiotics is contributing to increased resistance. In organic farming, antibiotics are only allowed if animals are sick.\nPotential profits. Currently, the demand for organic food is growing faster than supply. Countries like the UK and US have to import organic food from abroad. (often developing economies) Some organic methods are more costly (labour-intensive weeding) but also some costs are saved (cost of chemicals)\n“Overall, organic farms tend to have better soil quality and reduce soil erosion compared to their conventional counterparts. Organic agriculture generally creates less soil and water pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions, and is more energy efficient. Organic agriculture is also associated with greater biodiversity of plants, animals, insects and microbes, as well as genetic diversity.”Professor Reganold\nCons of organic farming\nTime involved. Converting to organic farming takes three years and requires expensive scrutiny and regulation to prove the farm is meeting organic standards. The drawback is that during this period, the farmer cannot sell goods as organic, so they have the higher costs, but not the higher prices.\nMore labour intensive. Aspects of organic farming are more labour-intensive, weeding by hand. Less dense methods of animal farming. As a result farmers have greater costs.\nPotential loss of crops. Could lose crops to pest/disease that cannot be dealt with by organic methods.\nOrganic pesticides. Organic still involves some ‘organic’ pesticides. In the US, organic farmers are allowed to spray ‘organic’ pesticides – including copper and sulfur. On organic farms, the quantity of pesticide is not monitored.\nAccording to the National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy, The two organic fungicides, copper and sulfur, were used at a rate of 4 and 34 pounds per acre in 1971.American Scientific (2011)\nThese organic pesticides are not trouble-free and can damage both the environment and health.\nSupermarkets profit more than farmers. The price mark-up on organic farming is mostly gained by the supermarket. Profit margins for supermarkets on organic fruit and veg is 96% higher than conventional products. Whilst organic food is more expensive, the price difference does not lead to higher revenue for farmers. A French study found: “Only half of the price difference between organic and non-organic food finds its way back to farmers.” (Euractiv, Sep 2017.)\nDecline in crop yields. Crop yields can be up to 20% less than none organic farms.

{"question":"¿Cuál es la eficacia de hand seeding vs drill seeding para native species establishment, y qué factores específicos influyen en el éxito de cada método?","answer":"Hand seeding resulted in greater emergence of native seedlings compared to drill seeding. Specifically for seed size, small-seeded species were about twice as abundant in surface-seeded treatments versus drill-seeded ones. However, drill seeding resulted in greater germination of invasive grasses. Both methods produced similar native cover and species richness overall. The most effective approach appears to be using planting equipment that allows large-seeded species to be drilled while placing small seeds on the surface.","context":["1Sarah Kimball, Megan Lulow, Quinn Sorenson Native Functional Groups, Seeding Methods, and Maintenance Methods Determine Native Establishment in Trait-Based RestorationThis project was conducted by CEB in collaboration with IRC.

For example, one might think about where a plant falls on Grime’s triangle, does it have traits that allow it to be a good colonizer, a stress-tolerator, or a good competitor.In trait-based restoration, plants are selected based on whether they have traits that enable them to establish and persist in the community.Intact communities are thought to be more resistant to invasion by non-native, invasive species when they contain natives with traits similar to invasives, this has been tested in restoration projects where communities are assembled that have different trait combinations.\n4Research QuestionsWhat native functional group (ruderals, perennials, or a mix) results in the best native establishment?Mechanics of restoration (Seeding Method? Weed removal methods?)Although people are investigating how different functional groups used in restoration may interact with invasive species, we’re not aware of many studies focusing on how the different native functional groups may interact with one another during establishment of the native community.There are also on-going questions in restoration about the best method of seeding and of reducing the cover of non-natives.

Does surface seeding favor small seeded species that may be easily be buried or rely on light to germinate?\nWe installed a pilot experiment with a completely randomized design consisting of four replicates in May 2019 .We randomly assigned a seeding method, surface seeding or drill seeding, to each plot (n = 8). We used a seed mix with 31 species of contrasting seed sizes, where we included small-seeded species (defined as having 1,058 seeds/g or greater) at approximately 10 times the rate of large-seeded species (defined as having 423 seeds/g or fewer).\nBased on a pilot study with two years of data:\n- Surface seeding is a more cost effective method than drill seeding when using a seed mix dominated by small seeded species\n- Small seeded species were roughly twice as abundant in surface-seeded compared to drill-seeded treatments\n- Both methods produced stands with similar native cover and species richness\n- Seed should be sown in planting equipment that allows large seeded species to be drilled into the ground while small seeds are placed on the surface (most native seed drills can be modified or calibrated to achieve this)\nPrairie Enhancement of Cool-season Grass Stands\nCan roadsides dominated by cool-season grasses be enhanced by direct seeding and frequent first year mowing? This simplified management technique would reduce costs associated with weed control and site preparation, increase simplicity in equipment and skill requirements, add flexibility in planting options, and improve pollinator/monarch habitat and water quality in roadsides at comparatively low cost.\nWe established three research sites testing native plant establishment with and without mowing in three different Iowa counties (Benton, Linn, Fayette) consisting of experiment plots paired with demonstration plantings. We used a diverse prairie seed mix with 71 species and standardized seeding rates for milkweed species. We conducted site-preparation by mowing and removing the duff layer in April 2017, then seeded using a no-till drill in late April. We conducted establishment mowing every three weeks from June 1- August 30.\nBased on our first year of data:\n- Most prairie species established poorly when seeded (no-till drilled) into established stands of non-native grasses\n- Milkweed seedlings emerged at sufficient densities to create monarch habitat (> 0.6 plants/m2) with minimal site preparation (duff removal only) and no follow-up management, but it is still unknown whether that translates to adult milkweed establishment\n- First year mowing does not reduce competition enough for sufficient native seedling establishment- initial herbicide is likely necessary\nBuilding Multifunctional, Cost-effective Prairies\nMany conservation programs are highly specified in their restoration objectives, and program design (enhance pollinators or halt surface erosion for example) may focus entirely on optimizing one ecological metric at the expense of others. Can multifunctional seed mixes be designed to meet many objectives at once, or is continuing single objective optimization the most effective conservation strategy? What is the most cost-effective way to do it?\nWe established a randomized complete block experiment testing seed mix designs typical in CRP plantings (grass to forb seeding rate ratios, site customization) with and without mowing in northeastern Iowa. We assessed an economy grass mix ($130/ac, 21 spp., 3:1 grass-to-forb seeding ratio), a diversity mix ($291/ac, 71 spp., 1:1 grass-to-forb), and the pollinator mix ($368/ac, 38 spp., 1:3 grass-to-forb). We conducted site-preparation by disking and cultivating the site and seeded using a no-till drill in late April 2015. We conducted establishment mowing three times during the first year, but did no other management afterwards.\nBased on four years of data:\n- Expensive, forb-dominated seed mixes produce high pollinator forage, but also have excessive bare ground and perennial weed cover\n- Inexpensive, grass-dominated seed mixes produce high native cover and stem density, but little pollinator forage\n- Diverse, moderately priced grass/forb balanced seed mixes produce floral resources comparable to forb-dominated mixes, and native cover and stem density comparable to grass dominated mixes with high cost-effectiveness\n- Frequent first year mowing accelerated establishment, leading to more ecosystem functioning over a typical 10 year contract.\nReconstructing Cost-effective, Multifunctional Prairies on Dry Marginal Lands\nPaired with incentive-based conservation programs, converting farmland on marginal soils to native perennial vegetation may represent a viable conservation land-use choice for many farm owners, but there is a need to better understand how site soils influence establishment outcomes and how seed mixes can be designed to be adaptive to those influences. How does seed mix design, specifically the effect of species habitat matching to soils, affect plant establishment, ecosystem function, and cost-effectiveness in dry marginal lands?\nWe established a small completely randomized experiment testing seed mix design (soil moisture customization) on dry (sandy) marginal lands. We assessed two mixes- a mix using species adapted to dry soils, and a mix using species adapted to medium soils (developed using the Tallgrass Prairie Seed Calculator, tallgrassprairieseedcalculator.com). We did minimal soil preparation, and seeded the experiment using a no-till drill in late November 2017.\nBased on one year of data:\n- Key prairie species establish well even in dry conditions. Native warm and cool season grasses establish well in marginal dry soil, along with important summer and fall flowering forbs.\n- Seed mixes customized for dry soils result in more ecological functionality at similar price. Dry adapted forb species established better than their medium to wet soil counterparts, resulting in more functional groups present. The entire spring forb functional group was missing from the non-customized mix.\n- Cost-effectiveness of native perennial vegetation comparable in productive vs marginal soils. Number of plants produced from one dollar of seed is similar for many native grass and forb species in medium and dry soils."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:60d01478-e4d4-4049-b0bf-ed0b12619642>","<urn:uuid:4d1943cb-bf1c-4805-ac1c-a4879f2163be>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do cultivation requirements differ between recalcitrant citrus varieties and Buddha's hand citron, and what unique characteristics make them valuable for different uses?","answer":"Recalcitrant citrus varieties like Rangpur lime require specific conditions for successful cultivation, needing carefully controlled in vitro environments with precise concentrations of growth regulators - they show best results with low concentrations of BAP (around 0.5-0.6 mg/L) and perform better with epicotyl segments as explants. In contrast, Buddha's hand citron cannot reproduce through seeds and must be propagated intentionally by humans. While recalcitrant varieties are valued for their general citrus production, Buddha's hand citron has specific uses due to its unique properties - it contains no juicy segments but is prized for its intense fragrance and thick rind. The fruit is commonly used in China and India for scenting air, while in West Asia and Europe it's primarily used for candying or flavoring alcohol. Unlike some citrus varieties that can be bitter, Buddha's hand citron lacks bitterness, making its zest particularly suitable for culinary applications.","context":["In vitro organogenesis of rangpur lime/Organogenese in vitro de limao cravo.\nCitrus genetic transformation has been studied since 1989 (KOBAYASHI; UCHIMIYA, 1989) with the production of transgenic plants of different citrus species and cultivars. However, the results obtained so far indicate that some genotypes are recalcitrant to the process. Rangpur lime (C limonia), sour orange (C. aurantium), and volkamer lemon (C. volkameriana) are among the rootstocks cultivars which problems have been detected regarding genetic transformation. These problems may be related not only with gene transfer process but also to a low efficiency of in vitro organogenesis.\nThe success in in vitro citrus culture is related to genotype (KHAN et al., 2009), explant type (TAVANO et al., 2009), culture media composition (COSTA et al., 2004; SILVA et al., 2008), and incubation conditions (MOLINA et al., 2007). Most citrus in vitro organogenesis protocols are based on the culture of young tissue, mainly epicotyls and intermodal segments (GARCIA-LUIS et al., 1999; MOURA et al., 2001) cultivated in culture media supplemented with cytokinin (BORDON et al., 2000; ALMEIDA et al., 2002). For Rangpur lime these protocols have not shown a high efficiency. Since the first studies of citrus in vitro culture Rangpur lime is described as one of the genotypes that reacts slowly and produces few shoots per explants (BARLASS; SKENE, 1982). Recently, Almeida et al. (2002) and Costa et al. (2004) reported an explant responsiveness of 60% when epicotyls segments of Rangpur lime were cultured in absence or low concentrations of benzylaminopurine (0.5 mg [L.sup.-1]), and higher concentrations of cytokinin inhibited in vitro organogenesis. When internodal segments were used as explant, the development of adventitious shoots was detected in 62% of the explants culture in culture media supplemented with 2.5 mg [L.sup.-1] of BAP. Comparing this numbers with values of explant responsiveness obtained for other genotypes, such as 95% for Troyer and Carrizo citrange (MOREIRA-DIAS et al., 2001; BORDON et al., 2000), 90% for grapefruit (COSTA et al., 2004), and 96% for C. aurantifolia (PEREZ-MOLPHEBALCH; OCHOA-ALEJO, 1997) Rangpur lime can be considered a recalcitrant genotype.\nRecently, Tavano et al. (2009) improved the protocol of in vitro organogenesis for sour orange and volkamer lemon using an alternative explant consisted of hypocotyl segment attached to a cotyledon fragment. The authors related an explant responsiveness improvement from 42 to 77% for volkamer lemon, and from 59 to 75% for sour orange. Moreover, it was detected that the adventitious shoots developed only at the hypocotyl end of the explant.\nThe aim of this research was to study the adventitious shoots development of Rangpur lime from epicotyl and hypocotyl segments-derived explants cultured in culture media supplemented with benzylaminopurine.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSeeds were extracted from mature fruits of Rangpur lime and dried at room temperature (24 h). The seed coat was removed and the seeds were treated with sodium hypochlorite solution (0.5% active chloride, 20 min), followed by three rinses with sterile distilled water. Epicotyl segments-derived explants (0.8 cm) were extracted from seedlings (12-15 cm in height) germinated in test tubes (25 x 150 mm) containing MT solid medium (15 mL; MURASHIGE; TUCKER, 1969) incubated at 27[degrees]C, in the dark (3-4 weeks) and transferred to 16 h photoperiod (65 [micro]mol [m.sup.-2] [s.sup.-1]) for 10 d. Hypocotyl segments-derived explants were extracted from seeds germinated in Magenta boxes containing MT solid medium (40 mL) incubated in the dark for 20 d. The hypocotyl-derived explants consisted of the entire hypocotyl segment (0.8 cm), the hypocotyl segment attached to a cotyledon fragment as described by Tavano et al. (2009), and the hypocotyl segment divided longitudinally.\nIn vitro organogenesis\nThe explants were horizontally cultured in Petri dish (100 x 15 mm) containing MT salts and vitamins medium (MURASHIGE; TUCKER, 1969) supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP; 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mg [L.sup.-1]), incubated firstly in the dark for 30 d and then transferred to 16 h photoperiod. Evaluation was performed after 45 d in culture to determine both the number of responsive explants and the number of shoots per explant with the help of a stereomicroscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The experimental design was completely randomized with 3 or 5 replications. Each replication consisted of a Petri dish with 4 or 8 explants. The experiments were repeated four times. The data were analyzed by ANOVA. The means of the different explants types were compared by Tukey's test. The influence of BAP concentrations was studied by regression analyses.\nThis study was performed in the Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, at the Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura/USP, Piracicaba/SP, Brazil.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAfter six weeks in culture the development of adventitious shoots could be detected in all explants types evaluated (Figure 1). A higher number of responsive explants were obtained when epicotyl segments-derived explants were evaluated, regardless the BAP concentration tested. The percentage of responsive explants for epicotyl segments-derived explants was twice as much the values obtained for the hypocotyl segments-derived explants (Tables 1 and 2).\nMost citrus in vitro organogenesis protocols are based on the culture of epicotyl segments-derived explants which results in the development of a high number of adventitious shoots that reflects in a high efficiency of genetic transformation. However, in some recalcitrant genotypes even using this young and less differentiated explants the results are not as expected. These difficulties encourage the study of other types of explants.\nHypocotyl segments have been described as a very responsive explants for species other than citrus such as passion flower (FERNANDO et al., 2007; PINTO et al., 2010), cotton (DIVYA et al., 2008), and Eucommia ulmoides (CHEN et al., 2008). Hypocotyl segment attached to a cotyledon fragment was described by Ananthakrishnan et al. (2003) as an efficient explant for improving squash in vitro organogenesis. The use of this alternative explant improved in vitro organogenesis of sour orange and volkamer lemon (TAVANO et al., 2009). Moreover, Tavano et al. (2009) detected that in this explant the adventitious buds development occurred always at the hypocotyl end. Based on that information, it was decided to study three different types of hypocotyl segments-derived explants in order to verify the possibility of improving Rangpur lime organogenesis. However contrasting results were obtained for Rangpur lime as the efficiency of in vitro organogenesis of the hypocotyl segments-derived explants was always lower than the efficiency obtained for epicotyl-derived explants.\nConsidering the different types of hypocotyl segments-derived explants evaluated in this study a better explant responsiveness was obtained for the entire segment and the segment attached to a cotyledon fragment. Cutting the explant longitudinally in order to expose the cambial ring (DUTT; GROSSER, 2009) has been reported as an important factor that may increase citrus organogenesis efficiency (MOURA et al., 2001). However, in this study the lowest explant responsiveness was obtained for hypocotyl segment divided longitudinally.\nRegarding the number of shoots developed per explant the best results were also obtained for epicotyl segments-derived explants, with values almost three times as much the values obtained for the hypocotyl segments-derived explants (Table 2). It may be conclude that hypocotyl-derived explants are not adequate for in vitro organogenesis of Rangpur lime.\nConsidering BAP culture media supplementation, contrasting with other citrus cultivars (GARCIA-LUIS et al., 1999; MOREIRA-DIAS et al., 2001; MOURA et al., 2001) the presence of cytokinin is not essential for adventitious bud development. The percentage of responsive explants was stimulated with BAP concentrations up to 0.55 mg [L.sup.-1] (Figure 2). In vitro adventitious shoot development in absence or low concentrations of BAP has been reported for Rangpur lime (ALMEIDA et al., 2002; COSTA et al., 2004), and for sour orange (TAVANO et al., 2009) when epicotyl segments-derived explants were used as explant. The culture media supplementation with higher BAP concentrations (higher than 1.0 mg [L.sup.-1]) did not lead to a high efficiency in in vitro organogenesis in these recalcitrant genotypes. In addition, high BAP concentrations decrease the percentage of responsive explants. The number of shoots per explant increased with cytokinin culture media supplementation with the best results at the BAP concentration of 0.6 mg [L.sup.-1], regardless the explant type evaluated (Figure 2).\nBased on the results obtained in this study, epicotyl segments-derived explants cultured in culture media supplemented with low concentrations of BAP are the best choice for obtaining Rangpur lime in vitro adventitious shoots development. Further studies, considering other parameters that may influence the success of in vitro culture should be carried over in order to improve the efficiency of Rangpur lime in vitro organogenesis.\n[FIGURE 1 OMITTED]\n[FIGURE 2 OMITTED]\nThe authors acknowledge Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) and PPG--Fisiologia e Bioquimica de Plantas--ESALQ/USP for financial support and fellowships to Leonardo Soriano, Eveline Carla da Rocha Tavano.

I had only recently moved to northern California from Indiana, and I’d never seen anything like it: it was a monstrous mass of a dozen pointed twisted fingers splayed irregularly from a stout base. It had the firm heft and girth of a grapefruit and the unmistakable pebbled skin of a citrus fruit, so I wondered whether my student had found a grossly deformed grapefruit; but the oil in the peel smelled heavenly and not at all like a grapefruit. In class we cut through a big finger and found no juicy segments, just white citrus pith all the way through.\nWe eventually discovered that this fascinating fruit was a Buddha’s hand citron, Citrus medica variety sarcodactylis, meaning fleshy (sarco-) fingered (-dactyl) citron. Since that day many years ago I’ve become an unapologetic (if surreptitious) collector of the fruits from that same campus tree. The citrons do not drop from the tree on their own, yet I often find one or two lying nearby, probably torn off by a curious tourist or student and then abandoned. Obviously these fruits need a good home, and where better than the window sill in my office?\nThe first time I left one closed up in my office over a weekend, I opened the door on Monday morning to a waft of fruity floral aroma. It turns out that many people in China and India use the fruit to scent the air, although in west Asia and Europe the fleshy fingers are more often candied or used to flavor alcohol. I do both: the fruits make my office smell nice until they are fully yellow, and then I cook them.\nIt can be difficult or expensive to get your own hands on a fingered citron, but it’s easy to find a navel orange almost any time of the year. Fortunately, the patterns underlying the morphology of the fingered fruit can also be seen in an everyday navel orange. Between our photos of Buddha’s hands and your own navel orange, you should be able to follow along at home.\nCarpels and segments\nA Buddha’s hand citron is a fruit, and like all simple fruits, it is the mature ovary of a flower. Citrus fruits – from kumquats to lemons to oranges to grapefruits – are technically berries because they are fleshy throughout and do not have hard pits or tough papery bits inside. More specifically, they are a special type of berry called a hesperidium, derived from the original name Linnaeus bestowed upon the citruses in lovely and colorful reference to the Golden Apples of the Hesperides. (For a lively detailed discussion of orange etymology, see Mabberley 2004).\nPlant ovaries (and resulting fruits) are made up of the lower parts of one or more carpels, the fundamental units of the “female” part of the flower (the gynoecium). Carpels arise at the tip of a flower extremely early in development, and in many species they gradually fuse together to form a single solid ovary with one or more styles and stigmas.\nUnder a microscope, the tip of a developing orange flower looks like a tall fluted bundt cake or a French cannelé, each hump a tiny incipient carpel (see images in Lima and Davies 1984). But by the time an orange flower opens, the outside of the ovary is totally smooth.\nThe carpels that make up a mature orange or grapefruit or lemon are obvious: they are the familiar (and convenient) individual wedge-shaped segments. Among my favorite botany fun facts is that the long pulpy sacs that fill the segments and cushion the seeds are actually individual hollow hairs, filled with juice.\nFingers and the failure to fuse\nThe gnarled fingers of a Buddha’s hand citron are simply separate carpels that somehow failed to fuse. This is evident when you look closely at the flowers and very young fruits of a Buddha’s hand. Instead of a smooth ovary made of united carpels, the young carpels of a fingered citron are already going off in their own directions.\nMany non-fingered citron varieties (such as the etrog) contain very little juicy pulp and are valued primarily for their scented zest and their very thick rinds, which are made into jam or candied. Cheap candied citron peel haunts the dreams of fruitcake haters, but homemade versions are amazing. The spongy white part of the rind (albedo) soaks up a lot of sugar syrup, and the zest (flavedo) provides an intense citrusy zing. Fingered citrons are even better suited for candying because they are basically nothing but rind and their fingered shape maximizes the ratio of flavedo to albedo. My recipe for homemade candied Buddha’s hand is below.\nFingered citrons also fail to make seeds and must be propagated intentionally by humans, so it was surprising when a recent study (Ramadugu et al., 2015) found a great deal of genetic diversity among eleven distinct varieties of fingered citrons from Yunnan Province in China, the presumed birthplace of fingered citrons. The authors speculate that the fingered mutation may have arisen independently several times from different non-fingered varieties, and that the trait also could have been passed on to hybrid offspring through pollen. Some varieties of the non-fingered types are noticeably ridged (see photos in Ramadugu et al. 2015), so perhaps there is a genetic predisposition towards making fingers. I have not found any studies that have specifically identified the mutation responsible for the fingered trait, but several genes are good candidates. (If you are familiar with research in this area, please leave a comment).\nFingers and navels\nFailure to fuse explains the separate fingers of a Buddha’s hand, but it doesn’t explain why there is usually more than one ring of them. To gain insight into this part of the mystery, we need to do a little navel gazing. This kind will be productive, I promise.\nSo what is the navel in a navel orange? Navel orange flowers make one normal ring of regular well-behaved carpels (the bundt cake described above) but then they produce a smaller second ring inside of that. The second ring becomes the “navel.” Sometimes the carpels in the second ring fail to fuse, and each is surrounded by rind, contributing to the iconic belly button look. Sometimes the rind around the second ring just gets lumpy and pushes itself into the segments of the first ring. Meanwhile, the tissue surrounding the first ring of carpels grows up around the second ring leaving a small opening through which the navel shows through (Lima and Davies 1984).\nA similar developmental pattern happens in fingered citrons, but to a more extreme degree. I’ve seen what look like three rings of carpels, although they are so irregular, it is hard to tell for certain that there are not four.\nBuddhas aren’t bitter\nCitrons (varieties of Citrus medica) represent one of the three original Citrus species from which most of our edible citrus fruits were derived through hybridization. The other two are Citrus maxima (pummelo) and Citrus reticulata (mandarin), and several recent phylogenetic studies have supported the monophyly of these three groups (e.g. Carbonell-Caballero et al. 2015).\nCitrons and mandarins are not bitter, whereas pummelos are. The bitterness of a citrus fruit depends on which of two enzymes is acting on a precursor molecule to generate a bitter flavanone or a flavorless one. Some hybrid species, such as grapefruit and bitter orange, express the bitter-flavanone-producing enzyme inherited from their pummelo parent. Interestingly, sweet oranges also have a pummelo parent; however in sweet oranges, a mutation in the bitterness gene disabled the pummelo version of the enzyme, leaving only the sweet mandarin parent’s version to operate in the fruit (Frydman et al. 2013).\nBecause citrons are not bitter, their zest can be used as an interesting substitute for lemon or orange zest, and it is not necessary to purge the rinds of bitterness before making them into candy garnishes.\nWhen my botany class met again after the Buddha’s hand show-and-tell, my student admitted to having served the prize fruit to his friends, sliced into vodka tonics. Well, that was one perfectly good way to use a Buddha’s hand, but below are two of my favorites.\nCandied Buddha’s hand citron\n- Wash a large fingered citron to remove any dirt clinging to it. You may have to separate or remove some of the fingers to get it all clean.\n- Chop the solid part of the fruit into chunks or sticks, as you wish. The pieces will shrink only slightly, so cut them to be close to their final size.\n- Cut the fingers into chunks or slice them lengthwise for curls. Very small fingers can be left whole.\n- Make a sugar syrup in the ratio of 2:1 sugar to water. For a large fruit, two cups of sugar in a cup of water should be more than enough. Ordinary table sugar works best in this recipe because it does not burn too quickly and it allows the citron flavors to shine through.\n- Heat the sugar and water gently to dissolve the sugar and add the chopped citron.\n- Continue to simmer the citron in the syrup, stirring frequently, until the pieces appear translucent and the syrup is thick but not caramelized.\n- Let the citron cool in the syrup, then transfer the pieces to a large plate and spread them out.\n- Any leftover syrup can be used as syrup or stirred into the marmalade recipe below.\nIf you plan to put them in fruit cake or figgy pudding, you can let the pieces dry for a couple of hours and refrigerate them until you are ready to bake. If you want them for candy or garnish, let the pieces dry for a couple of hours and roll them in powdered sugar to coat thoroughly.\nThey are beautiful strewn on top of an orange soufflé, straight from the oven, or on a scoop of ice cream.\nBuddha’s hand marmalade\nTo be honest, I just use the recipe at the Earthy Delights Recipe Blog.\nMy only comment on this recipe (besides that it’s very good!) is that my marmalade sometimes comes out too thick, with too much citrus chunk and not enough gelled matrix. The gelled matrix can also be too thick. Because there is so much pectin in the white (albedo) part of the fruit, this problem might be avoided by using only the pieces that have zest on them and leaving out some of the central mass of the fruit. No matter the texture, though, it tastes wonderful.\nCarbonell-Caballero, J., Alonso, R., Ibañez, V., Terol, J., Talon, M., & Dopazo, J. (2015).

{"question":"How do the maritime achievements of Zheng He and Bartolomeu Dias compare in terms of their historical impact on global trade and exploration?","answer":"Both explorers made significant but different impacts on global trade and exploration. Zheng He led the world's largest naval expedition of its time in 1405, commanding up to 300 ships and 30,000 sailors, exploring regions from Southeast Asia to Africa's eastern coast. He established trade connections and presented gifts from the Chinese emperor to foreign leaders. However, China later turned against seafaring and entered a period of self-imposed isolation. In contrast, Dias's 1488 expedition, though smaller in scale, had a longer-lasting impact by becoming the first European to round Africa's southern tip, opening a crucial sea route between Europe and Asia. This breakthrough enabled increased trade with India and other Asian powers, especially important after the Ottoman Empire had closed the overland route in the 1450s. While Zheng He's voyages ultimately led to China's withdrawal from maritime exploration, Dias's achievement laid the groundwork for subsequent Portuguese expeditions and European maritime dominance.","context":["NANJING, China, July 17 - The captivating tale of Zheng He, a Chinese eunuch who explored the Pacific and Indian Oceans with a mighty armada almost a century before Columbus discovered America, has long languished as a tantalizing footnote in China's imperial history.\nZheng He (pronounced jung huh) fell into disfavor before he completed the last of his early 15th-century voyages, and most historical records were destroyed. Authorities protected his old family home in Nanjing, but it was often shuttered, its rooms used to store unrelated relics.\nNow, on the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's first mission in 1405, all that is changing. Zheng He's legacy is being burnished -- some critics say glossed over -- to give rising China a new image on the world stage.\nBooks and television shows, replicas of Zheng He's ships and a new $50 million museum in Nanjing promote Zheng He as a maritime cultural ambassador for a powerful but ardently peaceful nation.\nOfficials have even endorsed the theory, so far unproven, that one of Zheng He's ships foundered on the rocks near Lamu island, off the coast of today's Kenya, with survivors swimming ashore, marrying locals and creating a family of Chinese-Africans that is now being reunited with the Chinese motherland.Continue reading the main story\nThe message is that Zheng He foreshadowed China's 21st-century emergence as a world power, though one that differs in crucial respects from Spain, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and, most pointedly, the United States.\n\"In the heyday of the Ming Dynasty, China did not seek hegemony,\" says Wan Ming, a leading scholar of the era. \"Today, we are once again growing stronger all the time, and China's style of peaceful development has been welcomed all over the world.\"\nThe Communist Party hopes to signal to its own people that it has recaptured past glory, while reassuring foreign countries that China can be strong and non-threatening at the same time.\nEven within China, though, the use of poorly documented history as modern propaganda prop has generated a backlash.\nSeveral scholars have publicly criticized the campaign as a distortion, saying Zheng He treated foreigners as barbarians and most foreign countries as vassal states. His voyages amounted to a wasteful tribute to a maniacal emperor, some argue.\nZheng He resonates, favorably or not, in Asia. Arguably for the first time since his final voyage in 1433, China is vying to become a major maritime power.\nBeijing has upgraded its navy with Russian-built Sovremenny-class guided missile destroyers, Kilo-class diesel submarines and a new nuclear submarine equipped to carry intercontinental ballistic missiles. It has flirted with the idea of building an aircraft carrier, according to conflicting reports in state media.\nSustained double-digit increases in defense spending have helped make China one of the largest military powers in the world, though still well behind the United States. China says it aims only to defend itself. But others are skeptical.\n\"Since no nation threatens China, one wonders: why this growing investment?\" Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld asked recently in a speech on China's buildup during a visit to Singapore last month.\nBeijing clearly hopes history will help answer the question.\nZheng He was a Chinese Muslim who, following the custom of the day, was castrated so he could serve in the household of a prince, Zhu Di.\nZhu Di later toppled the emperor, his brother, and took the throne for himself. He rewarded Zheng He, his co-conspirator, with command of the greatest naval expedition that world had ever seen. Beginning in July 1405, Zheng He made port calls all around Southeast Asia, rounded India, explored the Middle East and reached the eastern coast of Africa.\nThe three ships Columbus guided across the Atlantic 87 years later, the Niña, Pinta and Santa María, could fit inside a single large vessel in Zheng He's armada, which at its peak had up to 300 ships and 30,000 sailors. Some of China's maritime innovations at the time, including watertight compartments, did not show up on European vessels for hundreds of years.\nZheng He was China's first big ocean trader, presenting gifts from the emperor to leaders in foreign ports and hauling back crabapples, myrrh, mastic gum and even a giraffe.\nIn time, though, the emperor turned against seafaring, partly because of the exorbitant cost, partly because of China's religious certitude that it had nothing to learn from the outside world. By the latter part of the 15th century the country had entered a prolonged period of self-imposed isolation that lasted into the 20th century, leaving European powers to rule the seas.\nFor Chinese officials today, the sudden end of China's maritime ambitions 600 years ago conveniently signals something else: that China is a gentle giant with enduring good will. Zheng He represents China's commitment to \"good neighborliness, peaceful coexistence and scientific navigation,\" government-run China Central Television said during an hourlong documentary on the explorer last week.\nEarlier this month, authorities opened a $50 million memorial to Zheng He. Tributes to him fill courtyard-style exhibition halls, painted in stately vermillion and imperial yellow. A hulking statue of Zheng He, his chest flung forward as in many Communist-era likenesses of Mao, decorates the main hall.\nAs the Zheng He anniversary approached, delegations of Chinese diplomats and scholars also traveled to Kenya to investigate the claims that islanders there could trace their roots to sailors on Zheng He's fleet.\nOn one remote island, called Siyu, the Chinese found a 19-year-old high school student, Mwamaka Sharifu, who claimed Chinese ancestry. Beijing's embassy in Nairobi arranged for her to visit China to attend Zheng He celebrations. Beijing has invited her back to study in China, tuition-free, this fall.\n\"My family members have round faces, small eyes and black hair, so we long believed we are Chinese,\" Ms. Sharifu said in a telephone interview. \"Now we have a direct link to China itself.\"\nThe outreach effort has generated positive publicity for China in Kenya and some other African countries, as well as around Southeast Asia, where Zheng He is widely admired.\nBut Zheng He has been more coolly received by some scholars in China and abroad.\nGeoff Wade, a China specialist at the National University of Singapore, argued in an academic essay that Zheng He helped the Ming state colonize neighboring countries. His far-flung expeditions aimed at enforcing a \"pax Ming\" through Southeast Asia, allowing China to wrest control of trade routes dominated at that time by Arabs, he wrote.\nSeveral Chinese experts also questioned whether Zheng He's legacy is as salutary as government officials hope.\nYe Jun, a Beijing historian, said the official contention that Zheng He was a good-will ambassador is a \"one-sided interpretation that blindly ignores the objective fact that Zheng He engaged in military suppression\" to achieve the emperor's goals.\n\"These matters should be left to scholars,\" Mr. Ye said.Continue reading the main story","In 1488, Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias (c. 1450-1500) became the first European mariner to round the southern tip of Africa, opening the way for a sea route from Europe to Asia. Dias’ ships rounded the perilous Cape of Good Hope and then sailed around Africa’s southernmost point, Cabo das Agulhas, to enter the waters of the Indian Ocean. Portugal and other European nations already had long-established trade ties to Asia, but the arduous overland route had been closed in the 1450s due to the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of the remnants of the Byzantine Empire. A major maritime victory for Portugal, Dias’ breakthrough opened the door to increased trade with India and other Asian powers. It also prompted Genoan explorer Christopher Columbus (1451-1506), then living in Portugal, to seek a new royal patron for a mission to establish his own sea route to the Far East.\nAn Ambitious Plan\nAlmost nothing is known about the life of Bartolomeu de Novaes Dias before 1487, except that he was at the court of João II, or King John II of Portugal (1455-1495), and was a superintendent of the royal warehouses. He likely had much more sailing experience than his one recorded stint aboard the warship São Cristóvão. Dias was probably in his mid- to late-30s in 1486 when King João II appointed him to head an expedition in search of a sea route to India.\nKing João II was entranced by the legend of Prester John, a mysterious and probably apocryphal 12th-century leader of a nation of Christians somewhere in Africa whose kingdom included the Fountain of Youth. King João II sent out a pair of explorers, Afonso de Paiva (c. 1460-c. 1490) and Pêro da Covilhã (c. 1450-c. 1526), to search overland for the Christian kingdom in Ethiopia. King João II also wanted to find a way around the southernmost point of Africa’s coastline, so just a few months after dispatching the overland explorers, he sponsored Dias in an African expedition.\nIn August 1487, Dias’ trio of ships departed from the port of Lisbon, Portugal. Dias followed the route of 15th-century Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão (c. 1450-c. 1486), who had followed the coast of Africa as far as present-day Cape Cross, Namibia. Dias’ cargo included the standard “padrões,” the limestone markers used to stake Portuguese claims on the continent. Padrões were planted at the shoreline and served as guideposts to previous Portuguese explorations of the coast.\nDias’ expedition party included six Africans who had been brought to Portugal by earlier explorers. Dias dropped off the Africans at different ports along the coastline of Africa with supplies of gold and silver and messages of goodwill from the Portuguese to the indigenous people. The last two Africans were left at a place the Portuguese sailors called Angra do Salto, probably in modern Angola, and the expedition’s supply ship was left there under guard of nine men.\nThe Expedition Around South Africa\nIn early January 1488, as Dias’ two ships sailed off the coast of South Africa, storms blew them away from the coast. Dias is thought to have ordered a turn to the south of about 28 degrees, probably because he had prior knowledge of southeasterly winds that would take him around the tip of Africa and keep his ships from being dashed on the notoriously rocky shoreline. João and his predecessors had obtained navigational intelligence, including a 1460 map from Venice that showed the Indian Ocean on the other side of Africa.\nDias’ decision was risky, but it worked. The crew spotted landfall on February 3, 1488, about 300 miles east of present-day Cape of Good Hope. They found a bay they called São Bras (present-day Mossel Bay) and the much warmer waters of the Indian Ocean. From the shoreline, indigenous Khoikhoi pelted Dias’ ships with stones until an arrow fired by either Dias or one of his men felled a tribesman. Dias ventured further along the coastline, but his crew was nervous about the dwindling food supplies and urged him to turn back. As mutiny loomed, Dias appointed a council to decide the matter. The members came to the agreement that they would permit him to sail another three days, then turn back. At Kwaaihoek, in present-day Eastern Cape province, they planted a padrão on March 12, 1488, which marked the easternmost point of Portuguese exploration.\nOn the journey back, Dias observed the southernmost point of Africa, later called Cabo das Agulhas, or Cape of Needles. Dias named the rocky second cape Cabo das Tormentas (Cape of Storms) for the tempestuous storms and strong Atlantic-Antarctic currents that made ship travel so perilous.\nBack in Angra do Salto, Dias and his crew were aghast to find that only three of the nine men left guarding the food ship had survived repeated attacks by locals; a seventh man died on the journey home. In Lisbon, after 15 months at sea and a journey of nearly 16,000 miles, the returning mariners were met by triumphant crowds. In a private meeting with the king, however, Dias was forced to explain his failure to meet up with Paiva and Covilhã. Despite his immense achievement, Dias was never again put in a position of authority. King João II ordered that henceforth, maps would show the new name for Cabo das Tormentas: Cabo da Boa Esperança, or Cape of Good Hope.\nAdvisor to Vasco da Gama\nFollowing his expedition, Dias settled for a time in Guinea in West Africa, where Portugal had established a gold-trading site. João’s successor, Manuel I (1469-1521), ordered Dias to serve as a shipbuilding consultant for the expedition of Vasco da Gama (c. 1460-1524). Dias sailed with the da Gama expedition as far as the Cape Verde Islands, and then returned to Guinea. Da Gama’s ships reached their goal of India in May 1498, nearly a decade after Dias’ historic trip around the tip of Africa. Afterward, Manuel sent out a massive fleet to India under Pedro Álvares Cabral (c. 1467-c. 1520), and Dias captained four of the ships. They reached Brazil in March 1500, then headed across the Atlantic toward South Africa and, further ahead, the Indian subcontinent. At the feared Cabo das Tormentas, storms struck the fleet of 13 ships. In May 1500, four of the ships were wrecked, including Dias’, with all crew lost at sea. Bartolomeu Dias died on May 29, 1500 off the Cape of Good Hope.

In standard research consent protocols, documentation must include the date, participant name, medical record number, study number, study title, key elements discussed, details of the participant's understanding, confirmation of voluntary participation, withdrawal rights, and receipt of signed copies. Both processes require proper completion of forms without errors or omissions of signatures, names, initials and dates.","context":["About The Artist\nI am a photographic artist and PhD researcher at Ulster University in Belfast. My work explores the fault lines where medicine, technology and society meet.\nWhat is the study about?\nAdvanced reproductive technologies (ART) present ordinary families living with genetic disease or disability with some of the most challenging decisions gripping society today. I am interested in the complexities of these decisions. To understand them, you must try to walk in someone else’s shoes, and think about their lives and their choices. The challenge of this project for me as an artist, is to create a series of photographic portraits that communicate some of these difficult issues to the viewer through the medium of the family photograph.\nWho can take part?\nThe project will involve finding, photographing and interviewing ten families with rare diseases including mitochondrial disease. The families who participate will all have dealt in some way with the challenging decisions of ART. They will be willing to discuss the decisions they have made publicly and will be comfortable with having a visual representation of their family unit disseminated in the public domain. Some of these families will have actively chosen to use ART and others will, after consideration, have opted not to. The project is about both of those choices and the reasons for them.\nThe term assisted reproductive technologies or ART refers to in vitro fertilisation techniques such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and pre-implantation tissue typing (PTT). The project will not exclude families who have used prenatal diagnosis (PND) and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) after choosing not to opt for ART.\nWhat’s involved in taking part?\nParticipation in this project is entirely voluntary. If you decide you would like to take part, every member of your family will be provided with a detailed information form and will be asked to sign a photographic and audio release form. It will be the responsibility of one parent/guardian of any children under 18 years of age, or vulnerable adult participants to give consent. If you agree to take part, I will arrange to meet, or speak with you, in advance of the photographic and audio interview session to introduce myself. This will be an opportunity for me to discuss the information sheet and the consent form with you, and to make sure that you understand what participation in the project entails. We will then organise a mutually convenient time for me to visit you at your home. The photographic session and interview will take approximately three hours and the format of the photograph will be a conventional family portrait. I want you to be yourselves, so there will be no need to dress up or tidy up!\nThere are no costs associated with talking part.\nAre there any risks?\nThe study involves a photographic shoot and interview session, so the risks in participation are minimal.\nThe photographic shoot will EXCLUDE flash photography, reducing the risk to those with photosensitive epilepsy and families will be asked if there are any additional precautions which need to be considered when photographing their family, based on their individual circumstances.\nSome participants may find answering questions about their reproductive choices upsetting, and can at any point ask that the interview be stopped. If you are affected in this way, and would like additional support, please contact The Lily Foundation at [email protected] or telephone 0300 400 1234.\nWho will benefit?\nThe artworks that will be produced from these sessions will be used for research and exhibition purposes. The consent form for the images and the audio interviews will therefore cover multiple media platforms. It is hoped that the exhibition will raise a positive discussion in the public domain about ART and their impact on the families living with genetic disease that use them.\nThis research is part of a PhD which is funded by the Department for the Economy (DfE) and is being conducted on behalf of Ulster University. The study has been reviewed by the Ethics Committee at Ulster University in accordance with the University’s guidelines.\nHow do I find out more?\nPlease contact Susie Rea, PhD Researcher on [email protected]","Informed Consent In Research\nObtaining informed consent for a research study requires open and honest communication between the researcher and the study participant.\nObtaining informed consent for a research study requires open and honest communication between the researcher and the study participant. Much attention has been given to the consent document readability and its comprehension. However, it is important to remember that the document is a proxy and reference for a conversation. The conversation should be based upon the key elements of the consent document which include but are not limited to; the study objectives, procedures, duration, risks, benefits, alternative options, confidentiality of records, contact information for any participant questions, compensation if applicable, additional costs and compensation for research injury if applicable. It is essential that participants understand that participating in a research study is completely voluntary; they can withdraw from the study at any time or choose not to participate.\nInformed consent should be obtained after the participant has been presented with pertinent information, has had adequate time to review the consent document and have all questions answered. Consent should also be obtained prior to any study specific procedures. Participant privacy during the discussion is paramount and the environment should be free of undue influence and coercion from the research team.\n- Video Link: General Informed Consent Requirements\nFor high risk protocols (e.g., Phase l/ll, gene transfer) it may be prudent and/or recommended by the local IRB to include the use of an independent party to be involved in the consent process. An individual obtaining consent may (un)intentionally influence a participant’s decision to consent to a research study. The use of a Research Subject Advocate can improve objectivity in communicating the presented information about the study.\nIt is important to note that informed consent is a continuous dialogue with the participant which reinforces the key elements of initial consent throughout the duration of the study. New adverse events or important findings that may increase a participant’s risks or willingness to continue in the research study should be disclosed to the participants and to the IRB.\n- HRPP Policy on Documentation of the Informed Consent Process\n- HRPP Policy on Informed Consent Process and the Elements of Informed Consent\n- FDA: A guide to Informed Consent\n- 45 CFR 46: General Requirements of Informed Consent\n- OHRP: Informed Consent FAQ\n- FDA: 21 CFR 50\n- FDA : IDE Informed Consent\n- CCTS: Consent Template Language\n- The OSU CCTS maintains a listing of template language for various risks and procedures that can be copied and inserted to draft consent documents. Please contact Rob Rengel for further information.\nSpecial Consent Considerations\nClinical research studies that involve children, non-English speaking individuals or the use of a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) have additional guidances, regulations and processes that may apply.\n- Assent and Parental Permission\n- Emergency Research\n- Short Form Informed Consent\n- Research Involving Pregnant Women, Fetuses, or Neonates\n- Research Involving Prisoners\n- Research Involving Children\n- Vulnerable Populations: Students, Employees, and Adults Unable to Provide Consent\nDocumenting the Consent Process\nIt is important to document the consent process at the time the informed consent form is signed by the study participant or legally authorized representative. The source document should state the date, participant name, medical record number, study number and study title. It should state the key elements of the consent that were discussed with the potential participant and any further details of the discussion that are pertinent to the subject's understanding of the study or information that could impact their decision to participate in the study. It should state that the participant had adequate time to review all information and voluntarily signed the informed consent form(s) with an understanding that they are able to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. It should also state the participant received a copy of all forms signed and that the participant signed and dated the consent form prior to any research specific tests. It is essential that the forms are completed appropriately, without errors and omissions of signatures, printed names, initials and dates."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:aabe7a23-453e-42a3-9a7e-a23a5ea35453>","<urn:uuid:359ab049-ce23-4d72-8cc9-211bfd35f86a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the ancient features of Nunwell Estate and Someries Castle compare in terms of their architectural heritage and preservation?","answer":"Nunwell Estate contains several preserved ancient features including veteran Oak trees (some over 400 years old), medieval boundary banks, and remnants of 18th century landscaping like The Prospect lime tree avenue. Meanwhile, Someries Castle, while also historically significant, survives mainly as a gatehouse and chapel with walls up to 10m high, representing one of England's earliest brick buildings from the 1430s. The castle's main structure is now mostly reduced to foundations and earthworks, though its formal garden remains preserve features like raised walkways, flowerbeds and surrounding terraces. Both sites showcase medieval magnate residences, but while Nunwell retains more of its historic landscape features, Someries Castle better preserves its architectural structures.","context":["Welcome to Brading’s Histree Trail The Legends and Landscapes Histree Trail\n6.6km (4.1 miles) long with an optional shorter route of 4km (2.5 miles).\nThe trail begins and ends at the Bull Ring in Brading Town Centre. It presents a fairly easy walk. There are some stiles and gates to negotiate, with mostly gentle inclines and descents. The trail may also be muddy and uneven underfoot in places.\nGetting There Bus: 2, 3 and 10 to the Bull Ring. Train: runs twice an hour. Brading Station is only a short walk from the Bull Ring.\nCar: Brading Town Trust pay and display car park is next to St. Mary’s Church at the northern end of the High Street.\nFollow the text and use the map to explore the Legends and Landscapes Histree Trail. Discover the veteran Oaks of Nunwell, follow ancient boundaries and explore Bloodstone Copse. Many trees on this trail are ancient and are among the most magnificent specimens on the Island.\n(1) The Legends and Landscapes Histree Trail begins at the Bull Ring. The first tree is a Yew tree in the enclosure. The date of its planting is uncertain, but it features as a mature tree in postcards which depict the opening of the present Town Hall in 1903, making it over 100 years old. This Yew could have provided welcome shade for cattle during the weekly town market. Nearby, you will see a large iron ring set into a stone plinth. Bulls were tethered to this ring and tormented by dogs in the belief that the stress endured by the bull tenderised the meat.\nPass the Post Office and cross the road at the bottom of The Mall. On the corner is the Brading Tudor Garden and the Brading Dragon. The dragon was carved by local sculptor Paul Sivell to celebrate the millennium. The timber is Oak and derives from the nearby Whitefield Woods to the north of Brading.\nFrom the garden, proceed up The Mall, turn right into the car park of the surgery and go through the gate. This young plantation is Betty’s Copse and was planted with native tree species in 2005 with the help of the local community. Head uphill beside the plantation to join the bridleway through the iron gate, then turn right. Passing Little Jane’s chalk pit, typical ancient hedgerow species can be seen to your right including Hazel, Field Maple and Ash. All have multiple stems, an indication that these trees were harvested periodically or ‘coppiced’ for traditional crafts and building materials. As the path climbs steeply Beech trees come into view to your right. These majestic trees mark the beginning of the Nunwell Beech Hanger. ‘Hanger’ is a local word used to describe woodland located on steep slopes. Beech woods are uncommon on the Island and this is the finest example. Take the right fork just before reaching the summit at the low waymarker post to your right. You are now entering Kelly’s Copse.\n(2) Kelly’s Copse is named after landowner Cordelia Kelly from whom the land was purchased by the Nunwell Estate in the 1700s. The copse is ancient woodland; it has been continually wooded for more than 400 years. Here you are in the tree canopy with longranging views across the northeast of the Island. Carefully follow the path, known as Snakey Lane, as it skirts the top of the copse and descends.\n(3) A multi-stemmed Field Maple marks the point where the paths converge (right). This tree has ten stems which tells us that it was coppiced – cut down to base level and then allowed to regenerate. It is likely to have been a waymarker as this path once formed a route between Brading and Arreton. Field Maple is slow growing, often found along old boundaries and rights of way. From this tree, proceed westwards along the footpath which follows the old parish boundary, laid out in the 12th century. A path known as Ladies Walk used to run adjacent to the current right of way and was used exclusively by ladies until 1900. It was designed to form a backdrop to the private parkland of the Nunwell Estate – glimpses of which will become apparent to your right – with the intention of leading the walker to the point where the best views of the manor house could be obtained. The original path no longer exists, but the name is still used.\n(4) The tallest Beech tree to your right marks the eastern extent of the old Nunwell Estate boundary prior to the 1815 extension. A veteran for its species, this tree provides excellent habitat for bats and nesting birds and, being tall and straight, makes a perfect perching post for birds of prey. In places along the path, sections of the medieval bank boundary parallel with the path are still visible. Look out for incredible ivy growth entwined with some of the trees; the ivy’s stems may be thicker than your arm.\n(5) The next tree is one of the grandest Oaks on the Island. This Common Oak is known to be over 400 years old. With its gnarled, rotund trunk and tremendous character, it measures a whopping seven metres in girth! This remarkable tree is among the oldest and most celebrated trees on the Island (right). It is also a ‘Bound Oak’ marking the point where the old medieval Brading Town boundary changes course and follows an old field margin to your right. The Bound Oak is an ancient pollard. Pollards often have lumpy nodules and boles and many boughs spreading from one point on the trunk, indicating that timber was periodically harvested in a sustainable way, prolonging the tree’s life.\nFor over 900 years, Nunwell has been the seat of the Oglander family. The estate was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it belonged to William the Conqueror. Sir John Oglander, a dedicated diarist, wrote detailed manuscripts during the mid-1600s. These provide us with valuable comments on the Isle of Wight during that period. Most of the parkland landscaping which can be seen today is attributed to his descendant – Sir William Oglander during the 1700s.\nGeorge Brannon, Isle of Wight Victorian landscape engraver, spoke of Nunwell and Sir John in his book ‘Vectis Scenery’ in 1825. He wrote,\n‘‘Noble specimens of every kind of forest tree are to be found in the park, but particularly the oaks, several of which are many centuries old, the worthy baronet employing every possible means of preserving these venerable chiefs of the grove, for his soul holds dear an ancient oak!”\nContinue along Ladies Walk. The avenue of Common Lime trees here – originally planted in the early 1700s – was known as The Prospect\n(6). The avenue was then removed towards the end of that century when informal parkland became fashionable. However, a few specimen trees were left to blend in with the new landscaping. The existing huge Lime trees near the footpath are remnants of the original avenue – the tree to the right is the largest Lime on the Island.\n(7) Pause at the crossroads and, just within the estate fence on the corner, stands a pair of towering Beech trunks. Whether this is one or two trees is difficult to determine. The larger trunk has a bough which appears to embrace the smaller trunk. They are known as the King and Queen. At this stage in the trail, there is the option to extend the route. If you wish to walk the extension (2.6km/1.6 miles) please continue with the text. If you wish to walk the shorter route please skip to **. Continue towards the gate, passing some impressive Beech trees planted during the18th century, and which mark the westerly extent of the Nunwell Beech Hanger. Just beyond the gate to the left is a lone Beech\n(8). It may be a bundle planting – a group of saplings planted closely together which, over time, fused giving the trunk its fluted appearance (right). Keep to the old highway and, at the top of the hill, cross the field towards the gate in the far left corner, then turn right to join the track downhill. As you walk towards the hedgerow look to the left to view a row of Beech trees on the hillside marking the old Nunwell Estate southern boundary. Once through the hedgerow, turn right and follow the field margin until meeting the road. At the road turn right, continuing for a short distance on the grass verge. Ahead on the hill you can see the Ashey Sea mark – a white triangular shaped pillar erected in 1735 used as a reference point for shipping. At footpath B24, descend the steps into Eaglehead Copse. The copse is the site of an ancient settlement and parish boundary. Eaglehead Copse is an Ash and Oak chalk woodland with mature Hazel coppice. It is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and through careful management supports a healthy population of both red squirrel and dormouse. Continue through the copse until the path levels out. Along the copse boundary to the left are many fine ancient coppiced trees but two stand out in particular. The first is a multi-stemmed coppiced Ash and is likely to be hundreds of years old\n(9). Close by is a coppiced Whitebeam (10). Mature Whitebeam trees are rare on the Island and are known in local dialect as ‘whipcrop’ or ‘whiterice’. The leaves have a distinctive white, hairy underside giving the tree a slivery appearance. Continue on footpath B24 and, once past the bench near the crossroads, Eaglehead gives way to Bloodstone Copse. These copses form a wildlife reserve managed by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust. A spring rises here in which the water has a reddish hue, said to be the flow of blood from violent fighting between the Saxons and Danes. The truth behind the red colouration of the stream bed is more conventional; it is caused by red algae attached to pebbles and flints in the water. Leave Bloodstone, continue along the field edge on footpath B34 until meeting Nuncrate Rew. It takes its name from ‘Nuncroft’ the adjacent field where the original medieval manor house of Nunwell existed. ‘Rew’ means narrow strip of woodland. Turn right immediately after entering the rew and follow the path passing by straight Oak trees and Elm regeneration. Leave Nuncrate Rew, cross the stile into the field and cross another two fields following footpath B24 until you reach Nunwell Farm Lane. To continue with the extended trail please skip to *.\n** Turn right onto footpath B59 following it along the western boundary of the Nunwell Estate. Pause to view the standing dead Oak as the path swings left. As it decomposes, dead wood provides valuable habitat for insects, fungi, mosses and lichens as well as providing nesting and roosting places for birds and bats. Ahead, a panorama of open pasture studded with numerous and splendid Oak trees can be seen. The entire area is a protected for its historic, cultural and natural heritage.\nDirectly ahead is a curious, mushroom shaped Oak tree (7a). It is in the latter stages of its life, rotting from the top but still strong lower down the trunk – this process is known as ‘retrenchment’. It is said that an Oak grows for 300 years, spends 300 years resting and a further 300 years gracefully decaying (left).\nBy tracing the lines of Oaks seen in some of the fields nearby, it is possible to visualise the shortest route from the medieval house to the nearby farms. The northerly wood in the distance is Whitefield Wood. It was once a King’s Forest, a royal hunting ground belonging to King Charles I. It was replanted during the 1950s with coniferous trees. Proceed down the lane to Nunwell Farm.\n*Cross the first stile to join footpath B23. Head towards Brading in an easterly direction across the field. Cross the footbridge and then the stile beside another large Oak tree (11). This tree measures over four metres in girth and is thought to be around 350 years old (right).\nClimb the slight incline and at the top of the hill look for the fingerpost. Good views of the inner estate parkland can be seen from here. A pair of dead standing Oak trees are to your right. Known as the Antler Oaks, these trees have been dead for around 10 years. Follow the line of the hedge to your left towards a group of trees.\nAhead, you may notice Oak trees on several mounds. These are the remains of brick kilns which are likely to have been used during the construction of the medieval Nunwell Manor. Another ancient pollard; an enormous, anchorshaped Oak tree with a straight trunk and many boughs spreading from one point can be seen\n(12). This tree, along with many others, would have produced good quality timber. Due to the proximity to Portsmouth, Nunwell timber was extensively used in local ship-building. Records dating from 1805 – time of the Napoleonic war – show that the Nunwell estate produced over £100,000 of timber, equating to millions of pounds today. Before leaving the tree, pause to take in the view of Brading church and Culver Down to the east rising in the distance.\nCross the stile at the fingerpost and make your way to your left along the hedgerow, keeping to the field margin. Here you will find another of Nunwell’s veterans (13). This is a Bound Oak, the third ancient pollard, thought to have been pollarded as a mature tree, again probably for shipbuilding timber.\nThe medieval bank boundary is visible here and also in the next field to the right. Retrace your steps along the field margins, then follow the line of Oak trees by the footpath across the middle of the field and head for the cottage. These Oak trees were planted to mark the northern boundary of the Nunwell parkland estate.\nPause at the final Oak, before reaching the clump of Oak trees. A clearing on your right affords a great view of another of the oldest Oak trees on the Island (14). This tree is Old Stumpy and is the fattest and most gnarled of all the great Oaks on the Nunwell Estate and is the final tree on the Legends and Landscapes Histree Trail. Continue across the field past the Oak tree cluster. At the stile have a last look at the house and estate behind you. At the fingerpost take the steps down, taking care when joining the road as there is no pavement here. Walk a short distance and take the next turning on the right into Doctors Lane. At the end of Doctors Lane take the right fork into West Street which will return you to the Bull Ring where the Legends and Landscapes Histree Trail began. Thank you for walking the Legends and Landscapes Histree Trail. There are seven other Histree Trails for you to explore.","Someries Castle: a medieval magnate's residence and formal garden remains\nList Entry Summary\nThis monument is scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 as amended as it appears to the Secretary of State to be of national importance.

Asset Groupings are not part of the official record but are added later for information.\nList entry Description\nSummary of Monument\nLegacy Record - This information may be included in the List Entry Details.\nReasons for Designation\nMagnates' residences are high status dwellings of domestic rather than\nmilitary character. They date from the Norman Conquest (in some cases forming\na continuation of a Saxon tradition) and throughout the rest of the medieval\nperiod. Individual residences were in use for varying lengths of time; some\ncontinued in use into the post-medieval period. Such dwellings were the houses\nor palaces of royalty, bishops and the highest ranks of the nobility, usually\nthose associated with the monarch. They functioned as luxury residences for\nthe elite and their large retinues, and provided an opportunity to display\nwealth in the form of elaborate architecture and lavish decoration. As such,\nthese palaces formed an impressive setting for audiences with royalty, foreign\nambassadors and other lords and bishops.\nMagnates' residences are located in both rural and urban areas. Bishops'\nresidences are usually in close association with cathedrals, and all\nresidences tend to be located close to good communication routes. Unless\nconstrained by pre-existing structures, magnates' residences comprised an\nelaborate series of buildings, usually of stone, that in general included a\ngreat hall, chambers, kitchens, service rooms, lodgings, a chapel and a\ngatehouse, arranged around a single or double courtyard. As a consequence of\nthe status of these sites, historic documentation is often prolific, and can\nbe of great value for establishing the date of construction and subsequent\nalterations to the buildings, and for investigating the range of activities\nfor which the site was a focus.\nMagnates' residences are widely dispersed throughout England reflecting the\nmobility of royalty and the upper echelons of the nobility. There is a\nconcentration of sites which reflects the growing importance of London as a\npolitical centre, and the majority of magnates' residences tend to be located\nin the south of the country. Despite their wide distribution, magnates'\nresidences are a relatively rare form of monument due to their special social\nstatus. At present only around 236 examples have been identified of which 150\nare ecclesiastical palaces and 86 are connected with royalty. Magnates'\nresidences generally provide an emotive and evocative link with the past,\nespecially through their connections with famous historical figures, and can\nprovide a valuable educational resource, both with respect to the organisation\nand display of political power, and wider aspects of medieval and post-\nmedieval society such as the development of towns and industries and the\ndistribution of dependent agricultural holdings. Examples with surviving\narchaeological potential are considered to be of national importance.\nAlthough only the gatehouse and the chapel at Someries Castle survive as upstanding structures, the positions of the principal range and inner courtyard are indicated through joints and markings in the fabric of the walls. A substantial brick footing lies towards the north east corner of the site indicating the survival of buried foundations. Documentary evidence indicates a predecessor to the known structures which may also exist in the form of buried archaeological features. The surviving remains provide important evidence for the interpretation of similar buildings for which only the ground plan is known. Someries Castle is one of the earliest surviving brick buildings of this type in England and is therefore of great significance for the study of the development of construction techniques in brick. The importance of the monument is further enhanced by its accessibility to the public.\nFormal gardens are usually found in direct association with the dwellings of high-ranking individuals in society and are a further indication of the status of such buildings. Early gardens tend to follow a rigid design and were often elaborate earthworks, with gravel paths and raised borders.\nThe formal garden at Someries Castle is a well preserved example with a central raised mound, traces of paths and flowerbeds and surrounding terraces. The presence of the adjacent remains of the magnate's residence enhances the importance of the gardens by allowing the two related sites to be studied in conjunction with each other.\nLegacy Record - This information may be included in the List Entry Details.\nThe monument includes both upstanding and buried foundations of the late\nmedieval magnate's residence known as Someries Castle and the adjacent\ngarden earthworks to the south west. The monument lies beside an old road\nbetween Luton and Kimpton and is situated on a plateau of the Chilterns to\nthe east of the Lea Valley. The upstanding remains include the gatehouse\nand chapel forming the north west wing of the magnate's residence. Although\nthe roof has gone, the walls survive almost to full height, an estimated 10m.\nThe gatehouse is built in imitation of a castle gateway, with two semi-\noctagonal bastions on either side of the entrance passage which passes through\nthe building and would have given access to an enclosed courtyard. The\nrectangular chapel, measuring 16m long by 5m wide, extends to the north east\nof the gatehouse and has a large perpendicular window opening in the gable.\nOn the outer face of the south east wall of the chapel may be seen the\nabutment of the north east wing which is now demolished to ground level. The\narea occupied by the main block of the residence is defined by a raised\nplatform containing low, irregular earthworks to the north east of the\ngarden earthworks. Traces of a substantial brick wall are visible in the\nnorth east corner of the site.\nThe formal garden remains are represented by a rectangular earthwork,\nmeasuring a maximum of 100m long by 80m wide. A square mound, 40m by 40m, is\nplaced centrally within the earthwork. There is a slight bank forming a border\naround the perimeter of the mound which is quartered by two, 2.5m wide, raised\nwalkways indicating the positions of ornamental flowerbeds. Both the borders\nand the paths are less than 0.2m high. The mound stands about 1m above the\nsurrounding broad, level area which extends beyond the base some 18m to the\nnorth east and south west, and about 8m to the north west and south east. This\nflat area is bounded by a flat-topped bank averaging about 6m wide, though\nboth the corners and the north east sides are slightly wider. From the inside,\nthe bank stands about 1m high but externally it rises to about 1.5m above the\nbottom of a surrounding ditch. This ditch is generally about 4m wide except\nalong the north eastern arm where it is up to 8m wide. A further low bank\ndefines the outside edge of the ditch. It is about 3m wide and survives to a\nheight of 0.3m to 0.4m, except on the north west side where it has been\nincorporated into a later boundary. The circuit of the surrounding banks is\nbroken on the north west side by a 10m wide ramped causeway leading into the\ncentre of the garden. The earthworks are at their largest and most impressive\non the north east side where they face onto the magnate's residence.\nA small excavation was undertaken across the earthworks in 1969. Although they\ndid not proceed much below the topsoil, the investigations revealed that the\nbottom of the ditch was lined with a horizontal bed of stones. Pottery of the\n13th to 16th centuries and small amounts of building material were recovered.\nThe name Someries Castle is derived from William de Someries, whose residence stood on the site in the 13th century. The exact location of his manor house is not known but in the 16th century the antiquarian John Leland noted that the remains of an `old palace' could be seen. The garden earthworks, whilst bearing a superficial resemblance to a medieval moat, are firmly in the tradition of the formal gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries. The adjacent magnate's residence was built by Lord Wenlock, who acquired the Someries estate in the 1430s. The mansion is thus thought to be one of the earliest brick buildings in England. After Wenlock's death, the estate passed to Thomas Rotherham, Bishop of Lincoln and later Archbishop of York; King James I stayed here with one of Rotherham's descendants in 1605. The palace was never completed, although an inventory of 1606 lists 20 rooms in use.

{"question":"Could you explain step-by-step how dyadic behaviorism attempts to analyze triadic relations in cognitive science?","answer":"Dyadic behaviorism attempts to analyze triadic relations by: 1) Breaking down triadic relations into series of dyadic events (like energy exchanges), 2) Treating symbolic activity through formal sciences (logic, mathematics, syntax), while 3) Assigning the actual activity to learning theory using dyadic formulations of the form R = f(O), where R represents response variables and O represents stimulus variables. However, according to the theory, this approach is inadequate since genuine triadic relations (like talking-and-listening) cannot be reduced to series of dyadic relations.","context":["Peirce believed that there are two kinds of natural phenomena. First there are those events which involve “dyadic relations,” such as obtain in the “physical forces . . . between pairs of particles.” The other kind of event entails “triadic relations”:\nAll dynamical action, or action of brute force, physical or psychical, either takes place between two subjects . . . or at any rate is a resultant of such action between pairs. But by “semiosis” I mean, on the contrary, an action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of three subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs.\nIf A throws B away and B hits C in the eye, this event may be understood in terms of two dyadic relations, one between A and B, the other between B and C. But if A gives B to C, a genuine triadic relation exists. “Every genuine triadic relation involves meaning. “An index sign is part of a dyadic relation. An index refers to the object it denotes by virtue of really being affected by that object. Examples of indexes: a low barometer as an index of rain , the cry of warning of a driver to a pedestrian. A symbol, however, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. “The index is physically connected with its object . . . but the symbol is connected with its object by virtue of . . . the symbol-using mind.”\nDyadic events are, presumably, those energy exchanges conventionally studied by the natural sciences: subatomic particles colliding, chemical reactions, actions of force-fields on bodies, physical and chemical transactions across biological membranes, neuron discharges, etc.\nTriadic events, on the other hand, characteristically involve symbols and symbol users. Moreover, a genuine triadic relation cannot be reduced to a series of dyadic relations. Peirce seems to be saying that when a symbol user receives a symbol as “meaning” such and such an object, we may not understand this event as a sequence of dyadic events or energy exchanges even though dyadic events and energy exchanges are involved: sound waves in air, excitation of sensory end-organ, afferent nerve impulse, electro colloidal synaptic event, efferent nerve impulse, muscle contraction, or glandular secretion.\nPeirce’s distinction between dyadic and triadic behavior has been noted before, but so pervasive has been the influence of what might be called dyadic behaviorism that Peirce’s “triadic relation” has been recognized only to the degree that it can be set forth as a congeries of dyads. Morris, for example, interprets Peirce’s triad as implying that in addition to response and stimulus there is a third factor, a “reinforcing” state of affairs. This is like saying that Einstein’s special theory will be accepted only to the degree that it can be verified by Newtonian mechanics. Like Newtonian mechanics, dyadic theory can account for perhaps 98 per cent of natural phenomena. Unfortunately the phenomenon of talking-and-listening falls in the remaining 2 per cent.\nWhat would happen if we took Peirce seriously? That is to say, if we retain the posture of behavioral science which interests itself only in the overt behavior of other organisms, what are we to make of observable behavior which cannot be understood as a series of dyadic energy transactions? What has happened in the past is that we have admitted of course that there is such a thing as symbol mongering, as naming things, as uttering sentences which are true or false, as “rules” by which names are assigned and sentences formed. We have admitted that such activity is a natural phenomenon and as such is open to scientific investigation. But what kind of scientific investigation? We have gotten around the difficulty by treating the products of symbol-mongering formally, by what Carnap calls the formal sciences (logic, mathematics, syntax), while assigning the activity itself to a factual science, in this case learning theory, which has not, however, been able to give an account of it. It is no secret that learning theorists will have no truck with symbols and meaning. Most textbooks of psychology do not list the word symbol in their indexes. Indeed, how can learning theory, as we know it, give an account of symbolic activity? If we are to believe Peirce, it cannot. For the empirical laws of learning theory are formulations of dyadic events of the form R = f(O), in which R = response variables and 0 = stimulus variables. *\n* Actually the dyads should be segmented in some such order as 0 = f(S), in which 0 = the organic variables and S = the stimulus variables; lb = f(Ia), in which I = the intervening neurophysiological variables within the organism; and R = f(O), in which R = response variables, or measurement of behavior properties."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5ad86fe3-b12f-479b-bf38-d37484476d09>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Is the immune response through B cells in lymph nodes more direct/efficient than the filtration process in lymph node sinuses - yes or no?","answer":"Yes, the B cell immune response in lymph nodes is more direct and efficient. When B cells encounter their specific antigens in the outer cortex of the lymph node, they immediately internalize the antigen and can undergo antibody class switching to produce specific antibodies (IgG, IgA, or IgE). In contrast, the filtration in lymph node sinuses is a more general process where reticuloendothelial cells perform broad phagocytosis of particles passing through the cortical and medullary sinuses.","context":["Create an account\nChoose the true statement about fetal hemoglobin.\nFetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin.\nWhich of the following is true regarding the extrinsic pathway of blood clotting?\nThe extrinsic pathway is triggered by tissue factor.\nHemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) can develop when an Rh+ mother is pregnant with an Rh- child.\nWhich of the following shows the correct sequence of hemostasis from start to end?\nVascular spasm, platelet plug formation, and coagulation.\nThe process of actively metabolizing oxygen to produce bleach and hydrogen to kill bacteria is known as:\nErythroblastosis fetalis is caused by:\nRh incompatibility between an Rh- mother and an Rh+ child during pregnancy.\nIndividuals with malaria have a better chance of surviving if they have which type of anemia?\nWhich of the following facts has the greatest effect on making RBCs very effecient oxygen transporters?\nThey generated ATP by anaerobic mechanisms and do not consume any of the oxygen they carry.\nWhich of the following types of white blood cells kills parasitic worms, destroys antibody complexes, and inactivates some inflammatory chemicals of allergy?\nThe percentage of total volume used to determine the number of erythrocytes in a blood sample is referred to as the:\nPernicious anemia may result from:\nThe lack of vitamin B12 in diet or deficiency of intrinsic factor needed to absorb B12.\nCaused by an excess blood flow to the injured area; helps dilute harmful substances and brings in excess oxygen.\nDisease that leads to drooping facial muscles because the neuromuscular junctions are damaged.\nChemicals released from injured tissues stimulate rapid proliferation and release of cells.\nTissue factor (TFIII) or tissue thromoplastin.\nTriggers the 'shortcut' extrinsic mechanism that bypasses several steps of the intrinsic pathway.\nProduced by the liver and exerts osmotic pressure to maintain water balance between blood and tissues.\nIron deficiency anemia.\nCan result from inadequate intake of iron containing foods and impaired iron absorption.\nResults from destruction or inhibition of the red marrow by certain bacterial toxins, drugs, and ionizing radiation.\nSickle cell anemia.\nCaused by abnormal hemoglobin from a change in DNA which results in a change in one of the 287 amino acids.\nCaused by defective synthesis of heme groups and production of nonfunctional hemoglobin molecules.\nWhich of the following is characteristic of a secondary immune response?\nA secondary immune response lasts longer than a primary immune response.\nA graft that is transplanted from one person to a genetically identical individual is an example of a:\n___ is the property of lymphocytes that prevents them from attacking the body's own cells.\nWhich of the following is not a property of interferons (IFNs)?\nIFNs stimulate B cells to produce antibodies.\nSevere combined immundeficiency syndrome (SCID).\nGenetic defect resulting in a shortage of B and/or T cells.\nWhich type of cell wanders through the deep cortex of lymph nodes searching for dendritic cells that are presenting their antigens?\nLymphoid tissue associated with mucosal membrane, including the tonsils, Peyer's patches, and select areas of the respiratory system, are collectively known as ___.\nAntibodies that are free in the extracellular fluid are known as:\nImmunoglobulins or gamma globulins.\nVaccinations allow our bodies to generate a ___ immune response when we encounter the antigen.\nAntimicrobial proteins known as ___, are produced by infected body cells in order to block viral reproduction in neighboring uninfected cells.\nAntibodies in breast milk allow the passive transfer of immunity from mother to baby.

{"question":"What's the deal with project communication strategies and how do they relate to project timeline predictions? Need help understanding this! 👋","answer":"Project communication strategies involve multiple approaches: using newsletters timed carefully (like Friday afternoon or before lunch), choosing appropriate tools for different audience groups (such as podcasts for younger audiences), and maintaining ongoing communication while distinguishing between dissemination and discussion. These communications must be planned early and avoid appearing one-sided. Regarding timeline predictions, they are handled through probability management, where instead of single predictions, projects use sample distributions showing multiple possible completion times. This approach acknowledges that projects can have various outcomes - for example, having a 75% probability of completion within 10 weeks, or a 90% probability within 17 weeks. Both aspects require careful management of expectations and clear communication of risks and probabilities.","context":["Most of our projects are focused on the development of a technological tool, and that on its own is an enormous task. Activities such as interviewing users, user needs analysis, writing of specifications and prototyping, are very much connected with the projects' cores. Somehow we take for granted that everyone is going to like our product and find it useful. That is not always the case.\nAround all these initiatives there are a lot of human and social forces which affect or are affected by our projects. These forces need to be understood and assessed so they can be used in the design and implementation of our products. Stakeholders are the people and organisations that generate those forces which can be in favour or against us. Knowing what they do, think and expect is essential for the success of our work. We need to get most of them on board, and when that is not possible we need to be aware of their presence… and reasons for not liking us.\nAnyway, we had 6 presentations, all of them different. (Yes, it was unbelievable how different our approaches were.) I guess those depended on the kinds of organisations we are working in, the kinds of projects we are working on and the kinds of stakeholders we were aiming at. I have embedded the presentations below so you can have a look at them (they are organised by order of presentation). Next to them I have attached some comments that Sally Rumsey (BRII project manager) wrote.\n- Aims at efficient sharing of research activity information by using semantic web technologies.\n- Exploratory phase around the whole University, aimed at understanding organisational structures and research cultures\n- Difficult to make sense of the chaotic structure of Oxford\n- Polarized views were found with respect to uses and needs of research activity data\n- views are influenced by research field, and kind of job (academic, non-academic), and scope (does the job involve just one field or department, or more: divisional level, University level, cross disciplinary?)\n- Aimed at high level enterprise systems\n- Developed a communication plan\n- An intellectual thread runs through all communications whatever the medium\n- Delivering this high intensity communications is hard work\n- There is a distinct gulf between the strategies and the technologies\n- Aiming to improve institutional data flow\n- Systems have grown up piecemeal\n- 32 separate systems so data sharing is problematic\n- Creating a new information architecture which will lead to personalised services\n- Selling data flow as an institutional problem\n- Created ‘Wall of data doom’ diagrams of systems. Invited comments on their interpretation of systems based on the interviews.\n- Simplifying learner administration processes\n- Aiming to improve student enquiries and applications processes\n- Identified blockers and supporters within their stakeholders\n- Created a graph of Power against Interest and aimed communications at each group\n- Use staff news publication for regular updates\n- Demonstrate progress and change to counter any cynicism about nothing ever happening\nAcademic Networking [Cambridge]\n- Created using user experience methodology\n- Research phase followed by design phase\n- Need to design the criteria and then decide the number of participants\n- Used academia.edu and LinkedIn to find participants\n- Asked the question “Where are the problems?”\n- Clustered people who behave in the same way\n- Used similar behaviours to create 3 personas (a bit like use case)\n- Get input from stakeholders. Using a paper based task helped create ownership. Ask lots of ‘Why?’ questions when testing paper prototype\n- Keep going until every participant is happy\n- Read full text\neAdministration of Teaching [Cambridge]\n- Created sort of entities of jobs, people, units. Jobs are a teaching activity done by one person\n- Using 6 departments for this project\n- Involve those who will be involved in future ongoing maintenance of the system from early on\n- A problem of how to maintain momentum of input. Develop user forum\n- Read full text\nAfter lunch Susannah Wintersgill,, Head of Internal Communications, Public Affairs, Oxford University, gave a presentation on Stakeholder buy-in for a project that involves the desing of a new staff web gateway for Oxford University.\nShe told us that the Uni website has >7000 pages managed by around 24 groups and includes about 187 departments etc. Any decisions have to be approved by Congregation, a group of around 4000 people. This preserves academic freedom and the democratic structure of Oxford.\nThere are major questions of who are the stakeholders and how to reach them\n- Steering Group (for direction)\n- Consultation Group (as representative of College & University as possible and carry out user testing)\n- Contesting Group – vocal and critical at set milestones. Clear criteria and remit. They are there to challenge and critique not for every thought of theirs to be incorporated in the website\n- Good to build in communications from an early stage.\n- Use volunteers as champions who will talk to others and gather research. To senior officers of the University eg VC. Use departmental newsletters to communicate. Plan and build in from the beginning.\n- Important not just to have one editor of the website – bias and could limit development\n- Consultation is key – everyone likes to have a say\n- Danger of stakeholder fatigue. Don’t overload your stakeholders. Use a mini survey to find out who else is doing similar or related work within the University\n- Important to learn from user research but not be absolutely tied to it\nThese are some notes from our last session. We discussed in groups our approaches and came up with ideas and suggestions for better practices. We hope we will develop these notes into more userfriendly format in the near future:\n- It is easy to pay only lip service to stakeholder buy-in\n- Communications plan – do it early. Importance of planning.\n- Tasks – make your stakeholders do something but keep it within reason and not to much\n- Identify stakeholders – what do they want?\n- Sending out newsletters etc can have mixed results. It doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll be read. Timed carefully eg Friday afternoon or just before lunch\n- Choose the right tools for the job – the message, the medium and the way to know and approach your audience (identify narrow bands of different groups). Eg some may prefer podcasts (young?) to printed literature (older?)\n- Manage expectations\n- Try not to appear too one-sided. If everything appears marvellous people may not believe you.\n- Difficulties of selling the potential when the project is only a proof of concept or pilot. How do you show the bigger picture? Stakeholders may only see the things that are immediately relevant to them (think – light bulb is useful, but the potential of electricity). Counteract this by ensuring that the initial project is useful. Create relevant demos and pilots, something that people can use\n- Either describe by saying ‘This is the end goal and these are the prerequisites we need to get there (painting bigger picture but possibly raising expectations) or say ‘This is what we’re going to do in this project that is useful to you’ (but danger of losing the ultimate goal\n- Communications must be onging. Distinguish between dissemination and discussion\n- Balance the number of stakeholders involved with the quality of the feedback.\nPrint this post","Usually, \"How long will it take to do this?\" doesn't have just one answer. Whether 'this' is a small task or a large project, it has a whole bunch of answers - each with its own probability of being right or nearly right. The answer is an uncertain variable; it's a variable because it can have more than one value and it's uncertain because we don't know what the variable's value is (or will be). We don't know how long it will take to finish the task and we won't know for sure until it's done. Until then, it's an uncertain variable. After that, we refer to it as an actual value.\nUnfortunately, we can't leave it at that. There's a third value we call the plan value. That's the value we aim at, the value we hope will be right, the value we use to coordinate with other related activities. That's a value we choose and, hopefully, we make that choice knowing what the associated risks and probabilities are. Tagging along with that choice is the project schedule we hope will produce it, and the associated project cost we hope not to exceed. We don’t “manage” uncertainty; we stare it in the eye and make a decision.\nThe probability management approach to uncertain variables is to quantify that uncertainty with a sample distribution. If you aren't familiar with sample distributions, I cover them in this blog post.\nThe key to reading a sample distribution is that it's a list of numbers and each number is a possible value of the uncertain variable. Also, it's unbiased; each number is as likely as any of the others to be the closest to the variable's actual value.\nThe list will usually have hundreds or thousands of sample values, so looking at the numbers is not going to be terribly useful. We could calculate its average and other statististical properties, but this throws away a lot of information and gives only the illusion of relevance.\nWe need to see the range of possibilities, the relative probabilities, and most of all, if we choose a particular value as the plan, the odds of meeting or beating the plan. We need some pictures.\nOne marginally useful picture is a histogram.\nThis shows you the relative probability of different values. In this histogram we see that the most likely value is around 4 of whatever the unit is. On the other hand, there's a lot of the graph to the right - the probabilities are lower but there are more of them. Since we're really more interested in the probability of meeting or beating any particular plan, we need a better picture.\nThe better picture is a probability management version of what statisticians refer to as a cumulative distribution function, but we won't need any calculus to build it. A percentile curve just plots the sample values against their rank.\nIf you pick any point on the curve, the horizontal axis gives you a value and the vertical axis tells you what percentage of samples are equal to or less than that value. There's a complementary version of the chart for \"equal to or more\" for things like revenue and profit. The dotted red line is usually hooked to a control so it can be moved, making it easy to read-off values and percentiles.\nOn this chart, if the value axis shows weeks to complete the task, we can see that 50% of the sample values are six weeks or less, and 80% are twelve weeks or less.\nHow we read this is a function of where we got the sample values, who the audience is, and what kind of decision we're making.\nThe Judgement of History\n\"We looked at a large collection of similar tasks and used their actual durations as the sample values. We don't have any special magic, so the probability that we'll meet or beat a particular target is no better than that of the sample tasks.\"\nThe Judgement of Experts\n\"Since we started our program of estimator training and periodic calibrations, our senior developers have been giving us fairly reliable estimates. This is their consensus distribution for this job.\"\nIf we plan on six weeks it's an even money bet; heads we'll make it, tails we run over.\nIf we want something more like a sure thing, the 90% scenario is 17 weeks.\nThere's a 75% probability, 3 to 1 odds, that 10 weeks will be enough.\nWith a twelve-week plan there's a 20% probability of missing the date, and a 10% probability of overrunning by five weeks or more.\nThese are all characterizations of the same estimate.\nManage the Risk\nIn other words, \"Do you feel lucky?\" The choice to peg the plan at six weeks or seventeen or somewhere in between is about managing risk. What are the consequences of being late? What are the consequences of estimating high? Somewhere between those two is a management decision."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d89f08dd-cf09-42d6-bd2c-2cc99ac8ef77>","<urn:uuid:bb256b3c-8015-43c8-bb20-c53ab42ee138>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do visual elements play in preserving cultural identity in both Ukrainian folk traditions and Catholic church design?","answer":"In Ukrainian traditions, folk artists used visual elements like icon painting on glass planes to preserve cultural identity, with specific compositional principles dividing icons into cartouche frame groups and full-surface compositions. Meanwhile, in Catholic church design, visual elements like stained glass windows, statues, and architectural features serve as a 'Catechism in Stone and Glass,' teaching and preserving religious traditions, especially during times when Latin Mass wasn't understood by common people. Both traditions use visual arts as educational tools and means of cultural preservation, though they employ different specific techniques and mediums to achieve this goal.","context":["Pokotylo Hanna.

The heritage of Ukrainian Art Scholarship An attempt of systematization. P. 775-775","The art and architecture of a Catholic church can help us to know more about our Faith and to provide us with many opportunities for prayer and contemplation of the Blessed Trinity, the Holy Family and Saints and especially the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.\nThe General Instruction of the Roman Missal and other church documents provide architects and visual artists with guidelines on how the interior of a church should be designed and decorated, but each church building is unique to the community it serves and reflects the personal touches of its pastor and parishioners.\nBefore there was a Building, the Community was served.\nMasses have been offered at Folly Beach since 1937–at the Elks Lodge on E. Atlantic Avenue until a hurricane in 1940 destroyed the building. Between 1940 and 1950 Mass was offered on Folly Beach in a number of places including the famed Folly Pavilion, the old Community Center and even at the Coast Guard Radar Station. Construction of this church began in 1949 and the First Mass was celebrated in the present Church of Our Lady of Good Counsel on Christmas Day in 1950. You can read about the history of our parish here. Entrance to Our Lady of Good Counsel Church,Folly Beach showing the cornerstone.\nLook around Our Lady of Good Counsel church and see what it has to teach us about our Faith and our community.\nParts of our church\nThere are three main parts of our church building. 1) The Nave 2) The Sanctuary 3) The Sacristy (including the Confessional)\nThe Nave is the area reserved for worshippers, and includes the central aisle. The name is derived from the Latin ‘navis’, meaning a ship, possibly with some reference to the “ship of St. Peter” or the Ark of Noah. Many of the technical names of things you find in a church come from Greek or Latin words because those were the languages Christians spoke when these objects were named.\nThe first thing you see when you enter the door of our church is a pool of water—it represents the water in which we were baptized—because Baptism is the door to the Church. As we enter the church door, each person dips their right hand in the water, makes the sign of the cross and renews the promises that our parents and Godparents made for us at our Baptism. There is also a reservoir of Holy Water available for parishioners to use. Many people use a Holy Water font at home.\nOur parish baptismal font is located near the entrance of the church, but is moved to the sanctuary area when the sacrament is conferred. The postures that we use in church; standing, kneeling, sitting, etc., have a history of their own. Long ago people stood up for most of the Mass, and there were no pews or fixed seating. Pews enabled the congregation to sit and listen to the sermon, which often lasted several hours. In the 13th century, when Christians did not receive Holy Communion frequently and the high point of the Mass was looking at the host rather than consuming it, the congregation knelt in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament just as they were accustomed to kneel before an earthly king. As the practice of kneeling in church became more frequent, small kneeling benches were added. Standing is a posture of adult respect and attention, which is something we do when we hear the Gospel proclaimed.\nThe walls of the nave are decorated with colored glass windows. “Stained glass” is a term for how some glass is colored, but not all colored glass windows are technically “stained glass”. The windows in our church (on the left side) represent the Joyful and (on the right side) Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary. Each window tells the story of an event in the life of Mary and Jesus. From the Annunciation to the Crowning of Mary, Queen of Heaven and Earth. There are three other colored glass windows in the church, and two in the sacristy.\nAlso on the walls are 14 plaques representing the Stations of the Cross. From early times Christians have wanted to visit the Holy Land and follow the way that Jesus walked to Calvary, remembering the important parts of that story. In Europe during the Middle Ages the devotion of the Way of the Cross was made popular by Franciscans. This prayer enabled people who could not afford the expense of the long and dangerous journey to Jerusalem to be able to follow the Way of the Cross in their own town, remembering what Jesus did for them. Our attention moves from one station to the next, praying over these incidents in the life of Jesus. We do this especially during Lent.\nThe Joyful Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\nFinding the Child Jesus in the Temple\nThe Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\nThe Decent of the Holy Spirit\nCoronation of Mary\nThe word sanctuary means a holy place. While the entire church is a holy place, special reverence is given to the area of the church where the priest and other ministers conduct the liturgy. Always raised up higher than the rest of the church, the sanctuary is the place where Catholics believe Jesus is truly present in the consecrated bread and wine of Holy Communion.\nThe presider’s chair and seating for the other ministers are in the sanctuary. The presider’s chair is not a throne for someone set apart, but is arranged so that the priest is seen to be a member of the worshiping community even though he has a special office to perform.\nThe Ambo, reading stand, or lectern, holds the readings from Sacred Scripture. The church teaches that “The dignity of the Word of God requires the Church to have a suitable place for announcing His message so that the attention of the people may be easily directed to that place during the Liturgy of the Word.”\nThe altar is the holy table upon which we celebrate the Lord’s Supper. It functions as both banquet table and altar of sacrifice; the Mass is both Holy Thursday (meal) and Good Friday (sacrifice). When the Eucharist is celebrated the table is covered with an altar cloth. The different colors represent the different liturgical seasons or feasts. The top of the table is always covered in white.\nA Crucifix is a cross that has the image of Christ crucified on it. The Catholic Church directs that there should always be a crucifix on the altar, with a candle on either side. To better fulfill this requirement, the crucifix is also hung on the wall behind the altar, so that when the priest is facing the congregation the crucifix is not obstructed. The antipendium (the part of the altar below the table, facing the people) has the image of the Paschal Lamb which symbolizes Christ, “the Lamb of God”, who redeemed the world by the shedding of His blood. A sanctuary lamp burning before the tabernacle has traditionally told Catholics of the presence of the consecrated Bread. Our sanctuary lamp hangs from the rafters, and if you look up near it, you will see the image of a dove, representing the Holy Spirit — a gift from one of our parishioners.\nFrom the time of the apostles, when members of the assembly could not be present for Sunday Mass because they were sick or in prison, some of the bread and wine was saved after communion and carried to the absent members. The Eucharist began to be reserved so that it could be received as viaticum at the moment of death. The place for reserving this bread for the sick and dying came to be called the tabernacle.\nThe candles which we find in church were once primarily functional and gave light for reading the Scriptures and celebrating the sacred action. Now that churches have electrical lights, the candles play a more symbolic function. Before every Mass, the candles on either side of the altar are lit, and on special occasions, the more elaborate candelabras beside the tabernacle are lit.\nThe Paschal Candle is large wax candle, set in a great candlestick and featured in the service on Holy Saturday. The five grains of incense set cross-wise in the candle recall the sacred wounds retained in Christ’s glorified body. (John 20:25-27) This candle is also used in Baptismal celebrations to symbolize the transfer of the “light of Christ” to parents and Godparents who have the responsibility of passing the Faith onto their children. Baptismal candles are lit from the paschal candle and given to the parents of the baptized.\nThere is another colored glass window in the Sanctuary, it depicts Jesus breaking bread and blessing wine. It evokes Jesus both at the Last Supper, instituting the Holy Eucharist and Jesus revealing himself to the disciples he met on the road to Emmaus, after His resurrection. Recall how the two disciples “Recognized Him in the breaking of the bread.” (Luke 24:30)\nAnother distinguishing feature of Catholic churches are statues and other devotional images. Long ago, when the Mass and readings from the Bible were in Latin and not always understood by the faithful, statues, pictures and stained-glass windows often became the people’s catechism, teaching and explaining the mysteries of our faith and honoring the heroes who lived it. That is how the expression, a Catechism in Stone and Glass came to be.\nIn this image Mary, the Mother of Jesus, is wearing a blue mantle, symbolizing heavenly grace. The statue shows her crushing a serpent. It is a reference to Gen. 3:14-15 “Then the LORD God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you shall be banned from all the animals and from all the wild creatures; On your belly shall you crawl, and dirt shall you eat all the days of your life. I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; He will strike at your head, while you strike at his heel.”This reading from the first book of the Bible is understood as the first promise of a Redeemer for fallen mankind. The woman’s offspring is Jesus Christ.\nPeople often ask for special help from the saints who are represented by the statues. Lighting a candle in front of a statue expresses the desire that their prayers continue even after they leave the church.\nThe St. Joseph Statue includes the symbol of a budding lily on a staff. Pious legend tells us that when the Virgin Mary was only fourteen years old each of her potential suitors left his staff in the temple through the night with the hope that God would indicate which suitor He preferred for her. When the suitors checked the next morning Joseph’s staff was budding into leaf. Another reason for the symbol of the lily on St. Joseph’s staff is because the lily symbolizes chastity and virtue. St. Joseph is the chaste spouse of Mary. He is also the Patron Saint of a Happy Death and the lily represents the resurrection of the body after death.\nOur Parish Patron, Our Lady of Good Counsel is depicted in the large round colored glass windows. This title for Mary, Our Lady of Good Counsel dates back to an ancient fresco icon that is currently in Rome. Mary, The Blessed Mother of Jesus, under the title Our Lady of Good Counsel, was proclaimed the Patron of Albania in the year 1895. There is a very interesting story about how the original fresco image of Mary and Jesus made a miraculous journey from Albania to Rome. The image of Mary and Jesus in the circular glass window above the altar (shown below) of our church is similar to the icon of Our Lady of Good Counsel now in Rome. In the colored glass image above the entrance door of our church (shown left) Mary wears a crown, perhaps to recognize that she is Queen of Heaven and Earth.\nA Catholic historian once analyzed the icon in this way:\nEverything in Our Lady’s face gives the impression of her great satisfaction in having her Child in her arms. She is thinking only of Him. But she is not looking at Him directly, she is looking at the one who is praying to her. But her face touches His forehead. It is a moment of maternal love and tenderness.\nHe holds her like a person who desires nothing else in this world but her. He feels the joy of being protected by her. It seems that she is trying to guess what is going on in His soul, paying attention to realize if He will say something. She is not asking anything in her prayers; she is contemplating His person. He has this great intimacy with her, but His eyes do not look straight at her, they are turned upward. While her eyes look downward, His eyes are raised, up toward God the Father. We look to her; she looks to Him; and He looks to the two other Persons of the Most Holy Trinity.\nShe receives our prayers and transmits them to God. He receives them as God and also transmits our prayers to the other Persons of the Holy Trinity. So, you have the Catholic doctrine of the mediation of graces delicately expressed in this picture, perhaps without having noticed it at first glance.\nPerhaps when you draw nearer to the picture to contemplate the relationship between her and Him, you may feel yourself invited to enter into their intimacy. You may feel yourself being understood, loved, and helped by her, and by Him. You may feel yourself adopted by her as a son or daughter and, therefore like a brother of the Child Jesus.\nThis is the area of the church where the priest’s vestments and the vessels and books used in liturgical celebrations are kept. It is also where the priest and altar servers “vest” for Mass. The particulars of the items held in the sacristy will be discussed in another article. The sacristy bell is another gift from a parishioner. It is a long held Catholic tradition to ring a bell to signify that the priest was leaving the sacristy and entering the church. This bell is decorated with symbols of St. Peter–the fish symbolizes Christ’s call to “Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.” Also, the fish was an early symbol of Christianity, because the initial letters of each word in the Greek phrase “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Savior” form the word ICHTHUS, which means “fish.” The sacristy bell also has a key which recalls Christ’s words:\n“I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” Matt. 16:19\nMany of the fixtures and furnishings of our parish church were made possible by special gifts presented in memory of loved ones. Small brass memorial plaques, such as those beneath each of the colored glass windows, recall the names. Praying for the souls of the people inscribed on those plaques is another way to serve our Faith Community.\nComing into the church for Mass, we may miss some of the details around us, but when we take the time to look, we can see that our parish church invites adoration and contemplation even when there are no liturgical celebrations. It is a “beautiful house of the Lord where the faithful are free to recollect themselves. It is a place where, in a restless world, one can meet the Lord in peace.”\nSources: Catechism of Catholic Church, the Catholic Encyclopedia, Catholicliturgy.com, Prof. Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira Our Lady of Good Counsel of Genazzano, Thomas Richstatter, O.F.M.

{"question":"What's the difference between psychological anomie and cognitive dissonance in terms of how they affect a person's beliefs? 🤔","answer":"Psychological anomie and cognitive dissonance affect beliefs differently. In psychological anomie, individuals cease to respect social norms because these have lost their meaning, leading them to value individual interests above social interests. In contrast, cognitive dissonance occurs when people experience inconsistent mental states that create ambivalence, leading them to change their beliefs to reduce this uncomfortable state. While anomie results in a rejection of social conventions, cognitive dissonance drives people to modify their beliefs to maintain internal consistency.","context":["Anomie is a concept that refers, in a general way, to the absence of law, norms or conventions. The word, as such, comes from the Greek ἀνομία (anomy).\nThis etymology shows its use in the field of both social sciences and psychology, in which it refers to the absence of norms or conventions in a society or person, or their disrespect or degradation by an individual or a group of individuals\nThe consequences of anomie range from maladjustment to social norms, to the transgression of laws and antisocial behaviors.\nAnomie, in medicine, can also refer to a language disorder characterized by difficulties in remembering the name of things. In this sense, the word is composed with the voices a- , which denotes denial, and the Latin nomen, which means ‘name’.\nIn the disciplines of social sciences and sociology, anomie is related to the lack of social norms or conventions or their degradation as a product of a set of factors.\nThe French sociologist Émile Durkheim considered that human nature needed an authority that would put limits (norms, conventions) on his passions and desires, since his absence could become destructive to the individual himself.\nDurkheim also refers to how inequalities resulting from the social and economic dynamics of capitalism influence social anomie. Individuals, feeling that the norms and conventions under which they live lack a sense of justice and fairness, cease to respect them because they believe they have lost meaning for them.\nIn fact, Robert K. Merton considers that anomie can be considered as a consequence of the dissociation between the cultural aspirations of a society and the means or paths that individuals have to reach them, which means that in order to achieve these goals individuals must Sometimes violating certain social norms, which results in a breakdown from which antisocial behaviors originate.\nAnomie in psychology\nAnomie is a psychological disturbance that makes it difficult for a person to behave according to the set of legal, cultural or moral norms and conventions that govern life in society.\nHuman behavior is constantly regulated by this set of explicit or implicit rules, which constitute a model of social control, which the individual has difficulty adapting, due to his own human nature.\nIn psychological anomie, the individual values his interests and individual motivations above social interests because he has ceased to respect them since for him all these norms and conventions have lost their meaning.\nAsylum-bearing anomie is a behavior that is characterized by the negative and erroneous vision that an individual develops of himself. In asylum-oriented anomie, the person has a distorted idea of themselves and their abilities, so that they do not feel in a position to succeed in a difficult or adverse situation, rather they react by demonstrating their limitations or disabilities. It can be suffered by an individual or an entire social group.\nAsylum-bearing anomie is a consequence of situations of marginalization and exclusion, whether social, racial or ethnic. Groups that suffer from this type of discrimination feel that they cannot achieve what they set out or want, nor satisfy their personal needs or motivations, although in reality they can. Therefore, it seriously affects the personal and economic growth of individuals. The opposite of asylum-bearing anomie is social resilience, which is the ability to adapt or overcome adversity.\nAnomie in medicine\nAnomia is known as a language disorder in which the individual has difficulty calling things by name. It can be presented partially or totally.\nAnomie is one of the main characteristics of aphasic syndromes. With age, it is considered normal for most people to suffer a moderate degree of anomie.","The theory of cognitive dissonance was a framework theory with deep implications that were best appreciated by Roger Brown in the classic text Social Psychology (1965). Cognitive dissonance theory expressed the insight that the human detestation of ambivalence was at the center of the evolution of beliefs. Brown saw that Freud's insights into the repression of threatening ideation could be conceived as a reaction to the engendered ambivalence.\nCognitive dissonance theory was subsequently reduced to the platitudinous by its leading expositor, the social psychologist Scott Aronson, when he concluded that cognitive dissonance is aroused only by inconsistency with an agent's positive self-regard, reinterpreting the reduction of dissonance as limited to self-justification. The different interpretations can be illustrated in the paradigm $1/$20 experiment, where subjects changed their views more toward the views receiving a token payment for their advocacy than did subjects paid a substantial amount. On Festinger's original account, the subjects in the token-payment condition suffered more cognitive dissonance, because the knowledge that they are advocating something different from what they actually believe is an inconsistent mental state. Whereas, on Aronson's self-justification account, the inconsistency is not between the beliefs expressed and the beliefs held but between the expression of bogus beliefs and subjects’ positive self-concept. Aronson contended that subjects resist thinking of themselves as the sort of persons who would deceive others to their detriment about one's own beliefs for no substantial reason.\nIf cognitive-dissonance theory concerns defensive self-justification, its impressiveness would lie not in its enunciating a new psychological principle but rather in showing that the otherwise banal self-justification hypothesis reaches further than we expect. But to establish that the $1 and $20 experiment concerns self-justification, Aronson needs evidence that agents think it more honorable to lie for a large reward than for a small one. This is far from obvious given that the criminal law on the subject says the opposite: the transgressor's gain increases the severity of fraud.\nFestinger was on the right track. What repels subjects is ambiguity and ambivalence. Cognitive dissonance is more fundamental than self-justification; it may provide the explanation for the human tendency to self-justify, and it potentially explains much more. Festinger’s theory is consistent with Sigmund Freud's view that conative overload is the driving force for ego defense.\nFestinger's theory isn’t explicit about the nature of the inconsistency. Festinger says that usually agents don't tell a falsehood for no good reason. But it isn't the case that all expectancy failures arouse dissonance. When Festinger presents the theory more formally, he explains that cognitions A and B are dissonant when A implies B's obverse, a term for which Festinger provides no logical analysis.\nA new interpretation of cognitive-dissonance theory in the Festingerian hatred-of-ambivalence tradition is the action-oriented account proposed by Harmon-Jones and colleagues, who, first, recognized that the state of cognition giving rise to cognitive dissonance should be distinguished from the uncomfortable emotional state. Discrepant cognitions are said to produce dissonance, where cognitions are discrepant if they have opposed implications for action. They facilitate or impair a line of conduct, as is consistent with experimental evidence that dissonance starts when agents commit to specific conduct, at which point agents marshal their mental resources to actually carry out their commitments.\nThus, when subjects in the $1 and $20 experiment commit to the bargain by agreeing to lie, they will be best equipped to carry out their commitment either if they are motivated to earn $20, or if they can convince themselves that the communication is true.\nThe action-based interpretation of cognitive-dissonance theory resolves the major theoretical problem facing another theory in social psychology, construal-level theory, which proposes that the deployment of abstract and concrete concepts functions as separate systems. Agents, accordingly, can hold abstract belief that are in logical tension, even contradiction. This has led at least one commentator to conclude that abstract beliefs evolved for purposes related to social signaling. But for signaling to be viable, abstract belief must be subject to concrete belief to some substantial degree..\nOn the present view, the primary function of abstract thought is the self-regulation of concrete conation. The direct manipulation of the world for practical purposes is a function of concrete thought. But abstract, while not directive for action, serves to energize (or de-energize) it.\nCognitive-dissonance theory explains how agents may be induced to change their abstract beliefs due to pressure form concrete experience. The balancing act that an explanation must accomplish is to permit abstract logical contradictions while also prohibiting tensions logically weaker. This is accomplished by making the cognitive discrepancy between abstract and concrete representations pragmatic rather than logical. These tensions are perhaps the only means we have for rational influence on far-mode beliefs. While logical contradiction is not necessarily dissonant, sometimes it is."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:957a428b-130c-4dd9-b392-e03eacecd3a8>","<urn:uuid:eb547c83-a1b8-4432-a6b6-66d725921c23>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Cloudflare's Web Analytics Vitals Explorer measure page performance, and what specific cookie types are used for analytics tracking?","answer":"Cloudflare's Web Analytics Vitals Explorer measures page performance through Core Web Vitals including Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). It collects data about element selectors, path URLs, and metric values during the page's lifespan. For analytics tracking, analysis cookies like Google Analytics are used to collect information about navigation patterns, most-used sections, and user behavior to help analyze website usage and improve usability, though these cookies are not associated with personally identifiable information.","context":["Cloudflare Web Analytics makes essential web analytics, such as the top-performing pages on your website and top referrers, available to everyone for free, and it’s becoming more powerful than ever.\nFocusing on Performance\nEarlier this year we merged Web Analytics with our Browser Insights product, which enabled customers proxying their websites through Cloudflare to evaluate visitors’ experience on their web properties through Core Web Vitals such as Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Input Delay (FID).\nIt was important to bring the Core Web Vitals performance measurements into Web Analytics given the outsized impact that page load times have on bounce rates. A page load time increase from 1s to 3s increases bounce rates by 32% and from 1s to 6s increases it by 106% (source).\nNow that you know the impact a slow-loading web page can have on your visitors, it’s time for us to make it a no-brainer to take action. Read on.\nWe believe that, to deliver the most value to our users, the product should facilitate the following process:\n- Measure the real user experience\n- Grade this experience — is it satisfactory or in need of improvement?\n- Provide actionable insights — what part of the web page should be tweaked to improve the user experience?\nAnd it all starts with Web Analytics Vitals Explorer, which started rolling out today.\nIntroducing Web Analytics Vitals Explorer\nVitals Explorer enables you to easily pinpoint which elements on your pages are affecting users the most, with accurate measurements from the visitors perspective and an easy-to-read impact grading.\nOnce this new beacon is updated on your sites — and again the update will happen transparently to you — you can then navigate to the Core Web Vitals page on Web Analytics. When entering that page, you will see three graphs grading the user experience for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). Below each graph you can see the debug section with the top five elements with a negative impact on the metric. Lastly, when clicking on either of these elements shown in the data table, you will be presented with its impact and exact paths so that you can easily decide whether this is worth keeping on your website in its current format.\nIn addition to this new Core Web Vitals content, we have also added First Paint and First Contentful Paint to the Page Load Time page. When you navigate to this page you will now see the page load summary and a graph representing page load timing. These will allow you to quickly identify any regressions to these important performance metrics.\nThis additional debugging information for Core Web Vitals is measured during the lifespan of the page (until the user leaves the tab or closes the browser window, which updates visibilityState to a hidden state).\nHere’s what we collect:\nCommon for all Core Web Vitals\n- Element is a CSS selector representing the DOM node. With this string, the developer can use `document.querySelector(<element_name>)` in their browser's dev console to find out which DOM node has a negative impact on your scores/values.\n- Path is the URL path at the time the Core Web Vitals are captured.\n- Value is the metric value for each Core Web Vitals. This value is in milliseconds for LCP or FID and a score for CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift).\nLargest Contentful Paint\n- URL is the source URL (such as image, text, web fonts).\n- Size is the source object's size in bytes.\nFirst Input Delay\n- Name is the type of event (such as mousedown, keydown, pointerdown).\nCumulative Layout Shift\nLayout information is a JSON value that includes width, height, x axis position, y axis position, left, right, top, and bottom. You are able to observe layout shifts that happen on the page by observing these values.\n- CurrentRect is the largest source element's layout information after the shift. This JSON value is shown as Current under Layout Shifts section in the Web Analytics UI.\n- PreviousRect is the largest source element's layout information before the shift. This JSON value is shown as Previous under Layout Shifts section in the Web Analytics UI.\nAdditionally, we have added two important paint timings\n- First Paint is the time between navigation and when the browser renders the first pixels to the screen.\n- First Contentful Paint is the time when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM.\nA lot of this is based on standard browser measurements, which you can read about in detail on this blog post from Google.\nAnd we are by no means done. Moving forward, we will bring this structured approach with grading and actionable insights into as Web Analytics measurements as possible, and keep guiding you through how to improve your visitors’ experience. So stay tuned.\nAnd in the meantime, do let us know what you think about this feature and ask questions on the community forums.","What is a cookie?\nA “cookie” is a harmless file with a small amount of text that is stored in your browser (such as Google Chrome or Apple’s Safari) when you visit almost any web page.

{"question":"Please list the main advantages and limitations of implementing constructed wetlands for waste treatment in emergency contexts versus traditional stadium waste management programs.","answer":"The advantages of constructed wetlands include: being decentralized with simple low-maintenance design, requiring little land (35m2 per unit), enabling immediate toilet desludging, and providing end-point sludge mineralization. However, limitations include: not being suitable for flood-prone areas or hillsides, requiring technical expertise for operation, and needing steady waste loading to maintain bacterial environment. In contrast, traditional stadium waste management like at Carter Finley faces different challenges - mainly the costs of compost pickup, though these are offset by reduced landfill fees. The stadium program requires vendor cooperation for switching to compostable materials and focuses on changing fan behavior through messaging and engagement.","context":["Photo credit: NC State Waste Reduction and Recycling\nNC State’s Carter Finley Stadium is striving for zero waste starting this fall, thanks to a collaborative partnership between the Wolfpack Athletics Department and sustainability partners across the campus.\nZero waste is an environmental philosophy that aims to save landfill space and reduce the use of natural resources through increased re-use, recycling, and composting efforts. Two other regional university athletic programs, Duke and UNC-Charlotte, are working toward zero waste status, which is commonly defined by diverting at least ninety percent of the waste stream away from the landfill.\nThe Wolfpack already has a longstanding recycling program, with 84 percent of fans recycling in the stadium and tailgate lots, and more than 42 tons recycled in the 2014 season. The zero waste program will build on this effort by adding options for composting and encouraging stadium vendors to switch to compostable cups, plates, and utensils, though it may take a few seasons to implement this transition. Tailgating lots are often the locus of consumption and waste, so the program will look at ways to encourage fans to reduce their environmental impact before the game too.\nDr. Jonathan Casper, a professor in the College of Natural Resources, has aided in the collaborative efforts to green the Wolfpack athletics program. He began looking at the environmental impact of sporting events four years ago after hearing a statistic that the trash created during an athletic season could fill the entire bowl of a stadium. In his recently released book, Sports Management and the Natural Environment, Dr. Casper provides a lens to consider sports as an important environmental advocacy tool in local and global communities.\n“Sports stadiums are a good example to show if it can be done there, it can be done anywhere,” says Casper. We’re capturing an audience through their lifestyle, through something that they like and are having fun doing and, in an informal and nontraditional way showing how they can change behavior. Sports can be a unique vehicle to educate people about how they can be more environmentally responsible in their everyday lives.”\nDr. Casper initiated a dialogue between the athletics program and NC State’s sustainability and waste reduction and recycling offices, which led to the formation of a committee on sustainability in athletics. After hosting four successful zero waste athletic events at the school this year, the committee is targeting a more ambitious goal of working toward year-round zero waste at the stadium, starting this fall.\nThe biggest cost factors in the effort are the fees associated with compost pickup. The Office of Waste Management and Reduction and Recycling is offsetting those costs, however, through savings by reducing the number of landfill roll-offs.\nDr. Casper points to the Philadelphia Eagles and Colorado University as models of sustainability that demonstrate the potential for sports to encourage environmental responsibility among fans and community. A critical aspect of making zero waste successful is creating fan engagement through messaging, explains Dr. Casper. Wolfpack fans will learn about their role in sustainability efforts through PA announcements and videos during the games.\nZero Waste is one of seven sustainability themes promoted through NC State’s Sustainability’s Change Your State initiative. The campaign encourages students to see how small behavior changes have the potential for a big impact on the community.","Construction cost with land\nShort description of the emergency context\nKutupalong camp has a natural terrain with hills and canals ﬂowing through the downhills.

Once the sludge is transported to an intermediate transfer station, it goes to the constructed wetland located at the downhill side by gravity. An underneath pipe connects the transfer station to the constructed wetland.\nThe constructed wetland is a biological treatment unit to treat faecal sludge and wastewater. The constructed wetland has been re-engineered here to achieve primarily as separator of solid and liquid fraction of the raw faecal sludge and then the separated liquid portion undergoes to filtration media for further treatment before discharging into the environment.\nThe design includes chlorination at the effluent leachate treatment unit. The chlorination dose is repeated once per week. This method is however not proven efficient.\nThe solid portion is treated biologically in mostly aerobic condition in presence of thermophilic bacteria. The presence of Cana Indica (or other available suitable plants) facilitates the nitrification and denitrification process and is responsible for NO3– removal from faecal sludge. At present, final sludge is planned to be buried safely. However, it may have potential to be used as soil conditioner.\nThrough the process of active bacteria inside the porous media of constructed wetland and on the surface of hay, it stimulates BOD, COD removal. The filtration media facilitates PO4– and TDS removal.\nThe CW is within an excavated bund, lined with clay. This doesn’t ensure proper watertighness and thus results in pollution hazards. Walls have been built up by 1m around the beds and are made of metal shuttering (recycled oil drums) and backfilled with earth. This design has been modified to increase resilience against flooding, and should be considered on a site specific basis. The sites is fully enclosed with fencing and a plastic roof. The infiltration pit is made of concrete manhole (MH) rings. Due to the terrain in the CXB camps, the site has extensive slope stability using sandbags and geotextiles.\nDeveloping constructed wetland requires technical experts for siting, site preparation and analysis, construction, installation and most importantly operation. Appropriate plants selection for the constructed wetland also requires technical expertise on such system.\nFaecal sludge needs to be dosed steadily (no shock load) in the constructed wetland to facilitate aerobic bacterial environment inside the porous media and to limit inhibition effect. At present, we are loading with 10m3/week to develop biological environment at the constructed wetland. Once the plants will survive and adapt in the local environment, the dosing of faecal sludge can be higher (15-20m3/week). Design can be re-engineered and scaled up for higher capacity.\nSettled aerobically digested sludge accumulates until the wetlands are full (approximately after 6-8 months of average 15-20m3/day operation). When full, thickened digested solid sludge is buried/ disposed of or it may be used as soil conditioner.\nNine constructed wetlands are managed by a team of 10 people.\nWorkers involved in the emptying, collection, transport and safe disposal of excreta are provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to protect their health and safety.\nPlants need some time to adapt to the constructed wetland, they may need to be planted several times at the beginning period.

{"question":"How do bacterial throat infections and chronic back pain treatments compare in terms of medication types used?","answer":"The medications used for bacterial throat infections and chronic back pain are quite different. For bacterial pharyngitis, the primary treatment is antibiotics, specifically penicillin or amoxicillin, which are used to eliminate the bacteria. For chronic back pain, several medication options are available including over-the-counter pain relievers (NSAIDs like ibuprofen), topical pain relievers, muscle relaxants, narcotics (like codeine), antidepressants (like amitriptyline), and cortisone injections. The treatment duration also differs - bacterial pharyngitis typically resolves within one to two weeks with antibiotics, while back pain medications may be needed for longer periods, though narcotics are only used short-term under close supervision.","context":["Generally, over-the-counter pain relievers, using heat and ice, and stretches are all your need to cure minor back pains. It is usually best to try to continue your normal activities as much as possible, but make sure to stop any activity that increases the pain. After a few weeks, if these methods aren’t working to improve the pain, your doctor might recommend some other treatment options for you to try.\nDifferent types of medications are recommended depending on the causes of your back pain. Severe back pain will, likewise, require stronger medication. Some of the most common medications prescribed for back pain include:\n- Over-the-counter pain relievers\nNon-steroidal drugs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen can help to relieve acute back pain. Higher strength NSAIDS are available by prescription if over-the-counter pain relievers are not strong enough.\n- Topical pain relievers\nThese include creams, salves, or ointments you can rub into your skin at the site of your pain.\n- Muscle relaxants\nFor mild to moderate back pain that does not improve with over-the-counter or prescription anti-inflammatory medications or as a result of physical therapy or stretching, your doctor might prescribe a muscle relaxant medication instead. This medication can potentially make you feel very sleepy as a side effect.\nFor severe back pain or injuries, or even chronic pain, your doctor might prescribe narcotics such as codeine or hydrocodone to help manage your pain. These medications are typically only used for a short period of time and under close supervision by your doctor.\nCertain antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have been shown to relieve certain types of chronic back pain.\nIf no other medications relieve severe back pain, your doctor may inject cortisone or a numbing medication into the epidural space, which is the area around your spinal cord. This relieves pain by decreasing inflammation around your nerve roots and will typically last less than a few months.\nPhysical therapy and stretches are both very common treatments for chronic back pain. This type of treatment is administered by a physical therapist and involves applying various techniques such as heat, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, muscle-release techniques, and stretches to your back muscles and soft tissues in order to eliminate pain. Once your pain begins to improve, the physical therapist will work with you to teach you exercises that will control and prevent pain in the future, such as increasing flexibility, strengthening your back and abdominal muscles, and improving your posture.\nThis is usually a last resort and a rare treatment option only used for severe back pain. If you experience radiating leg pain, progressive muscle weakness, or nerve compression, your best treatment option might be surgery. Typically, doctors only resort to surgery specifically for back pain resulting from structural problems, such as spinal stenosis or a herniated disc. One procedure that helps eliminate painful motion of the spine is a spinal fusion. This involves fusing painful vertebrae together into one single, solid bone to keep the spine from moving too much.\nFeatured Image: depositphotos/monkeybusine","Throat Pain Due to Bacterial Pharyngitis: Symptoms, Treatment- Antibiotics\nWhat is Pharyngitis?\nInflammation of pharynx is termed as pharyngitis. Pharynx is located at the back of the throat and is the most common cause of throat pain or sore throat. There are two ways by which one can have pharyngitis i.e., viral and bacterial. In this article, we will focus on bacterial causes of pharyngitis, its causes, symptoms, prevention, and treatment.\nWhat Is Bacterial Pharyngitis?\nGenerally, pharyngitis is caused by viral infections. Less common but nevertheless pharyngitis is also caused by bacterial infections requiring antibiotic treatment. The most common bacterial infection of throat is Strep Throat, which is caused by Streptococcus-A bacterium. Some of the very rare causes of bacterial pharyngitis are gonorrhea, chlamydia, and corynebacterium.\nWhat Are The Forms Of Bacteria Responsible For Bacterial Pharyngitis Causing Throat Pain?\nThe most common form of bacteria responsible for causing pharyngitis is Streptococcus pyogenes. If there is a suspicion of exposure to such bacteria, it can be confirmed with routine lab tests. Such bacterial infections need to be treated with a course of antibiotics. If not treated appropriately, Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis can result in some sort of complications. In rare cases, bacteria apart from Streptococcus pyogenes are known to cause pharyngitis.\nSymptoms of Throat Pain Due to Bacterial Pharyngitis\nThe Common Symptoms Which Accompany Bacterial Pharyngitis Are As Follows-\n- White filming in the throat\n- Swelling of lymph nodes present in the neck\n- Appetite loss along with nausea\n- Loss of taste\n- General malaise\n- In some cases, there may be development of rashes, especially with Infectious Mononucleosis.\nInvestigations To Confirm Throat Pain Due to Bacterial Pharyngitis\nThe following are the investigations done generally if there is a suspicion of bacterial Pharyngitis-\nPhysical Exam for Throat Pain Due to Bacterial Pharyngitis\nIf an individual is having symptoms of pharyngitis, a physician does a careful inspection of the throat to look for white filming in the throat, redness, or swelling. The physician may also look for swollen lymph nodes in the neck area.\nThroat Culture for Throat Pain Due to Bacterial Pharyngitis\nThe next form of investigation is a throat culture where the physician may use a swab to take a sample of secretions and send it for culture in the lab. A physician can also do a rapid strep test which helps to identify, if the test is positive, for Streptococcus bacteria.\nBlood Tests for Throat Pain Due to Bacterial Pharyngitis\nApart from the above tests or if the above tests come back negative and the physician suspects some other cause for sore throat or throat pain then the physician may order a blood test. A blood test may identify whether you have mononucleosis.
