{"question":"Hey, I'm looking for creative activities - what's the deal with sorting books by feelings at the Adult multi-lingual library vs the LEGO club at Station Library?","answer":"These are two different creative approaches: At the Adult multi-lingual library, readers participate in an emotional cataloging system where they categorize books into 7 emotion categories (amusing, boring, bizarre, depressing, exciting, inspiring, or sentimental) when returning them. Books are then shelved based on the latest reader's emotional response. At the Station Library, the LEGO Builders Club offers a hands-on creative experience every third Saturday from 11:00am-1:00pm, where children can build their own creations or work in teams using provided LEGO and Duplo blocks.","context":["The Adult multi-lingual library\n“The library is a small and parallel world: the books wander between the shelves as their readers wander the world, carrying with them their emotional history.”\n– Marit Benisrael, ARTEAM member\nThe Adult multi-lingual library provides residents with books in their mother tongue, and a safe and welcoming place to read, meet and study. The library contains more than 3,500 books in sixteen different languages – from Hebrew and Arabic to Tagalong, Nepali, Chinese, Hindu, Tigrinya, etc., servicing the different needs of the various migrant communities. There is also a section for children books in all the mother-tongues of the diverse communities in order to support parent’s efforts to maintain their culture from their home countries.\nThe Library was founded based on the belief that reading is a basic right. The library seeks to create for migrants and asylum seekers an “exterritorial space” that enables to raise above the harsh daily reality- to imagine and be inspired.\nThe Library was originally planned as a temporary structure – that can be dismantled – somewhat like a “Magic Box”. The architecture of the library consists of two main structures that resemble a book shelf, and in between them is the heart of the library- a space to read and study, to meet people and to hold spontaneous social gatherings.\nThere is a special way the books are organized in the library;\nSorting by Emotions\nDuring the first two years of the library run, the artist collective that established the Garden Library implemented a unique, participatory, indexing and cataloguing system based on readers’ emotional responses to the books they read.\nWhen returning a book, readers were asked to choose one of seven emotion categories that best described how they experienced it: amusing, boring, bizarre, depressing, exciting, inspiring, or sentimental. A volunteer librarian would then enter the color-coded judgment into the lending database, adding it to the past history of responses represented on the spine of each book. The book was then placed back on the library shelves according to its latest classification.\nIn other words, each book’s “identity,” its categorization and placement, was never fixed, and could change with each new reader. The placement of each book was not decided by popular vote, but by the most recent reader, using a system that everyone could impact and in which every participating reader’s input counted.\nThe cataloguing system perpetually restructured the layout of the book collection, creating at any given point in time a transient “wandering map” that visualized the current composition of readers’ opinions and preferences.\nThe instability and transience of the book arrangement, with each book marked by the record of its emotional history and the history of its wandering between categories and shelves, was intended as an echo of the spirit of the library and the destinies of its founders. In a country where refugees and migrant workers are not granted full recognition or rights, the cataloguing system was designed to be a symbolically empowering gesture that would highlight the readers’ individuality.\nIn addition to exchanging books you can also join other recreational activities at the library;\n• Hebrew and English classes: Fridays and Saturdays between 16:00-19:00.\n• Guitar classes: Fridays and Saturdays between 17:00-19:00.","|Monday - Thursday||8:00am - 8:00pm|\n|Friday||9:00am - 5:00pm|\n|Saturday||10:00am - 2:00pm|\n|Sunday||1:00pm - 5:00pm|\nStation Library Events\nThe Station Library is dedicated to serving our active duty personnel, retired military and their families by providing for their recreational, educational and information needs.

{"question":"I'm worried about my high water bill. How do water leaks contribute to water waste in homes, and what role does water pressure play in causing these leaks?","answer":"Water leaks contribute significantly to water waste - the average household wastes over 10,000 gallons annually through leaks, with 10% of homes wasting around 90 gallons daily. Common sources include faulty toilet flappers, dripping faucets, and leaking shower heads. High water pressure (above 60 psi) is a major cause of these leaks, as it creates excessive \"push\" that can erode materials and cause dripping faucets, leaking water heaters, and bursting pipes. This high pressure makes water flow faster than necessary, leading to waste. By addressing both leaks and high water pressure, homeowners can reduce their water bills by up to 10%.","context":["National Fix a Leak Week takes place during the third week in March. It takes place from March 13 to 19 this year. It is an excellent opportunity to inspect your home for easy-to-repair leaks. Did you know that every year, residential leaks waste about one trillion gallons of water across the United States? Quite amazing, right? This is the week to track down and address those leaks.\nHistory of National Fix a Leak Week\nNational Fix a Leak Week serves as an important reminder of the need for water conservation and environmental protection. The Fix a Leak Week public awareness campaign was created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (E.P.A.) WaterSense Program in 2009 to urge people to locate and fix leaks in their homes and yards. National Fix a Leak Week events were held in 26 locations across the country by 2010. Some communities provided free leak-identification workshops, while others distributed leak detection kits to residents.\nOver 10,000 gallons are wasted by the average household leak annually, and about 10% of households with water leaks waste a daily average of 90 gallons. Some common culprits include faulty toilet flappers, leaking valves, and dripping faucets. These leaks can be easy to address and require few hardware and tools. Fixing these leaks can help homeowners reduce their water bills by 10%.\nTo find leaks around the house, you need to investigate if you have leaks and track the source. Colder months like January and February are the prime time to pay attention to your water usage. A family of four should not be using more than 12,000 gallons monthly.\nYou should also be checking your water meter in two-hour intervals when there is no water usage. If there are changes in the meter readings, you have a leak somewhere. Toilet leaks can be detected by adding food coloring into the tank. If any of the coloring makes it into the bowl — you know the rest.\nCelebrate National Fix a Leak Week by doing your bit to make sure you are on the right side of the water conservation effort. Check for surface leaks and inspect pipe fittings and faucet gaskets.\nNational Fix a Leak Week timeline\nThe Environmental Protection Agency sponsors and hosts National Fix a Leak Week in March.\nThe National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' board of directors convenes in 2013 during a commission meeting to encourage members to participate in National Fix a Leak Week.\nWater partners with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on April 23 to promote water conservation.\nGovernor Gretchen signs a declaration for National Fix a Leak Week in Michigan.\nNational Fix a Leak Week FAQs\nHow much water is wasted from a leaky pipe?\nAt a rate of 10 drops per minute, a leaky pipe is responsible for increasing monthly water usage by 90 liters.\nHow can you reduce water usage?\nThere are several ways to reduce water usage in your home. Here are some examples you can put into practice: Always make sure water is turned off when not in use. Don’t leave the water running while you shave or brush, flush your toilet sparingly; make sure used paper towels, tissues, hair, and trash are disposed of properly, conduct regular leak checks, attach flow-reducing devices to old plumbing fixtures, and spend less time in the shower.\nHow can you temporarily fix a leak?\nPipe putty and epoxy putty are great short-term options to fix leaky pipes. The putty hardens when exposed to room temperature and seals the crack or hole.\nHow to Observe National Fix a Leak Week\nConduct regular water meter checks\nWater leaks can be sneaky little things. You should keep a keen eye on your water meter to make sure you are not wasting water.\nReplace old pipes\nEverything declines with age and frequent use. Take a look at your pipes, fittings, and faucets and see if you need replacements.\nTake shorter showers\nWe’re all guilty of getting carried away in a hot bath every now and again. Spend less time when you’re in the bathroom and you’ll save water.\n5 Facts About Water Leaks That Will Blow Your Mind\nLeaks in the average household\nEvery year, leaks in the average home waste more than 10,000 gallons of water, enough to wash 270 loads of clothing.\nWorn toilet flappers, dripping faucets, and leaking shower heads are all common leak sources in the home.\nLeaks in 10% of households waste 90 gallons or more each day.\nFixing water leaks in the home can save some homeowners up to 10% on their water costs.\nA low-cost requirement\nIn most circumstances, fixture replacement parts do not necessitate a significant financial expenditure.\nWhy National Fix a Leak Week is Important\nIt is an important reminder\nNational Fix a Leak Week is an annual reminder to inspect your home for water leaks. The observance plays a crucial role in the promotion and advocacy for water conservation.\nEducating the public\nNational Fix a Leak Week is dedicated to teaching us about leaks in our homes and how to fix them. The week seeks to change the public’s perception of water usage and highlight the dangers of leaving leaks unattended.\nConserving water in our homes helps to save energy and reduce our carbon footprint. This energy is required in filtering, heating, and pumping water into homes.\nNational Fix a Leak Week dates","Most national and local plumbing codes require that a water pressure reducing valve is installed in buildings where water supply pressures\nexceed 80 psi.\nExcessive water pressures can burst pipes, cause dripping faucets, and can even cause rupture and explosion of both cold water pressure tanks\nand hot water storage tanks\n- What is a Water Pressure Regulator?\nAlso called water pressure reducing valves, they are compact, inexpensive regulators that perform two functions:\n(1) they automatically reduce the high incoming water pressure from the city mains to provide a lower, more functional\npressure for distribution in the home; (2) they “regulate” by maintaining a set pressure in the home usually 50 lbs. –thereby\ninsuring that the home piping and appliances operate under a safe, more moderate, but satisfactory pressure.\n- What is water pressure?\nWhen a fixture in a home is opened and water flows from it, it is because the water is “pushed.”\nThis “push” is pressure. The speed at which water flows from the opened outlet depends on the amount of “push” or pressure,\nwhich exists at that time in the system. In short, the higher the pressure, the stronger the “push” behind the water.\n- What is wrong with high water pressure?\nHigh water pressure, which is generally considered anything above 60 lbs., has some advantage, such as in fire fighting\nsystems. However, in the home plumbing system, it can be damaging because water, with a strong “push” behind it, can\nerode or wear away many materials and cause leaking water heaters, banging water pipes, dripping faucets, dishwasher\nand clothes washer noise and breakdown, and leaking water pipes. Therefore, water flowing at a rate in excess of that\nnecessary to satisfy normal fixture or appliance demands becomes damaging, wasteful and reduces the life expectancy of\nequipment in the system. But, probably most important to the average homeowner is that it can add to the cost of water,\nenergy and waste water bills.\n- Does high water pressure cause “water hammer”?\nYes, and water hammer is very simply the noise generated by the shocks of high-speed water flowing in a pipe when\na fixture is suddenly closed. The sudden stoppage causes a “bounce-back” of the water and is called water hammer,\ncausing banging pipes, noise systems and damage to appliances. It might be compared to driving your car at slow speed into\na wall where the effect is negligible. However, if you drove the car at a much higher speed, the impact would be greater and,\nconsequently, so would the bounce-back or shock. Another description of the water hammer effect of high water pressure can be\neasily demonstrated. First, walk around a sharp corner and then run around the same corner. We can equate walking around\nthe corner to a lower, more functional, controlled water pressure. However, when you run around the corner, the momentum\nforces your body to swing in a wider, uncontrolled arc. This principle is based on the fact that moving objects, and this includes\nwater, tend to move in a straight line. They resist changes in direction. Therefore, in a home where the piping has many changes in\ndirection, water hammer shock can be limited by reducing the water pressure.\n- What is the difference in water flow from\na fixture when the pressure is at 100 lbs. vs. a pressure of 50 lbs.?\nReducing the pressure from 100 lbs. to 50 lbs. will result in a saving of approximately 1/3\nbecause 1/3 less water flows. At this lower pressure remember, there is more “push” behind the water at 100 lbs. than at 50 lbs., and most of\nthis water is wasted. A moderate savings would result if your supply pressure was 65 lbs. However, even at this lower pressure,\nsavings with a regulator would be 20%.\n- Are there any studies to support this savings figure?\nYes, in 1971 the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission conducted a test program in 2,400 dwelling units\nthat has attracted widespread interest from more than 40 states and various foreign countries. One of the devices\nused in their conservation study was a water pressure regulator. It is interesting to note that their report concluded\nthat in test locations using regulators, there was a water consumption reduction of 30% in October and November and 37%\n- Where are Water Pressure Regulators most commonly used?\nWater pressure regulators are commonly installed at the mater in residential, commercial and industrial buildings.\nThis location is desirable because it then controls the water pressure flowing to all appliances and outlets within\nthe building and provides an inexpensive means of supplying lower, more functional water pressure to outlets and appliances.\n- Why do we now call Regulators “Primary Conservation Controls”?\nMost people have considered regulators as pressure controls because, as described in the foregoing, they are used to\nprotect appliances and piping from the effects of high water pressure. However, because of water and energy shortage\nand cost problems, regulators have become increasingly more important because they automatically provide the advantage\nof conserving water and energy.\n- How do Regulators save water?\nAs mentioned before, 1/3 less water flows at 50 lbs. than at 100 lbs. Therefore, when you reduce the city main pressure\nto a more moderate pressure of 50 lbs., you can look forward to conserving up to 1/3, or more, of the water previously consumed\nand this will be reflected on your water bills.\n- How much does a typical family of four use?\nA typical family of four uses an average of 255 gallons of water each day for interior plumbing. This is broken down\nby: dish washing – 15 gallons; cooking/drinking – 12 gallons; utility sink – 5 gallons; laundry –35 gallons; bathing – 80 gallons;\nbathroom sink – 8 gallons; toilet – 100 gallons. When you multiply this by a year, typical family usage totals 93,000 gallons of water.\nYour family, particularly if it includes teenagers, would undoubtedly use more than the above averages.\n- How do Regulators affect the wastewater system?\nWhen we can save 1/3 of the water previously consumed, this also represents a similar saving of water, which will not\nbe going into the sewer system where it has to be treated. Water does not evaporate after we use it and it has to be\npiped to the wastewater system. Many sewer bill taxes or surcharges are based on the amount of water you use, with the\nassumption that this water is going into the wastewater system. This is billed to you as sewer surcharge and, in many cases,\nthe sewer tax can equal the water cost. Therefore, when pressure regulators\nsave 1/3 of the metered water, they also contribute\nto saving up to 1/3 of the wastewater load and this is extremely important because it benefits both the user, by a lower sewer bill,\nand the community, as this is water they do not have to treat.\n- How do Water Pressure Regulators save on energy?\nThe Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 30% of the water used in households is heated and, in order to heat this\nwater, it takes energy. Logically, therefore, if a pressure regulator can reduce consumption by 1/3, we automatically cut down on\nthe amount of hot water we’re using in lavatories and showers and, therefore, it follows that we automatically reduce the amount of\nenergy required to heat that load. Thus, it can be easily seen that water conservation has a direct relationship to energy\nconservation. An average shower, for example, costs approximately 17 cents in energy and a shave with the faucet running cost 10\ncents in energy.\n- How do these savings benefit the water and energy utilities?\nA high rise office building in Chicago was designed using water conservation products which resulted in savings of more than\n3,000,000 gallons of water per year. This is significant in that the municipal water utility did not have to pump that extra\ngallonage, the water purification plant didn’t have to treat it, the building itself saved on pumping of 3,000,000 gallons, and\nthere must have been significant savings in energy by conserving hot water. Also, there were further savings by the fact that\n3,000,000 gallons of water, or the normal portion thereof, did not have to be distributed to the wastewater system and consequently\nthe water treatment plant did not have to retreat this water. The heating of water takes energy and it should also be remembered that\n“pumping” water from one place to another also requires a considerable amount of energy.\n- How do Regulators save on maintenance?\nWe have previously described the effects of high water pressure on piping and appliances. By having these appliances work under\na lower pressure, their life expectancy will be much longer and will also cut down on service calls caused by problems with dish\nwashers and clothes washers, leaky water heaters, leaking water pipes and the potential water damage which could be resulting.\n- Do codes require Water Pressure Reducing Valves?\nYes. They are required by the Federal Housing Administration, the regional plumbing codes such as IAPMO, Southern Building Code,\nand BOCA, and numerous city and state codes. The requirement is that whenever the city main water pressure exceeds 80 lbs.,\na regulator must be installed. However, because of the recently acknowledged advantages of regulators\nconservation wise, regulators\ncould be economically installed even where supply pressures are in the vicinity of 60 lbs. Because of the water and energy saving\nbenefits they can provide.\n- How long will a Regulator last?\nRegulators have been described as “life-of-mortgage” products, because historically a malfunctioning pressure regulator\nis not replaced but simply cleaned or repaired via an inexpensive service kit.\nDesign wise, it is similar to the kitchen\nfaucet in that dirt or foreign matter on the seating area can cause problems and actually it is no more difficult to repair a\nregulator than it is to fix the kitchen faucet.\n- If I install a Pressure Regulator, what savings can I expect?\nAn average savings would be from $50 to $150 per year, probably much higher.\nBased on the fact that 1/3 less water flows at 50 lbs. than 100 lbs., you can expect to save up to 1/3 of the\nwater previously consumed. As a typical family of four uses 90,000 gallons per year, that would mean a savings\nof approximately 30,000 gallons of water. The higher the pressure, the higher the savings. Lower pressures result in less\nsavings. (Your water Co. can provide the rate.)\nRemember also, however, that 1/3 of the water used in homes is heated; so 1/3 of\nthe 30,000 gallons of water saved divided by 2 to reflect a cold water mixing factor would mean a savings in heating up to 5,000\ngallons of hot water per year. If you figure 4 cents to heat gallon of water, the savings would be $200.00.\nYou can also figure on a savings in your sewer surcharge bill, since most of the 30,000 gallons of water saved will not be\ngoing into the wastewater system, therefore, you will not be assessed on that. (Contact your local authority for any assessment charges.)\nYou would also have to figure the savings generated by not having to have appliances repaired or replaced more frequently.\nThis is a nebulous figure but, based on your own experience over the past years, you could look for a reduction in the\nfrequency of maintenance and certainly for an improved performance by these appliances.\n- Should we consider using other water and energy conservation devices?\nCertainly, The water pressure regulator we’re talking about today is the nub of a conservation program; but you should also\nconsider flow control devices, low-flush toilets, improved water heating equipment and better disciplined habits by the user.\nHowever, if none of these devices were installed, the water pressure regulator would still serve to contribute important and\nsignificant savings in energy and water, resulting in average savings of anywhere from $50 to $150 per year, or more depending\non your local rates.\n- Do flow-restricting devices actually save water?\nYes, and they can effectively be installed on showerheads, fixtures and\ntank less heaters in boilers. Many showerheads,\nfor example, supply water at a rate of 6 pm. Applying a 3 pm flow restrictor will cut the flow in half providing savings\nin water and energy . It should be remembered however that their capacity is based on a “fixed” supply pressure like 50 lbs.\nand operating under a higher pressure will permit greater flow. That’s why we say a water regulator is the “hub” of a program\nbecause it maintains a constant pressure throughout the home, thereby even improving the performance of flow-restricting devices.\n- What are some tips the user can employ to save water and energy?\nPut a stopper in your sink or use a dishpan when you wash dishes. Washing with running water uses 30 gallons per meal.\nKeep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator – running the water from the faucet until cold will waste a gallon.\nWait until you have a full nine-pound wash before you run your washing machine. The average machine uses 50 gallons per load.\nTurn the hot water off while you shave, and turn the cold water off while you brush your teeth. Shaving with a running faucet\nuses about 20 gallons.\nTake showers instead of baths. The usual bath requires 36 gallons, the usual shower, only 25. Ten gallons is enough for a shower\nif you turn it off while you lather.\nDon’t use the toilet bowl to dispose of cigarette ashes, facial tissues, and other materials. A normal flush requires 5-8 gallons.\nUse dishwasher only when completely full.\nFix dripping faucets promptly. Nearly two gallons can be wasted per day of dripping.\nRunning toilets can waste four gallons per hour. Keep them in good repair.\nTHINK before you turn on the tap.\n- What does a Water Pressure Regulator cost?\nEvery water system is different.\nThe best way to determine the right regulator for your specific needs, and it’s cost, is to\ncontact us here at Suburban Water Heater Company.\nWe’ll recommend the right regulator for your application and provide a written estimate.\nTo determine how much you might saving, it would be necessary to consider the factors in question 17, in comparing with your current water and energy bills.\n- How do I know if I have high water pressure?\nA rule of thumb is: If you hear banging pipes in your home or observe water splashing in your sink,\nyou probably have excessive pressure. For a precise reading, contact Suburban Water Heater Company and we can come out and\ntest your pressure with a gauge.\n- How can I get a Water Pressure Regulator installed?\nThe easiest way would be to contact us here at Suburban Water Heater Company.\nWe can provide you with an estimate, advise of the various type regulators available and install the one best suited for your situation.\n| About us\n| Contact Us\n| Do it yourself\n| Hot Water Heaters\nQ/A and Info\n| Water Treatment\n| Q/A and Info\n| Thermal Expansion Tanks\nWater Pressure Regulators\nSuburban Water Heater Company.

{"question":"What is the impact of using resin filters on high-resolution camera systems?","answer":"When using resin filters on high-resolution cameras like the Nikon D810, Sony A7R II, and Canon 5DS R, there is a noticeable loss in image sharpness. Tests revealed a 15-17.5% drop in center sharpness with 2-stop resin filters, and the difference becomes even more apparent with higher resolution 42 or 50 MP cameras. The loss in sharpness is particularly visible in edge detail of images.","context":["Landscape photographers often deal with the dilemma of choosing between different types and brands of neutral density and graduated neutral density filters for use in high-contrast situations such as sunrise and sunset, where their cameras might not have enough dynamic range to be able to capture the entire scene. While we are not going to go over each and every brand to see which one performs better, we do want to show the difference in sharpness between glass and resin filters. For this particular test, we used three 0.6 (2 stop) filters from three different manufacturers – NiSi (glass filter), Lee (resin) and HiTech (resin). The latter two are probably the two brands that are used the most among photographers in the field.\nFor the sharpness test, we used the Nikon 105mm f/1.4E ED, which we are in the process of evaluating for an upcoming review. The lens was mounted on the Nikon D810 and shot in Mirror Lock Up mode, with EFCS (Electronic Front Curtain Shutter) enabled, as detailed in our how to reduce camera shake on a tripod article. While the numbers are not yet final (only one sample was tested with a high-resolution chart at a very close distance, which can skew mid-frame and corner numbers), you can see that the lens looks absolutely amazing, almost Zeiss Otus-like in terms of center sharpness – definitely one of the sharpest Nikon prime lenses we have ever tested.\nWe stopped down the lens to f/5.6 to yield maximum sharpness (although MTF numbers at f/4 look even more impressive in some cases) and we used a few different focusing techniques to yield the best possible performance without any filters, while a NiSi filter holder was already attached to the lens. Once maximum resolution numbers were achieved, we mounted one filter at a time, without touching the focusing ring.\n2 Stop GND Filters – Glass vs Resin\nBelow are the results from Imatest software, showcasing MTF numbers for the 2 stop GND filters:\nAs you can see, there is no difference between using a lens with or without a glass filter. And we have shown before in our clear filter tests, if one uses high quality glass in front of a filter, there is no impact on the lens’ resolving power. So it looks like if one uses glass filters similar to the ones from NiSi, one can get maximum sharpness from the camera + lens setup.\nAt the same time, take a look at what happens when a resin filter is mounted on the camera. I have been using Lee and HiTech filters for years and previously, I never really noticed much loss of sharpness in my images when using lower resolution cameras. After I started using high-resolution cameras such as the Nikon D810, Sony A7R II and Canon 5DS R, I did start noticing differences in sharpness in my images. Not to the point that would make me not want to use filters, but definitely to the point where I started wondering if perhaps my filters needed to be replaced.\nThe graphs above show a very typical situation when using resin filters – there is a definite and visible drop in sharpness on high-resolution cameras, even at 36 MP. As you can see, Lee’s two stop 0.6 GND (Graduated Neutral Density) filter had a pretty dramatic drop of sharpness, almost 17.5% lower in center sharpness compared to not using a filter and around 15.8% lower in center sharpness compared to NiSi’s glass filter.\nActually, the numbers were even lower when I initially mounted resin filters. Due to changes in optical path when using resin filters, I actually had to refocus my setup and see if I can get better numbers. I was able to get higher numbers in the center of the frame and due to the change of plane of focus, the change did affect mid-frame numbers as well, which is why they show up a little higher in comparison to not using a filter at all.\nAfter testing out my Lee filter, I decided to mount HiTech’s 0.6 GND as well and see what it would yield. As you can see, although its performance looks a tad better, overall, it is really not much different compared to Lee. Center performance drops by roughly 15%, which is certainly not a small number – that’s practically worse than using a cheap circular filter in front of your lens.\nNow you might be wondering, can these differences be seen in images? Let’s take a look at two crops taken from the above-mentioned tests:\nKeep in mind that these tests were performed with a 36 MP camera. If I were to show you difference with 42 or 50 MP cameras, the differences would be even more apparent. Please don’t try to view these images on a small mobile device / tablet, or a large super high-resolution screen, since pixels would be packed too closely together and you would never see any differences. 15% does not look like a big number for sure, but if you look closely at edge detail, the differences are definitely there. Now if those differences are too small for you to care about, then by all means, forget about the existence of this article! However, if you do want the best edge detail your camera can provide for landscape or architectural photography needs, you might want to re-evaluate your setup and potentially look into getting resin filters replaced with glass filters.\n10 Stop ND Filters – Glass vs Resin\nWe also decided to run another test to compare two 10 Stop ND filters from NiSi (glass) and HiTech (resin). Aside from serious color cast issues pointed out in our NiSi Filter System review, we saw a pretty dramatic drop in sharpness when comparing NiSi to HiTech filters. Take a look at the MTF numbers below:\nAs you can see, the NiSi 10 stop ND filter performed really well compared to the HiTech resin filter, which actually caused quite a bit of damage – practically a 30% drop in sharpness! So keep this in mind if you want to do long exposure photography. Looks like glass is the way to go not only if you want to preserve original colors (no color cast), but also if you want to keep the resolving power of your lens.\nResin filters definitely have their own advantages – they handle great in the field and if you drop them on a hard surface, they do not break like glass does. They don’t shatter under pressure, since they have the flexibility to bend. However, they are quite prone to scratches and even moderate use of resin filters can introduce small scratches all over the filter. While scratches don’t do additional damage to your images in terms of sharpness, they certainly can reduce contrast and potentially introduce more artifacts to your images when shooting against bright sources of light (in the form of ghosting and flare).\nIn comparison, glass filters are obviously superior in sharpness and they are less prone to scratching. However, they do require better handling in the field, so you must be able to provide good protection for them not only while transporting, but also while using. If you drop a glass filter, unless it lands on grass, you will have to look for a replacement.\nPersonally, I am planning to start using glass filters from now on. However, in case I do lose a filter in the field, I am planning to bring my Lee filters along, just in case :)\nWhat types of filters do you personally use? Resin or glass? Have you tried both to see what is practical in the field? Would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:24fd1398-3d31-46ca-97a0-c063b90d30a6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How has mindfulness become integrated into Western society beyond traditional Buddhist practice?","answer":"Buddhist mindfulness practices have been widely applied to various aspects of Western life, from mental health treatments to eating out, creating a 'mindfulness boom'. This represents the most significant development in Western Buddhism since the 1960s and is likely to shape its evolution over the next 50 years. Buddhist influence has also extended to other areas including the arts, social action, environmentalism, and psychotherapy.","context":["Home Dharma Dew\nHow western Buddhism has changed in 50 years\nby Vishvapani Blomfield, The Guardian, March 16, 2012\nA western Buddhist shares 10 insights into how the religion and its followers have moved on since its arrival in the west\nLondon, UK -- It's 50 years since Buddhist teachers started arriving in the west in the early 60s and Buddhism crash-landed into the counterculture. So what have we learned about western Buddhism?\n<< Gathering of the largest number of American Buddhist teachers at any one time, held in June 2011 at the Garrison Institute. Photo courtesy of Roshi Joan Halifax\n1. It's not all about enlightenment. Many who found Buddhism in the 60s saw nirvana as the ultimate peak experience. A decade later these recovering hippies were painfully finding out that Buddhism is more concerned with reshaping character and behaviour than big, mystical experiences. Younger Buddhists are often more fired by social action than mysticism.\n2. It doesn't focus on monks. In most Asian countries Buddhist monks are the real practitioners, focusing on meditation and study while lay people support them. Distinctions between monks and lay people does not fit in with modern society and western monastic orders are relatively scarce. Non-monastic practitioners are often very serious and they power the various Buddhist movements.\n3. Tibetan Buddhism has baggage. Tibetan lamas arriving in the 1970s seemed to fulfil our Shangri-La fantasies. But, along with inspiration and wisdom, they also brought sectarian disputes, shamanism, the \"reincarnate lama\" (tulku) system, tantric practices and deep conservatism. Westerners love Tibetans, but we notice the baggage.\n4. The schools are mixing together. Most Asian Buddhist teachers assumed they would establish their existing schools in western countries. Hence we have western Zen, western Theravada etc. But the boundaries are breaking down as western Buddhists, motivated by common needs, explore the whole Buddhist tradition. The emerging western Buddhist world is essentially non-denominational.\n5. People take what they need, not what they're given. For all the talk of lineage, transmission and the purity of the teachings, western Buddhism is driven by students' needs as much as teachers' wishes.\n6. Mindfulness is where Buddhism and the west meet. Buddhist mindfulness practices are being applied to everything from mental health treatments to eating out, and we're now seeing a \"mindfulness boom\". These approaches apply core Buddhist insights to modern living, making this the biggest development in western Buddhism since the 1960s. It will probably shape the next 50 years.\n7. But it's not the only meeting point. The mindfulness movement is hyped as the \"new Buddhism for the west\". But, unless you're following the noble onefold path, there's more to Buddhism than mindfulness. Buddhist influence on western culture is strong in the arts, social action, environmentalism, psychotherapy and practitioners' lives.\n8. Westerners can meditate and maybe even get enlightened. Numerous Buddhists I know who have been practising for several decades have made the teachings their own. Westerners can definitely do Buddhism, and are its future.\n9. But sex doesn't go away. Scandals and anguished life stories show that, even for people who prize celibacy, sex doesn't go away. Is this really a surprise?\n10. And we still don't know if western Buddhism is secular or religious. A growing movement (as Julian Baggini has discussed) wishes to strip Buddhism of \"superstitious\" elements such as karma and rebirth to distil a secular Buddhism that's compatible with science. That raises a big question: does following science mean ditching enlightenment? Is Buddhism an alternative source of authority that challenges the west? Ask me again in 50 years."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3161123c-037e-439e-bfe8-e23fb955a35f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Por qué no es recomendable usar alas de pájaros para entrenar perros cazadores?","answer":"Using wings for training hunting dogs is not recommended because they can teach dogs to chew on things. This is particularly problematic for breeds like German shorthaired pointers that already tend to be 'hard-mouthed' dogs, meaning they clamp down on birds instead of gently retrieving them.","context":["It’s wing season time in North Idaho.\nThat means hunters have the opportunity to shoot upland game and snip the wing on a dead grouse to use as a dog-training tool.\nGrouse wings are a standard tool for bird dog aficionados as well as the newly indoctrinated hunting dog owner whose flop-eared pup was purchased with future upland game seasons in mind.\nTossing a bird wing for a pup to retrieve, or dancing one on the end of a fishing line to teach a pup to point, has been standard fare for bird dog owners since the dawn of “The American Sportsman” television series.\n“The American Sportsman,” a classic weekend hunting show that began when the RCA Victor came with a walnut cabinet, is, like TV cabinets, no longer around.\nUsing a wing to teach a dog, though, is sort of a tradition.\nIt’s one that John Sykes doesn’t like.\n“Wings aren’t a good idea,” said Sykes, a Palouse-based hunting dog trainer.\n“They get a dog to like to chew on things,” Sykes said.\nMost first-time and many experienced dog owners who have learned to toss wings to eager pups don’t employ the kind of discipline it requires to introduce a puppy to a bird wing, Sykes said.\nHe sees a lot of those dogs at his Palouse River Kennels west of Potlatch.\n“It’s easier to train a dog than to retrain a dog,” Sykes said.\nWhen Sykes trains dogs, he takes the animal’s genes into account. German shorthaired pointers are among the most popular pheasant- hunting dogs in the U.S., Sykes said. But because they were initially bred to hunt a variety of game including fox and deer, they tend to chew on stuff. Tossing a wing to a lanky, puddle-eyed shorthair pup, and letting it have its way, releases its desire to gnaw and bite. That can transfer into the dog chewing up the dead birds that hunters want gently returned to hand.\n“They tend to be hard-mouthed dogs anyway,” he said.\nThat means they clamp down on a bird where other breeds, retrievers for example, are more prone to gum a bird instead of bite it.\nThere’s another problem with the wing-tossing scenario, said Sykes, who is also a falconer and trains his own dogs to work hand in hand with his birds of prey.\nMost hunters display the same eagerness as their pups. Patience is a key to training a sound bird dog. Sykes doesn’t like to start training a dog until after it has shed its baby teeth.\n“Somewhere between four and six months they are teething,” he said. “They want to chew on something because their gums hurt and it makes them feel good.”\nThere’s another reason to be patient and let a pup grow a bit.\n“We’re kind of waiting on brain cells at that point,” Sykes said.\nUsing the proper stimulus, dogs that are more mature than a sprightly, needle-toothed 3-month-old are easier to train.\nWhen Sykes trains dogs at his kennels — he’s usually booked and stops taking in dogs in the dead of winter — it is with a dose of psychology that he calls common sense.\nHe uses it to shoot down traditional training methods such as the practice of popping a gun when a dog is eating in an effort to get pooch to equate the shotgun blast with comfort. The dog won’t be afraid of the noise if he has his snout in a bowl of kibbles when first he hears the bang, according to the theory.\nA gun shy dog is better suited for the couch than the field, right?\nWhat really happens when you shoot a gun near a feeding dog, Sykes said, it trains the dog to eat birds when it hears the blast. Or, something like that.\nIt’s better to pop a blank when the dog has a bird in its mouth, Sykes said. He uses clipped wing pigeons.\nWhen you do that, he said, the dog immediately associates the bang with a downed bird.\n“That noise means something good is going to happen,” he said. “And that something is a bird.”\nThe dog doesn’t associate the sound with food.\nThings go easier from there on out.\nNo eating of your prized, wing-shot pheasant, no raised hackles among hunters, no ruffled feathers, just a dog with a bird in its mouth, bringing the bird back to the shooter because that is the behavior it connects with a gunshot.\nTo introduce a pup to the sound of a gunshot, Sykes first claps two pieces of 2-by-4 together. He gradually moves up to pulling the trigger on a 410 shotgun, weeks later he works up to a 20 or 12 gauge.\nHe doesn’t use a .22 he said, because it is too loud.\n“Dogs can hear the bullet move up the riflings,” he said. “It’s a lot louder for a puppy than it sounds to us.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e1c2901c-2cec-4871-b3f6-6afd9f3023d1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain how early the concept of 'España' appeared in official inscriptions? I'm particularly interested in examples from medieval tombstones.","answer":"The concept of 'España' appears in medieval inscriptions, notably in Ferdinand III of Castile's tombstone in Seville's Cathedral (died 1292), where 'ESPAÑA' is written in its modern Spanish form rather than in Latin. The inscription refers to him as the one who conquered all Spain ('TODA ESPAÑA') and calls Seville the head of all Spain ('CABEZA DE TODA ESPAÑA').","context":["‘Spain’ in the sense of ‘Hispania’, alluding to the Roman province, certainly existed as a concept at the time, even if the Kingdom didn’t (yet). Indeed, there’s several medieval Kings in the Iberian peninsula who used the title ‘Imperator totius Hispaniae’ (ie, ‘Emperor of all Spain’).\nSee, for example, the epitaph of Ferdinand I of Leon, who died in 1103:\nH.

He made his tributaries, with arms, all the Saracens of Spain. He seized Coimbra, Lamego, Viseo and other places. He took by force the kingdoms of Garcia and Vermudo. He died on December 27, (the year) 1103.\nAnother example, Ferdinand III of Castile, who died in 1292 and is buried in Seville's Cathedral; note how \"ESPAÑA\" is already written in its modern form, not in Latin:\nAQVI YAZE EL MVY ONDRADO HERNANDO, SEÑOR DE CASTIELLA E DE TOLEDO, E DE LEON, E DE GALICIA, DE SEVILLA, DE CORDOVA, DE MVRCIA, DE IHAEN, EL QVE CONQVISSO TODA ESPAÑA, EL MAS LEAL, EL MAS VERDADERO, EL MAS FRANCO, EL MAS ESFORZADO, EL MAS APVESTO, EL MAS GRANADO, EL MAS ZOFRIDO, EL MAS HOMILDOSO, EL QVE MAS TEMIE A DIOS, EL QVE MAS LE FACIE SERVICIO, EL QVE QVEBRANTO E DESTRVYO A TODOS SVS ENEMIGOS, EL QVE ALZO, E ONDRO TODOS SVS AMIGOS, E CONQVISSO LA CIVDAD DE SEVILLA, QVE ES CABEZA DE TODA ESPAÑA, E PASSO EN EL POSTRIMERO DIA DE MAYO, EN LA ERA DE MIL E CC.

{"question":"How does brain activity differ between conscious and unconscious thoughts?","answer":"Brain imaging shows that thoughts can exist without awareness in the visual cortex, similar to how unconscious perception works. The brain can process images even when they're made invisible to conscious awareness. Research has found that each hemisphere has its own separate chain of memories and learning experiences, with the left hemisphere handling logic and verbal aspects while the right hemisphere processes visual-spatial information. These hemispheres work both separately and together, sharing information through the corpus callosum.","context":["How much control do you have over your thoughts? What if you were specifically told not to think of something – like a pink elephant?\nA recent study led by UNSW psychologists has mapped what happens in the brain when a person tries to suppress a thought. The neuroscientists managed to ‘decode’ the complex brain activity using functional brain imaging (called fMRI) and an imaging algorithm.\nThe findings suggest that even when a person succeeds in ignoring a thought, like the pink elephant, it can still exist in another part of the brain – without them being aware of it.\n“We were able to find visual representation of the thought – even when participants believed they successfully pushed the image out of their minds,” says Joel Pearson, senior author on the study and professor of cognitive neuroscience at UNSW Science.\n“This suggests mental images can form even when we’re trying to stop them.”\nThe study, recently published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, tracked the brain activity in 15 participants as they completed several visualisations and thought suppression exercises.\nParticipants were given a written prompt – either green broccoli or a red apple – and challenged not to think of it. To make this task even harder, they were asked to not replace the image with another thought.\nAfter 12 seconds, participants confirmed whether they were able to successfully suppress the image or if the thought suppression failed. Eight people were confident they’d successfully suppressed the images – but their brain scans told a different story.\n“The visual cortex – the part of the brain responsible for mental imagery – seemed to be producing thoughts without their awareness,” says Prof. Pearson.\nBrain neurons fired and then pulled oxygen into the blood each time a thought took place. This movement of oxygen, which was measured by the fMRI machine, created particular spatial patterns in the brain.\nThe researchers decoded these spatial patterns using an algorithm called multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The algorithm could distinguish brain patterns caused by the vegetable/fruit prompts.\n“MVPA is a type of decoding algorithm based in machine learning that allows us to read thoughts,” says Dr Roger Koenig-Robert, first author on the study and postdoctoral researcher at UNSW Science and Monash University.\n“Using this algorithm, we can see what people are imagining even when they’re not aware of it.”\nThe scans showed that participants used the left side of their brains to come up with the thought, and the right side to try and suppress it. Prof. Pearson hopes this functional brain mapping will help future researchers know which areas of the brain to target for potential intrusive thought therapies.\n“This study can help explain why forcefully trying not to think about something always fails,” he says.\n“For example, for someone trying to quit smoking, trying not to think about having a cigarette is a very bad strategy.”\n“We know that you can have conscious and unconscious perception in your visual cortex – for example, I can show someone an image of a spider, make the image invisible, but their brain will still process it,” says Prof. Pearson.\n“But until now, we didn’t know this also worked with thoughts.”\nBoth studies point towards the elusive world of the ‘unconscious’, which Prof. Pearson plans to explore in his future work.\n“I’m interested in this idea that imagination can be unconscious – that these thoughts can appear and influence our behaviour, without us even noticing.\n“More evidence is starting to suggest unconscious thoughts do occur, and we can decode them.”","According to the research in the bio-medical field, the human brain is made up of two \"hemispheres\", i.e., two halves. These two halves are called the \"right hemisphere\" and \"left hemisphere\" (Dorfsman, 1997). Since the early 19th century, considerable research and studies have been done in the medical field to gain a better understanding of the brain hemisphericity (Dorfsman, 1997).\nIn 1836, Marc Dax found that his 40 patients, who had lost the speaking ability, were diagnosed with left brain impairment. After studying the condition of these patients, Marc Dax was the first to claim that two brain hemispheres function differently (Dorfsman, 1997). Further, in the late 19th century, Karl Wemickle and Paul Broca's significant research in the field acknowledged the link between the language skills and the left brain hemisphere (Dorfsman, 1997). In 1916, Reichardt and Holmes found that people with the right hemisphere impairment had spatial problems. Also, they found that people had issues with their limbs on the opposite portion of the damaged brain hemisphere. For example, individuals with left brain damages had problems using their right leg, arm, etc. (Dorfsman, 1997) From these examinations, the researchers concluded that the left and right hemispheres of human beings control the opposite sides of their bodies (UCMAS, 2014). In other words, the left brain hemisphere controls the right side's processes and vision of the right eye, while the right brain hemisphere controls the left side's processes and vision of the left eye (UCMAS, 2014). Further, with the regular research and studies in the medical science, the theory of brain hemisphericity was developed in the late 20th century.\nAccording to the theory of brain hemisphericity, each hemisphere has its own perceptions, ideas, thoughts, and private sensations which are separated from the related senses in the opposite hemisphere. Each right and left hemisphere has its own separate chain of learning experiences and memories that are available to recall by the opposite hemisphere (Brain Hemisphericity and Learning Style, n.d.). The neurosurgeons and brain researchers have found that each hemisphere processes the information differently and is involved in a different field of interests. For instance, the left hemisphere involves logic, thinking, reasoning and verbal aspects while the right hemisphere does visual-spatial functions, involves creativity, and appreciation of music and art (Brain Hemisphericity and Learning Style, n.d.). According to Poul Thompsen and Ann Howe, hemisphericity can play a crucial role in student motivation and learning. The research claims that when a person is interested in the subject, the related information progresses in the right hemisphere, enhancing the understanding and knowledge of the person about the topic. Later, the information passes to the left hemisphere for the analytical evaluation of it (Brain Hemisphericity and Learning Style, n.d.).\nThe researchers have determined that the human brain hemispheres function separately and in accordance with each other. Both hemispheres share information like sensory observations to each other by means of the corpus callosum which attaches them with each other (Remy, 2011). The right hemisphere regulates the function of the muscles on the left part of the human body, while the function of the muscles on the other side of the body is controlled by the left hemisphere (Remy, 2011). Mainly due to such crisscross connection, impairment in one side of the brain causes a negative impact on the opposite part of the body. Linguistic skills are mostly influenced by the left hemisphere. Processing of the heard information and handling of the speaking duties are carried out by the left brain. It is also in charge of processing correct mathematical computations and logic (Remy, 2011). The left brain is objective, rational, logical, sequential, and analytical, while the right brain is mostly intuitive, subjective, random, synthesizing, and spontaneous (Brain Hemisphericity and Learning Style, n.d.). Right brain mainly controls the functions such as face recognition, music evaluation, and major spatial skills. It also helps in analyzing visual imagery. It plays some role in linguistic skill too, especially in understanding and evaluating a person's tone and context (Remy, 2011).\nWhether a person is left-brained or right-brained and the preferences of the right brain and left brain are way complex than a mere left brain versus right brain equation. For instance, some people write with their right hand but throw the ball with their left hand (Remy, 2011). Studies found that almost 2/3 of left-handed people and 97% of right-handed people have the linguistics functions in their left brain hemisphere. Also, \"temporal plane' part of the brain is 70% longer in the left brain than in the right brain for the majority of the people (Dorfsman, 1997). Those who do not show such asymmetry in their brain suffer from disorders like dyslexia. However, there is still insufficient knowledge about the influence of brain asymmetry on overall functions of the left brain and right brain (Dorfsman, 1997). The brain precisely manages the right balance of total functions and responsibilities of each hemisphere in order to maximize its efficiency and functionality. According to professor of London University, Stephen Wilson, brain asymmetry plays a key role in proper brain working mechanism. It allows the right brain and left brain to improve their efficiency and processing abilities and avoid any conflict when both hemispheres attempt to take charge (Remy, 2011).\nIn conclusion, the theory of brain hemispheres shows that each brain has a mind of its own and specific fields of interest. It is found that the right brain is the artistic side while the left brain is the logical side. Also, the importance of right and left hemisphere in learning activities cannot be ignored, and teachers should develop teaching methods that can trigger active participation of left and right hemisphere of students. The concept of brain hemisphericity is still developing, and further research and studies in the field will definitely help to understand brain asymmetry and the role of each brain hemisphere in improving particular skills and functions of the human body.\n- Brain Hemisphericity and Learning Style.

{"question":"I'm researching LED measurement systems. What are the key features of the BTS2048-VL spectroradiometer, and what challenges does it address in LED luminous flux testing?","answer":"The BTS2048-VL is a compact CCD-based spectroradiometer with a diffusor window featuring cosine-corrected field of view for measuring spectral irradiance and illuminance. It has a BiTec sensor allowing measurements with both a photometric photodiode and CCD spectrometer, enabling fast measurements of luminous intensity, spectrum, color, and color rendering index. When combined with the GB-GD-360-RB40-2 goniometer, it can measure luminous intensity distribution with measurement distances between 100-2000mm. Regarding LED testing challenges, this system helps address the significant issue of LED directionality, which can cause measurement variations of over 50% in conventional systems due to uneven light distribution on integrating sphere surfaces and varying reflectance characteristics affecting detector readings.","context":["Measurement of the luminous intensity distribution\nLuminous intensity distribution is used to specify the directional radiation characteristics of lamps. It is determined through numerous separate measurements of the luminous intensity. Every measurement detects the light emitted into the half space around the lamp under a different viewing angle. The measurement data are represented in polar plots and 3D graphs and output in standard formats e.g., IES, EULUMDAT, Excel, etc. This data can also be used to calculate the luminous flux.\nThe BTS2048-VL light meter\nThe high-quality BTS2048-VL CCD based spectroradiometer is internationally recognized as a high-end product. It is one of the most compact spectroradiometers on the market which enables direct system integration in many applications without the need for expensive, and potentially measurement degrading, light guides. Among its characteristic features is its diffusor window with cosine corrected field of view for the measurement of spectral irradiance and spectral illuminance. This also makes it possible to combine the BTS2048-VL with goniometers for the measurement of luminous intensity distributions. Its impressively wide dynamic range makes it ideal for the measurement of spot lamps that have a distinctive edge profile. More detailed information about the BTS2048-VL can be found in the respective data sheets. The unit is also available in the BTS2048-VL-TEC thermoelectric cooled version.\nEnhancement of the BTS2048-VL with the GB-GD-360-RB40-2 goniometer\nThe BTS2048-VL spectroradiometer can be combined with the GB-GD-360-RB40-2 goniometer in order to measure luminous intensity distribution. Unlike most conventional spectroradiometers , the BiTec sensor of the BTS2048-VL makes it possible to perform measurements using just an internal photometric photodiode and hence measurements are much fasterIf the spectrum, color, and color rendering index are needed, the CCD based spectrometer may also be employed. This flexibility provided by the BiTec technology makes it ideal for goniometric measurements (article on the BTS technology). The GB-GD-360-RB40-2 goniometer facilitates the alignment of the test lamp for measurements with two degrees of freedom. The rotation movements are controlled remotely using stepper motor drives. The turntable has an M4 hole pattern for universal attachment of test lamps. Four mini-sockets allow for four-terminal electrical connections. The turntable enables fine tuning with 5 mm stroke and a coarse tuning with 100 mm stroke for alignment of test lamps in the goniometric axis. A removable stop is integrated to aid the alignment of the test lamp in the goniometric axis. The distance between the device and the test lamp can be varied between 100 mm and 2000 mm. Short distances are chosen for measurement of single LEDs with low intensity. Longer distances are more suitable for measurement of extended LED arrays and LED lamps. The rail on the guide carriage is stiffened by means of a stable base.\nThe S-BTS2048 user software supports operation of the goniometer and display of measurement values. It can be used to create measurement sequences as well as configure different settings. The measurement data can be exported to standard formats such as IES, EULUMDAT, ASCII, and Excel. Besides the display of the luminous intensity distribution in 3D and polar graphs, the software can also be used to calculate the luminous flux as well as display the spectrum, color values, etc.\nOne essential quality feature of photometric devices is their precise and traceable calibration. The BTS2048-VL is calibrated at Gigahertz-Optik’s DAkkS-accredited (D-K-15047-01-00) calibration laboratory for spectral responsivity and spectral irradiance in line with ISO/IEC 17025.

On the one hand, LED light source have outstanding directively characterizes than other ordinary light sources. Normally it wouldn’t uniformly emit lighting at all the direction on the whole space. This feature makes LED’s direct light distributed unevenly on the surface of integrating sphere, which directly causes different direct reflective light of LED for different reflective characteristics of the detector. Because the position of detector port and baffle is fixed, different reflectance distribution directly presents as signal fluctuations. In the conventional measurement system, the actual measurement value also shows great differences for LED of different forward divergence angle, the same LED of different orientations, different positions in the same direction and others, even if the nominal luminous flux is the same. According to the results verified by customer, in the conventional LED measurement system, the effect of LED placement direction on the results of luminous flux measurements is often more than 50% (difference between the maximum and minimum signal of the same LED measured in different directions).\nWhen measuring different LED of different lighting angle, the different distribution on the surface of integrating sphere causes the effect of the direct reflectance distribution on the detector is different, thus directly affect the difference of accuracy between the two measurements. As shown in the picture:\nOn the other hand, LED measurement system usually uses a halogen lamp as standard light source. The standard light source is totally different from LED lights on the appearance, luminous distribution or spectral characteristics side. Therefore, the difference must be corrected by the self-absorption coefficient.\nOne of the important reason of LED’s directionalities influence the testing accuracy focus on inner surface reflectance characteristics of the integrating sphere. In the common LED measurement system, both the reflectance and lamberts characteristic of integrating sphere surface coating are not very satisfactory. One is low reflectivity, the other is bad diffuse reflection characteristics. One result of low reflectivity on the surface of integrating sphere is the direct lighting of LED gradually decays after a few times reflection. In the whole process of light mixing, the direct lighting and direct reflected light accounts for a large proportion and plays a dominant role. However, at some conditions, the low reflectance material will produce a strong shadow effect on the detector at the back of baffle. What results in inaccurate measurement is nothing else but the reflected light and shadow effect.\nMoreover, lower diffuse reflectance will seriously cause the signal attenuation. During the measurement, since the continuous reflection of light inside the integrating sphere and the reflection decays each time, the effects of high or low reflectance on luminous intensity can be strengthened after multiple reflections. Reflecting the light in the ball 15 times, for example, if both reflectance difference is 5%, then the attenuation of the signal may be double or more. However, the difference of reflectance inside the integrating sphere is much more than that.\nCurrently, LED testing system has not been used LED standard light as a standard light source but a calibrated halogen with stable driver during the measurement. Due to the appearance of standard light source and the tested LED varies widely, LED fixture’s absorption effect to light, and the difference between mounting position of standard light source and the tested LED, which are all the important factors affecting the measurement accuracy of the results.\nLisun developed a IS-*MA new design integrating sphere with testing hold base. Compared to the “massive assembly” production technology of traditional integrating sphere, IS-*MA adopted a molding technology to produce the integrating sphere which shape fully complies with 4π or 2π spherical structure, and used coating of high reflectance and diffuse reflectance, and designed the luminaries opening position right towards the detector. With this improvement, even it is under extreme conditions which using LED with strongly high directionality or placed LED with extreme conditions, the measurement results are still maintained a good consistency.\nLPCE-2 system uses a calibrated halogen lamp as standard light source. Meantime auxiliary lamp is available for alternative solution, which use to compensate for the impact of the difference of clamp of measured LED and standard lamp on the measurement results. LPCE-2 system specifically tests for LED measurement accuracy problem as described above. Test conditions are as follows: adopting high brightness green 5LED, which power is about 0.35W, emitting angle is about 30°.\nLPCE-2 system uses nine measuring position, representing the possible LED placement position shown as Figure III.\nFigure III Different Placement Position of LED\nThe relationship between the lumen and the LED placement are as Figure IV. From the test results, even it is in the most extreme case which LED towards or back towards the opening of detector, the luminous flux measurement result is still less than 5%, which is a very good test results. In the practical application, since the LED would not be placed as such extremely situation, it generally uses a simple test fixture in testing. Under the case of including positioning error, measurement results error of luminous flux in the same position is less than 0.1%. However, the test error of LED luminous flux measurement repeatability is much less than 0.1% during the actual testing.\nFigure IV Lumen Value for different measurement position of LED"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4b7c3662-024a-4a87-af78-5a7bfeb7d404>","<urn:uuid:7186b793-fc8a-47c1-ac0e-c6f32b3d7429>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¡Hola! Estoy pensando en hacer una remodelación en casa para unir dos habitaciones. ¿Podrías explicarme qué es una viga a ras y qué consideraciones de seguro debo tener en cuenta? 🏗️","answer":"A flush beam is a load-bearing beam that's hidden in the attic to create an 8-foot continuous ceiling between rooms during remodeling, allowing for better pass-through and air circulation. When installing one, the beam size depends on the span - for example, a 6-foot span needs 4x8 lumber while a 12-foot span requires 4x14 lumber. Regarding insurance considerations, you must notify your insurance company before starting renovations as this will likely increase your home's replacement value and may require coverage adjustments. You'll also need to verify your contractor has commercial liability and workers compensation insurance, and depending on the extent of renovations, you might need additional coverage like a dwelling under construction endorsement if the work involves new construction.","context":["Things You'll Need\nDrywall hatchet or saw\nSimpson type ties\nHow to do House Remodeling With a Flush Beam\nDuring your next home improvement room addition, build an 8 foot ceiling between the two rooms so they appear to be one room. The way to do this is to use a flush beam. This will give you a much better pass-through, one that's 8 feet high with a continuous ceiling between your new addition and the existing room. This article will show you how you can do this by hiding the load bearing beam in the attic without having to call the builders.\nVideo of the Day\nGet a building permit from your city hall.\nDetermine where in the wall you want the new opening.\nUse a metal detector or stud sensor to determine what is behind the drywall. You will have to look for things such as electrical wires, gas pipes, water pipes, and drain pipes.\nLocate and mark where all the studs are in the cutting area, the area you will be working in.\nTurn off the electrical power and use a drywall hatchet to cut holes between studs. This will allow you to find items of interest. Be careful not to hit anything hiding in the wall: pipes, wires etc.\nReroute any wires and pipes that you find in the wall. Run them up and through the attic or down through the basement.\nBuild a temporary 2x4 support for the ceiling, on both sides of the wall that you are making the pass-through on. you will need about four 2x4 studs for each ceiling that you are supporting, depending on the size of your span. Don't put too much pressure when you stand up the temporary supports or you will crack the ceiling plaster. Make it fit just right.\nCalculate what size beam you will need for the size pass-through that you are making. For example:\nA beam spanning over a 6 foot wide pass-through will need to be made of 4\"8\" lumber and be about 8 feet long. It can be loaded with about 5,000 pounds of equally distributed weight.\nA beam spanning 12 feet will need to be constructed of 4\"x14\" lumber. A beam this size can be loaded with about 10,000 pounds of equally distributed weight.\nIf you do not have a two story house and need less weight carrying capacity for your beams, then you can use smaller size beams.\nThe best way to calculate your project is to determine the size of your span and what type of house you have and take this information to a structural engineer, he can give you all of the calculations and drawings you will need to meet your city building codes.\nInstall double or triple studs in the wall to support the ends of the beam. Depending on the overhead load and type of foundation you have, you may have to pour a supporting pier foundation under your slab, in the crawl space under your house or under the basement floor slab.\nPrepare the attic. Now that you have the vertical supports for the beam and the temporary ceiling walls in place, you can start to cut off the ends of the ceiling joists. Cut just enough to make space for the beam between the joists of the two rooms. You want the joists to fit flush against the new beam, in the new joist hangers.\nPlace the new flush beam over the wall top plate, fit it between the joist end that you just cut in the previous step.\nSecure the ends of the new beam to the wall by toe-nailing and strapping with Simpson Ties.\nPlace a joist hanger under the end of each ceiling joist and nail to the new beam and joist.\nRemove the temporary walls that are supporting the ceiling in both rooms.\nCut the top plates of the wall flush with the king stud, near the ends of the new beam, make sure you leave about 6\" of support for the new beam to bear on.\nCut the sole plate of the wall flush with the king stud. Remove the studs and plates from your new pass-through.\nInstalling a hidden beam flush with the ceiling will really open up your new room and make it seem like a continuous part of the house. You will have an uninterrupted ceiling and much better air circulation between rooms. It's a large project, to be sure, but well within the scope of the do-it-yourself re-modeler.\nYou can make a 4x beam by using two 2x lumber beams.\nMake sure you get a building permit from your city. Cut all power, gas and water before cutting into the wall.","Home renovations can impact your rates, coverage limits, and may require additional coverage for your policy.\nIf your home is being remodeled, you’ll want to notify your insurance company\nAfter a major renovation, you may need to increase the amount of insurance in your policy\nIf the renovation involves new construction or a vacant premises, you may need additional coverage\nGet a copy of your contractor’s insurance to ensure they have general liability and workers comp coverage\nThere’s a lot more to remodeling your home than just picking out the right floor pattern and choosing a general contractor — you should also consider the impact that renovations can have on your homeowners insurance. If you plan on remodeling your home or you recently completed a project, inform your insurance company and make sure you have the right amount of coverage.\nIf you add an extension onto the property or replace your roof, the improvements will likely make your homes replacement cost go up, so you’ll want your dwelling coverage limit to reflect the higher rebuild value.\nDepending on the extent of the renovations and the home’s occupancy status, you should also look into additional coverage for your policy. Standard homeowners insurance usually won’t cover your home if it’s been vacant for more than 60 days or dwellings under construction due to the increased risk of theft, vandalism, and storm-related damage. If you’re planning on living elsewhere throughout the course of renovations or you’re adding a completely new section onto the property, look into supplemental coverage like vacant homeowners insurance, a dwelling under construction endorsement for your homeowners policy, or builder’s risk insurance.\nLastly, check to see if the contractor or builder is fully covered with commercial liability coverage and workers compensation policy. If your contractor doesn’t have the necessary protection, it may not be worth the risk of hiring them for the job.\nIn this article:\nA home remodel can mean anything from renovating the kitchen to adding an entirely new room or wing. Regardless of the project, if you’re making drastic updates or improvements to the home, it will likely increase the value of the structure. Before construction begins, notify your insurance company to increase your coverage limits to reflect the value of the rebuilt or renovated section of your home.\nIn other words, if your home is insured for $300,000 and your insurer determines that a new addition or remodel increases its rebuild value by $30,000, they may recalculate the dwelling coverage limit in your policy to $330,000. Many companies also offer replacement cost coverage enhancements that you can add to your policy, like extended replacement cost. Extended replacement cost coverage automatically increases your dwelling limit an additional 25 or 50% in the event the home is destroyed and your coverage limit isn’t high enough. If you’re remodeling your home and unsure if the suggested coverage limit adjustment is accurate, extended replacement cost may be an option worth considering.\nAny of the following scenarios may necessitate an update to your insurance policy:\nIf you’re building a new addition onto your home, you’re likely increasing its replacement value, or the cost to repair or replace the property. This amount is indicated in the dwelling coverage limit in your policy. If you’ve added onto your home, your dwelling limit will likely increase once your coverage is recalculated by your insurance company.\nWhile the increased coverage may increase your insurance premiums, it’s a bad idea not to inform your insurance company about updates to your home. Your insurance company requires that your home be insured for at least 80% of its replacement cost before they pay out losses, so if your home is renovated and your dwelling limit isn’t adjusted, your claim may be denied if you don’t meet the coverage limit threshold.\nBe sure to let your insurance company know about the addition prior to construction so that you can obtain the necessary coverage for the premises throughout the project.\nUpgrading your kitchen can significantly increase the rebuild value of your home. If you’re transitioning from veneer to marble countertops or installing new cabinetry, flooring, and so on, you’ll want the limits in your policy to be updated accordingly so you can be fully reimbursed in the event of a disaster.\nIf you plan on replacing the roof of your home, be sure to contact your insurance company and let them know. A new roof adds value to your home, so your coverage limits will likely be recalculated, but you also may qualify for a discount. Many insurance companies offer discounted rates if your roof is under a certain number of years old. You may qualify for further discounts if your roof is made with stronger material to withstand windstorms, hail, and leaks.\nPools can affect your homeowners insurance twofold: they can increase the rebuild value of your property and can also be a liability hazard. If someone is injured in a pool-related accident and decides to press charges, you’ll likely be responsible to pay out the damages. If you’re planning on adding an in-ground or above-ground pool, you’ll want to be sure it’s covered under the liability section of your policy. In most cases, pool accidents are covered, but your insurer may require a fence with a gate around the exterior of the pool as a condition for coverage.\nAdjusting your coverage limits isn’t the only reason to inform your insurance company of renovations prior to the start of the project — you should also make sure that the remodeling process itself is covered. There are multiple scenarios where your remodel may or may not be covered by your homeowners insurance policy.\nA standard homeowners insurance policy specifically excludes theft to a dwelling under construction along with materials and supplies used for the build. Your coverage typically won’t pick back up until the home is finished and occupied. This is where you’ll want clarification from your insurance company, as your definition of “construction” may be different from theirs.\nFor example, a simple interior update to a room in your home may necessitate alerting your insurer to update your coverage limits, but you likely won’t need to add any coverage to your policy to cover the materials and supplies involved in the renovation. Conversely, if you’re adding a new room onto your home or building an attached garage, your insurer may view your home as under construction and exclude theft loss from your policy until the project is complete. Why is that? Because it generally takes little to no effort to break into a construction site, making them hotbeds for theft, vandalism, and arson.\nBefore construction starts, check with your insurer to see if you need any special renovation coverage to ensure you’re fully covered. Many insurance companies offer dwelling under construction coverage that you can add onto your policy for an additional premium.\nYour homeowners insurance policy also won’t cover perils like vandalism if the dwelling has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days prior to the loss. If your home renovations require you to live elsewhere for a few months, you may want to consider vacant or unoccupied homeowners insurance — many companies offer this type of policy in addition to the standard home insurance product. If you go this route, make sure you pause your homeowners insurance before the vacant home coverage kicks in. When you move back in, you’ll want to start your standard coverage back up.\nYour homeowners insurance policy specifically covers home structural collapse if it was caused by the use of defective material or methods in construction, remodeling, or renovation if the collapse occurred during the course of the work. That means if that half-finished second story bedroom addition falls through into your family room, the cleanup and repairs may be covered by your insurer.\nIf you plan on remodeling the home yourself or you anticipate that a friend or family member will be helping you out throughout the course of the project, you’ll want to check the personal liability and medical payments coverage in your policy. Do-it-yourself construction projects involving other people open you up to potential lawsuits if the person helping you is injured during the job.\nWhile it’s unlikely that a friend or family member would sue you over a remodeling accident, they may need help paying for medical bills as a result of their injuries — that’s where your no-fault medical payments protection comes in. With medical payments coverage, if a guest is injured in your home, they simply submit a claim through your insurance company and are reimbursed for medical payments like copays and deductibles. You can typically have up to $5,000 in medical payments coverage.\nPrior to renovations, ask your contractor or builder for a copy of their insurance for your records to ensure they have adequate protection and that all of your bases are covered financially. Your contractor should have commercial liability and workers compensation insurance to cover the wages of workers who are injured on the job.\nIf the contracting work involves new construction, check with your builder to see if storm damage and theft loss to the property itself or building materials are covered by their insurance. In many cases, this caveat will be spelled out in the builder’s contract. Typically, homes under construction or renovations involving extensive add-ons will require either a dwelling under construction provision to your homeowners insurance or a separate builder’s risk policy. If your contractor isn’t carrying a builder’s risk policy (also known as “course of construction” insurance), it may be your responsibility to obtain this coverage.\nAbout the author\nPat Howard is an Insurance Editor at Policygenius in New York City, specializing in homeowners insurance.

{"question":"How many earthquakes occurred in Youngstown before 2011?","answer":"Youngstown had never experienced an earthquake before 2011, or at least hadn't had one since record-keeping began in 1776.","context":["Before 2011, Youngstown, Ohio, had never experienced an earthquake. Or at least, the area hadn't had one since 1776, when record-keeping began. So it was strange, during a nine-month period of 2011, that nine of them shook the town.\nAt first these were small; none topped 2.7 on the Richter scale—tiny things, not perceived much differently than the passing of a heavy truck. But then, the quakes escalated. On Dec. 31, 2011, at 3:05 p.m., Youngstown was stirred by a 3.9 (a local newspaper crowdsourced its readers to respond to the question \"Did you feel the boom?\" You'll want to read some of the answers.) To be sure, this still wasn't a huge quake. For some perspective, the one that hit the D.C. area in July 2011 was a stronger 5.8. But still, while earthquakes in the greater Ohio area aren't unheard of (there have been at least 200 since 1776), having such a concentrated number was odd for the area, especially in a city that had previously experienced none.\nLocated suspiciously near all of this seismic activity was the Northstar 1 well, which pumped chemical-laden hydraulic-fracturing, or fracking, fluid deep within the ground, at a rate around 1,300 gallons per hour. Right after the 3.9 quake, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources director took to a news conference to say, \"The seismic events are not a direct result of fracking.\" In any case, the well was shut down for investigation. (It had actually been shut down just a few days prior in response to a 2.7 quake. The New Year's Eve quake turned it off for the long term.)\nNow, the data is in, and it appears the Natural Resources director's assessment was flat-out wrong. \"We conclude that the recent, 2011-2012, earthquakes in Youngstown, Ohio were induced by the fluid injection at Northstar 1 deep injection well due to increased pore pressure along the preexisting faults located close to the wellbore,\" an article in the most recent Journal of Geophysical Research concludes. Pore pressure refers to the force exerted on underground rock by fluids. Furthermore, the research finds a correlation between the quakes and the daily volume of material being injected into the well. After a peak of injection pressure into the well, five days later, seismic activity would spike as well.\nWhat seemed to happen was that the high-pressure fluid moved along a preexisting fault in a west-southwest direction (away from the well), increasing pressure on the rock formations as it progressed. This decreased the resistance the rock had to faulting, which increased the risk of an earthquake. And the location of the seismic activity moved as the the fluid did, along the fault line. When the pumping at the well stopped, the study concludes, the earthquakes waned.\nHowever, it's not the case that fracking fluid will always cause earthquakes. In the case of Youngstown, the placement of the well over an unknown fault led to the town shaking. After all, the Northstar 1 \"is the only well out of 177 ... waste disposal wells operating in the state of Ohio during 2011 that has been linked to potentially induced earthquakes.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:11ad8f07-8b9a-4150-a67d-b2034154df9f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I need help understanding backup systems for business disaster planning - how does on-site vs off-site backup compare, and what's recommended for data protection?","answer":"For business disaster planning, both on-site and off-site backups play important roles. While on-site backups are valuable, they are not sufficient alone - off-site backups are strongly recommended as they make backup data invulnerable to any disaster that occurs at the business location. The disaster recovery team needs to specifically determine what needs to be backed up, who should back up the data, how the information should be backed up, where backup data should be stored, and how frequently backups should occur. This comprehensive approach to data protection ensures critical business processes can remain operational even during disasters.","context":["In order to optimize the growth of your business, you have to plan for the future. To this end, one of the most important steps that you need to take is to create a business continuity plan. Let's take a look at why implementing one of these plans is so valuable for your business, and how you can get your plan started today.\nWhat is a business continuity plan?\nA continuity plan is often mistaken for a disaster recovery plan, but they are not the same thing. A disaster recovery plan involves the restoration of any assets that were destroyed during a disastrous event. A continuity plan, on the other hand, doesn't consider how to restore damaged assets. Instead, it is a plan to keep your business up and running in the event that critical business resources are no longer functional or are destroyed. A complete continuity plan will factor in every business asset that you own, even including your company's building.\nWhy is a business continuity plan important?\nDisasters happen. No matter where your company is located, a destructive fire, storm or even an earthquake can strike. Although putting everything back together is important, restoration of your destroyed assets shouldn't be the only thing on your mind when a disaster happens. If you stop operations completely, then everything that your business does from the moment of the disaster until full recovery will be a total loss.\nA continuity plan will give your company the ability to continue earning profits throughout the entire recovery process. You never expect disasters to happen, but if you're prepared when they do, then you will be able to maintain a meaningful level of productivity while your business recovers from a disaster.\nWhat steps should I take to create or enhance my business continuity plan?\nAt first thought, it can seem like an inconceivable task to continue running your business without a critical asset like your building, but it is possible. Here are the steps you need to take:\nCreate a comprehensive list of potential disasters\nIn order to plan to recover from a disaster, you have to know what it will be and how it will affect your business. That's why the first task for your business continuity plan should be to identify as many potential disasters as possible. You should consider anything that would cause a major or minor hindrance to your business operations. Here are a few examples:\n- Lightning storm\n- Epidemic or pandemic\n- War or terrorism\n- Cyber attack\nBack everything up\nYou rely on your business' data. If this is destroyed in a disaster, you will have to start from scratch. You can prevent valuable data destruction from having such a massive impact by backing it up.\nAlthough on-site backups are great, you should also have off-site backups. This will make your backup data invulnerable to any disaster that occurs at your business.\nPut a remote operations plan in place\nThanks to modern technology, your entire team can continue working cohesively without being in the same place. To make this happen, you will first need to create a digital office that will be largely unaffected by the sudden destruction or displacement of physical assets.\nIn order to enable your team to remotely operate after a disaster, you will need three things:\n- Cloud document management\n- Remote document access systems\n- Mobile document management applications\nThere are powerful document management systems that give you all of these capabilities.\nAre you prepared for anything?\nKeep your company up and running no matter what with an effective business continuity plan.","A disaster recovery team is the group in an organization tasked to develop, document, and execute processes and procedures for data recovery, business continuity, and IT infrastructure repairs in case of an attack or failure.\nThink of it as a race car’s pit crew that ensures it will run efficiently throughout a race.\nRead More about a “Disaster Recovery Team”\nWho Are the Members of a Disaster Recovery Team?\nLike any other kind of team, a disaster recovery team comprises several people from various departments. It typically includes:\nThese members don’t participate in disaster recovery planning, but it’s good to involve them because you’ll need their approval for strategies, policies, budgets, and other management-related obstacles.\nCrisis management coordinator\nTypically a business leader is tasked to oversee data recovery management when disasters strike. He or she initiates recovery plans, coordinates efforts from the start through successful recovery, handles problem resolutions as issues arise, and eliminates factors delaying the process.\nBusiness continuity expert\nHe or she has two primary responsibilities:\n- Ensure the disaster recovery strategy and plan complies with business needs. It should identify specific goals and allow disaster recovery efforts to support actual needs. In this role, the expert needs to keep everyone on the team on the same page. As such, he or she should facilitate open communication between the business and IT teams.\n- Confirm that critical business continuity plan points are also present in the disaster recovery plan. The expert should keep in mind that while the IT team are the tech experts, they might not be aware of business fundamentals that play a role in an emergency. They may not know the proper reporting procedure or who to contact and how.\nImpact assessment and recovery team\nThese specialists are the heart of the team and have the most expertise. This team’s members should represent four critical components of the organization’s IT infrastructure—networks, servers, storage, and databases. Each member or subteam should identify, implement, and test the solutions and strategies that will ultimately recover operations.\nWhat Does Disaster Recovery Entail?\nWhen problems arise, the disaster recovery team should take care of these corporate network components:\n- Network and telecommunication equipment: The team needs to understand your network infrastructure and be thoroughly familiar with recovering operations if connectivity fails. Note that disruptions will make it difficult for personnel to communicate internally and externally.\n- Servers: The team needs to know your server and operating system (OS) infrastructure by heart. They should also understand what replication and backup technologies to use. And since virtual machines (VMs) are the norm, they need to be aware of the differences between virtual and physical environments and their implications to disaster recovery.\n- Storage: Replication and data protection have to do most with storage devices. The team needs to have experience dealing with problems in both physical and virtual storage environments.\n- Databases: These hold the application and other data and can operate on shared or individual servers or might be shared among applications. The team needs to know all about data protection.\nDoes Every Disaster Recovery Team Need a Disaster Recovery Plan?\nThe quick answer is yes, as the plan dictates who the members of the disaster recovery team are, what they should do in case catastrophes occur, and more. A disaster recovery plan answers these five questions:\n1. Who are the members of the disaster recovery team?\nThe plan should identify the team members, define each member’s responsibilities, and provide their contact information.\n2. What are the organization’s disaster risks?\nAll risks, including natural disasters, human-made emergencies, and technology-related incidents, need to be identified and assessed. That will help the disaster recovery team identify the strategies and resources they need to recover from any disaster within a specified time frame.\n3. What are the organization’s critical applications, documents, and resources?\nCritical business processes should remain operational, so disaster recovery plans should focus on short-term survivability.\n4. Where should data be backed up and stored?\nQuestions like the following need answers here:\n- What needs to be backed up?\n- Who should back data up?\n- How should the information be backed up?\n- Where should backup data be stored?\n- How frequently should the data be backed up?\n5. How do you make sure your disaster recovery plan works?\nDisaster recovery planning is a continuous process since risks always change. All plans should be regularly evaluated for effectiveness and appropriateness."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3668f91f-530f-4090-8404-468ae65242f7>","<urn:uuid:6a7acc81-8cbc-4a9d-b681-eb116650548e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between CRR requirements for banks and maximum deposit limits for Post Office Monthly Income Scheme accounts?","answer":"For CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio), banks must maintain at least 3% of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities with RBI, which can be increased up to 20% of NDTL. In comparison, the Post Office Monthly Income Scheme has maximum deposit limits of Rs. 9 lakh for single accounts and Rs. 15 lakh for joint accounts, with a minimum deposit requirement of Rs. 1000.","context":["1. CASH RESERVE RATIO\nCash reserve Ratio (CRR) is the amount of funds that the banks have to keep with RBI. If RBI decides to increase the percent of this, the available amount with the banks comes down. RBI is using this method (increase of CRR rate), to drain out the excessive money from the banks. The amount of which shall not be less than three per cent of the total of the Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) in India, on a fortnightly basis and RBI is empowered to increase the said rate of CRR to such higher rate not exceeding twenty percent of the Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) under the RBI Act, 1934.\n2. STATUTORY LIQUIDITY RATIO\nIn terms of Section 24 (2-A) of the B.R. Act, 1949 all Scheduled Commercial Banks, in addition to the average daily balance which they are required to maintain in the form of….\n- In cash,or\n- In gold valued at a price not exceeding the current market price, or\n- In unencumbered approved securities valued at a price as specified by the RBI from time to time.\n3. REPO RATE\nRepo rate, also known as the official bank rate, is the discounted rate at which a central bank repurchases government securities. The central bank makes this transaction with commercial banks to reduce some of the short-term liquidity in the system. The repo rate is dependent on the level of money supply that the bank chooses to fix in the monetary scheme of things. Repo rate is short for repurchase rate. The entity borrowing the security is often referred to as the buyer, while the lender of the securities is referred to as the seller. The central bank has the power to lower the repo rates while expanding the money supply in the country. This enables the banks to exchange their government security holdings for cash. In contrast, when the central bank decides to reduce the money supply, it implements a rise in the repo rates. At times, the central bank of the nation makes a decision regarding the money supply level and the repo rate is determined by the market.\nThe securities that are being evaluated and sold are transacted at the current market price plus any interest that has accrued. When the sale is concluded, the securities are subsequently resold at a predetermined price. This price is comprised of the original market price and interest, and the pre-agreed interest rate, which is the repo rate.\n4. BANK RATE\nBank rate is referred to the rate of interest charged by premier banks on the loans and advances. Bank rate varies based on some defined conditions as laid down the governing authority of the banks. Bank rates are levied to control the money supply to and from the bank. From the consumer’s point of view, bank rate ordinarily denotes to the current rate of interest acquired from savings certificate of Deposit. It is most frequently used by the consumers who are concerned in mortgage\nSome commonest types of bank interest rates are as follows:\n- Bank rate on CD, i.e., on certificate of deposit\n- Bank rate on the credit of a credit card or other kind of loan\n- Bank rate on real estate loan\n5. INTERBANK RATE\nThe rate of interest charged on short-term loans made between banks. Banks borrow and lend money in the interbank market in order to manage liquidity and meet the requirements placed on them. The interest rate charged depends on the availability of money in the market, on prevailing rates and on the specific terms of the contract, such as term length.\nBanks are required to hold an adequate amount of liquid assets, such as cash, to manage any potential withdrawals from clients. If a bank can’t meet these liquidity requirements, it will need to borrow money in the interbank market to cover the shortfall. Some banks, on the other hand, have excess liquid assets above and beyond the liquidity requirements. These banks will lend money in the interbank market, receiving interest on the assets. There is a wide range of published interbank rates, including the LIBOR & MIBOR, which is set daily based on the average rates on loans made within the London interbank market & Mumbai Interbank Market.\n6. GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT\nThe monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period, though GDP is usually calculated on an annual basis. It includes all of private and public consumption, government outlays, investments and exports less imports that occur within a defined territory.\nGDP = C + G + I + NX\n- “C” is equal to all private consumption, or consumer spending, in a nation’s economy.\n- “G” is the sum of government spending.\n- “I” is the sum of all the country’s businesses spending on capital.\n- “NX” is the nation’s total net exports, calculated as total exports minus total imports. (NX = Exports – Imports)\nGDP is commonly used as an indicator of the economic health of a country, as well as to gauge a country’s standard of living.\nInflation can be defined as a rise in the general price level and therefore a fall in the value of money. Inflation occurs when the amount of buying power is higher than the output of goods and services. Inflation also occurs when the amount of money exceeds the amount of goods and services available. As to whether the fall in the value of money will affect the functions of money depends on the degree of the fall. Basically, refers to an increase in the supply of currency or credit relative to the availability of goods and services, resulting in higher prices. Therefore, inflation can be measured in terms of percentages. The percentage increase in the price index, as a rate per cent per unit of time, which is usually in years. The two basic price indexes are used when measuring inflation, the producer price index (PPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) which is also known as the cost of living index number.\nIt is a condition of falling prices accompanied by a decreasing level of employment, output and income. Deflation is just the opposite of inflation. Deflation occurs when the total expenditure of the community is not equal to the existing prices. Consequently, the supply of money decreases and as a result prices fall. Deflation can also be brought about by direct contractions in spending, either in the form of a reduction in government spending, personal spending or investment spending. Deflation has often had the side effect of increasing unemployment in an economy, since the process often leads to a lower level of demand in the economy.\nWhen prices are falling due to anti-inflationary measures adopted by the authorities, with no corresponding decline in the existing level of employment, output and income, the result of this is disinflation. When acute inflation burdens an economy, disinflation is implemented as a cure. Disinflation is said to take place when deliberate attempts are made to curtail expenditure of all sorts to lower prices and money incomes for the benefit of the community.\nReflation is a situation of rising prices, which is deliberately undertaken to relieve a depression. Reflation is a means of motivating the economy to produce. This is achieved by increasing the supply of money or in some instances reducing taxes, which is the opposite of disinflation. Governments can use economic policies such as reducing taxes, changing the supply of money or adjusting the interest rates; which in turn motivates the country to increase their output. The situation is described as semi-inflation or reflation.\nStagflation is a stagnant economy that is combined with inflation. Basically, when prices are increasing the economy is deceasing. Some economists believe that there are two main reasons for stagflation. Firstly, stagflation can occur when an economy is slowed by an unfavourable supply, such as an increase in the price of oil in an oil importing country, which tends to raise prices at the same time that it slows the economy by making production less profitable. In the 1970’s inflation and recession occurred in different economies at the same time. Basically, what happened was that there was plenty of liquidity in the system and people were spending money as quickly as they got it because prices were going up quickly. This gave rise to the second reason for stagflation.\n12. FOREIGN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENTS\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) are allowed to invest in the primary and secondary capital markets in India through the portfolio investment scheme (PIS). Under this scheme, FIIs/NRIs can acquire shares/debentures of Indian companies through the stock exchanges in India.\nThe ceiling for overall investment for FIIs is 24 per cent of the paid up capital of the Indian company and 10 per cent for NRIs/PIOs. The limit is 20 per cent of the paid up capital in the case of public sector banks, including the State Bank of India.\n13. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES\nForeign exchange reserves (also called Forex reserves) in a strict sense are only the foreign currency deposits held by central banks and monetary authorities. However, the term in popular usage commonly includes foreign exchange and gold, SDRs and IMF reserve positions. This broader figure is more readily available, but it is more accurately termed official reserves or international reserves. These are assets of the central bank held in different reserve currencies, such as the dollar, euroyen, and used to back its liabilities, e.g. the local currency issued, and the various bank reserves deposited with the central bank, by the government or financial institutions. and\nLarge reserves of foreign currency allow a government to manipulate exchange rates – usually to stabilize the foreign exchange rates to provide a more favorable economic environment.","Post Office Monthly Income Scheme helps us to get monthly income from post office based on the deposits made and interest rate.

{"question":"What is the relationship between Human-Computer Interaction and Game Theory in modern decision-making systems? Please provide specific aspects of both.","answer":"Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on creating user-friendly systems through advanced interfaces including multisensoriality, multimodality, multilingualism, and brain/machine interfaces, along with new display technologies like wearable devices and 3D displays. Game Theory complements this by providing mathematical models for strategic decision-making that can be implemented in these systems, such as in artificial intelligence applications where systems need to make strategic choices while interacting with humans, as demonstrated in the chess match between Deep Blue and Kasparov. Both fields contribute to developing systems that can effectively interact with and make decisions alongside humans.","context":["Presentation on theme: \"DECISION THEORIES 1 Problem solving –Collaboration, GAME THEORY –Asymmetric information, AGENCY THEORY –Optimization, OPERATIONAL RESEARCH 2 Problem finding.\"— Presentation transcript:\nDECISION THEORIES 1 Problem solving –Collaboration, GAME THEORY –Asymmetric information, AGENCY THEORY –Optimization, OPERATIONAL RESEARCH 2 Problem finding –Intelligence, Design, Choice –Cognitive dissonance theory –Cognitive Fit theory 3 Collective problem - Mimetism\nCONTRACTCALCULATION UNDERSTANDING RATIONALITY - Autonomy - Calculation rationality - Preferences maximization - Pure market Positivism - Strategical, political - Bounded rationality - Satisfacing - Access cost to the market Behaviorism - Convention, Understanding, Trust - Rationality of Mimetism - Information screen Constructivism\n1. Problem solving\n. Game theory A branch of applied mathematics that uses models to study interactions with formalized incentive structures (\"games\"). Game theory studies choice of optimal behavior when costs and benefits of each option are not fixed, but depend upon the choices of other individuals : various players interact strategically Game theory has applications in a variety of fields, including economics, international relations, evolutionary biology, political science, and military strategy. Game theorists study the predicted and actual behaviour of individuals in games, as well as optimal strategies.\nAgency Theory - The « principal-agent » problem treats the difficulties that arise under conditions of incomplete and asymmetric information when a principal hires an agent For example when stockholders hire top executives of corporations: - The desires or goals of the principal and agent conflict - It is difficult or expensive for the principle to verify what the agent is actually doing - The principle and the agent may prefer different actions because of the different risk preferences Various mechanisms may be used to try to align the interests of the agent with those of the principal : piece rates/commissions, profit sharing, efficiency wages, the agent posting a bond, or fear of firing.\n2.

Cognitive Dissonance Theory Leon Festinger (1957): there is a tendency for individuals to seek consistency among their cognitions (i.e., beliefs, opinions). When there is an inconsistency between attitudes or behaviors (dissonance), something must change to eliminate the dissonance.

A Basic Introduction and Example\nGame Theory is one of the most fascinating branches of mathematics with tons of applications to fields ranging from the social sciences to the biological sciences. Game Theory has even found its way into mainstream media through movies such as A Beautiful Mind, with Russell Crowe.\nThis article will explain some of the fundamentals of game theory and work through a simple example.\nDefinition of a \"Game\"\nGame Theory is the study of \"games.\" Games, in the mathematical sense, are defined as strategic situations in which there are multiple participants. Furthermore, the outcome of the decision any individual makes is dependent on the decision that individual's decision and the decisions made by all of the other participants.\nIs Sudoku a \"game?\"\nNo, not the way we defined \"game.\" Sudoku is not a \"game\" because what you do when solving the game is independent of what anyone else does.\nIs Chess a \"game?\"\nYes! Imagine that you are playing a game of chess with a friend. Whether you win or not will be dependent on the moves you make and the moves your friend makes. At the same time, whether or not they win will be dependent on the moves they make and the moves you make.\nNOTE: The most important thing to realize in the chess example is that at least 2 \"participant's\" decisions were affected by the decisions of other participants. Solving a Sudoku puzzle is not a game since how you solve the puzzle is not affected by anyone else's decisions.\nOk, I get what a \"game\" is, but what is Game Theory?\nGame Theory is the study of \"games.\" Game theorists try to model \"games\" in a way that makes them easy to understand and analyze. A lot of \"games\" end up having similar properties or reoccurring patterns, but sometimes it is hard to understand a complicated game.\nLet's work through an example of a game and how a game theorist might model it.\nExample: The Game of Chicken\nConsider the \"game\" of chicken. In the game of chicken we have 2 people, Bluebert and Redbert, who drive their cars at full speed towards each other. They each have to make the decision just before crashing to either drive straight ahead or to swerve at the last minute. The possible results are as follows:\nBluebert is happy he wins, Redbert is sad he loses\nBluebert is sad he loses, Redbert is happy he wins\nThey stare at each other shocked at what they've done\nNow that we know the general results, this isn't the easiest way of understanding the game. Let's reorganize the possible results into a matrix.\nThis is called a payoff matrix. The rows represent the possible actions of Bluebert. The columns represent the possible actions of Redbert. Each box represents the result from each combination of decisions. By using this matrix, it is easy to see what the result of different combinations of actions is.\nA quick example: If Bluebert swerves, then we know the result will be one of the top 2 boxes, depending on what Redbert decides to do. On the other hand, if Blubert goes straight, then we know the result will be one of the bottom two boxes, depending on what Redbert decides to do.\nLet's replace the illustrations of the results with some numbers to make things easier to analyze.\n- Both swerving and staring at each other = 0 for both\n- Both going straight and crashing = -5 for both\n- One swerving and one going straight = 1 for the winner (straight) and -1 for the loser (swerve)\nSome Simple Analysis:\nNow that we have organized this game theoretic \"game\" into an easily readable payoff matrix, let's see what we can learn about how the game will be played out.\nThe first thing we will look at is something called a best response. Essentially, lets imagine that we are Bluebert and we KNOW what Redbert will do. How do we react?\nIf we KNOW Redbert will swerve, we need only look at the left column. We see that if we swerve we get 0 and if we go straight, we get 1. So the best response is to go straight.\nOn the other hand, if we KNOW Redbert will go straight, we need only look at the right column. We see that if we swerve we get -1 and if we go straight, we get -5. So the best response is to go straight.\nIn this game, Redbert has similar best responses.\nIf you have seen the Ron Howard movie, A Beautiful Mind, with Russell Crowe, you may remember that it was about the Mathematician John Nash. Nash Equilibriums are named after this very Nash!\nA Nash Equilibrium is when all players play a best response. In the game of chicken above, both players going straight is not a Nash Equilibrium because at least one player would have preferred to swerve. In the game of chicken, both players swerving is not a Nash Equilibrium because at least one player would have preferred to go straight.\nHowever, when one player swerves, and one player goes straight, this is a Nash Equilibrium because neither player can improve their outcome by changing their action. Another way of saying this is that both players are playing a best response.\nIf you've made it this far congrats! You've learned the basics of game theory. It wasn't the most fun we can have with game theory, but it did lay a solid foundation to understand this amazing branch of mathematics, and you can see how applicable it is to many different disciplines.\nIf you have questions, comments, or suggestions, please let me know. In particular, if something was unclear above, let me know so I can try to explain it better.

{"question":"How did archaeologists manage to preserve and study the wooden parts of the Pompeii chariot when they would have rotted away thousands of years ago?","answer":"The archaeologists used a special technique of injecting plaster into the voids left in the volcanic ash where the wooden parts had decomposed. This method allowed them to preserve the shapes of the chariot's wooden shaft and platform, as well as the imprints of its ropes. This same technique had been previously used to preserve remains of humans at Pompeii, and was also successfully used to preserve the shapes of three Roman horses found at the same site a few years earlier.","context":["An ornate four-wheeled chariot of iron, bronze and wood that archaeologists think was drawn by a team of horses in processions through Pompeii almost 2,000 years ago has been unearthed during excavations of a wealthy Roman villa just north of the ancient city’s walls.\nArchaeologists discovered the elaborate chariot, which still has imprints of organic materials such as its ropes and floral decorations, almost intact in a portico of the villa in the suburb of Civita Giuliana, facing the stables where the remains of three horses were found in 2018.\nThe collapsing walls and roof of the villa helped preserve the chariot from 21st-century antiquities thieves, who had dug tunnels at the site that nearly reached the chariot, according to officials at the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, which is managed by Italy’s cultural heritage ministry.\nIt’s thought the richly-adorned chariot may have been a pilentum referred to by some sources, which was not for everyday use or for agricultural transport, but featured in community festivities, parades, and processions. It’s the first time that this type of ceremonial chariot has been found in Italy, the statement said.\nThe exceptional preservation and the fact that the chariot would have been such a show-stopper in its day has archaeologists amazed. “I was astounded,” Eric Poehler, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has written about ancient Pompeii, told NPR. “Many of the vehicles I’d written about before … are your standard station wagon or vehicle for taking the kids to soccer. This is a Lamborghini. This is an outright fancy, fancy car.”\nPark director Massimo Osanna said in the statement that the chariot “is an extraordinary discovery for the advancement of knowledge of the ancient world.” She added, “At Pompeii, vehicles used for transport have been found [in] the past… but nothing like the Civita Giuliana chariot.”\nThe ancient city of Pompeii near Naples was destroyed when the nearby volcano Vesuviu erupted in A.D. 79, when pyroclastic flows of superheated gas spread throughout the surrounding settlements, killing more than 30,000 and burying the city under up to 10 feet (3 meters) of ash.\nParts of the buried city were discovered in the late 1500s, and scientific excavations started there in the 18th century. In the 19th century, archaeologists developed a method of injecting plaster into the voids left by the remains of the dead in the ash layer — mostly of humans, but famously also a chained-up dog.\nThe shapes of the three Roman horses found at Civita Giuliana a few years ago were the first time the technique had been used successfully on large mammals. Two of them had been harnessed with bits and bridles, possibly as their owner attempted to escape the destruction.\nArchaeologists say most of the newly unearthed chariot has survived intact, although its materials are extremely fragile.\nThe shapes of the shaft and platform of the chariot, which were made of wood that has long since rotted away, and the imprint of its ropes have been preserved by injecting plaster into the voids that remain in the ash.\nThe ceremonial style of the chariot may have Greek origins; among its decorations are medallions that show figures of satyrs and nymphs associated with Eros, the Greek god of desire and sex, whose Roman counterpart was Cupid.\n“One cannot exclude the possibility that this could have been a chariot used for rituals relating to marriage, for leading the bride to her new household,” the statement said.\nThe archaeological park at Pompeii is now a UNESCO World Heritage site that covers 170 acres (69 hectares) of the buried ancient city, but roughly 50 acres (20 ha) are still unexcavated.\nThe latest excavations at Civita Giuliana began after looters dug tunnels to a closed-off area in search of antiquities they could sell illegally; a police investigation that started in 2014 eventually led to the arrest of more than 140 suspects and the recovery of about 2,000 ancient artifacts.\nArchaeological excavations since 2017 have revealed the looters dug an extensive network of tunnels into the ash, stealing or damaging many culturally important artifacts, the statement said.\nBoth the looters and the archaeologists who excavated the area initially overlooked the chariot.\nThey eventually found it beneath the collapsed wooden ceiling of a two-level portico that opened onto an uncovered courtyard; an upper part of the chariot was revealed only when archaeologists preserved and removed carbonized wooden beams from the ceiling that lay above it.\nScientists also used photogrammetry and laser scanning to record the elements of the chariot and the rooms that surround it; they transferred the remains of the chariot to the park’s laboratory, where restorers are working to remove more volcanic material from its metal parts."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:668f4b09-ef7b-4df1-8eaa-aff8dddcda0b>"],"error":null}

He was depicted in mummiform, only his hands reaching forward, wearing a tight-fitting cap and carrying a combined was- and djed-pillar scepter. The Pyramid Texts mention him as a creator god and already in the Old Kingdom the priesthood in Mennefer created a theology aimed at defining Peteh as the creative impulse behind the universe, accepting the other creator gods but placing them as forms of Peteh. On the Shabaka Stone (c. 700 BC) he is altogether identified as eight primitive forms of God; the first is 'Peteh who is upon the great (i.e. primeval) place', meaning the original spirit. Then Peteh-Niu - the waters 'who was the father of Atum', next is Peteh-Naunet - 'the Primeval Mother who gave birth to Atum. Then 'Peteh the very great one who is the heart and tongue of the Divine Compay'. Unfortunately several of the names have been lost to us, except Nefertum, the lotus. In the Coffin Texts and in the 19th Dynasty he was associated with the early earth god of Mennefer, Ta-tenen, 'The Land Which Has Become Distinguishable', meaning distinguishable from the primeval waters, i.e. the Primeval Mound. For the people he was 'the sculptor of the earth', with a likeness to Khnum who fashioned mankind on his potter´s wheel but he never gained a wide and unchallenged popularity, perhaps on account of his intellectual and not so colorful mythology. He was associated with Apis, the sacred fertility bull of Mennefer which was called his 'spokesman' and his 'glorious soul'. In the Late Period he was merged with the ancient Memphitian mortuary deity Sokar and through him also with Osiris, thus becoming a composite god; Peteh-Sokar-Osiris. The ancient Egyptians believed that the name of something held the essence of that being or thing. Instead of as in the Heliopolitan creation myth, where Atum creates the Ennead with his semen and his fingers, Peteh creates with his word; the thought originates in his heart and when it is formed and spoken by his tongue, the authority of his utterance cause all things come into being. The Ennead of Peteh is his teeth and lips, when he speaks, his essence transmits and causes gods and mankind to exist. The theology of Peteh suggests a synthesis of the mind and the material world, a well thought out theology, probably created in order to make Peteh take precedence over rivalling centres of worship, but intellectually advanced and fascinating even today.\nMain center of worship:\nat Mennefer/Memphis, 1 st Nome, Lower Egypt\nThe Serapeum at Saqqara, 1st Nome, Lower Egypt\nFestivals: (exact dates not historically verified)\n14th October - 28th Hethara - Festival of establishing Heru as\nKing, The appearance before Ptah\n16th December - 1st Mechir - Day of Ptah lifting up his hands\n6th January - 22nd Mechir - Feast of Ptah and Heru (Horus)\n11th January - 27th Mechir - Feast of Sokar\n15th March - 30th Parmutit - Offerings to Ra, Wasir, Heru,\nPtah, Sokar and Atum\n12th July - 29th Mesore - Holiday in the Temple of Sokar,\nFestival in the Estate of Ptah\nSuggested Pdf Resources\n- Cisco Expo 2011 - Trustsec mrezna usluga - Goran Peteh\n- path in the switching environment. ▪ IEEE 802.\n- FEMA Floodplain\n- PETEH.

There are many stories, some from the Vedas, some from the Brahmanas, some from the Puranas; some are philosophical, based on concepts, and others are narratives based on characters. One can sense something common in all, but there is a great deal of variations.\nThe fundamental difference between the story of creation in Hinduism and Abrahamic religions is that Hinduism - like Buddhism and Jainism - views the world as eternal, going through phases of creation and destruction. So, beginning refers to the beginning of a phase, not beginning of the world itself. In Abrahamic mythology, the world comes into being from nothingness by the will of God; and it will end in nothingness. There is a starting and an end point. A segment, essentially. In Hinduism, it is a line, eternal and even repetitive. This difference in the notion of time, explains the difference in the creation of myths. So, while there is a definitive Genesis in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions, there isn’t one in Hinduism.\nIn Hinduism, when we speak of \"creation\", we have to clarify, are we speaking of the birth of matter, or birth of consciousness, or birth of living creatures, or birth of culture.\nIn Tantras, we are told that matter came first as the Goddess, and from her came the mind, taking three male forms: Brahma, the priest; Vishnu, the king; Shiva, the ascetic. (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)\nIn early Vedic hymns, society is an organism (purusha) created by the coming together of four different kinds of humans: the knowledge-keepers form the head, the land-controllers form the arms, the market-controllers make up the trunk, and service-providers make up the feet. Society is also divided along these lines. So union and separation become key themes.\nIn later Puranic traditions, when we refer to Brahma as the creator, we are referring to the birth of human culture, through the ritual of culture. Culture goes through four phases of childhood (Krita), youth (Treta), maturity (Dvapara) and old age (Kali) before dying (Pralaya) after which there is rebirth. The death is imagined as a flood, and the only thing that survives is the first human, Manu, and the Vedas, saved by Vishnu. This is a recurring event.\nBrahma is also called Prajapati, the father of all living creatures. And so from his mind are created \"mind-born\" sons, the sages, referring to asexual reproduction. After which come sons who marry women and produce children. Rishi Kashyapa, son of Brahma, marries many women who give birth to different kinds of creatures, according to Puranas. Timi gives birth to fishes, Kadru to snakes and Vinata to birds. But it is never clear where the women come from: are they from Brahma’s body or elsewhere? The Brahma, and all male forms, seem like metaphors for the mind that is planted in matter (represented as women) to create embodied life.\nThis union of a male and female form, of mind and matter, is a recurring theme in Puranic tradition, especially after the rise of Tantra. Shiva cannot create the world without Shakti; without her, he starves. This world of Shiva and Shakti is nature. In the Gita, this duality is denied. Krishna claims that he is the source of life, that he has two \"wombs\" (yoni), which are mind and matter. Some people prefer using the word consciousness instead of mind.\nWhat comes first, mind or matter? In the old Vedic hymns, over 3,000 years old, the most famous \"creation\" hymn is highly sceptical if this question can ever be answered for even the \"gods came later\". This scepticism is found in Upanishads too, although many attempts are made.\nLater, in Tantras, we are told that matter came first as the Goddess, and from her came the mind, taking three male forms: Brahma, the priest; Vishnu, the king; Shiva, the ascetic. Brahma sought control of the Goddess, and was beheaded. Shiva sought to reject the Goddess and was enchanted and turned into husband. Vishnu became caretaker as well as beloved of the Goddess. Brahma’s desire to control the Goddess is given as the reason why he is not worshipped.\nHowever, in the Puranas, mind came first. The world comes into being when Vishnu awakens and from his navel rises a lotus in which sits Brahma who feels alone and afraid. Unaware of his origins, he creates various living creatures from his mind. And assumes he is the creator, another reason why he is not worshipped.\nVishnu worshippers, who became dominant 1,000 years ago, insisted that the world comes into being when Vishnu awakens and ceases to be when Vishnu sleeps. It is he who brings the world out from the bottom of the sea, and enables Lakshmi to be churned out from the ocean of milk. Brahma sits on the lotus that rises from Vishnu's navel.\nShiva worshippers rejected this idea and tell the story of the pillar of fire, embodiment of consciousness, that has no beginning or end, whose tip Brahma could not find when he took the form of a swan, and whose base Vishnu could not find when he took the form of a boar. Thus, Shiva is the infinite origin around which all finite forms take shape.\nThese myriad ways of looking at creation open up our mind to various possibilities and do not fix it to one way of looking the world. Thus, the dynamic diversity of Hinduism manifests itself oneself once again."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2e7f227e-049d-4e69-a0ec-020194178d3d>","<urn:uuid:ffaa4426-4502-4805-8e44-2a9f91d59ba4>"],"error":null}

So we can conclude that they are younger than 2.5 million years old — and the majority are probably younger than 250,000 years,” Jörn Helbert of the DLR Institute of Planetary Research in Germany, co-author of a study published April 8 in Science, said in a press release. “In geological terms, this means that they are practically from the present day.”\nThe results could explain why there are fewer asteroid impacts than expected on the planet’s surface. Volcanism has been the prime suspect, because lava flows can fill in and obscure craters. But scientists were unsure whether a major episode of volcanic activity resurfaced much of the planet all at once in the past, or if intermittent activity has slowly filled in craters over time. The existence of a recent flow suggests the latter is more likely, and that volcanism may be ongoing.\nVenus is shrouded in a thick cloud cover which obscures the visible light emissions form the surface. So a team led by Suzanne Smrekar of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory studied the thermal emissions of the surface using the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer on the Venus Express orbiter. Older surfaces tend to be smoothed by weathering over time, while younger surfaces are more rough and have higher thermal emissions.\nSeveral areas on the surface had been identified as potential volcanic centers by radar imagery data from the Magellan mission, which ended in 1994 when the spacecraft was intentionally crashed into the surface. Smrekar’s team targeted three of these areas and found they had higher thermal emissions than the surrounding areas.\n“Now we have strong evidence right at the surface for recent eruptions,” Smrekar said in a press release.\nBecause Venus is similar in size and internal structure to Earth, comparisons between the two planets can help scientists understand our own planet’s evolution. If volcanism on Venus is also similar to Earth, as the new study indicates, that narrows the factors that could have sent the planets on such different paths that ended with Earth being habitable and Venus being bone dry and hellishly hot.\nIn order to determine what the young rock is made of, Helbert plans to build a lab that can heat various rock types to around 900 degrees Fahrenheit, the planet’s surface temperature, and study their thermal emission signatures to compare to the Venus Express readings.\nImages: 1) 3-D radar image of Maat Mons volcano./DLR. 2) Thermal emission signature of Venutian volcano.

{"question":"How did the Persian Gulf states transition from being known as 'pirate kingdoms' to modern nations, and what current trade infrastructure connects them to India?","answer":"The Persian Gulf states transformed from 'pirate kingdoms' through the 1820 General Maritime Treaty, which banned piracy and required states to fly white-pierced red flags indicating their abandonment of piracy. These former pirate states became known as 'Trucial States' due to their truce with the British Empire, eventually emerging as sovereign nations like the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain in 1968. Today, these nations are connected to India through the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), a modern multi-modal transport network. The INSTC features multiple routes, including the Central Corridor connecting Maharashtra's Jawaharlal Nehru Port to Iran's Bandar Abbas Port, and the Western Corridor linking Iran and Azerbaijan through railway networks. This infrastructure development is expected to boost trade relationships, reduce transportation costs, and provide India better access to these markets, though its development faces challenges from regional political tensions and financing issues.","context":["Bombay port was a scene of hectic activity in November of 1819: a great imperial expedition was underway. Warships, troop carriers and support ships were being readied to carry three thousand British and Indian soldiers to wage war in the Persian Gulf. For decades, the so-called “pirate kingdoms” of the Persian Gulf’s southern coast(present day UAE, Qatar and Bahrain) had been preying on British shipping. The British had launched naval patrols and a punitive naval campaign ten years ago, to no avail. This time the authorities resolved that Arabian threat had to be put down for good. Also, the political system of that region had to be shaped to suit the Empire’s strategic objectives. The 1819 campaign turned out to be successful for the British and the impact of the expedition and the subsequent treaties endure to this day.\nIn the 17th century, the Al-Qasimi tribe (the line of the current Emirs of Sharjah and Ras Al-Khaimah) established control over large parts of the Persian Gulf Coast. Other tribes held sway over Qatar and Bahrain. These tribes adopted what western historians called “piracy”, due to the lack of productive land, means of livelihood, and strong maritime authority in the region. Moreover, these states perceived themselves as legitimate authorities and claimed toll from vessels passing through their littoral regions. The imperious British did not acknowledge such claims and refused to pay. The Al Qasimis, the most warlike tribe of the lot,began plundering British ships. Imperial narratives portrayed this as piratical acts by predatory groups. (Multiple sources do point out that the tribes of this region had been known for preying on commerce and travelers for centuries). Within a few years the Qasimis grew bolder and bolder and even ventured into the Arabian Sea. Additionally, fundamentalist Wahhabism gained influence across the Arabian Peninsula. The Wahhabi clerics directed the Qasimis to plunder all infidel and “apostate” Muslim shipping, without exception. The religious aspect made the British very worried; they feared Wahhabism inching closer to India with her millions of Muslims denizens. Besides, the British had a history with piracy too. Down the ages, many nations had made piracy the cornerstone of their policy: England’s growth as a maritime power owed a great deal to slavery, piracy and privateering (privately owned vessel commissioned by royal letter of marque to attack enemies). She had preyed on Europe’s Catholic kingdoms, sometimes in league with Protestant Dutch and Muslim powers. By the 18th century, England had morphed into Great Britain. She adopted the trappings of a modern state and abandoned slavery and piracy. However, she had not forgotten the impact of piracy on her rise: perhaps today’s tiny pirate states could grow into a serious threat. Such a threat could not be allowed to fester so close to India, the Jewel in the Crown.\nIn November 1819 the British-Indian force set sail under General William Keir Grant. The Qatari state under Rahmah ibn Jabir, a much-feared raider, supported the British. He had long realised that the British were too powerful. Moreover, the Qasimi were his rivals in those waters. Sultan Said bin Sultan of Oman also supported the British for similar reasons. The British-Indian forces, the Omanis and the “good pirates” attacked the Qasimis in December 1819. Within a week the Qasimis were crushed. Their capital, Ras Al Khaimah, and other towns were razed to the ground. The Qasimi surrendered after suffering heavy casualties. General Grant navigated skillfully across the political landscape and brought in line every chief of the Persian Gulf’s southern coast. The landmark General Maritime Treaty of Peace was signed in 1820. Slavery, piracy, and inter-tribal conflicts without British sanction were banned. The chiefs had to fly “white pierced red flags”, instead of the blood-red flags they hitherto sported. The white signified that they had abandoned piracy. Even today, the flags of the Emirates of the UAE feature variations of this rule.\nSuch provisions defanged the Arab states and made the Empire their de-facto master. Minor inter-tribal conflicts persisted till 1835, when the states agreed to a “perpetual maritime truce”. The former pirate states became known as ‘Trucial States’ as they were bound by a truce with the British Empire. For a long time, security and support were provided by British India. This engagement was deep, and the Indian Rupee became the de facto currency in the region. In 1968 Britain abandoned its protectorate of the Trucial States. After some political upheaval, the sovereign nations of Qatar, the UAE and Bahrain emerged. It is interesting to note that Indians have been always involved in the fortunes of the present-day Persian Gulf states. Two centuries ago Indians helped forge the Trucial States in blood and fire. Since the 1970s, Indians played a major role in building the sovereign nations that emerged.\nPS: This is my article in DNA, published on September 16, 2018. Here’s the link to the original article.","Background and Introduction\nInternational North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is a multi-modal transport corridor which was initially founded by India, Iran, and Russia, and later expanded with the inclusion of 10 other member states. It was established in 2000 and is currently being developed to connect the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea via Iran, which will then be connected to Saint Petersburg and North Europe via Russia for the purpose of promoting transportation cooperation among its Member States.\nThe agreement stands ratified by thirteen (13) countries namely, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Armenia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Ukraine. The legal framework for the INSTC is provided by a trilateral agreement signed by India, Iran, and Russia at the Euro-Asian Conference on Transport in the year 2002. Since then, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Oman, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Syria have signed instruments of accession to become members of the INSTC. The transit corridor is being developed with the objective of promoting regional cooperation-trade and transportation between the member states.\nThe INSTC essentially will have Central, Western and Eastern Corridors. The Central Corridor which starts at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Maharashtra connects to Bandar Abbas Port, Iran. The Western Corridor connects Iran and Azerbaijan through a railway network via Astara and further to Mumbai via sea. Finally, the Eastern corridor connects India to Russia through Central Asia including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.\nIndia has proposed to include the Chabahar port in the framework of the INSTC and has welcomed the formation of the India-Uzbekistan-Iran-Afghanistan Working Group on the joint use of the Chabahar port. This would open India’s direct trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia.\nThe North-South route enables lowering the transportation cost of goods by 30% and time of plying by 40% as compared to the Suez Canal. Thus, This route will provide an economic advantage of a lower capital and cost due to shorter distances covered along with faster deliveries. The development of INSTC will provide direct access to India in Central Asia and Russia. ‘Other available figures indicate that it would take half the time from Mumbai to Europe and Russia on the INSTC than along the sea route, and savings amount to the tune of $2,500 for every 15 tonnes of cargo’. The Standard route takes approximately 40 days in transit, relative to the North-South corridor which will bring it down by more than half.\nIn the recent past, the Suez Canal route also caused significant losses (US $10bn a day) to trade due to its blockage. The Suez Canal route caters to 10% of the global trade itself, and hence its vulnerabilities can directly impact global trade negatively. Although developments have been in line for the widening of its stretch, the issue called attention to the need for alternative routes. Thus, the strategic development of INSTC is even more important to reduce over-dependence on the Suez Canal route.\nThe members of the agreement include regions of Europe, Central Asia, Eurasia, South Asia, and the Middle East which are already members of multi-lateral trade agreements like the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC), Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), etc. Thus, the development of the corridor will not only facilitate the existing multilateral trade arrangements but also lead the way for better trade relationships among the member countries through new Free Trade Agreements and Bilateral Trade Agreements.\nWhat impact could this have on India’s trade with Iran and Russia?\nPresently, the trade levels of India with several of the above-mentioned CIS countries are less than one-per cent, mainly because of a lack of connectivity. However, the bilateral trade relations between India and these countries have been improving. The Indian primary export promotion board also identifies the category of goods that are likely to see a rise in trade given this development. These are, namely:\nTrade between Iran and India has deepened despite the sanctions’ impact. India exports rice, machinery and instruments, metals, primary and semi-finished iron and steel, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, processed minerals, manmade yarn and fabrics, tea, organic/inorganic/agrochemicals, and rubber-manufactured products to Iran. Over 80% of India’s crude oil imports are from Iran. With India’s growing energy consumption, it can benefit from the untapped hydrocarbon reserves of Iran. Though, India’s bilateral trade with Iran had remained stagnant after 2019, it remains one of Iran’s major oil importers after China. Thus, the development of INSTC will also mean greater energy security for India. INSTC would also augment the bilateral preferential trade agreement under the Global System of Trade Preferences between India and Iran that has been in the pipeline for some years by facilitating connectivity.\nIndia’s exports to Russia in 2021-22 stood at USD 3.25bn while imports were USD 9.87 bn. Major items of export from India include electrical machinery, pharmaceuticals, organic chemicals, iron and steel, apparel, tea, coffee, and vehicle spare parts. Major items of import from Russia include defence equipment, mineral resources, precious stones and metals, nuclear power equipment, fertilizers, electrical machinery, articles of steel, and inorganic chemicals.\nThe development of this corridor can prove to strengthen the bilateral trade ties between India and Russia, especially with the deterioration of Russia’s relations with Western countries. Currently, India exports mainly primary goods and lower-end manufactured goods to Russia. A deepening of trade relations in the wake of the Ukraine-Russia conflict may provide the opportunity for India to be the exporter of some of the higher value-added goods like aircraft, spacecraft, and electrical machinery, that were earlier imported from the U.S. and Europe.\nIn the past, the trade volumes between India and Russia had seen a considerable fall, which mostly accounts for the lack of knowledge on the demand in both the economies and the logistical complexities. Though the mere development of this corridor cannot guarantee an acceleration of inter-regional trade, the development of infrastructure in the markets is expected to amplify demand and lead to growth.\nThe progress of INSTC will also lead to the development of Iran and Azerbaijan as transit hubs and has the potential to lead to a multi-fold increase in trade by expanding it to the Baltic, Nordic and Arctic regions.\nObstacles to the development\nAlthough the construction of the route is underway, the growth is slow due to several geo-political and technical reasons. The infrastructure development is moving slowly because of a lack of political will and long-term financing strategy. The different members of the convention are characterised by their own different legal regimes and transport laws that are not consistent with each other. Along with that, there remain other areas of lacunae like the security of cargo, insurance coverage, regulatory bureaucracy etc.\nCurrently, the building up of political and religious tensions between India and the trilateral alliance among Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey may significantly impact the development and operations of INSTC. Pakistan and Azerbaijan share a very strong military cooperation with each other. The former also helped Azerbaijan in its military advancements against Armenia. Thus, Azerbaijan is inclined to assist Pakistan, along with Turkey fuelled by religious sentiments, in its war against India for the Indian State of Kashmir. India on the other hand has maintained cordial relations with Armenia over the decades. With all these countries (except Pakistan), being a member of the INSTC arrangement, political unrest and terrorism-led activities can pose a great threat to the trade taking place through this route. This tension can further be augmented with an expected intervention from China which already maintains a contentious relationship with India. However, the development of the corridor could also be a channel to ease such political tensions given all the member countries are collaboratively working to develop the route and its infrastructure indicating the priority they accord to commercial growth. Increased trade among the member states can bring about cordial relations and may even augment the possibility of the development of a new regional block.\nApart from that, a big challenge facing the development of the INSTC is the ongoing political tension between the US and Iran to deter the development of nuclear weapons by Iran. With the US currently holding a dominant position in the financial market, the negative effects faced by Iran in the form of sanctions also impacted the growth of INSTC. Although Europe and other Asian countries have devised means like Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) and Asian Clearing Union (ACU) to trade with Iran to skirt the sanctions, political uncertainties may cause disruption to the operationality of the corridor.\nImpact on Indian Private Sector and Corporates\nThe development and operations of the INSTC will also benefit the private sector of India. With Asia now projected to account for 66% of the global middle class possessing significant purchasing power, the entry into the new markets, that will be provided by the INSTC routes, is expected to benefit the private players in India. The Indian firms engaged in the production of primary goods in the agriculture sector, textiles, organic chemicals etc. can greatly benefit from this advancement. Not only the manufacturers but the cost savings through the shorter route can bring down the transportation costs of the products and make them more competitive in the market which will eventually lower the costs for the retailers and the consumers as well.\nIndia is one of the major importers of crude oil and edible oil, importing about 70% of its total consumption of Sunflower oil from Ukraine and 20% from Russia. With the geo-political constraints imposed by the Ukraine-Russia war and consequent hike in prices, this commercially cheaper route of transportation provided by INSTC will lead to a lowering of import costs of edible oils like sunflower oil. This will lead to significant cost savings for the Indian corporates importing the same from Ukraine by substituting the exporting country and shipping routes.\nThis development is likely to benefit conglomerates in the primary goods industry and the port and the marine infrastructure development industry. Apart from that, there are also prospective opportunities for developing the transit corridor into a development corridor with industrial parks and special economic zones to add commercial value to INSTC. Such a development would lead to the building of local logistical hubs at locations like Nagpur and Bhiwandi in Maharashtra. Indian firms that already possess expertise and presence in the domain and the location can utilise this opportunity for the development of infrastructure facilities in Mumbai- the south trail of the corridor.\nEven though overland transport routes over a more time-efficient delivery, the shipping liners trump this mode by offering cheap rates particularly due to less demand. With India now focusing on improving its logistics sector with a well-defined policy aiming to develop a logistics hub, it seeks on attracting public-private-partnership. The policy also specifies a more focused approach towards the development of railway and waterway transport. This could serve as a rewarding opportunity for the Big Indian conglomerates in the logistics sector to engage with the government in changing the logistics scenario of the country.\nConclusion-Opportunities of INSTC\nWith India now flagging a digital multimodal TIR with Iran to facilitate seamless movement of goods, trade would further be pushed to INSTC. INSTC can become operational at a crucial time in the geo-political scenario. It can put India at a great advantage to utilize its trade opportunities with Iran and Russia and gain access to Europe and Central Asia along the same. The INSTC route will also allow India to bypass Pakistan, which is infamous for having contentious relations with the country. This will open new markets for Indian exports and Indian producers as well as provide a diverse consumer base for the exports of these engaging countries. With the development of infrastructure, many Indian companies would find themselves inclined to exploit the logistical facilities. On the international front, this would greatly facilitate the upcoming bilateral and preferential trade agreements between India and the CIS countries. India has also framed a Comprehensive Logistics Action Plan (CLAP) to revive its logistics sector under the Draft National Logistics Policy. India’s vision for making its logistics sector more time and cost-efficient is greatly aligned with the development of this project. The well-defined action areas under CLAP will resolve the connectivity issues that had obstructed India’s trade with these countries in the past. With increased digitalization and the proposed development of logistics parks under the Master Plan, the NLP will give a boost to this sector.\nPursuing the INSTC project is a good opportunity for India to also establish better political relations with Iran and Russia, especially in the wake of the changing political scenarios in Afghanistan and Russia. In fact, as suggested by the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, the members of the convention can develop an independent document like the TIR to develop the same comfort of seamless documentation among each other. India can take the initiative to come up with a format and get other countries on board to build a more efficient and speedy movement of transport.\nGiven the overall uncertain global political landscape, operating through this corridor is even more important with the slow economic recovery of India’s Western partners. Not only India, but INSTC is also a collaborative attempt by Iran and Russia to take advantage of a more commercially feasible trade route and exploit emerging regional trade opportunities.\nHowever, currently, the INSTC development is slow because of the geopolitical unrest in the region with Afghanistan taken over by the Taliban, Russia at a war with Ukraine, Pakistan-Azerbaijan-Turkey forming a potential alliance against India and Armenia. The benefits of the project are ample, but the effect of the obstructions is grave. Therefore, the member countries have to collaboratively come forward to mitigate the challenges and expedite the development of this route to be able to fructify all the envisioned gains.\nAuthored by: Surbhi Sharma, Antara Mukherjee and Arnab Roy\n David Rogers, “Iran’s railway revolution,” Global Construction Review, December 14, 2015, http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/markets/howislamic-republic-set-become-land-br8i8d8ge/\n Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n TIR is a global transit system that allows seamless movement of goods across countries through a coordinated and mutually recognized system of customs which helps cut cost and time of transit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:85c7f32e-6ea8-45f3-9c8d-49493eceecb2>","<urn:uuid:4b040191-c843-41c3-8c58-9b6c429741b6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Is winning by default possible in both Line Dice and Spades?","answer":"In Line Dice, you can win by default by being the last player remaining even if you have no playable moves left. In Spades, there is no winning by default mechanism - you must reach 500 points to win, or in tournament play, accumulate the predetermined number of wins.","context":["Thank you for purchasing Line Dice, a quick and simple dice game for 2 to 6 players, ages 5 and up. The Line Dice is a winding, single, unbroken path you follow until you can't go any further. If you can't play on your turn, you lose. The last player to continue on the path is the winner. Beginning a game:\nFirst dividing up all of the dice evenly amongst all the players:\n2 Players = 18 Dice each\n3 Players = 12 Dice each\n4 Players = 9 Dice each\n5 Players = 7 Dice each - (Roll the remaining die and it becomes the First Move)\n6 Players = 6 Dice each\nFor a quick match, try limiting the number of dice to 10 for each player.\nEach player shakes up their dice and rolls them publicly. This determines the moves available to each player. Once rolled, the dice can not be re-rolled! If you can not play any of your rolled moves, you lose. You can hide your dice after the roll to prevent other players from strategizing your moves.\nThere are 3 types of Dice Faces:\nThe Straight Line:\nThe Cross piece is like an Overpass on a Freeway. It's not a 4-Way Stop. Those 2 sections of road do NOT directly connect.\nAnd 4 Corners:\nThe Corners are differentiated from each other by an Arrow in one corner of the each face. This shows you the direction the Corner must face during gameplay. Each player should take a moment to align all of the Corners rolled so the Arrows all face the same direction. It helps to keep the game moving smoothly.\nPick who goes first: Paper-Scissors-Rock, Flip a Coin, or Oldest goes first.\nThe First player can play any dice they like. I use a Cross the for example, but any piece (Straight, Corner, or Cross) can be used. Place the dice in the center of the table to allow the most room to build off of.\nThe Corner Arrows:\nWhen the first Corner is played, the direction of all further Corner Arrows MUST face the same direction. After the first Corner piece is played, all players are encouraged turn their Corner dice so all of the arrows face the same direction as the first Corner played. Once turned, it's easier to plan your moves. Experienced players also tend to group Corners by Arrow direction, so they can plan out their moves better.\nPath of Travel:\nThe second dice placed determines the Path of Travel. You are always moving FORWARD at all times, never backwards. Think of the Path of Travel like a car hurdling down a highway. The first dice is where it started, and the second dice shows you the direction on the Road you are heading. The dice after that continues the road. The Road can only continue forward, NEVER back! When you come to Cross piece, you treat it like an overpass. You continue either over or under the perpendicular road, but can NEVER turn Right or Left onto it. Like an Overpass, the Cross piece contains 2 completely separate roads that never touch each other.\nRemember: At NO TIME can you turn around and use the other end of the road! You must continue forward until you, or the other players, run out of usable Road.\nDon't confuse the Path of Travel with the Arrows on the Corners, which exist only to give you can idea of which way each Corner should face. You can travel against Arrows or with them, but you can ONLY move forward every move.\nEach player adds one dice to the front of the Road, then passes turn to the player on their Left.\nHere's an example of 3 Players, each playing one dice, during each of their first turns:\nThe first player plays a Cross, so the direction of all Corners is unknown, as is the Path of Travel.\nThe second player plays a straight line. By playing the line on the Right, the second player has established the Path of Travel, demonstrated here in green. All further moves have to continue in the direction set by the second player. The direction of all Corners is still unset.\nThe third player finally plays a Corner, and now all future Corners played have to be rotated so their arrows all face in the same direction. As you can see by the last green pointer, the next piece has to be played at the top of Player 3's Corner, continuing the Line upwards.\nHere's an example of how that game might continue to be played. As you can see, the Arrows on all of the Corners are facing Down, because the first Corner to be played had it's Arrow facing Down. The 6th move is the 2nd Cross, which is eventually passed through again after the 9th move. Following the 9th move, 10th move appears again on the other side of the 2nd Cross. The 11th move is the 3rd Cross. The Road loops around again, eventually diving through the 3rd Cross and appearing with the 15th move on the other side. This example stops with the 16th move, which would have forced the 17th move to dived under the 1st Cross, and appeared at the bottom it to continue the game.\nAll Lines must remain \"True\". You can not play a Cross Dice adjacent to a non-connecting Straight or Corner piece, nor can you “dead-end” a Corner or Straight piece into the edge of an unsupported die. True Line Examples:\nMost IMPORTANT: If you don't have a move to play, you LOSE! No passing turn, you either have something to play your turn or you're out.\nLast Man Standing:\nIf you are the last player, even if you don't have any playable moves left, you are still the Winner by Default.\nSabotaging the Board:\nYou can win by making it impossible for any other player to play any dice. Because everyone else loses before the turn returns to you, you Win by being the Last Loser.\nYou can also win the game by forcing the very next player to play a move that connects the line back to the starting move of the game, effectively making an infinite loop and destroying the game. When an infinite Line is made, the player BEFORE the player that made the infinite path is the winner, not the player who made the infinite Line. If I make you form an Infinity, I win, not you.\nLet's assume you've run out of legitimate moves and you're about to lose the game. You can *attempt* to put in a corner dice facing the wrong way. If the next player plays a dice without calling out your bluff, then your wrong facing corner becomes a legitimate move. We like to consider it \"Honest Cheating\". If you get called out for your misplaced dice before the next player plays, punishment is recommended.\nGame Winning Strategies:\nSince these have large animated GIF's showing how to do them, I've moved this section to it's own set of Subpages:\nThe Corner Gap Trap Strategy\nOthers soon to come!\n(Do you know of some? Be a good egg and share your tips with the world. Otherwise we'll all get mad and stop playing with you!)\nBack to the Main Page","Rules for Spades: Four Player Spades Partnership\nFour players play the game, with partners sitting opposite each other.\nA standard deck of 52 cards is used which has 4 suits: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds. The ranks are Ace being high card in each suit, then King, Queen, Jack, 10 and so forth, with the 2 being the lowest. Spades are always Trump, meaning they are considered higher than any other suit. Thus, a 2 of Spades outranks an Ace of Hearts. The Bids and Scores (explained below) are usually wrote down on paper.\nThe first dealer may be chosen at random by laying out 4 cards with 1 card being an Ace. Each player then draws a card. The player who draws the Ace is the dealer who then shuffles the cards before the deal. Note: this step is skipped in the app with the dealer being chosen at random. The dealer then deals a card to each player face down, starting with the player to the dealer’s left and continuing clockwise until each player has 13 cards. Players may look at their hand at any time. However, there are times when a player may choose not to look at their cards. This is explained more in bidding.\nDuring a typical round, each player will play one card from their hand. The highest card played wins that round. This is called a “trick”, some players call it a book. The pirates call them marks. There is a maximum of 13 tricks that can be captured. Bidding consists of looking over your hand and determining how many “tricks” you believe you can capture in this way.\nEach player may examine the cards dealt to them at any time. This is your “hand” of cards. The player to the dealer’s left starts the bidding. Aces are usually sure bids, and Kings can most times be taken. Queens rarely take a trick. Players also bid on the trumps that are in their hand. If you have the Ace of Spades, it is a guaranteed trick. The potential of other trumps to take a trick depends on their rank and the number of cards you have in each suit. For example; if you have only two Hearts, then there is a good chance that you will be able to trump Hearts early and win a trick that way.\nWhen all players have bid, the partners combine their bids to form their “contract” for that round. Their contract is the minimum number of tricks they need to capture that round. Each partner can cover the other partner’s bid. For example; if both partners bid three and one partner captured only two, but the other partner captured at least four, then the partner has covered the bid and they have competed their contract.\nIf your hand is void in high ranking cards, or you have enough low cards to cover your high cards you may consider bidding a Nil, which means you must not take a single trick. Nil bidders can rely on their partners to cover them, meaning the Nil bidder's partner must take any trick that would be captured by the Nil bid player. If the round ends and the Nil bidder has not taken a trick, then the Nil bid was successful.\nIf a player does not look at their cards, they may bid a Blind Nil on their turn to bid. This then plays the same as the Nil Bids above, except a successful Blind Nil will double its scoring value. The dealer has an advantage when considering a Blind Nil as they can see how many tricks that are not bid on.\nThe player to the dealer’s left starts the round and then play follows clockwise. That player must choose 1 card from their hand to play. The suit of the first card played is considered the lead suit. Spades may not be led until they are “broken” (explained below). Each other player must then play a card of the same lead suit. The is called “following suit”. The highest card played of the lead suit wins the trick. The winner then collects the cards and stacks them neatly next to themselves. This helps them remember how many tricks they have captured. The winner of the trick is the first to play a card for the next round. Play continues until all 13 tricks have been captured.\nIf a player cannot follow suit, they may play any card in their hand. The first time a Spade is played in this way, breaks Spades, and the trick is considered trumped. Other players must still follow suit, but if they are unable to do so, they may play any card in their hand as well. In a trumped trick, the highest Spade played wins the trick. Any player may lead a Spade once they are broken.\nIf a partnership captures more tricks than they bid these are considered bags or overtricks. These accumulate over the course of the game. In a standard game, once a partnership has accumulated 10 or more bags, they are “bagged out” and are penalized or set back 100 points. After a bag out, bags are then reset to 0.\nIf a partnership completed their contract, they score 10 times their bid. If a partnership failed to compete their contract, they are penalized or set back 10 times their bid. Nils have a bonus of 100 points and Blind Nils have a bonus of 200 points, if the contract is complete. If a Nil fails, the partnership is penalized its value. If the partner of a Nil completed their bid, then the partnership scores 10 times that player’s bid. For example; the partnership failed their Nil bid and is penalized 100 points, however, the one partner made their bid of 3 so they score 30 points, which means the partnership is penalized 70 points instead of the full 100. Also, if a Nil bid was successful but the partner failed to get their bid, the players would still gain the 100 points for the Nil minus 10 times the partners bid.\nAfter scoring, if there is no winner a new hand is shuffled and dealt with the player to the dealer’s left being the new dealer.\nA typical game is played to 500 points. When any team has 500 or more points the team with the highest score wins. If there is a tie, in standard Spades the team with the most bags wins. However, the pirates rule that the partnership with the lowest number of bags has played the best and are therefore the winners.\nIn tournament play each partnership keeps track of their wins. The first partnership to accumulate the predetermined number of wins is the tourney winner."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a44647bc-8b9b-43e2-8ef9-5ea4ff94dd61>","<urn:uuid:8403602b-ca54-4290-bbda-53a05e4b1649>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the relationship between grass pollen allergies and food reactions? Could you explain how these cross-reactions work in detail?","answer":"The allergenic components of grass pollen share similarities with several foods, leading to cross-reactions. Specifically, people allergic to grass pollen may experience reactions to melons, oranges, kiwi, tomatoes, and peanuts. This occurs because these foods contain proteins that are structurally similar to those found in grass pollen. When someone who is allergic to grass pollen consumes these foods, their immune system may recognize the similar proteins and trigger an allergic response.","context":["Oral Allergy Syndrome: Why do Pollens and Foods Cross-React?\nIf trees make you sneeze, they may also make you react to certain fruits and vegetables.\nAllergic Living explores the science behind oral allergy syndrome, nature’s allergic double whammy.\nNot only do a third of North Americans battle hay fever – with runny noses, sinus and eye symptoms – but for a significant proportion of allergy sufferers, the spring bloom is just the start of their allergy woes. Dr. Antony Ham Pong, a Canadian allergist and researcher, estimates that up to 10 per cent of the general population has a condition called oral allergy syndrome, or OAS.\nIt’s a less severe form of food allergy, directly related to pollen reactions, that’s known to set off tingling and unpleasant itching in the mouth, throat and lips. Reactions are caused by a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and even spices; all of which share allergenic proteins with specific hay fever-causing trees and plants.\n“It’s not considered a life-threatening allergy,” says Ham Pong, the author of several articles educating patients and doctors about oral allergy syndrome. “But it’s actually more common than peanut, milk, egg, and fish allergy.”\nTwo of the biggest cross-reaction offenders are birch and alder trees. Depending on where you live, anywhere from 20 to 70 per cent of people who are allergic to birch and alder pollens will also have oral allergy syndrome.\nHam Pong estimates about one-third of birch-allergic North Americans are affected, but the incidence of oral allergy syndrome is even higher in some European countries. Although OAS is relatively common, he doesn’t think it is increasing, at least not in North America. Rather, doctors have become better at spotting this condition.\nBut how can a tall, skinny tree that gives you the sniffles cause an itchy mouth if you chew on a celery stick or bite into an apple?\nHow the immune system gets confused\nUnfortunately for those with tree-pollen allergies, the pollen proteins that trigger hay fever symptoms are also found in a several foods.\nThe components of those proteins are well conserved among different plants, which means their three-dimensional structures are so similar that some of our immune systems can’t tell the difference between, say, birch pollen and apple peel.\nIn birch, the most common allergy troublemaker is a protein called Bet v 1, and alder has a similar protein called Aln g 1. Their purpose is to help protect the fruit or vegetable in times of stress or from infection.\nHam Pong explains that Bet v 1 is called a “pan-allergen” because very similar proteins are found in a variety of unrelated plants, including apples, plums, kiwis, carrots, celery, potatoes, hazelnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, and even spices such as oregano, basil and dill.\nPeople with birch-related oral allergy syndrome already produce antibodies to the pan-allergens from their prior exposure to birch pollen, so those antibodies will try to protect against similar proteins when they enter the mouth.\nPan-allergen relationships don’t stop with birch trees. The allergenic components of grass pollen are also shared with melons, oranges, kiwi, tomatoes and peanuts, among others.\nFor those reactive to ragweed, serious cross-reactions are also possible from consuming chamomile, honey and echinacea. This is not oral allergy syndrome, however. In this case, it’s because they belong to the same botanical family.\nApples and Peaches and Oral Allergy\nThe better news for spring is that although trees such as maple, oak and poplar produce allergenic pollens, they don’t share reaction-causing proteins with foods. Nor does having allergies to birch, alder, grass or ragweed mean you’ll necessarily cross-react with the implicated foods.\nAnd, if you do react, you may not be allergic to every food on the list.\nSome fruits and vegetables, however, are more troublesome. Apples, for instance, more often trigger oral allergy syndrome than pears. According to Japanese research, in the plum family, cherries and peaches are more likely to irritate than apricots and plums.\nIt may even depend on which variety of the fruit you eat. European studies, for example, have found that gala and golden delicious apples have higher levels of allergenic proteins than Braeburn or Santana apples, and are more likely to cause reactions.\nNext: Allergic Reactions Beyond the Spring"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b1881422-de8c-4c32-841d-b0aa32a9255f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the energy-saving benefits of cool roofs vs green roofs in table format?","answer":"Here's a comparison of energy-saving benefits:\\nCool Roofs:\\n- Decrease necessity for artificial cooling, saving up to 10% on energy costs\\n- Absorb less heat through light/reflective surfaces\\n- Minimize heat transfer to building interior\\n\\nGreen Roofs:\\n- Minimize heat transfer through plant shading and growing medium\\n- Create cooling effect through soil moisture build-up\\n- Improve thermal performance and reduce fuel costs through insulation\\n- Can prevent overheating of solar panels if installed","context":["By Jason Godfrey, General Manager, Safesite Ltd\nToday’s requirement for more sustainable planning and construction has seen an increase in the demand for green roofs with both government and local authorities actively encouraging such developments, particularly in urban areas.\nWhy are Green Roofs Popular?\nThe benefits of this technology are substantial. As well as being aesthetically pleasing and a cost effective means of enhancing biodiversity, green roofs also have the benefits of increasing the life expectancy of the roof membrane, protecting it from UV degradation and weather damage, reducing rainwater run off which prevents localised flooding and improving air quality by converting CO2 to oxygen and removing airborne pollutants. Their greater thermal mass also has a positive impact on a building’s energy consumption by improving its thermal performance, reducing fuel costs by insulating and/or cooling the building\nSo when you take all this into consideration, it’s easy to see why the demand for sustainable construction has grown and we’re seeing an increase in green roofs, particularly in cities where these roofs are seen as an important part of combating the effects of climate change.\nSafe Maintenance of Green Roofs\nThere is however, a common misconception that green roofs are self-sustaining so do not require maintenance. This is not the case, green roofs require maintenance at least twice a year, which according to the HSE is frequent activity. In addition to maintenance of the vegetation such as removing weeds or replacing dead plants, drain outlets and fire breaks must be checked, components such as flashings, mastic and roofing membrane inspected, rooflights cleaned, photovoltaic panels maintained and general rubbish removed from the roof.\nIt’s essential that these maintenance requirements are planned for at the design stage and, as is legally required, provision made for fall protection systems so that work can be carried out safely. When considering a safety system, the general rule is for collective measures such as guardrails to be the first priority, especially when many of those accessing the roof will have limited experience and training when it comes to working at height. As this photograph shows, guardrails need not detract from the aesthetics of the green roof, powder coating in a colour that blends in with the environment can help to enhance it.\nThere will be occasions however, such as for technical or design reasons where collective measures are not suitable. In these cases, fall restraint or fall arrest systems such as roof anchors and lifelines provide an ideal solution. Lifelines allow the user continual handsfree protection along the length of the system without the need to detach while roof anchors can be used as a single unit or as a series of anchors linked together via a horizontal lifeline to provide user protection. Whenever possible these systems should be used as fall restraint which prevents the user from reaching the leading edge. If work does need to be carried out in an area where a fall is possible, then fall arrest protection will be required and the user must then have appropriate training on both the equipment and rescue.\nGrowing Demand for Green Roofs\nWith demand increasing for environmentally and ecologically friendly construction methods, the popularity of green roofs will undoubtedly grow. As with any form of work at height, safety on green roofs must not be overlooked. By considering safety at the design stage, fall protection systems can be installed before planting, allowing the green roof to grow ‘around’ the system. This makes it less obtrusive but still ensures that the roof and equipment on the roof can be maintained in complete safety","THE COOL ROOF AND THE GREEN ROOF\nThere are two main types of environmentally friendly roof treatments i.e the cool roof and the green roof.\nCool roofing is an easy and cost-efficient, environmentally friendly finishing technique that can be considered by all prospective home and building owners in order to minimise energy use. It calls for either the cladding of rooftop surfaces in high solar reflective materials or the painting of this in light, bright colours, such as white which means of cutting energy consumption.\nBENEFITS OF COOL ROOFING\nThe concept is as simple as wearing a white shirt on a hot day. Your roof can get up to 50 degrees hotter than external temperatures. Light, or reflective surfaces, absorb less heat and therefore minimise heat transfer to the underlying slab of the roof and subsequently into the building’s interior.\nAchieving this means:\n- decreased necessity for artificial cooling which can save up to 10 percent on energy costs\n- increased indoor comfort through creating a cooler environment\n- decreased roof maintenance costs due to longer roof lifespan\n- inexpensive material and installation costs\nENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF COOL ROOFING\nAside from user-specific benefits, cool roofing can also play a role in improving overall environmental conditions in more urban areas. Dark pavements and roof surfaces in more developed areas can contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through creating an increased platform for heat absorption and subsequently energy consumption, leading to greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. This phenomenon is referred to as the ’heat island effect’, which causes these areas to release accumulated heat back into the atmosphere and cause up to a 5-degree temperature rise in comparison to less urban areas.\nExtensive use of cool roofing city/island wide could manifest environmental benefits such as:\n- improved air quality\n- a cooler urban environment\n- reduced greenhouse gas emissions\nGREEN ROOFS IN TROPICAL CLIMATES\nA green roof or living roof involves completely covering the top exterior level of a building with vegetation and growing medium. Traditionally, these are known for their ability to better insulate homes in temperate climates, providing a warmer indoor environment. However, these can also be utilised to serve various purposes in tropical climates.\nThe average underlying system consists of:\n- roofing waterproofing membrane\n- root barrier\n- air barrier\n- water retention mat\n- drainage/water storage/ aeration\n- filter fabric\nGREEN ROOF BENEFITS\nGreen roofs help minimise heat transfer into building interiors through the shading provided by its plants and associated growing medium which helps block sunlight from reaching underlying roof membranes. This occurs alongside a cooling effect achieved through moisture build up in the soil. On hot summer days, this makes a green roof cooler than the surrounding air temperature. Local landscape architect Andre Kelshall believes green roofs reap a multitude of benefits if properly designed and installed; stating that this roofing type could be particularly efficient for developers by ensuring a cut in energy consumption by tenants, thus ultimately lowering utility bills. He also concurs that the build-up of layers involved in the system could put homeowners in the Caribbean at an advantage when it comes to flooding and water mitigation. Installation costs can run between $90.00 – $150.00 BBDS per square foot. If wanting to opt for a less pricey, lower maintenance system, he recommends the use of turf instead of grass, as this can be engineered to grow at a slower rate.\nPerformance advantages of green roofs in the Caribbean include:\n- cooler building interiors\n- stormwater mitigation\n- lengthening the life of the roof waterproofing membrane by two to three times\n- increase indoor comfort by diminishing stress associated with heat waves\n- noise reduction\n- create an aesthetically pleasing or recreational roof landscape\n- increased property value\n- can prevent the overheating of solar panels if installed\n- long-term cost efficiency\nENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF GREEN ROOFS\nGreen roofs are capable of reducing surrounding temperatures by a process which releases moisture into the air known as evapotranspiration. Vegetation naturally removes air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration and storage (the absorption and storage of carbon with immediate potential to become a CO2 gas) as well as through the reduction of energy demand and production.\nSuch factors aid the environment by:\n- minimising heat island effect\n- diminishing air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions\n- supporting habitat provisioning and biodiversity\n- reclaiming land excavated from buildings footprint\nAndre Kelshall, Design, [www.dla.design.com]\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency, ‘Using Green Roofs to Reduce Heat Islands’, epa.gov, [https://www.epa.gov/heat-islands/using-green-roofs-reduce-heat-islands]\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency, ‘Reducing Urban Heat Islands: Compendium of Strategies ’, epa.gov, [https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-05/documents/reducing_urban_heat_islands_ch_3.pdf]\nCool Roof Rating Council, ‘Why Cool Roofs are Way Cool’, coolroofs.org, [http://coolroofs.org/documents/IndirectBenefitsofCoolRoofs-WhyCRareWayCool_000.pdf]\nEnergy Saver, ‘Cool Roofs’, energy.gov, [https://energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-home-design/cool-roofs]"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c404e031-660c-4dcf-b8e2-85bfa0886b00>","<urn:uuid:67435366-3a60-4769-8b1b-17eac0d76b71>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What should I consider before getting a pet, and what steps should I take if my pet eats toxic foods?","answer":"Before getting a pet, consider factors like the animal's lifespan, dietary needs, exercise requirements, size at maturity, veterinary costs, habitat needs, and whether your living situation allows pets. Also consider if there are young children, elderly people, or immunocompromised individuals in the household. If your pet consumes toxic foods like chocolate or sultanas, seek immediate veterinary attention. For chocolate ingestion, treatment may take up to three days, while sultana consumption requires either removal from the system or kidney support if injury signs appear. Prevention is better than treatment, but prompt veterinary care is essential if exposure occurs.","context":["Pet owners warned over toxic Easter treats March 23, 2016 Chocolates and the sultanas in hot cross buns can be dangerous for pets Hot cross buns and chocolate may be sweet treats for humans, but experts warn that Easter is a deadly time for pets. Jill Griffiths from Murdoch University Veterinary Hospital (MUVH) warned pet owners to remember that cocoa and dark chocolate were extremely dangerous for pets, with the sultanas in hot cross buns possibly leading to kidney failure. “Chocolate is very toxic to dogs – they are at least 3 times as sensitive to the toxic compounds in it as humans, meaning they do not need to eat much to become very sick,” said Dr Jill Griffiths from the MUVH. “Chocolate toxicity starts with vomiting, diarrhoea, a pounding heart beat and agitation, then progress through tremors, twitches and collapse to seizures and potentially death. “It can take dogs and cats take a long time to detoxify after consuming stimulants such as caffeine, with treatment taking up to three days.” Obviously prevention is better than treatment, but if your pet manages to over indulge on delicious Easter treats, MUVH veterinary doctors recommend you take them to a vet as soon as possible. “Hot cross buns slathered in butter are a traditional and delicious start to the day. However, sultanas have been associated with kidney failure in dogs, so best not to let your dog eat the leftovers,” continued Dr Griffiths. “If your pet has eaten sultanas or grapes, veterinary attention is recommended to either try to remove the grapes or sultanas from their system or to provide support to the kidneys if they are showing signs of injury.” Many people go away over Easter, leaving their animals in the care of friends or family. With animals susceptible to health dangers over the Easter period, Dr Griffiths highlighted the importance for pet owners to discuss what pet sitters should do in the event pets require emergency lifesaving surgery. “It is important that the people who are looking after your pet know your wishes regarding treatment for your pet, especially if you are not contactable at all times,” she said. “Unfortunately, this is a situation we see in the Emergency Room all too often, and if your pet sitter doesn’t know what you want for your pet, it can mean significant delays to instituting optimal treatment. “Clear communication and setting expectations and limits in advance are very important here, and mean that your pet can get the appropriate treatment.” Murdoch Pet Emergency Care is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and staff are always available should you have any concerns about your pet. MPEC can be contacted on 1300 652 494. If you are not contactable, please ensure you have discussed the following with your pet sitter: Written permission for your pet sitters to authorise emergency lifesaving surgery if needed Discuss who will pay the deposit for treatment (these are needed at the time of admission) How much will you spend on your pet Authority for your pet sitter to make the decision regarding euthanasia Consider leaving an emergency fund for your pet sitter to access Print This Post Media contact: Luke McManus Tel: (08) 9360 2491 | Mobile: 0400 297 221 | Email: L.McManus@murdoch.edu.au Categories: General Tags: chocolate, chocolate toxicity, dog kidney problems, dr jill griffiths, easter, hot cross buns, mpec, murdoch university veterinary hospital, muvh, pet dangers, toxic treats Leave a comment Name (required) Mail (will not be published) (required) Website You can use these tags : <a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <s> <strike> <strong> We read every comment and will make every effort to approve each new comment within one working day.

They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. Most households in the United States have at least one pet.\nStudies have shown that the bond between people and their pets can increase fitness, lower stress, and bring happiness to their owners. Some of the health benefits of having a pet include:\n- Decreased blood pressure\n- Decreased cholesterol levels\n- Decreased triglyceride levels\n- Decreased feelings of loneliness\n- Increased opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities\n- Increased opportunities for socialization\nHowever, pets can sometimes carry harmful germs that can make us sick even when the pet appears healthy. The diseases people get from animals are called zoonotic (zoe-oh-NOT-ic) diseases. Below are some tips to help you and your family stay healthy while enjoying pets.\nPick the Right Pet\nBefore adopting a new pet, make sure that it is the right one for you and your family. Do some research beforehand about the specific needs of the animal. Ask yourself these questions before getting a pet:\n- How long will this animal live?\n- What does the pet eat?\n- How much exercise does the pet need?\n- How large will it become?\n- How much will it cost for veterinary care?\n- Do I have enough time to properly care for and clean up after the pet?\n- What type of habitat does this pet need to be healthy?\n- What type of exercise does this pet need?\n- Are pets allowed in my house, apartment, or condominium?\n- Are there young children, older people, or people with weak immune systems who will care for or be around the pet?\nChildren 5 years of age and younger, people with weakened immune systems, and people 65 years of age and older are more likely to get diseases spread between animals and people (also known as zoonotic diseases). Pregnant women are also at a higher risk for certain animal-related diseases. Before getting a new pet, keep the following in mind:\n- Households with children 5 years of age and younger should not have pet reptiles (turtles, lizards, snakes), amphibians (frogs, toads), or backyard poultry because of the risk of serious illness from harmful germs spread between these animals and young children.\n- People with weakened immune systems should take extra precautions when choosing and handling pets. Talk to your veterinarian for help picking the best pet.\n- Pregnant women should avoid adopting a new cat or handling stray cats, especially kittens. Cats can carry a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis—a disease that can cause birth defects. If you are pregnant, you do not need to give up your current cat, but you should avoid changing cat litter.\n- Pregnant women should avoid contact with pet rodents to prevent exposure to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which can cause birth defects. If you’re pregnant and have a pet rodent, avoid direct contact and have someone else clean its habitat.\nStay Healthy Around Pets\nWash Your Hands\nWhether you are playing with, feeding, or cleaning up after your pet, it is important to wash your hands to help reduce the risk of getting sick from germs pets can carry. If you or a family member are concerned about illness, talk to a doctor and mention the animals you’ve had contact with recently.\nAlways wash hands:\n- After touching or playing with your pet\n- After feeding your pet or handling pet food\n- After handling pet habitats or equipment (cages, tanks, toys, food and water dishes, etc.)\n- After cleaning up after pets\n- After leaving areas where animals live (coops, barns, stalls, etc.), even if you did not touch an animal\n- Before eating and drinking\n- Before preparing food or drinks\n- After removing soiled clothes or shoes\nRunning water and soap are best for hand washing, but you can use hand sanitizer until running water and soap are available. Adults should always assist young children with hand washing.\nKeep Your Pet Healthy\nWhether you have a dog, cat, horse, parakeet, gerbil, bearded dragon, or other fun pet, providing regular, life-long veterinary care is important for keeping your pet and family healthy. Regular veterinary visits are essential to good pet health. Talk to your pet’s veterinarian about how to keep your pet healthy. Provide your pet with a good diet, fresh water, clean bedding, and plenty of exercise. Keep up with your pet’s vaccines, deworming, and flea and tick control. Some pets can carry ticks that can spread serious diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever to people. In areas with plague—including some rural areas in the western US—fleas can be a risk to both animals and their owners.\nBy keeping your pet healthy, you help to keep yourself and your family healthy. Contact your veterinarian if you have any questions about your pet’s health or if you think your pet may be sick.\nPractice Good Pet Hygiene\nIn addition to hand washing, practicing good pet hygiene can help prevent the spread of germs between pets and people. Keep pets and their supplies out of the kitchen, and disinfect pet habitats and supplies outside the house when possible. Never clean supplies in the kitchen sink, food preparation areas, or the bathroom sink. Pets can contaminate surfaces in your home with germs—you don’t have touch pets to get sick from their germs.\nAlways remove your dog’s feces (poop) from your yard and public places by using a bag, and dispose of it in proper areas. Dog and cat poop can contain parasites and germs that can be harmful to people. Keep children away from areas that might contain dog or cat poop to prevent them from getting roundworms and hookworms. Cover sand boxes so cats don’t use them as a litter box. Clean the cat’s litter box daily to lower the chances of exposure to harmful parasites. Remember, pregnant women should avoid changing a cat’s litter box if possible.\nTeach Children How to Interact with Animals\nPets can teach children compassion and responsibility. However, children 5 years of age and younger should be supervised while interacting with animals to ensure the safety of the child and the pet. Teach children to wash their hands right after playing with animals or anything in the animals’ environment (cages, beds, food or water dishes). Don’t let children kiss pets or put their hands or other objects in their mouths after handling animals.\nAdults should supervise and be extra cautious when children 5 years of age and younger have direct contact with farm animals, including animals at petting zoos and fairs.\nKeep Wildlife Wild\nAlthough they may look cute and cuddly, avoid touching wild animals to reduce the risk of illness and injury. Don’t encourage wild animals such as raccoons, prairie dogs, or wild rodents to come into your home by feeding them. You might find a young animal that appears to be abandoned and want to rescue it, but often its parent is close by. If you are concerned about the safety of a wild animal, contact a local wildlife rehabilitation facility\n- 4 Tips to Stay Healthy Around Your Pet: CDC’s Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh provides 4 simple ways to stay healthy around your pets.\n- Power of the Pet: Pets Enrich Our Lives Externalexternal icon: CDC’s Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh discusses how to pick the right pet for your family"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6a80bd04-513f-4fd9-a5be-e5c4d1bba43d>","<urn:uuid:e030b9c7-d8a2-4029-8ede-ce5e088ffdea>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I need help understanding filters. How does EMI/RFI noise filtering compare with bandpass filtering in terms of what signals they allow through?","answer":"EMI/RFI filters and bandpass filters handle signals differently. EMI/RFI filters are designed to stop electromagnetic and radio frequency noise from entering or leaving electronic systems, protecting equipment from power line interference. In contrast, bandpass filters are specifically designed to pass signals within a certain frequency band while attenuating all signals outside that band. Their function is defined by high and low cut-off frequencies that determine the passband.","context":["AC Power Line Noise Filter Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is EMI/RFI?\nEMI/RFI stands for “Electro-Magnetic Interference” and “Radio Frequency Interference”. EMI/RFI is a high frequency / low energy noise typically of a continuous nature that doesn’t directly destroy electronic systems, but rather disrupts the proper function by overwhelming the normal signal information within the electrical circuitry. A good example of the type of noise is the household vacuum cleaner. If the vacuum is running and you are attempting to watch TV, you may notice lines of interference on the TV screen or even sound distortion. This interference on the TV is being conducted from the motor of the vacuum through the power lines and into the TV. Although you may be able to still see and hear the TV, it is not functioning correctly. EMI/RFI in interfering with the proper function of the TV. This interference may be minor to the TV, but imagine that same interference in medical equipment or an industrial computer controlling a manufacturing process. That interference is not just a nuisance and could potentially cause a failure, which might injure or kill a patient or damage a major manufacturing process costing thousands of dollars.\nWhat does a filter do?\nEMI/RFI filters are designed to stop the EMI/RFI electrical noise from entering an electronic system and causing disruptions.\nWhy use filters?\nThe purpose of an EMI/RFI filter is two fold. First it stops noise from entering and disrupting the operation of your electrical equipment. Secondly, it stops your electrical equipment from putting EMI/RFI noise onto the power lines.\nThe first is to protect your equipment from malfunction or failure. The second is to protect other electrical equipment. The FCC, IEC and other regulatory agencies have rules and regulations concerning the amount of electrical noise your equipment will be allowed to place onto the AC Power line. These limits must be met before your equipment will be allowed to be connected to the AC Power line. The European limitations are much more stringent then the North American limits.\nWhy are safety agency approvals important?\nMany times, the EMI/RFI filter is the first line of defense against electrical noise entering your equipment. As such, it must be able to withstand the rigors of the AC Power line. Safety Agency approvals assure that the components used in an EMI/RFI Filter meet the standards required, to survive the AC Power line, while protecting your equipment.\nHow do I select a filter for my application?\nThe selection of an EMI/RFI filter begins by determining the voltage and current requirements of the application. Since the filter is a series as well as a parallel element in the power circuit, both the voltage and current ratings of the filter are important. Many filters are rated 250VAC which means the will work in any voltage applications up to and including 250VAC. The current ratings of a filter series can range from as small as 1 ampere to as large as 30 ampere for single phase applications and 250 ampere and greater in 3-phase application. 3-phase filters can also have voltage ratings much higher than 250VAC.\nAfter the voltage/current decisions it becomes a physical decision as to the style of filter required for the applications. IEC inlet filters allow a line cord to be plugged directly into them. Other styles allow interconnect by screw terminals, faston connector or solder connection. The physical size of the filter can also be determined at this point.\nThe final decision, although it probably should be higher up on the list, is the insertion loss characteristics. This is what the filter is all about. How much electrical noise will the filter prevent from being passed from input to output. To determine the insertion loss characteristics of a filter, electrical noise, of a known amplitude and at a given frequency, is generated at the input to the filter. The amount of noise present at the output is measured and the difference between the two is the insertion losses, ie: how much noise did the filter prevent from passing from input to output. Repeated testing at selected frequencies is done to determine the level of insertion losses over a frequency range. The typical frequency range of this testing is from 150kHz to 30mHz. However, test data at frequencies as low as 10kHz and as high as 300mHz is not uncommon.\nThe Safety Agency concerns about electrical noise levels generated by equipment and inserted onto the power line system is what established the 150kHZ to 30mHz range. However, since the filtering capability is bi-directional, you, as the design engineer, maybe concerned with electrical interference at noise levels lower than 150kHz or higher than 30mHz as they affect the operation of your equipment. Thus the reason for insertion losses data at frequencies as low as 10kHz and as high as 300mHz.\nKeep in mind the Insertion Loss Characteristics, which are shown in filter data books are generated under laboratory conditions and under defined parameters. This data is for reference only and actual results may vary in your application.\nNeed a larger filter?\nIf you need a single phase filter larger than 30 Ampere, you may find it difficult to find large amperage single phase filters, but keep in mind that a 3-Phase filter can be used in a single phase application and these filters typically have amperage ratings as high as 250 ampere. Using a 3-phase filter in a single phase application just means that one leg of the filter is left unconnected.","Band Pass Filter\nA band-pass filter is a circuit which is designed to pass signals only in a certain band of frequencies while attenuating all signals outside this band. The parameters of importance in a bandpass filter are the high and low cut-off frequencies (fH and fl), the bandwidth (BW), the centre frequency fc, centre-frequency gain, and the selectivity or Q.\nThere are basically two types of bandpass filters viz wide bandpass and narrow bandpass filters. Unfortunately, there is no set dividing line between the two. However, a bandpass filter is defined as a wide bandpass if its figure of merit or quality factor Q is less than 10 while the bandpass filters with Q > 10 are called the narrow bandpass filters. Thus Q is a measure of selectivity, meaning the higher the value of Q the more selective is the filter, or the narrower is the bandwidth (BW). The relationship between Q, 3-db bandwidth, and the centre frequency fc is given by an equation\nFor a wide bandpass filter the centre frequency can be defined as where fH and fL are respectively the high and low cut-off frequencies in Hz.In a narrow bandpass filter, the output voltage peaks at the centre frequency fc.\nWide Bandpass Filter\nA wide bandpass filter can be formed by simply cascading high-pass and low-pass sections and is generally the choice for simplicity of design and performance though such a circuit can be realized by a number of possible circuits. To form a ± 20 db/ decade bandpass filter, a first-order high-pass and a first-order low-pass sections are cascaded; for a ± 40 db/decade bandpass filter, second-order high- pass filter and a second-order low-pass filter are connected in series, and so on. It means that, the order of the bandpass filter is governed by the order of the high-pass and low-pass filters it consists of.\nA ± 20 db/decade wide bandpass filter composed of a first-order high-pass filter and a first-order low-pass filter, is illustrated in fig. (a). Its frequency response is illustrated in fig. (b).\nNarrow Bandpass Filter.\nA narrow bandpass filter employing multiple feedback is depicted in figure. This filter employs only one op-amp, as shown in the figure. In comparison to all the filters discussed so far, this filter has some unique features that are given below.\n1. It has two feedback paths, and this is the reason that it is called a multiple-feedback filter.\n2. The op-amp is used in the inverting mode.\nThe frequency response of a narrow bandpass filter is shown in fig(b).\nGenerally, the narrow bandpass filter is designed for specific values of centre frequency fc and Q or fc and BW. The circuit components are determined from the following relationships. For simplification of design calculations each of C1 and C2 may be taken equal to C.\nR1 = Q/2∏ fc CAf\nR2 =Q/2∏ fc C(2Q2-Af)\nand R3 = Q / ∏ fc C\nwhere Af, is the gain at centre frequency and is given as\nAf = R3 / 2R1\nThe gain Af however must satisfy the condition Af < 2 Q2.\nThe centre frequency fc of the multiple feedback filter can be changed to a new frequency fc‘ without changing, the gain or bandwidth. This is achieved simply by changing R2 to R’2 so that\nR’2 = R2 [fc/f’c]2"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5307d383-2b9a-4a4a-9203-1d66d6e89650>","<urn:uuid:fc5ca938-4319-496a-922f-9c599560beef>"],"error":null}

First, computer technology can uniquely help people with moderate to profound cognitive deficits and increase their participation in everyday activities in the home, in the community, at school, and at work. This theme also involves techniques and methods of software design for people with cognitive deficits.\nThe second theme is that cognitively impaired users typically provide significant contributions to the design of their software. More important, these designs highly leverage the individual’s abilities toward maximizing personal performance .\nThe third theme is the design of a delivery system, and scalability. We have 2 classes of users: (1) individuals with cognitive disabilities and (2) professionals who address the needs of these individuals. These professionals develop new treatment modalities and techniques for working with their clients.\nSome Key Papers\n“Patient-Centered Design: Interface personalization for individuals with brain injury”, Elliot Cole, PhD Because cognitive assistive technology can help achieve a partial recovery in patients with enduring cognitive disabilities, clinicians can and should be involved in the design process. Patient-Centered Design (PCD) is a method of customizing cognitive prosthetic software for use as a therapist's tool in treating patients. The patient is viewed as a user with rapidly changing software needs. PCD can be used to personalize the software fast enough to be an appropriate therapy tool. Two mini case-studies are presented. One used almost no features yet overcame a barrier to achieving a significant therapy goal. The second shows the significant role of therapist and patient in designing a powerful new tool that enables patients to remind themselves, in their own words and voices, of upcoming events. The paper also relates advances in neuroscience to new clinical opportunities for cognitive assistive technology.\nCognitive Prosthetics: Overview of a method of treatment.

Therapist-friendly tools are needed for an effective delivery system. Therapy with a patient 500 miles away, with physical and cognitive involvement, illustrates therapist-friendly tools. Our prosthetic software is client-centered, addressing the client’s priority activities. This requires 1) that the prosthetic software is highly customized to the individual client, and 2) that the software can address a broad array of daily activities. The therapist is in the best position to customize prosthetic software for their client. “Therapist-friendly” tools enable the therapist to learn how to customize software as well as run therapy sessions via telerehabilitation with a minimum of training.\n“Computer-Based Cognitive Prosthetics: Meeting Clients’ Functional Priorities”.

{"question":"Which trading instrument offers more risk protection features - options or CFDs?","answer":"Both instruments offer risk protection features but in different ways. Options can be used for hedging and protection strategies, though these involve additional costs and don't guarantee against losses. CFDs offer protection through stop losses, including both normal and guaranteed stop losses, which act like insurance premiums. However, with options, investors can only lose 100% of invested funds in long options, while CFD losses are not limited to the initial deposit and may require additional funds if the market moves against the position.","context":["An option is a contract that allows (but does not require) an investor to buy or sell an underlying instrument, such as a security, an ETF, or even an index, at a predetermined price for a certain period of time.

Options are among the most popular vehicles for traders, because their price can move fast, making (or losing) a lot of money quickly. Options strategies can range from fairly simple to very complex, with a variety of benefits and sometimes strange names. Options can be used to generate potential income on the shares you own and the shares you would like to own.\nOptions carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Investing involves risks, including loss of capital. Hedging and protection strategies generally involve additional costs and do not secure gains or guarantees against losses.\nWith long options, investors can lose 100% of invested funds. Hedged calls provide revenue, fall protection only to the extent of the premium received and limit the upside potential to the strike price plus the premium received. Spread trading must be done on a margin account. Read the options disclosure document entitled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options before considering any options transaction.\nSupporting documentation for any claim or statistical information is available upon request. While many brokers have eliminated fees for trading stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), they still exist for options. These details will be documented in an options trading agreement that will be used to request approval from your prospective broker. Because option prices can be mathematically modeled with a model such as the Black-Scholes model, many of the risks associated with options can also be modeled and understood.\nThe risk you take as an option investor ultimately depends on your role in the contract (which side you're on) and your strategy, as there are multiple strategies you can implement using different combinations of options. European options are different from American options in that they can only be exercised at the end of their useful life, on their expiration date. This is why, when trading options with a broker, you usually see a disclaimer similar to the following. Options that expire before the estimated dates have values calculated based on the underlying prices from the estimated dates, as if the option expires on the estimated date.\nOptions trading is the way investors can speculate on the future direction of the stock market in general or individual securities, such as stocks or bonds. Like all the investment decisions you make, you need to have a clear idea of what you hope to achieve before trading options. Compared to opening a brokerage account to trade stocks, opening an options trading account requires larger amounts of capital. Options trading is when you buy or sell an underlying asset at a pre-traded price on a certain future date.\nBefore buying or selling options, investors should read the Standardized Options Characteristics and Risks booklet (PDF 17.8 MB), also known as the options disclosure document. Options quotes, technically called an option chain or matrix, contain a range of available strike prices. If used properly, options trading offers numerous advantages that stock and bond trading alone doesn't. Options trading strategies can become very complicated when advanced traders pair two or more call or put options with different strike prices or expiration dates.","A CFD stands for Contract for Difference. It’s a derivative product involving a contract between a CFD provider and an investor. It consists of an underlying security, which might be a stock on an overseas or local share market, a currency, debt security, a commodity, or an overseas or local stock index. Through CFDs, the investor is buying and selling the price movement of the security, rather than directly owning the shares or securities. The CFD contract is a representation of a theoretical buy or sell order. The profit and loss are calculated by the difference between the opening and closing price, just when the position is closed.\nIndividuals opening a CFD position must put down a deposit on the value of shares. This can be as little as 5%. The CFD contract mimics the performance of the shares. CFD providers thus allow their clients to enter a short position at the same expense of entering a long one. Trading CFDs give traders the opportunity to trade long or short. For instance, an investor can sell a stock or short it using a CFD contract if he/she thinks that the stock is going to fall.\nCosts Involved in Using CFDs\nCFDs are usually provided by CFD providers. They tend to charge traders a premium for using CFDs. This can come in many forms described below.\nInvestors can trade securities by investing as little as 3% in some cases of the underlying asset’s value. The CFD provider offers exposure to the balance while the investor gains exposure to the whole amount of the transaction. Financing costs are charged on the portfolio’s balance in addition to the initial deposit. The CFD provider takes out a hedge to protect its own exposure to the underlying asset. It then passes on the cost of that hedge on to the investor in the form of a financing charge. Financing costs are usually calculated as a margin which can vary from 1.25 to 2% in some cases.\nCFD providers charge a commission on a user’s initial deposit. In some cases, they offer flat commission rates regardless of the transaction size. Many brokers commonly offer a flat commission of 0.10 or 0.20 percent. Others charge commissions on a sliding scale ranging from 0.05% to 0.2%.\nMinimum Opening Balance\nThe requirements for minimum opening balance can range from zero to as high as $5000 or $10000 in the case of some brokers and providers.\nMonthly fees depend mostly on the provider or broker chosen. Some have no monthly fee and do not charge for live market feeds. Others charge a monthly account fee but have packages for frequent traders that waive them off.\nAdvantages and Features of CFDs\nTraders who want a cost-effective, leveraged way to access different markets should use CFDs. They can take advantage of the market volatility by implementing various short-term techniques. However, they are not suited for individuals who are searching for wealth accumulation through private portfolios, or for retirees who are looking for efficient risk management.\nNo Expiry Date\nOne of the major advantages that CFDs have over other derivative trading instruments is that they do not have an expiry date, unlike warrants or options. This allows investors to keep their CFDs open for as long as they prefer. This gives CFDs a high degree of flexibility.\nIn recent years CFD providers have been modifying their products to appeal to traders and investors who prefer long-term strategies. Thus, these traders can use CFDs in the following ways:\nTrading with leverage\nTraders can use CFDs as a margin loan to get access to greater market exposure. They can control losses by placing stop losses in the correct positions. A stop loss can be likened to an insurance premium, providing an additional layer of protection. Traders should always realize that the losses they encounter while trading CFDs are not limited to the deposit paid. If the market moves against the CFD holder, he/she may be called upon to pay additional funds. To avoid such scenarios, the use of a normal as well as a guaranteed stop loss is recommended.\nDeferring Capital Gains\nIt may so happen that an investor builds up an overnight position in a well-performing stock and wants to diversify away from that high-risk exposure. They can then use CFDs as a way to sell against his stock position. It has the effect of locking in a selling price, thereby freeing up cash for other investments.\nCFDs can help protect a portfolio against adverse market environments. One can do this by taking out a CFD in the opposite direction of the portfolio position. For instance, if one holds an ASX 200 index, he/she can use a CFD contract to short it. As a result, the losses in the physical portfolio will be offset by the gains on the short positions when the market falls.\nThe longer CFDs are in the market, the better people’s understanding of it seems to be. In today’s markets, there are various short and long-term investors and other self-directed individuals who add CFDs to their portfolio. Compared to other derivatives, they are easily understandable especially if one is already a share investor. Additionally, many online brokers and CFD providers have started offering training sessions and other educational resources to educate traders and investors about CFD trading."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3816c4c3-ec8c-49e1-bae2-7363df821ff6>","<urn:uuid:7644c07f-0565-43db-84ca-72c841b684f8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the differences between how Hinduism and Buddhism view divine births?","answer":"In Hinduism, divine births are seen as manifestations of the Supreme God (Brahman) who assumes different forms for creation, while maintaining His unity as the supreme being. In Buddhism, as exemplified by Buddha's birth in Lumbini, divine births are accompanied by specific miraculous events - in Buddha's case, his mother Maya gave birth painlessly between twin Sala trees, the newborn immediately spoke claiming it was his final rebirth, took seven steps with lotus flowers springing from each step, and both mother and child were washed by divinities.","context":["Hinduism and the Belief in one God\nThe Hindus believe in many gods and goddesses. At the same time they also believe in the existence of one Supreme God, whom they call variously as Paramatma (Supreme Self), Parameshwar (Supreme Lord), Parampita (Supreme Father). Iswara, Maheswara, Bhagawan, Purusha, Purushottama, Hiranyagarbha and so on. In the Vedas and several scriptures, He is popularly known as Brahman, the infinite, expansive, supreme God\nThe idea of supreme God in Hinduism pervades all teachings and methods of worship although it may not always be visible. It is also the main feature of Shaivism and Vaishnavism. Both the sects believe in one God who assumes different forms and roles for the sake of creation.\nHinduism is unique because it is essentially a monotheistic faith which acknowledges polytheism as reflective of the diversity in God's creation. God is one, but also many. He manifests Himself in innumerable forms and shapes. As Purusha (Universal Male), He enters Prakriti (Nature, Matter or Divine Energy) and brings forth the numerous worlds and beings into existence. He upholds His entire creation with His unlimited powers.\nHe is both the Known and the Unknown, the Being as well as the Non-Being, Reality as well as Unreality. As the Unknown, He is rarely known and worshipped in his unmanifested aspect (avyakta) for difficult and painful is the path for those who choose to worship Him as the Unmanifested (The Bhagavad-Gita XII.6).\nHe exists in all and all beings exist in him. There is nothing other than Him, and there is nothing that is outside of Him. He is Imperishable, unknowable, immortal, infinite, without a beginning and without an end. However, when worshipped with intense devotion and unshakeable faith, He responds to the calls of His devotees and comes to their aid and rescue.\nAll the gods and goddess are His manifestations only. In His female aspect He is Shakti, who as the Divine Universal Mother assists the whole creation to go through the process of evolution in Her own mysterious ways, acting as the field and force of creation.\nThe relationship between God and His devotees is purely personal. They have the freedom and the permission to approach Him and worship him in their own ways. The world may create divisions and categorize people into groups (Jati) and castes (Kula), but for God they are all the same.\nThere are no fixed rules and no central controlling authority on the subject of devotion and what should or should not be done. They are influenced mostly by a person's karma and his or her family traditions. The scriptures and law books (Smritis) do provide guidelines and suggest methods of worship but whether to follow them or not is purely an individual choice.\nThe concept of monotheism is not new to Hinduism. It is as old as the Vedas themselves. References to One indivisible and mysterious God are found in the Rigveda itself. The concept is the central theme of all the Upanishads in which He is variously referred to as Brahman, Iswara, Hiranyagarbha, Asat, etc.\nWhile the students of Upanishads tried to know Him by the path of knowledge with utmost secrecy and there by made it the exclusive domain of a few enlightened persons, the bhakti marg or the path of devotion brought Him closer to the masses and contributed to mass awakening.\nThe One Imperishable and Ancient Being was no more a God of remote heights, secret teachings and elite classes, but a popular and personal God of infinite power, love and compassion, eager to help His aspiring devotees in numerous forms and willing to perform miracles if necessary.\nThe rise of tantric cults added a new dimension to our understanding of Him. To the tantric worshippers, the Supreme Self is the Universal Mother (Shakti). Purusha is subordinate to Her, who plays a rather passive and secondary role in Her creation as the witness. For them Shakti is not a dependent entity, but independent and supreme. Being passive, God cannot initiate creation unless He is joined by Shakti.\nAt the highest level and in his purest aspect, He is satchitananda. Truth, Consciousness and Bliss. As the lord of the universe, He is the inhabitant of the whole world and the indweller of all. There is nothing that is outside of Him or without Him. He exists in the beings (jivas) as Atman, the Enjoyer who delights in Himself, without undergoing any change, but willing to participate in the cycle of births and deaths and bear witness to the illusions of life.\nHe is realized in many ways. The paths or the methods that lead to liberation or union with God can broadly be groupd into four, the path of action, the path of knowledge, the path of renuciation and the path of devotion. All the paths are interrelated, and for success on any path, perfection in others is necessary.\nThe first path requires performance of selfless actions, the second one pursuit of self-knowledge, the third one renunciation of desires and worldly life, and the fourth one devotion to God and absorbing the mind in the contemplation of God. Of the four, the path of devotion is considered the best.\nIn the Bhagavad-Gita we come across an integrated approach. The path of action incorporates the essential elements of the other three as one integrated approach to liberation in which a devotee has to live a divine centered life as a servant of God upon earth (bhagavata), performing his actions with detachment, without any desire for the fruit of actions and offering them to God with pure devotion and total surrender.\nThus, it can be seen that Hindus have a broader approach to the concept of God and his worship. One may call Him by any name or worship Him in any form. The names and forms of God are mere reference points to know him and relate to him in the objective world. Since the senses can only grasp the objects, for us God becomes an object, while the reality is that He is transcendental, beyond the senses and hidden in the objects.\nOtherwise, how can we worship Him, who is unreachable, indescribable, beyond grasp, and beyond all words and thoughts? He objectifies the best and the highest in us. He elevates our very thought and vision, and represents the loftiest ideals, which we can aspire to achieve in our search for meaning and truths about ourselves.\nHe is the highest goal (Parandhama), attaining which in our individual ways is the very purpose of our lives. Those who quarrel about His name or forms, blinded by their faith and their attachment to it, are ignorant and deluded. They never attain him, until they mend their ways.\nTruly, the Brahman of Hinduism represents the Highest principle which the human mind can ever conceive of. He is not God of just one world or a few worlds, but represents the entire known and unknown Universe as well as Time or Kala, the all devouring God of Death.\nSuggestions for Further Reading\n- The Concept of Brahman As Priest and As Supreme Self\n- Aspects, Emanations, Incarnations and Forms of God in Vaishnava Tradition\n- Brahman according to Advaita and Dvaita schools of thought\n- Mahavakya, Prajnanam Brahma, Brahman is Knowledge\n- Bhagawan meaning and significance\n- The Samkhya Philosophy and 24 Principles of Creation\n- The Bhagavadgita On The Problem Of Sorrow\n- The Concept of Atman or Eternal Soul in Hinduism\n- The Practice of Atma Yoga Or The Yoga Of Self\n- The Problem of Maya Or Illusion and How To Deal With It\n- Belief In Atman, The Eternal Soul Or The Inner Self\n- Brahman, The Highest God Of Hinduism\n- The Bhagavad Gita Original Translations\n- The Bhagavadgita, Philosophy and Concepts\n- Bhakti yoga or the Yoga of Devotion\n- Hinduism And The Evolution of Life And Consciousness\n- Why to Study the Bhagavadgita Parts 1 to 4\n- The Triple Gunas, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas\n- The Practice of Tantra and Tantric Ritual in Hinduism and Buddhism\n- The Tradition Of Gurus and Gurukulas in Hinduism\n- Origin, Definition and Introduction to Hinduism\n- Hinduism, Way of Life, Beliefs and Practices\n- A Summary of the Bhagavadgita\n- Avatar, the Reincarnation of God Upon Earth\n- The Bhagavadgita on Karma, the Law of Actions\n- The Mandukya Upanishad\n- The Bhagavadgita On The Mind And Its Control\n- Symbolic Significance of Numbers in Hinduism\n- The Belief of Reincarnation of Soul in Hinduism\n- The True Meaning Of Renunciation According To Hinduism\n- The Symbolic Significance of Puja Or Worship In Hinduism\n- Introduction to the Upanishads of Hinduism\n- Origin, Principles, Practice and Types of Yoga\n- Hinduism and the Belief in one God\nTranslate the Page","published on 09 December 2013\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, Lumbini is the name of the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautma, also known as the Buddha. Lumbini is located in present-day Rummindei, in the Terai region of Southern Nepal, not far from the Indian-Nepalese border.\nBuddhist sources say that the mother of the Buddha, Maya, was travelling from her home in Kapilavastu to her parent’s home to give birth when she suddenly went into a labour at Lumbini. A number of myths surround this particular scene: Maya gave birth painlessly, while standing between twin Sala trees; when the child was born he immediately spoke and said “this is my final rebirth”, he then took seven steps to the four cardinal points (beginning with the north) and a lotus flower sprang forth with each step; both mother and child were washed by the divinities. This last account is the origin of “bathing the infant Buddha”, a ceremony which takes place in several Buddhist communities when celebrating the Buddha’s birth. As it happens in all legends of different buddhas, Maya died seven days after the birth of the child. Mahaprajapati, Maya’s younger sister, would become Siddhartha’s foster mother.\nHistory of Lumbini\nLumbini has been identified thanks to the Indian Emperor Ashoka, who visited the area in 248 BCE and erected a pillar with an inscription commemorating the birth of Siddhartha. He also built a wall around the village and ordered the building of four stupas to mark the spot. It is not absolutely certain that Siddhartha was actually born in Lumbini, but at least we know for certain that this was widely believed by the Buddhist community at the time of Ashoka and even earlier.\nA Chinese pilgrim named Faxian (Fa-Hien, 337-c.422 CE) reports his visit to Lumini in 403 CE. In his work known as “A record of the Buddhistic kingdoms”, Faxian wrote:\nFifty le east from the city [Kapilavastu] was a garden, named Lumbini, where the queen [Maya] entered the pond and bathed. Having come forth from the pond on the northern bank, after (walking) twenty paces, she lifted up her hand, laid hold of a branch of a tree, and, with her face to the east, gave birth to the heir-apparent. When he fell to the ground, he (immediately) walked seven paces. Two dragon-kings [appeared] and washed his body. At the place where they did so, there was immediately formed a well, and from it, as well as from the above pond, where [Maya] bathed, the monks [even] now constantly take the water, and drink it.\n(Faxian, Chapter 22)\nAbout two hundred years later, Xuanzang (Hsüan-tsang, 602-664 CE), another Chinese pilgrim who also visited Lumbini, described a number of structures in the area including some monasteries and Ashoka's pillar, shattered by lightning and lying on the ground. The site was not as popular during this particular time as it once was, but it was not entirely forgotten either. During the the 9th century CE, the area became controlled by the Muslims and later by the Hindus: During this process, the Buddhist structures were destroyed and the memory of Lumbini was lost.\nA German archaeologist named Alois Führer rediscovered Lumbini in 1895 CE. Führer unearthed some of the structures built by Ashoka as well as a temple which included scene’s of the Buddha’s life. During the 20th century CE, a number of excavations were carried out and many Buddhist structures were rediscovered. The area has been almost entirely restored during the last few decades. One of the main structures in Lumbini is the Mayadevi temple. The temple area covers the actual place where the Buddha was born, which is indicated by the marker stone, which was discovered in 1996 CE when the temple was excavated. The temple stands adjacent to the Holy Pond where the Buddha and his mother took their first bath.\nLumbini is today one of the four main pilgrimage places in Buddhism and is also an important place of pilgrimage for those Hindus who consider the Buddha one of the many manifestations of the god Vishnu. The place is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nc. 490 BCE - c. 410 BCEThe life of Siddhartha Gautama according to modern scholar consensus.\n448 BCE - 368 BCEThe life of Siddhartha Gautama according to the Short chronology (Indian chronology).\n403 CEA Buddhist Chinese pilgrim named Faxian (Fa-Hien) visited Kapilavastu and Lumbini. as recorded in his work “A Record of the Buddhistic kingdoms”."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a830589f-65be-4852-aca8-c81d07e80000>","<urn:uuid:92458a92-ab60-4b3c-abe5-617807267995>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm curious about cookware safety - can I use the same metal pans in both regular microwaves and convection microwaves? What's the difference?","answer":"Regular microwaves and convection microwaves have different rules for metal cookware. In regular microwaves, metal containers should not be used unless specifically directed by a recipe, as microwaves bounce off metal and can cause arcing and fires. However, in convection microwaves, metal cookware like stainless steel or aluminum pans is actually recommended as it conducts heat evenly and quickly. The key difference is that convection microwaves use an additional heating element and fan to circulate hot air, making them more similar to traditional ovens in terms of cookware compatibility.","context":["The microwave oven is now an essential part of most kitchens. During the summer or other hot times of the year, it's an excellent appliance to use because it won't heat up your kitchen the way an oven will. Unfortunately, most people still use the microwave to heat coffee, melt butter or make popcorn. That's just fine - but the appliance can do so much more! Read on to learn how to use a microwave oven.\nHow the Oven Works\nThe microwave works when the high voltage is converted to waves of electromagnetic energy, which is a combination of electrical and magnetic energy. This energy is in the frequency band of radio waves, not x-rays. A waveguide and stirrer blade work together to make sure the energy reaches all areas of the oven interior. When the door is opened or the timer reaches zero, the energy automatically stops, so no microwave radiation leaves the oven. All ovens also have two independent systems that ensure the electrical activity stops as soon as the door is opened.\nThe microwaves make the water molecules contained in food vibrate and 'wiggle', which produces heat. This is what cooks the food, and also why the oven itself doesn't heat up. That's why foods that have a lot of water, like fruits and vegetables, cook more quickly. Foods high in fat and sugar also cook more quickly. Metal reflects the microwaves, and the energy passes through glass, plastic, and paper. As soon as the microwave energy is absorbed by the food, it is converted to heat - so the microwave energy can't 'contaminate' the food.\nAlthough heat is produced directly in the food, microwave energy doesn't cook food from the inside out. More dense foods like meat are cooked primarily by conduction of heat from the outer layers, which are heated by microwaves.\nIn combination microwave/convection ovens, you'll notice that the interior is metal. A convection oven's special feature is a fan that constantly circulates hot air around the food, so it cooks more quickly and browns very evenly. Follow the cooking instructions to the letter if you have one of these appliances.\nNever try to repair your own microwave. It is a complex appliance that includes a magnetron, high voltage transformer, thermal protectors, and complicated circuits.\nMicrowave Oven Safety\nNow a few words about microwave safety:\n- The foods will be very hot when removed from the oven, so use oven pads and be careful.\n- If the food is covered during cooking, make sure to leave a small portion vented, or uncovered, so steam doesn't build up and burns you when the covering is removed.\n- The foods should sit as directed in the recipe after being removed from the oven so the heat can continue to spread and dissipate. This is called 'standing time', but it is actually more cooking time.\n- Most ovens have hot spots, and if you eat the food directly from the oven, a few areas could be superheated and will burn.\n- On the flip side, there can also be cold spots where the food doesn't get hot enough to kill bacteria. Follow stirring and rotating instructions carefully.\n- Don't use metal containers unless the recipe specifically directs you to: as stated above, microwaves bounce off metal, which can cause arcing and a fire inside the oven. Some recipes may call for shielding parts of the food, especially meats, with small amounts of foil. This is perfectly acceptable as long as the directions are carefully followed.\n- Make sure any glass, plastic containers, and plastic wrap you use are labeled 'microwave safe'. You can also test containers, as directed on the next page.\n- Don't heat water or other liquids beyond the time recommended by the manufacturer or any recipe. Superheating can occur when plain water is heated in a clean cup for an excessive amount of time. The water will look innocuous, but when moved it can literally erupt out of the cup. Don't heat the water twice - that adds to the superheating risk. Adding sugar or coffee granules to the water will reduce the risk of superheating.\n- Never operate a microwave if the door is damaged or doesn't close securely.\n- Don't operate the oven while it is empty. This can also cause arcing and start a fire.\n- It's also a good idea to stand 3-4 feet away from the microwave when it is operating - just to be on the safe side!\nThe more you know about how to use a microwave oven, the better the results. These cooking tips are invaluable.\n- When using the microwave to defrost meat, the foods must be completely cooked right away. The microwave may have partially cooked part of the meat, and bacteria may grow if the food isn't thoroughly cooked.\n- Arrange food evenly in the pans and follow directions for stirring, rotating and standing time. Most recipes are developed for use in a 700-watt oven.\n- Check the food at the shortest time in the specified cooking range. Let the food stand as directed, then test using an instant-read thermometer to be super safe, or test according to the recipe's doneness tests. You can easily cook it longer if the food isn't done.\n- If you're wondering if a dish you own is microwave safe, there's an easy way to test it. Place a cup full of water and the dish you want to test in the microwave. Cook at 100% power for one minute. If the water gets hot and the dish you're testing stays cool, it is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish gets hot, it contains lead or metals and shouldn't be used in the microwave.\n- Onions and other vegetables are easily sauteed in the microwave. Just chop as directed in the recipe, place in a safe container, add 1 Tbsp. of water and cook on HIGH for 1-2 minutes until soft. This is a great way to cook quickly with no added fat.\n- In general, the outside sections of the food will cook more quickly. So arrange fish fillets, for example, so the thinner parts are toward the center. When cooking on any other power level than HIGH, the oven cooks by cycling power on and off, so the energy has a chance to move through the food without overcooking. MEDIUM and LOW power are generally used to soften, melt, and defrost foods, while HIGH is usually used for cooking.\n- Follow the recipe! Remember to use a microwave-safe plastic wrap to cover the food while cooking if the recipe says to. Leave one corner uncovered to vent steam so it doesn't build up to dangerous levels. And always be careful when removing the cover from food; the steam will billow up quickly and it's easy to get burned. Pay careful attention to arranging the food, stirring, rotating, and standing instructions in the recipes.\n- To easily clean the microwave, place 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice in 1 cup of water in a 2 cup liquid measuring cup. Microwave on HIGH for 2-3 minutes, until the liquid is boiling. Let the liquid remain in the microwave, without opening the door, for 5 minutes. Remove the measuring cup. The microwave will easily wipe clean with a paper towel.\nGet the Recipes!\nThese fabulous recipes are the last part of learning how to use a microwave oven. Enjoy every bite.\nBut first, do you know the wattage of your microwave oven? If you're not sure, here's an easy way to find out, according to the University of Tennessee. Fill a glass measuring cup with exactly one cup of lukewarm tap water. Microwave the water, uncovered, on HIGH until water begins to boil. If boiling occurs in less than three minutes, the wattage of your microwave is 600 to 700; three to four minutes, the wattage is 500 to 600; more than four minutes, the oven wattage is less than 500 watts. Most microwave recipes are developed for ovens with more than 600 watts of power. If your oven's wattage is less than that, you will probably need to add more cooking time.\nMany of these recipes cook entirely in the microwave oven. Be sure to follow cooking, rotating, stirring, and standing times carefully. Never try to taste or eat food as soon as it comes out of the oven because the food is still cooking and increasing in temperature.\nNow enjoy these recipes!\n- Microwave Meatloaf\nThis classic meatloaf cooks to perfection in the microwave oven.

The best cookware for use in a convection microwave is made of metal, such as stainless steel or aluminum. Metal cookware conducts heat evenly and quickly, resulting in meals that are cooked thoroughly and evenly.\nNon-metallic materials such as glass or ceramic should be avoided because they can interfere with the cooking process by not allowing the food to brown properly. Additionally, plastic containers can melt in high temperatures which could damage your oven. Make sure you select cookware that fits well inside your oven; too small pieces can cause food to overcook while too large pieces will leave parts of the meal undercooked.\nFinally, avoid any kind of cookware that has exposed wires since these could cause sparks within your oven’s interior cavity and lead to disaster!\nCooking with a convection microwave oven is becoming increasingly popular among busy families, who appreciate the convenience of being able to cook meals quickly and efficiently. But if you’re new to this type of cooking, you may be wondering what kind of cookware works best in a convection microwave oven.\nThe good news is that there are several types of cookware that work well in these kinds of ovens.\nHere are some great options for those looking for the best cookware for their convection microwave: 1) Heavy-duty aluminum or stainless steel pans – These heavy-duty metal pans heat evenly and resist warping due to high temperatures. Plus, they’re easy to clean and long lasting.\n2) Glass bakeware – Not only does glass bakeware offer an attractive presentation when serving food, but it also cooks evenly and doesn’t require any special care like nonstick coatings do. If using glass bakeware in your convection microwave, make sure it’s labeled as “microwave safe” before placing it inside the appliance.\nWhat Cookware Can Be Used in a Microwave Convection Oven?\nCooking with a microwave convection oven can be intimidating at first, but the results are well worth it. A microwave convection oven is a great way to save time and energy in the kitchen, as you can use it to prepare meals quickly and efficiently. With that said, not all cookware is suitable for a microwave convection oven.\nIn this blog post, we’ll discuss what types of cookware are best suited for use in one of these versatile appliances. The most important thing to remember when using any type of cookware in your microwave convection oven is that it should be made from materials that won’t warp or melt under heat exposure. This means sticking to metal pans such as cast iron skillets and stainless steel baking dishes.\nCeramic ware also works well in microwaves, although some people prefer glass dishes due their superior heat retention capabilities and because they don’t impart any flavor onto the food being cooked inside them. It’s important to note that plastic containers should never be used in a microwave convection oven; they will melt under high temperatures!\nDo You Need Special Pans for Convection Microwave?\nIf you’ve been considering purchasing a convection microwave for your kitchen, one of the questions you may have is whether or not special pans are necessary. The answer is yes, in some cases. Convection microwaves use an additional heating element and fan to circulate hot air around food as it cooks.\nThis helps ensure even cooking, but can cause problems if you try to cook with traditional metal bakeware that wasn’t designed for this process. When using a convection microwave oven, the best results will be achieved when using cookware specifically designed for this type of appliance. These types of pans typically feature materials such as glass or ceramic which allow heat to penetrate more evenly than metal pans do due to their higher thermal mass and low reflectivity properties.\nAdditionally, these pans are often shaped differently from traditional bakeware with deeper wells that help contain liquids during cooking so they don’t splatter all over the walls of your oven cavity like they would with regular baking sheets or cake tins. In addition to choosing the right material and shape for your cookware, there are other considerations when selecting appropriate items for a convection microwave oven:\nCan You Put Metal Pan in Convection Microwave?\nYes, you can put metal pans in a convection microwave. However, there are some safety considerations to keep in mind before doing so.\nConvection microwaves work by circulating heated air around the food as it cooks, which results in faster and more even cooking.\nAs such, they can be used to cook almost any type of food that would traditionally be cooked on the stovetop or in an oven. Metal is perfectly safe to use in a convection microwave—in fact most manufacturers recommend using metal pans with their appliances for the best results. That said, not all types of metal are suitable for use with a convection microwave; aluminum foil should never be used as it may cause sparks and create hazardous conditions inside the oven cavity.\nAdditionally, large pieces of uncoated stainless steel should also not be used since these will reflect heat away from your food instead of trapping it like other materials do when cooking. When using metal pans with your convection microwave (or any kind of pan for that matter), make sure you place them away from the walls and sides of the oven cavity to avoid overheating or sparking due to contact between them and other surfaces inside your appliance’s interior design .\nBest Cookware For Convection Microwave Ovens of 2023 [Updated]\nCan I Use Metal Pans in My Microwave Convection Oven\nIf you’re in the market for a new oven, you may be wondering if metal pans can be used in a microwave convection oven. The answer is…it depends!\nWhen shopping for microwaves with convection technology, it’s important to read the product descriptions carefully.\nSome manufacturers clearly state that their models are safe for use with metal cookware whereas others do not mention this at all. Before investing in any appliance or cookware, take some time to understand what types of materials and utensils are recommended by its manufacturer. Generally speaking, using metal cooking vessels in your microwave convection oven should be avoided unless specifically stated as compatible by the manufacturer.\nMetal reflects heat from microwaves which causes arcing – an electrical discharge that occurs when electricity jumps between two conductors such as metals inside your oven cavity – and potentially damaging sparks or fires may occur due to overheating components within the device itself.. It also increases wear on internal parts like door seals, fans and heating elements which could lead to premature failure of your appliance over time if done frequently enough.\nBaking Utensils for Convection Microwave Oven\nIf you love to bake but don’t have the time or space for a traditional oven, then a convection microwave oven may be the perfect solution. Convection microwaves are becoming increasingly popular because they offer all of the convenience and speed of traditional microwaving with added features like browning, crisping, and even baking. To make sure that you get the most out of your new appliance, however, it’s important to know what type of utensils will work best for convection cooking in your microwave.\nWhen selecting baking utensils for use in your convection microwave oven, opt for materials like glass or ceramic as opposed to metal pans or aluminum foil which can cause arcing (a spark caused by electricity). Additionally, since heating times differ from those used with traditional methods such as gas or electric ovens; make sure that whatever pan you choose is heat resistant so it won’t warp when exposed to high temperatures. Some good options include stoneware dishes made specifically for microwaves and special heat-resistant glassware like Pyrex.\nWhen using these types of containers there are some additional tips to keep in mind:\nConvection Microwave Oven Accessories\nWhen it comes to cooking, convection microwave ovens offer the best of both worlds – a combination of traditional microwaving and convection baking. But what makes them so unique? Convection microwave ovens use hot air circulated with fans to cook food more quickly and evenly than traditional microwaves.\nAnd with just the right accessories, you can take your meals from ordinary to extraordinary in no time! The most important accessory for any convection microwave oven is an appropriate rack or tray. Racks vary in size, shape and material depending on the model of your appliance.\nThe correct rack should be placed at least one inch above the bottom of your oven so that air can circulate properly for even heat distribution. Be sure to check whether your convection microwave comes with a suitable rack before making a separate purchase! Another popular accessory is an extender ring which increases the capacity of your oven by raising its interior walls higher than usual, providing enough space for larger dishes like roasts or casseroles.\nAn extender ring also helps create an ideal environment inside while keeping temperature consistent during cooking cycles.\nMicrowave And Oven Safe Cookware\nWhen cooking, it’s important to have the right cookware that won’t damage your appliances. If you want to use both a microwave and oven for your recipes, then you need cookware that is safe to use in both. This type of cookware is called “microwave and oven safe cookware.”\nNot all types of cookware can be used in the microwave and oven; some materials are too reactive or not heat-resistant enough for this purpose. Microwave and oven safe cookware is typically made from metal or ceramic materials like stainless steel, aluminum, copper, glass or enameled cast iron/steel. These materials can handle high temperatures without reacting with food particles or leaching chemicals into the food being cooked.\nAdditionally, these materials transfer heat quickly so foods will get cooked evenly with minimal risk of burning them on the bottom of the pan due to direct contact with an element inside an oven setting. Glass dishes such as Pyrex are popular options when it comes to cooking in microwaves because they barely absorb any energy during cooking which means no additional cleaning is required afterwards – simply wipe down after use!\nConvection Microwave Tray\nIf you’re looking for a way to make your microwave cooking easier, then a convection microwave tray is an excellent option. This simple piece of kitchen equipment can help you cook food faster and more evenly than ever before.\nA convection microwave tray works by utilizing hot air circulation to heat food quickly and efficiently.\nIt creates an even temperature throughout the entire dish and helps prevent uneven cooking or burning in certain areas. The result is perfectly cooked meals every time! The main advantage of using a convection oven over other types of microwaves is that it cooks food much faster than traditional methods.\nConvection trays allow you to cook larger portions with less energy consumption, making them great for busy households or those trying to save money on their electricity bills. Plus, these trays are designed to fit into almost any type of standard-sized microwaves so they’re easy to use regardless of what kind of appliance you have at home. When purchasing one, there are several things that should be taken into consideration such as size, shape and materials used in construction—all which will affect how well the tray performs in terms of speed and efficiency when heating up your meals.\nMicrowave Convection Oven Rack\nIf you’re looking for a way to cook your food faster and more efficiently, then the microwave convection oven rack may be just what you need. With a combination of microwaves and conventional heating elements, this type of oven can help you get dinner on the table in no time. But before you invest in one, it’s important to understand how they work and why they might be an ideal addition to your kitchen.\nA microwave convection oven is essentially two appliances combined into one unit: A traditional microwave oven plus a convection heating element that circulates hot air around the food being cooked. The result is faster cooking times and better results – not only because there are two sources of heat but also because the circulating hot air helps evenly distribute the temperature throughout whatever food is inside. Not all models have both features, so if this is something that interests you make sure to double check when shopping for an oven like this.\nThe other thing to consider about these types of units is their racks or shelves, which come in different sizes depending on model and brand (so again do your research!).\nDo You Need Special Cookware for Convection Oven\nConvection ovens are becoming more popular in home kitchens due to their energy efficiency and ability to cook food faster than traditional ovens. As a result, many people may be wondering whether they need special cookware for use in these ovens. The answer is yes—specialized cookware can help you get the best results from your convection oven.\nWhen cooking with a convection oven, it’s important to understand how this type of appliance works differently than regular ovens. Convection heats food by circulating hot air around the chamber using fans, which means that heat reaches all areas of the food evenly and quickly. This also means that foods cooked in a convection oven tend to dry out faster since there is no moisture retention like traditional heating elements allow for.\nTo ensure even cooking and prevent sticking or burning on pans when using a convection oven, special cookware should be used instead of standard bakeware such as aluminum or glass dishes.\nMicrowave Safe Baking Pans\nBaking pans are an essential part of any kitchen. They come in all shapes and sizes, from round to square, from cake tins to muffin tins. But what about baking pans that can be used in a microwave?\nThis is where microwave safe baking pans come into play! Microwave safe baking pans are specially designed for use in the microwave oven. They often have special coatings or materials that allow them to withstand the high temperatures of microwaves without melting or becoming damaged.\nThe best part is they still provide you with great results when cooking food – just like regular bakeware! For those who don’t want to invest in traditional bakeware but still want delicious baked goods, using a microwave-safe pan is the perfect solution. Not only are these types of pans easier on your wallet, but their ease of use makes them ideal for busy bakers who don’t always have time to preheat their ovens and wait around while things cook up slowly over many minutes (or hours).\nIf you’re looking for the best cookware to use in your convection microwave oven, you’ve come to the right place. Convection microwaves are a great way to get a fast cooked meal without all of the hassle that comes with using a conventional oven. But when it comes to choosing cookware and bake ware, there are some important considerations.\nWe’ll go over what types of materials work best in a convection microwave – like glass and ceramic – as well as how to choose the right size pieces for even cooking results!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ae83864d-51a0-41a2-8d88-88cc95b4f7b7>","<urn:uuid:8d2d1f19-9c3a-4ced-a449-7b99a6d454bb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"what happens when private companies dont follow rules protecting environment and people rights in mining?","answer":"When private companies don't follow regulations in mining, there are serious consequences for both human rights and the environment. Mining companies that don't honor their responsibilities can leave areas in an unsustainable condition, creating lifeless wastelands that threaten plant species and wildlife. Additionally, they can cause extensive environmental damage including erosion, groundwater contamination, and loss of biodiversity. From a legal perspective, while traditionally only the state could be held liable for rights violations, there's a growing recognition that private entities should also be accountable for observing both liberty and prosperity rights, especially given the 'advent of liberalization, deregulation and privatization' where private individuals can become sources of abuses and threats to human rights.","context":["As a way of commemorating Christian resurrection and liberation from earthly afflictions today, Easter Sunday, let me turn to the award-winning treatise of Raphael Lorenzo Pangalangan pleading for equal legal treatment of the rights to prosperity with those of liberty.\nScholarly treatise. Written in elegant, authoritative and scholarly legalese, the 47-page treatise, fortified by 248 footnotes, won the first place (P300,000 cash plus a plaque of recognition) in the first “Dissertation Writing Contest” sponsored by the Foundation for Liberty and Prosperity (FLP), with funding from Ayala Corp. and the cooperation of the Philippine Association of Law Schools. It may be accessed at www.libpros.com but I will try to simplify it.\nTo begin with, FLP champions the philosophy of liberty and prosperity under the rule of law. It believes that these twin beacons must always go together; one is useless without the other. They must be equally cherished and protected as essentials of life and wellbeing. Indeed, the choice is no longer “Give me liberty or give me death”; it is enjoying both liberty and life in equal measure.\nPangalangan observed, however, that traditional legal concepts prioritize liberty over prosperity. While fundamental liberties are recognized as self-executing rights enforceable by judicial action without need of further legislation, prosperity is appreciated merely as an aspiration rather than as a right; it requires congressional acts before it could find sanctuary in the courts.\nHe wrote, “The intent of the drafters of the 1987 Constitution is clear: social and economic rights — as embodied in the Declaration of Principles and State Policies, as well as in the Social Justice provisions of the basic law — are not one of the traditional rights like those enshrined in the Bill of Rights, and are mere commands to the state” needing action by Congress.\nDichotomy of rights. Consequently, our Supreme Court (echoing that of the United States) adheres to the “state action doctrine” which generally reserves the application of the Bill of Rights to the public, but not to the private, sphere. Only the state — to the exclusion of private entities and individuals — is obligated to observe and can be held liable for violating basic rights.\nThis dichotomy is justified by the traditional theory that civil and political liberties (like freedom from fear, freedom of speech, of assembly, of religion, and freedom to participate in elections and in the formation of public opinion), are characterized as natural rights while social and economic rights — the anchors of prosperity — (like freedom from want, from afflictions, and the free pursuit of economic activities, competition and vocations), have been shunned as mere inventions requiring affirmative state action.\nThe former are deemed “first generation rights” while the latter, “second generation rights,” are mere inventions of political will rather than essentials sourced from our very humanity.\nEquality of rights. However, citing a formidable bibliography of cases both here and abroad, authoritative publications, journal articles and lectures, and over 20 international covenants, including seven core human rights treaties that the Philippines ratified and constitutionally adopted as part of the law of the land, Pangalangan passionately posits that prosperity rights, like civil and political rights, should now be deemed self-executing rights enforceable by the courts without need of enabling legislation.\nMoreover, repeatedly quoting from Tañada vs Angara (May 2, 1997) and my separate opinion in Serrano vs NLRC (Jan. 27, 2000), he vigorously argues that with the “advent of liberalization, deregulation and privatization … even private individuals [are] sources of abuses and threats to human rights and liberties.” Thus, they should be accountable in the observance of rights to liberty and prosperity.\nHe concludes: “Liberty and prosperity forward common sense in the pursuit of uncommon justice. [They recognize] how civil and political rights are tightly intertwined with social and economic relations — how freedom from fear necessitates freedom from want.”","Mining has several bad effects.

I need the exact measurements!","answer":"The 1879 nautical chart of Bombay Harbor measures 39 x 25 inches (99.06 x 63.5 cm).","context":["1879 (dated) 39 x 25 in (99.06 x 63.5 cm)\nA rare and extraordinary 1879 nautical chart or map of Bombay (Mumbai) Harbor, India prepared by the British Admiralty. Offers extraordinary detail of Bombay harbor from Salsette in the north to Warsole Creek and Veshvee in the south. The city and peninsula of Bombay are beautifully rendered to the level of individual buildings. Notes piers, dock, lighthouses, the observatory, life boat locations, the Lunatic Asylum, the mint, and various workshops and palaces. Miniature palm trees and fields dot the coastline. Also notes topographical features, under sea shoals, swamps, ancient ruins, and forts. The harbor and rivers are dotted with near countless depth soundings in feet. An inset in the lower left hand quadrant details the Fort of Bombay from Old Woman's Island to Carnac Basin. Shows Cornwallis' Statues, the Arsenal, the Coal Depot, the Sepoy Lines, the Marine Battalion Lines, and the Castle. This chart was originally published by the Admiralty in 1864 under the direction of Captain G. H. Richards, Hydrographer. It was updated periodically until 1879 to reflect the work of R. W. Wish, R. Williams, A. L. Brown, A.W. Campbell, Colonel Laughton, and F. W. Jarad. Represents Admiralty Chart no. 2621.\nThe British Admiralty Office (1795 - Present) or the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office refers to the Branch of the English government that is responsible for the command of the British Navy. In 1795 King George III created the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, known in short as the U.K.H.O., to provide top notch nautical charts to the vast Royal Navy. Prior the founding of the Admiralty the surveying and creation of nautical charts was primarily a commercial venture wherein the cartographer himself, more of than not, actually financed the printing of his own material. The great navigator Cook himself is known to have scrambled for funds to publish his own seminal charts - the most important and advanced of the period. The system of privately funded nautical mapping and publishing left vast portions of the world uncharted and many excellent charts unpublished. King George III, responding significant loss in trade revenue related to shipwrecks and delay due to poor charts, recognized the need for an institutionalized government sponsored cartographic agency - the Admiralty. The first head of the Admiralty, a position known as Hydrographer, was the important cartographer Alexander Dalrymple. Dalrymple started by organizing and cataloging obtainable charts before initiating the laborious process of updating them and filling in the blanks. The first official Admiralty Chart appeared in 1800 and detailed Quiberon Bay in Brittany. By 1808 the position of Hydrographer fell to Captain Thomas Hurd. Hurd advocated the sale of Admiralty charts to the general public and, by the time he retired in 1829, had issued and published some 736 charts. Stewardship of the organization then passed to Rear Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort. It was under Beaufort's administration that the Admiralty truly developed as a \"chart making\" as opposed to a \"chart cataloging\" institution. Beaufort held his post from 1829 to 1854. In his 25 years at the Admiralty Beaufort created nearly 1500 new charts and sponsored countless surveying and scientific expeditions - including the 1831 to 1836 voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle. By 1855 the Admiralty's chart catalog listed some 1,981 charts.\nGood condition. This map is all in all, in extraordinary condition.

{"question":"How should I feed my betta fish to keep it healthy, and what are the signs of constipation I need to watch out for?","answer":"For a healthy diet, you should use betta pellets as the main food rather than flakes or freeze-dried bloodworms. Feed pellets every day with one weekly fasting day (e.g., feed Monday through Saturday, skip Sunday). Freeze-dried bloodworms should only be used as treats since they can cause bloating and lack complete nutrition. As for constipation signs, watch for an enlarged, swollen stomach and reduced fish waste in the tank. If constipation occurs, fast the betta for 1-2 days, then feed a tiny piece of peeled pea until the swelling decreases. After recovery, maintain a varied diet of betta pellets, brine shrimp, and flake food, feeding small amounts twice daily.","context":["Tank: good.

It's much more accurate that way, especially since your tank is acrylic and not glass. I have an in tank thermometer and a stick on one side by side, and right now the outside one says 71, and the in tank one says 76 - which is where I want it to be. If I was relying on the outside one, I'd think my girl was freezing and crank up my heater possibly frying her.\nFeeding flakes and bloodworms isn't the best diet. I am guessing that you are talking freeze-dried blood worms? They are a good treat, but should not be used as a staple because they can cause bloating and do not have all the nutrients. You should feed them as a supplement. Did you say you are feeding bloodworms every other day?\nI recommend using some kind of pellet made for bettas as a staple. New Life Spectrum (NLS) makes good betta pellets, as does Omega One.\nAlso, not many bettas like flakes, and mostly only eat them when they have nothing else. Pellets ever day should be used instead of flakes every day.\nYou should also feed every day, and have a \"fasting\" day once a week. like, feed monday through saturday and then not feed sunday.\nMy male won't have anything to do with flakes or freeze-dried bloodworms. It's pellets or nothing for him, and yes, he would rather starve than eat those.\nMy female on the other hand, was a flake lover, but they were causing bloating problems and a dirty tank (flakes can be VERY messy), so it took me a while to find a pellet she likes.\nAfter having done both flakes and pellets, I highly recommend pellets, there is much less mess. Flakes get soggy and break apart and dirty up the water very quickly and it's very hard to get out all of the little pieces they don't eat. Uneaten food rots very quickly and can turn just changed, clean water toxic very fast.","A Choodle is a Chihuahua and a Toy Poodle mixed-breed dog.

Adjusting the water temperature to 78 to 80 degrees is a simple solution to the problem. If the betta fish does not respond to the correct water temperature, then a betta fish disease is the likely cause of the symptoms. Review caring for betta fish guides to ensure the health of the fish.\nFin and Tail Rot\nBetta fish display very interesting features, especially their striking colorful, flowing fins and tails. Unfortunately, fin and tail rot often strike betta fish. The disease is the result of bacteria build-up from infrequent water changes. Leftover food and feces causes stress in bettas and their tails and fins begin to rot.\nJagged, torn fins and tails are symptoms of the disease. Eventually the fins and tail disappear completely and the betta is unable to swim, leading to death. The first thing to do when fin rot appears is to change the water and clean any ornaments or plants with hot water. Fin and tail rot is also contagious, infecting any other fish.\nThe most common medications for fin and tail rot are Tetracycline and Maracyn. These medications are available at pet stores. Adding about ¼-teaspoon aquarium salt to a one-gallon tank often helps with healing.\nOne of the most common betta fish diseases is constipation. It causes death in betta fish if left untreated. An inappropriate diet of too many bloodworms, not enough variety, or overfeeding leads to betta fish constipation. The symptoms of a constipated betta fish are an enlarged, swollen stomach and little fish waste appears in the tank.\nTreatment of betta fish constipation requires no medication but a simple diet change and fasting. To cure betta constipation, do not feed the fish for one to two days. After fasting, feed the betta fish a tiny piece of a peeled pea until the abdominal swelling decreases.\nWhen the betta fish is having normal bowel movements, feed a variety of betta pellets, brine shrimp, and flake food. A couple pellets or flakes in the morning and at night are all betta fish require. Fast the betta fish once per week to allow its system to remain clear and prevent constipation.\nA small parasite causes ich in betta fish. Stress caused by changing water temperature is the most common cause of ich and it is extremely contagious. The symptoms appear as tiny white dots covering the betta’s body. The betta will hold its fins tight to the body, stop eating, and start rubbing against ornaments in the tank.\nTreat the entire fish tank if ich is present. Ich is usually fatal but if diagnosed and treated soon enough, it can be cured. Begin treatment by raising the water temperature to 85 degrees and change the water throughout the 14-day treatment period. Coppersafe, Maracide, and Aquarisol are the medications needed to treat ich. Continue the medication for the full two weeks even if the white spots disappear."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8affe253-fe82-4344-9c51-a3bfa32b2b03>","<urn:uuid:4171ca61-6dc8-4eb6-8b4b-71ae277b646a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which method combines better sanitation and water treatment: emergency toilet bags or distillation?","answer":"Distillation is the most comprehensive method as it both kills and removes biological contaminants while also protecting against a broad spectrum of other contaminants. It can even desalinate ocean water and provide high-purity drinking water for extended periods. In contrast, emergency toilet bags (plastic bags lined with disinfectant and deodorant like cat litter) only contain waste and prevent immediate contamination but don't actively treat or purify anything. While both methods are useful in emergencies, distillation is the only FEMA-recommended method that provides complete purification, whereas toilet bags are merely a temporary containment solution that must eventually be disposed of through burning or burial.","context":["Week 8 of 52: Emergency Sanitation\nWelcome to this on-going series entitled “52 Weeks to Preparedness.” Each week, we will share the week’s action plan, authored by Tess Pennington of Readynutrition. This step-by-step plan provides an organized method of increasing family readiness.\nThis week’s installment is called “Week 8 of 52: Emergency Sanitation.” If you missed week 7, “Basic Home Security” you can find it here.\nWeek 8 of 52: Emergency Sanitation\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like if your trash wasn’t picked up each week? Have you thought of how you dispose of it? What would happen to your town if trash was left to sit out in the sun to bake for weeks on end without anyone showing up to take it away?\nThe odor alone would be enough of a nightmare to face, but what about what is inside the trash itself (i.e., dirty diapers, contaminated medical supplies, rotting meat and food)? This type of situation would cause E. coli and bacteria to invade most everything that you touch. If a situation like this was allowed to fester, the potential for diseases and epidemics would create an entire new disaster to be dealt with.\nNo one really wants to discuss sanitation because it’s an unpleasant and dirty subject; however, it is one of the most important areas to focus on when preparing for a disaster. In a disaster where water resources are compromised, people within a 50 mile radius could be adversely impacted by illness and disease just if one person handled the trash improperly. When trash cannot be picked up, it must be burned or buried by you; however, municipalities cannot risk contamination to the water source or soil from people who incorrectly bury their debris, so it is important to know how to properly dispose of your waste products.\nIf you find yourself in a situation where toilet paper is not available, you may have to resort to a more natural method of being hygienically clean. Below is a list of toilet paper alternatives for an emergency situation.\nToilet Paper Alternatives\n- Phone books\n- Unused coffee filters\n- Corn cobs (That’s right- Corn Cobs)\n- Dilapidated kitchen towels (no longer used for cleaning).\n- Bed linen strips\n- Mail order catalog\nDon’t forget that women need to have sanitation items stored for emergencies. Prevention is the key to spreading communicable diseases, so prepare appropriately. If water services are interrupted during a short term emergency, consider these alternatives:\n- Clean and empty the water of the toilet bowl out.\n- Line the bowl with a heavy-duty plastic bag.\n- Once the bag has waste, add a small amount of disinfectant and deodorant (e.g. cat litter) and securely tie the bag and dispose of it.\n- A large plastic trash can (lined with a heavy duty bag) can be used to store the bags of waste. Once waste services begin, the city will come and collect these.\n- If waste services do not begin, then you may need to consider burning or burying your waste. If you decide to do so, there are factors you need to consider. Click here to learn more.\nLong Term Disasters\nSanitation during a long term disaster requires the same sanitation supplies used in a short term disaster; however, a more permanent structure, (e.g., a latrine) must be put into place for long term use.\nHaving a sanitation kit ready for a disaster is essential to keeping your family and neighbors healthy. These kits fit easily into a bucket, and they are affordable. Also, having a natural alternative to cleaning yourself is a proactive way to prepare for better sanitation practices. This article shows you ways of making your own hand sanitizer by using natural ingredients.\nYour suggested preps to buy this week will specifically target creating a sanitation kit.\nPreps to buy:\n- Disposable bucket or luggable-loo\n- Toilet paper (1 roll per family member for each week)\n- 1-2 rolls of paper towels\n- Diapers for infants\n- Additional infant supplies (baby wipes, diaper rash cream, etc)\n- Rubber gloves\n- Sanitation items for women (at least one- month supply)\n- Garbage bags with twist ties ( i.e., to line toilets or luggable-loo)\n- Cat Litter or absorbent material (i.e., saw dust or dirt)\n- Baking soda (for eliminate odors)\n- Soap or antibacterial cleanser (one per family member)\n1. Create a sanitation kit for your family.\n2. If you are preparing a sanitation kit with infants in mind, ensure that you have accounted for their short- and long-term needs (see list above).\n3. Familiarize yourself with different methods of handling the sanitation problems that arise during short- and long-term emergencies.","Editor’s note: This is the continuation of a two-part article from last month. To read part one, click here.\nKnow the FEMA and Red Cross recommendations\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross have created a comprehensive document that explains how to treat water during an emergency situation. FEMA recommends three methods for treating water during an emergency situation: Boiling, chlorination and distillation. Water treatment professionals should be well versed in these recommendations and should recommend the document to clients. Every home in the U.S. should have a copy of this pamphlet printed out and stored in a safe place for reference if the power goes out. Download this document at http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/f&web.pdf for free.\nUnderstand the science behind the FEMA and Red Cross recommendations\nIt is not enough to know what FEMA and the Red Cross recommend. It is also important to understand why these recommendations are in place. Only by understanding the science behind the recommendations can people understand how to prioritize water concerns and how to properly use the tools that they have. When things go wrong, people have to be able to adjust to real-world conditions and this means that they need a higher level of understanding. This information can be presented in a simple and straightforward way that average people can understand.\nThe following information needs to be conveyed in as simple terms as possible:\n- During an emergency situation, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, the water coming from your tap can become dangerously contaminated without your knowledge, or it may stop flowing all together. You may not know whether your water is contaminated or not, so take precautions.\n- Having a supply of safe and clean drinking water is vital to your family’s safety. It is at the top of the list and is more important than food.\n- Water safety and cleanliness is the only priority as it pertains to water. Do not get distracted with concepts such as alkaline, structured or clustered water, or anything else.\n- There are five primary categories of contaminants that can be in water: Particulates, biological, inorganic, radioactive and organic. Biological contaminants, including bacteria, parasites and viruses, are usually much more dangerous than the other types of contaminants. The difference is significant. Biological contaminants can make you ill or can even cause death within hours or days.\n- While most people have experienced a stomach bug, in our day-to-day lives a stomach bug is usually just an inconvenience. We drink plenty of water and get plenty of sleep and we get better. But, when you are unable to drink plenty of water, such an illness can quickly become dangerous and incapacitating.\n- It is important to understand that FEMA and the Red Cross recommend boiling, chlorination and distillation as the core methods for treating water during an emergency because of their concern over biological contaminants. There is no room for error when it comes to biological contaminants, especially during an emergency situation. This emphasis on protection from biological contaminants is very important.\n- This emphasis on biological contaminants is the reason filters are not recommended by FEMA and the Red Cross as a core method for treating water during an emergency. Filters provide variable protection and should be used only on potable water. Filters, including reverse osmosis filters, can become a breeding ground for bacteria. When filters fail, contaminants can pass through to the filtered water without your knowledge. There is a proper way to use filters, however, which we will get to.\n- Also not mentioned are ultraviolet (UV) lights and ozone, which cannot be counted on to produce the highest level of protection against dangerously contaminated water, especially if the power goes out. FEMA and the Red Cross specifically say to not use any chemicals other than chlorine.\n- You are able to exceed the FEMA/Red Cross recommendations if you take the correct steps. While biological contaminants are the most dangerous, other types of contaminants can also be very dangerous and can be released into the environment in large quantities during an earthquake or hurricane. You should understand the proper priorities: Priority No. 1 is absolute protection against biological contaminants. Priority No. 2 should be protection against all other types of contaminants, as long as Priority No. 2 does not interfere with Priority No. 1.\n- When looked at in this way, we can further analyze the FEMA-recommended methods for treating water. Boiling water is an excellent method for killing biological contaminants in water, but boiling water does not remove biological contaminants or endotoxins created when biological contaminants die, and boiling can actually concentrate other contaminants such as heavy metals. Chlorination also kills biological contaminants in water but does nothing to remove dead biological contaminants or other contaminants. Again, even though the process of boiling water may concentrate other contaminants, its effectiveness against biological contaminants makes it an essential treatment method.\n- Distillation, which is the process of boiling water and then capturing the pure steam and condensing it back into liquid water, is the only process recommended by FEMA and the Red Cross that kills and removes biological contaminants, while also protecting against a broad-spectrum of other contaminants. Distillation provides high-purity drinking water for as long as needed and can be a permanent method for desalinating ocean water. Distillation requires fuel, such as propane or a wood fire.\nKnow what to recommend and what not to recommend\nSo, what should you recommend? Everyone should have at least a two-week supply of bottled water. Beyond this, however, everyone should have a means to boil water and should have bleach on hand so they can disinfect water. Ideally, a person should have an emergency water distiller stored away because this will provide the highest level of protection and is the only method that allows people to convert ocean water into pure drinking water. There are two leading emergency water distillers on the market today. While filters should not be used as a primary treatment method during an emergency, filters can be effective at removing some contaminants prior to using one of the FEMA/ Red Cross recommended methods. For example, you can filter water and then boil or chlorinate the water, but you must know that the FEMA/ Red Cross recommended methods should always be used as the final step in treating the water. Do not boil water, for example, and then filter it because the filter could re-contaminate the water.\nUnderstand the tools that are available to you\nThere are three primary tools available to educate people about the proper way to treat water during an emergency. First, the FEMA/ Red Cross pamphlet located at fema.gov/pdf/library/f&web.pdf. Second, at WaterInAnEmergency.com you can download a free e-book called, “Understanding FEMA & Red Cross Recommendations for Treating Water in an Emergency.” People should print this e-book out and store it in a safe location. Not only is this e-book free, but it can be distributed to anyone. Third, also at WaterInAnEmergency.com, people can purchase a laminated quick-reference guide that provides a condensed resource for information on how to ensure a supply of safe drinking water during an emergency. This should be stored with an emergency kit.\nEducate your clients and take a leadership role\nOn a final note, I want to emphasize that by doing some education you can make a significant impact on people’s lives. This education, however, needs to take place before an emergency happens. Afterwards is simply too late. Blog about it. Talk about it. Encourage people to download the FEMA brochure, or email the e-book mentioned above. Reach out to local emergency management agencies and city councils. Take a leadership role in your local community. Beyond this, I encourage the water treatment industry to develop training materials for water treatment professionals.\nGlenn Meder is the president of GAEMRIC Inc. and is the inventor of the Survival Still, emergency drinking water system (www.SurvivalStill.com).

Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage is associated with a rapid increase in its level and with an increased ability of p53 to bind DNA and mediate transcriptional activation. Upon low or repairable levels of DNA damage, p53 mediates delay or arrest of replication to give the cell the opportunity to repair the damage before its fixation and propagation. Upon high or irreparable DNA damage, p53 promotes apoptosis. Mutations of the gene which inactivate some or all of p53´s functions provide a selective advantage for clonal expansion of neoplastic cells.\nFunctional p53 must be tightly regulated and the mdm2 (murine double minute 2) gene plays an important role in this regulation. The transcription of the mdm2 oncogene is induced by the p53 gene after DNA damage. The MDM2 protein then binds to p53 and downregulates it in an autoregulatory feedback loop. MDM2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity, promotes nuclear export to the cytoplasm and rapid degradation of the p53 protein. It, therefore, plays a crucial role as a regulator of p53 in early embryonic development and for recovery of cellular proliferation after repair of DNA damage.\nThe aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and type of p53 and mdm2 alterations in ovarian cancer and to correlate the results with clinico-pathological variables, response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome of the patients.\nMethods: 178 cases of primary epithelial ovarian cancer, snap frozen and stored at -80°C, were used in this study. Mutations of the entire p53 coding sequence (exons 2-11) were analyzed by SSCP (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism) and DNA-sequencing. p53 protein expression was analyzed immunohistochemically with the monoclonal Ab DO7 in frozen tissue sections. p53 was considered to be overex-pressed, if more than 10% of the nuclei in the sections showed immunostaining. Clinical follow-up of the ovarian cancer patients was documented up to 12 years. In the total cohort, the median time of follow-up was 31 months and among the survivors, 52 months. 74 patients who received Cis- or Carboplatin in combination with Cyclophos-phamide were evaluated for platinum-sensitivity.\nAnalysis of the mdm2 gene for alternative splicing was performed by using PCR amplification of full length mdm2 cDNAs. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA, and then the cDNA was amplified by nested PCR. Cases with RT-PCR products other than the full length mdm2 cDNA were cloned into a pCR 2.1 vector and\n151sequenced or the PCR products were directly sequenced. p53 and mdm2 splice variant cDNAs were cloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector. p53 and MDM2 full length and mdm2 splice variant proteins were expressed in vitro by transient transfection of the pcDNA3 constructs into HeLa-cells. The HeLa cells had been previously infected with the vTF7-3 virus, a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase.\nResults: p53 mutations were seen in 56% (99/178) of the ovarian cancer cases of which 72% were missense mutations. p53 overexpression (> 10% positively stained nuclei) was seen in 62% (110/178) of cases. 62% of the p53 mutations were located in the evolutionary highly conserved domains of the gene. p53 mutations were significantly correlated with shortened time to progression (p=0.028) and poor overall survival of the patients (p=0.015). Comparing clinical outcome of patients with mutations in highly conserved domains with those who had either wildtype p53 or a mutation in a nonconserved domain, the difference in time to progression (p=0.007) and overall survival was even more obvious (p=0.005). Furthermore, time to progression and overall survival were seen to be shorter in patients with p53 overexpression as compared to normal p53 expression, but the results only reached marginal statistical significance (p=0.073, p=0.058). Patients with p53 overexpression (p=0.001) or p53 missense mutations (p=0.008) were significantly more often platinum resistant than patients without p53 alterations. Overall, the most favorable prognosis in terms of overall survival was seen in patients who had wildtype p53 sequence and normal p53 expression, as opposed to those who had either one or both alterations of the p53 gene and protein (p=0.007).\nBesides p53 mutations 45 sequence alterations were identified and considered polymorphisms. The codon 72 arginineproline polymor-phism was identified in 5% (9/178) of the cases. Furthermore, alterations were found at codon 36 (exon 4), codon 213 (exon 6), codon 224 (exon 6), and codon 231 (exon 7). The 16 basepair repeat polymorphism of intron 3 was identified in 14% (24/178) of the cases. Three novel intron alterations were identified by sequencing the introns 6 and 10. A gc nucleotide exchange at position 13964 in intron 6 was found in two cases. An at polymorphism was found at nucleotide 17708 of intron 10 in a frequency of 1.1% and a ct polymorphism at nucleotide 18550 of intron 10 in a frequency of 2.3%. Both intron 10 polymorphisms were confirmed in normal tissue of the patients. Most of the cases (7/8) with intron 6 or intron 10 polymorphisms showed p53 over-expression.\nThe mdm2 gene was neither amplified nor overexpressed in any of the ovarian cancer cases. An mRNA transcript of 7.4 kb, 5.5 kb and 2.8 kb was seen at normal levels in all ovarian carcinomas. However, mdm2 alternative or aberrant splicing was\n152seen in 66/92 (72%) of the ovarian carcinomas, 7/9 (78%) of borderline tumors, 5/6 (83%) of benign ovarian cystadenomas and 11/20 (55%) of the normal ovarian tissues. A total of 30 splice variant sequences were identified. 67% of these had a partial and 7% a complete loss of the p53 binding site. 28/30 splice variants do not splice at exon/intron boundaries but use cryptic splice sites within exons and were therefore considered aberrant splice variants.\nA 654 bp splice variant (mdm2-b) was expressed in 41% of ovarian carcinomas, but only in 1/9 (11%) borderline tumors, none of the benign cystadenomas, and 1/20 (5%) normal ovaries. This splice variant splices out exon 4-11, including 90% (81 of 90 amino acids) of the 3‘end of the p53 binding domain as well as the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the nuclear export signal (NES). Expression of this splice variant in ovarian carcinomas was significantly correlated with poor grade of differentiation (p=0.004), residual tumor after surgery (p=0.004), and high S-phase fraction (p=0.016) of ovarian carcinoma. Presence of mdm2-b was furthermore correlated with p53 protein overexpression (p=0.018). A small splice variant of only 221 bp, which has lost most of the functional mdm2 domains was present in only 16% of the ovarian carcinomas but in 5/9 (56%) of borderline tumors, 1/6 of the cystadenomas, and interestingly also in 8/20 (40%) of the normal ovarian tissues. The 221 bp splice variant was correlated with early stage of ovarian cancer (FIGO I and II) and longer overall survival (p=0.048).\nThe absence of the full length mdm2 transcript respectively, the presence of mdm2 splice variants in general were correlated with a higher proportion of ovarian carcinomas, which were resistant or refractory against a platinum-based chemotherapy but were not correlated with survival.\nDepending on the diagnosis for which the patient underwent surgery, different mdm2 RNA splicing patterns were seen in normal ovarian tissue. The presence of splice variants in the unaffected normal ovary was significantly correlated with the diagnosis of gynecological cancer, either in the contralateral ovary or in the uterine cervix or endometrium (p=0.017).\nConclusions: p53 mutations are present in more than 50% of epithelial ovarian carcinomas and are associated with early progression and shortened overall survival. Mutations in evolutionary conserved domains correlate with significantly shorter survival, compared to mutations in nonconserved regions and p53 wildtype sequence. p53 protein overexpression reached only marginal statistical significance as a predictor of clinical outcome. With multivariable analysis however, p53 alterations were not an independent prognostic factor. Evaluation of adjuvant treatment showed that p53 overexpression as well as p53 missense mutations were correlated with resistance to\n153platinum-based chemotherapy. This provides further clinical evidence that the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells for Cis- or Carboplatin depends on the efficient induction of apoptosis mediated by a functional p53 protein.\nmdm2, which inhibits p53‘s transcriptional activity and downregulates it in an autoregulatory feedback-loop by promoting nuclear export and rapid degradation of the protein, was found to be frequently altered in ovarian carcinomas. mdm2 alternative and aberrant splicing was found in the majority of ovarian carcinomas and borderline tumors, but also in cystadenomas and normal ovarian tissue. A distinct difference in patterns of splice variants was notable in comparing benign and malignant tissues. While the mdm2-b splice variant was found in nearly 50% of the ovarian carcinomas and was associated with more advanced and histologically more aggressive tumors, smaller size variants were typically seen in early stage ovarian carcinomas and benign tissues.\nThe mdm2 splice variants mostly lack part, or all of the p53 binding sequence. mdm2 alterations appear to stabilize p53 protein and may cause p53 accumulation in the absence of p53 mutation. If these results are corroborated by other investigators, alterations of mdm2 may be considered to be an important step in carcinogenesis and may have important implications for the response to chemotherapy and clinical course of ovarian carcinomas.\nSince most of the mdm2 splice variants lack various functional domains of the gene, such as the p53 binding site and the nuclear localization signal, the purpose of the alternative splicing remains unclear. But the fact that splicing is found in the majority of ovarian carcinomas and splice variants of identical sequence occur throughout this cancer cohort and in benign tissues, suggests that these splice variants have distinct, as yet unknown functions and are not simply a by-product of RNA processing.\n© Die inhaltliche Zusammenstellung und Aufmachung dieser Publikation sowie die elektronische Verarbeitung sind urheberrechtlich geschützt.

{"question":"How do the Endangered Species Act's protections and ecopassages' benefits apply differently to small versus large animals?","answer":"The Endangered Species Act provides general protection for all endangered species regardless of size, prohibiting their killing and habitat destruction. In contrast, ecopassages are specifically designed with different structures based on animal size - underpass tunnels are built for small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, while overpasses and green bridges are designed for larger or herding animals.","context":["Last week, Ontario’s Divisional Court upheld a ruling, challenged by Ontario Nature and Wildlands League, which removes two core provisions from the Endangered Species Act. Lara Tessaro, lawyer with Ecojustice, stated of the decision, “It takes out the heart of what the Act is.”\nThe regulations target sections 9 and 10 of the Endangered Species Act which in summary prohibits the killing of endangered species in Ontario and prohibits damage to the habitat of endangered species. The regulation exempts major industry such as forestry, mining or energy development from complying with those sections.\nHowever, the regulations may exempt myriad industry and developments. “People engaging in all kinds of harmful activities have been exempted – not just giant mines, but even early mining exploration which people consider a less major development. But from a species survival situation that isn’t always the case. An urban housing development, for example, can be just as devastating to their survival as a mine,” remarked Tessaro.\nThe ruling provides that industry is required to meet some standard of conditions but Tessaro argues that the criteria works to a lower standard of protection.\n“Mining activities are accepted if steps are taken to lessen the amount of killing and habitat destruction caused by the industry,” she explained. “Prior to the regulation, industries would have to prove that even though they might be causing some harm to the species that the activity would have an overall benefit to the species. Now all the company has to do is show that they are lessening the harm to that endangered species. We argued that it undermined what the purpose of the Act is about, which is not to do with lessening the harm to endangered species, but protecting them. The Court did not agree.”\nWhen it was established in 2007, the Endangered Species Act was lauded as the ‘Gold’ standard for its’ protection of endangered species as well as for the flexibility it afforded for development.\nCaroline Schultz is the executive director with Ontario Nature.\n“In our view the regulation actually undermined the intent of the Act to protect and recover species at risk,” she remarked. “Having legal protection for endangered species is paramount. The Act was all about balancing and being able to proceed with certain activities but also making sure that there was compensatory action taken so that the species was better off. This Act, prior to the regulation, provided a lot of opportunity to work out solutions.”\nOver the past five years Schultz, as well as various conservation entities, observed a gradual slide away from the government’s commitment to the Act. Schultz offered her thoughts about why this may have occurred.\n“There wasn’t enough dialogue with partners and stakeholders about innovative ways to implement the Act. I think the government made a big problem for itself with the way it was implementing and then decided that everything was way too expensive and cumbersome. That’s why they attempted to pull back and they tried to do that by gutting much of what the Act provided for.”\nSchultz expressed concern regarding the fate of all endangered species but specifically spoke about the threat to Ontario’s six herds of caribou.\n“Unless forestry industries are required to reduce their ecological footprint we know that the woodland caribou will decline. Unfortunately now with the regulations we have in place, the Endangered Species Act is of no help in reducing that footprint,” remarked Schultz.\nAccording to Schultz, the habitat of two woodland caribou herds overlap with industrial forest operations. Government research shows that these two herds will not survive. As for the remaining four herds- their survival rate is 50/50.\n“Without the intervention of the Endangered Species Act that actually requires Forestry to operate in a way that won’t affect caribou- those odds are pretty poor. Over a century, caribou habitat has shrunk northwards with forest activity. We do believe that forestry and caribou can exist but it means large protected areas and not going in to critical caribou habitat. What’s working now for forestry isn’t working for the caribou.”\nSo why the ongoing match between environment and industry?\n“It’s not wanting to change practices and fearing that changes are going to affect the bottom line,” mused Schultz. “But the entire jobs versus environment thing is really just a red herring. It’s very clear that the two can co-exist provided we have something like the Endangered Species Act where there is a provision of mechanisms that provide flexibility for both.”\nSchultz challenges that different industry models need to be considered regarding economic and employment gains that can be drawn from the natural environment.\n“The jobs versus environment thing really gets amped up in the North. The North is traditionally a resource extraction based economy. We need to look at a range of economic activities that are still resource based but done in a different way. There are many more opportunities in terms of livelihood that can be derived from the forest other than the traditional approach to forest management. One of the projects Ontario Nature is working on is a Forest and Fresh Water Food program. We’re engaging communities and First Nations in the North to look at the economic potential of harvesting forest products that aren’t timber.”\nTessaro put forward that provisions provided in the Endangered Species Act creates an even stronger economy.\n“Sustainable economic development is economic development that protects the environment. To view economic development and environmental protection as at odds with each other ignores that a lot of our economic strengths comes from having a healthy, clean environment that is rich in biodiversity. The most obvious example is Tourism,” expounded Tessaro. “People come to Ontario and other parts of Canada because -unlike so many other parts of the word, there are still healthy natural areas here. I think Ontarians accept that we need to promote a healthy environment and a healthy economy that go hand in hand.”\nOntario Nature and Wildlands League are considering next steps. The two groups have until June 12th to put forward a request to appeal before the Ontario Court of Appeal.\nPress Release issued by Ontario Nature\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nStatement on Divisional Court ruling on Ontario’s Endangered Species Act\nTORONTO — Ontario’s Divisional Court has upheld a provincial regulation that exempts major industries from the Endangered Species Act and allows them to kill species at risk and destroy their habitat.\n“This is a disappointing decision for Ontario’s endangered and threatened wildlife,” said Ecojustice lawyer Lara Tessaro. “The Endangered Species Act is intended to put species first — not to let their survival be balanced against competing industrial interests. That would tip the scale towards extinction.”\nWhen it was introduced in 2007, the Endangered Species Act was considered the gold standard law for species protection in North America. Unfortunately, recent years have seen Ontario shirk its duties to protect at-risk wildlife.\nIn 2013, the province introduced a regulation that exempts major industries from strict protection standards under the Endangered Species Act — in many cases giving them a free pass to kill endangered or threatened species and destroy their habitat, as long as this harm is “minimized.” To challenge this regulation, Ontario Nature and Wildlands League, represented by Ecojustice lawyers, brought a lawsuit that culminated in a hearing earlier this year.\n“There are too many plants and animals that are teetering on the edge in this province,” said Anna Baggio of Wildlands League. “We will continue to speak up for them until their habitat is protected and until they are no longer at risk of extinction.”\nSome of Ontario’s 155 at-risk species threatened by the regulation include the American Eel, Blanding’s Turtle, Lakeside Daisy, Jefferson Salamander, Eastern Meadowlark, and the iconic Woodland Caribou.\n“In the past 40 years, the earth has lost over half of its wildlife,” said Caroline Schultz. “Today’s ruling certainly won’t help the situation. The prospects for Ontario’s most vulnerable plants and animals just got a whole lot bleaker.”\nThe groups are reviewing the decision and considering their options.\nFor more information, please contact:\nLara Tessaro, Staff Lawyer | Ecojustice: 416-368-7533 ext. 531, 647-462-1834 (mobile)\nAnna Baggio, Director of Conservation Planning | Wildlands League: 416-453-3285 (mobile)\nCaroline Schultz, Executive Director | Ontario Nature: 416-444-8419 ext. 237, 416-768-9795 (mobile)","By: Eric Buiter, Sr. Habitat Technician, Ontario Streams\nIn today’s world of constant progression, with pressures from large scale land alterations from agricultural intensification to urbanization, it seems like we humans are always on the go, always moving forward with shovel in hand. It’s no wonder how in a world that’s constantly moving forward, we tend to forget the needs of the non-humans when we build things, such as our infrastructure. Roads and bridges are designed to make our lives easier, but how do our movements affect how wildlife gets around?\nOur infrastructure may be the problem, but it can also be the solution to protecting sensitive species on the move. With advancements in development and technology, we can design and build better infrastructure to support and benefit nature. We can do this by incorporating “ecopassages” into new and existing roads. These human-made structures can be used to benefit our local critters on their journeys to find new homes, migrate, or search for new areas to find food.\nWhat is an Ecopassage and who else does it benefit?\nAn ecopassage is a structure designed to reduce the risk of danger while wildlife try to navigate about our busy roads. Sometimes referred to as wildlife crossings or corridors, ecopassages usually take the shape of underpass tunnels to help small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians safely move or migrate. In contrast, some ecopassages are designed as overpasses or green bridges that benefit larger or herding animals. Whether big or small, ecopassages are often used in practice by ecologists and urban designers as an effective tool to maintain or reestablish connections between habitats. This strategy is often used to mitigate habitat fragmentation or preserve known migration routes for wildlife. Another benefit to the passages is to reduce the risk of collisions between vehicles and animals, which can be a major threat to human safety. These structures can provide a range of benefits from avoiding collisions with deer, to helping protect some of our endangered reptiles and amphibians as they cross the road.\nWho is our Target?\nWhile ecopassages can benefit a wide range of species, Ontario Streams, an environmental charity based out of Aurora, Ontario, has been working closely on a special amphibian at risk, the Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum). This species of salamander has been designated “Endangered” under Ontario’s Endangered Species Act since 2011. ecologically sensitive areas, while working alongside nature, not against it.\nOntario Streams was awarded a grant from the Ontario Species At Risk Stewardship Program to learn more about Jefferson salamanders, their ecology, how to best support the recovery of the species, and the protection of its natural habitat. With these types of projects, we as humans can better understand how to design our infrastructure to be more beneficial to ecologically sensitive areas, while working alongside nature, not against it.\nProject Highlights and Accomplishments\nFor more information, please visit Ontario Streams’ website or Facebook page.

{"question":"What performance and security trade-offs exist between responsive email design and static posts for website content?","answer":"Responsive email designs and static posts present different performance and security trade-offs. Responsive emails require loading multiple elements from web servers and may face loading delays or image blocking by email clients, which can impact performance. However, they offer greater flexibility in content delivery and customization. Static posts, on the other hand, offer enhanced website performance through pre-rendered HTML and CSS files, resulting in faster loading times and improved speed. From a security perspective, static posts are more secure as they don't rely on server-side processing and are less vulnerable to hacking attempts. They also provide lower hosting costs and reduced resource consumption compared to responsive designs that need to handle dynamic content loading and processing.","context":["What is Responsive Email Design?\nResponsive email design allows your email to look its best no matter where it’s opened – a smart phone’s email app, a web browser on a computer, or an email client such as Microsoft Outlook. Furthermore, every screen is different. Even when the physical dimensions are the same, different resolutions (the number of pixels that can be drawn on the screen) can dramatically change how the content of an email appears. It’s important to ensure your email will look great no matter where – or how – it’s being viewed.\nThe technology behind responsive email design is the same technology behind responsive web design, which allows websites to render correctly on computer, tablets, and mobile devices – HTML and CSS. Different platforms interpret both HTML and CSS slightly differently and some platforms don’t support certain HTML and CSS features that other platforms do.\nThere are many unique considerations to take into account when designing a responsive email. These include:\n- Button Size: The difference between how a mobile screen reads a finger tap and a computer registers a mouse click at a cursor’s location is not insignificant. A mouse click is nearly pixel-precise, while a finger tap covers a broad area and can read differently depending on the angle of the finger, how clean the screen is, whether the user has callouses, etc. Buttons and links should appear much larger on mobile displays, to make responding to your CTA as easy and painless as possible.\n- Content Width: Content designed to work well on a narrow, vertically-oriented display often looks terrible when stretched to fit a desktop window. There are multiple ways to handle this, including setting a maximum width for the displayed content – scaling as needed for the different screen sizes of phones, but only scaling to a certain size, regardless of whether the user has their browser window set to full screen or not.\n- Image Placement and Resolution: Much like content width and button sizes, loading different images depending on how – and where – the email is being viewed is critical to loading your content quickly and beautifully.\n- Content: More and more users are reading their email on the go. Tailoring your content itself, based on whether the user is viewing the email on a phone vs a desktop computer, lets you add an extra level of customization that can make your content shine! Relying on system information available to the user’s email client, It’s even possible to change content based on time of day, the users location, or even weather conditions!\nIt is important to realize that responsive HTML email design – just like a web page – loads some elements from a web server, most notably – images. There’s no real limit to what content you pull from a server – including displaying text from a database, etc. There is a practical limit, however, as you don’t want a user to feel they must wait for an email to load successfully. Some email clients block images until prompted to load them by the user, so make sure your design and copy is compelling enough that the user clicks that “Load Images” button.","Here is your complete guide to what is a static post\nIntroduction What is a Static Post\nIn today’s digital landscape, static posts play a crucial role in creating and managing website content. But what exactly is a static post? How does it differ from dynamic posts? In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the world of static posts, exploring their characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks.

{"question":"How does hospice team provide care at different locations and what are the professional roles involved?","answer":"Hospice care is provided in multiple settings including patients' homes, skilled nursing homes, rest homes, assisted living facilities, and dedicated inpatient facilities. The care team is comprehensive and includes physicians/nurse practitioners, nurses, certified nursing assistants, social workers, hospice counselors, pharmacists, and trained volunteers. These professionals deliver expert physical, emotional, and spiritual support to both patients and families. The team's primary goal is to alleviate pain and control disease symptoms so individuals can live their remaining time to the fullest, while facility staff benefit from the team's expert knowledge and skills in managing end-stage illness.","context":["These Frequently Asked Questions about hospice end of life care are answered below to help clarify the care and services provided for individuals and families living with life-limiting illness. It is our hope that they will also dispel any lingering fears or myths that surround hospice care. Please don’t hesitate to contact us at if you have other questions: 800.662.8859.\nQ. What is the history of hospice movement?\nThe present-day hospice movement was begun by Dr. Cicely Saunders who founded the first modern hospice in London in 1967. Hospital patients who were dying were taken out of isolation and provided with the best medication possible to control their pain so they and their families could address the emotional and spiritual challenges they faced.\nIn 1968 Florence Wald, then dean of the Yale School of Nursing, brought the idea of hospice to the United States. The hospice movement in the United States was engendered by groups of volunteers who worked tirelesesly in communities throughout the country on behalf of this holistic form of health care.\nQ. How is hospice care provided today?\nHospice care is designed to alleviate pain and control the symptoms of disease so that individuals can live their lives to the fullest during whatever time remains. Medical professionals make \"house calls\" to deliver the care with expertise and compassion. In addition to physical care, hospice provides spiritual, social, and emotional support.\nIndividuals today are confronted with difficult choices about health care, particularly at the end of life. Questions of cost, availability, quality, and patient autonomy are debated by families, heath care providers, and politicians. For an increasing number of patients and families, hospice is an enlightened development in medicine, and hospice services are covered by Medicare, Medicaid and most private health insurance.\nQ. What impact has hospice had in the United States?\nIn 2013 in the United States, approximately 5,800 hospices cared for over 1.5 million patients.\nHospice care is a covered benefit under most public and private health plans, including Medicare.\n\"While hope for a miracle cure may not be evident in hospice philosophy,” states Jay Mahoney, former president of the National Hospice Foundation, “hospice care can be an extraordinary expression of hope and individual courage.” This philosophy of hope is at the heart of the hospice movement.\nQ. What is End of Life Care?\nQ. What is Advance Care Planning?\nAs you develop an advance care plan, you will explore your options for care, reflect on those options and your values, talk with your loved ones, and finally, record and share your wishes with loved ones, physician, and others. Your plan may change over time, as your situation or wishes change.\nOptions for care include Palliative Care and Hospice Care, which are philosophies of care focused on quality of life, rather than length of life. Neither is limited to a location or practice, and both address the many ways illness can affect a person's life. Both are available to people of all ages and illnesses.\nQ. What is Palliative Care?\nQ. What is Hospice Care?\nQ. What is Bereavement Care?\nQ. Does hospice only take care of cancer patients?\nQ. How does hospice work?\nHospice care is available also in many skilled nursing homes, rest homes, and assisted living facilities. Facility staff welcome the expert knowledge and skills of hospice staff who can assist with the particular needs of residents with end-stage illness.\nSome hospices also have inpatient facilities where patients with acute medical needs are cared for by hospice trained staff and volunteers.\nQ. Who is the hospice “team”?\nQ. When is it time to refer a patient to hospice and who does it?\nSome physicians may feel uncomfortable bringing up hospice care, so a patient or caregiver should feel free to bring up the topic. In addition to physicians, a patient, friend, family member, or pastor may make a hospice referral. An early referral enables the hospice team to develop the relationships that meet the needs of the patient and caregivers.

A combination of ricotta, mozzarella,\nand Parmesan in just the right proportions, blended with a single egg yolk, gave us the best filling for our ricotta\nIn addition to standard kitchen tools, to make this recipe you will need a standing mixer or food processor,\nparchment paper, and a baking stone. The stone must heat for an additional 30 minutes once the oven has come up\nto temperature; if your oven heats slowly, begin heating it about an hour into the dough's first rise.\nLeftover calzones must be refrigerated; to reheat, heat the oven with the baking stone just as you did when making the recipe,\nthen set the calzones on the hot stone for about 10 minutes. A simple tomato sauce is a nice accompaniment to the calzones.\n4 cups bread flour (22 ounces), plus additional for dusting work surface\n2 1/4teaspoons instant yeast (1 envelope)\n1 1/2teaspoons table salt\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 1/2cups water , plus 1 tablespoon (12 1/2 ounces), 105 degrees\n10 ounces whole-milk ricotta\n8 ounces shredded fresh mozzarella (2 cups)\n1 1/2ounces grated Parmesan cheese (about 3/4 cup)\n1 large egg yolk\n1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano leaves\n1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n2 medium red bell peppers , cut into 1/2 inch by 2-inch strips\n3 medium cloves garlic , pressed through garlic press or minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n1 pound spinach , washed, dried, and stems trimmed (about 4 cups)\n8 ounces goat cheese , crumbled\nExtra-virgin olive oil for brushing shaped calzones\nKosher salt for sprinkling\n1. FOR THE DOUGH (See below for food processor procedure): In bowl of standing mixer, whisk flour, yeast, and salt to combine. Attach bowl and dough hook to mixer; with mixer running at medium-low speed, add olive oil, then gradually add water; continue to mix until mixture comes together and smooth, elastic dough forms, about 10 minutes. Lightly spray large bowl with nonstick cooking spray; form dough into ball, transfer it to bowl, cover bowl with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray, and let rise in warm spot until doubled in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\n2. FOR THE FILLING: Combine ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, egg yolk, oregano, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and black pepper in medium bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until needed.\n3. Heat 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until oil begins to smoke. Stir in red bell peppers and 1/8 teaspoon salt; cook until slightly softened and spotty brown, about 5 minutes, stirring only 2 or 3 times. Clear center of pan; add 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, 1 tablespoon minced or pressed garlic, and red pepper flakes to clearing and mash with back of spoon until fragrant, about 10 seconds, then stir into red peppers. Immediately stir in spinach and 1/8 teaspoon salt off heat; continue to stir until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute. Transfer mixture to paper towel-lined plate and cool to room temperature; once cooled, pat with paper towels to absorb excess moisture and set aside until needed.\n4. Adjust oven rack to lowest position, set baking stone on oven rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and spray parchment lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Turn risen dough out onto lightly floured work surface. Divide dough in half, then cut each half into thirds. Gently reshape each piece of dough into ball. Transfer to baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray. Let dough rest at least 15 minutes but no more than 30 minutes.\n5. Cut eight 9-inch squares of parchment paper. Working with one piece of dough at a time and keeping other pieces covered, roll dough into 9-inch round. Set round onto parchment square and cover with another parchment square; roll out another dough ball, set dough round on top of first, and cover with parchment square. Repeat to form stack of 3 rounds, covering top round with parchment square. Form second stack of 3 with remaining dough balls and parchment squares.\n6. Remove top parchment square from first stack of dough rounds and place rounds with parchment beneath on work surface; if dough rounds have shrunk, gently and evenly roll out again to 9-inch round. Place scant 1/2 cup cheese filling in center of bottom half of dough round. Using small spatula, spread/press filling in even layer across bottom half of dough round, leaving 1-inch border uncovered. Spread 1/6 of pepper mixture over the cheese and then sprinkle with 1 ounce goat cheese. Fold top half of dough over filling, leaving 1/2 inch border of bottom layer uncovered. With fingertips, lightly press around silhouette of cheese filling and out to edge to lightly seal dough. Face seam of calzone toward you. Beginning at left end of seam, place left index finger diagonally across edge and with right thumb and index finger gently pull bottom single layer of dough gently over tip of resting index finger and gently press into dough (double thickness) to seal. Remove index finger from fold and rest in new imprint. Repeat process, working to your right, until calzone is fully sealed. With very sharp paring knife or razor blade, cut 5 slits, about 1 1/2 inches long, diagonally across top of calzone, making sure to cut through only top layer of dough and not completely through calzone. With pastry brush, brush top and sides of calzone with extra-virgin olive oil and lightly sprinkle with kosher salt.\n7. Using scissors, trim excess parchment paper; slide calzones on parchment onto pizza peel or rimless baking sheet, then slide calzones with parchment onto hot baking stone, spacing them evenly apart.\nBake until golden brown, about 11 minutes; use pizza peel or rimless baking sheet to remove calzones with parchment to wire rack. Cool 5 minutes, remove parchment, and serve. While first batch bakes, form second batch, and bake after removing first batch.\nFOOD PROCESSOR METHOD\n8. Made in a food processor, the calzone dough bakes up with slightly less chew than we like, but it offers an alternative method for making the dough if you do not own a standing mixer. The quantity of dough is too large to be made in any food processor that does not have at least an 11-cup bowl.\n9. In food processor, pulse flour, yeast, and salt to combine, about five 1-second pulses. While pulsing, add olive oil through feed tube, then gradually add water; continue pulsing until dough forms ball, then process until smooth and elastic, about 30 seconds. Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface and knead by hand a few turns to form smooth, round ball. Lightly spray large plastic container or bowl with nonstick cooking spray; transfer dough to container, cover container with plastic wrap lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray, and let rise in warm spot until double in size, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.\n10. Continue with recipe from step 2.\nStep-by-Step Making Calzones\n1. With fingertips, press dough ball into 5-inch circle. With floured rolling pin, roll outward from center in all directions until dough forms 9-inch circle. If dough sticks, dust flour under it.\n2. Place scant 1/2 cup cheese filling in center of bottom half of dough round. Using small spatula, spread/press filling in even layer across bottom half of dough round, leaving 1-inch border uncovered.\n3. Fold top half of dough over cheese-covered bottom half, leaving 1/2-inch border of bottom layer uncovered.\n4. With fingertips, lightly press around silhouette of cheese filling and out to edge to lightly seal dough.\n5. Begining at one end of seam, place index finger diagonally across edge and gently pull bottom layer of dough over tip of index finger; press into dough to seal. Repeat until calzone is fully sealed.\n6. With very sharp paring knife or razor blade, cut 5 slits, about 11/2 inches long, diagonally across top of calzone, making sure to cut through only top layer of dough and not completely through calzone."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd3a50ad-4e7d-4398-9ea7-c8edf14e10fb>","<urn:uuid:272d25c1-2291-42de-9d2b-cc8aecbed746>"],"error":null}

Each year, 1 in 6 Americans gets sick by consuming contaminated foods or beverages. Many different disease-causing microbes, or pathogens, can contaminate foods, so there are many different foodborne infections. In addition, poisonous chemicals, or other harmful substances can cause foodborne diseases if they are present in food.\n- More than 250 different foodborne diseases have been described. Most of these diseases are infections, caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can be foodborne.\n- Other diseases are poisonings, caused by harmful toxins or chemicals that have contaminated the food, for example, poisonous mushrooms.\n- These different diseases have many different symptoms, so there is no one \"syndrome\" that is foodborne illness. However, the microbe or toxin enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, and often causes the first symptoms there, so nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhea are common symptoms in many foodborne diseases.\nMany microbes can spread in more than one way, so we cannot always know that a disease is foodborne. The distinction matters, because public health authorities need to know how a particular disease is spreading to take the appropriate steps to stop it.\n- For example, Escherichia coliO157:H7 infections can spread through contaminated food, contaminated drinking water, contaminated swimming water, and from toddler to toddler at a day care center. Depending on which means of spread caused a case, the measures to stop other cases from occurring could range from removing contaminated food from stores, chlorinating a swimming pool, or closing a child day care center.\nWhat are the most common foodborne diseases?\nThe most common foodborne infections from the 2011 Estimates of Foodborne Illness and from those tracked by FoodNet include those caused by:\nCampylobacter is a bacterial pathogen that causes fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. It is the most commonly identified bacterial cause of diarrheal illness in the world. These bacteria live in the intestines of healthy birds, and most raw poultry meat has Campylobacter on it. Eating undercooked chicken, or other food that has been contaminated with juices dripping from raw chicken is the most frequent source of this infection (tracked by FoodNet).\nSalmonella is a bacterium that is widespread in the intestines of birds, reptiles and mammals. It can spread to humans via a variety of different foods of animal origin. The illness it causes, salmonellosis, typically includes fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In persons with poor underlying health or weakened immune systems, it can invade the bloodstream and cause life-threatening infections (tracked by FoodNet).\n(C. perfringens) is a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium that is found in many environmental sources as well as in the intestines of humans and animals. C. perfringens is commonly found on raw meat and poultry. It can survive in conditions with very little or no oxygen. C. perfringens produces a toxin that causes illness.\nNorovirus (previously called Norwalk-like virus) is an extremely common cause of foodborne illness, though it is rarely diagnosed, because the laboratory test is not widely available. It causes an acute gastrointestinal illness, usually with more vomiting than diarrhea, that generally resolves within three days. Unlike many foodborne pathogens that have animal reservoirs, norovirus spreads primarily from one infected person to another, often through contaminated food, water, or environmental surfaces. Infected kitchen workers can contaminate a salad or sandwich as they prepare it, if they have the virus on their hands. Sewage discharge into coastal growing waters have contaminated oysters before they are harvested.\nThe Shigella germ is actually a family of bacteria that can cause diarrhea in humans. They are microscopic living creatures that pass from person to person. Shigella were discovered over 100 years ago by a Japanese scientist named Shiga, for whom they are named. There are several different kinds of Shigella bacteria: Shigella sonnei, also known as \"Group D\" Shigella, accounts for over two-thirds of shigellosis in the United States. Shigella flexneri, or \"group B\" Shigella, accounts for almost all the rest. Other types of Shigella are rare in this country, though they continue to be important causes of disease in the developing world. One type found in the developing world, Shigella dysenteriae type 1, can cause deadly epidemics (tracked by FoodNet).\nSome common diseases are occasionally foodborne, even though they are usually transmitted by other routes. These include infections caused by Shigella, hepatitis A, and the parasites Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidia. Even strep throats have been transmitted occasionally through food. In addition to disease caused by direct infection, some foodborne diseases are caused by the presence of a toxin in the food that was produced by a microbe in the food.\n- For example, the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus can grow in some foods and produce a toxin that causes intense vomiting.\n- The rare but deadly disease botulism occurs when the bacterium Clostridium botulinum grows and produces a powerful paralytic toxin in foods. These toxins can produce illness even if the microbes that produced them are no longer there.\n- Other toxins and poisonous chemicals can cause foodborne illness. People can become ill if a pesticide is inadvertently added to a food, or if naturally poisonous substances are used to prepare a meal. Every year, people become ill after mistaking poisonous mushrooms for safe species, or after eating poisonous reef fishes.\nRead the rest of this detailed article at from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

{"question":"As a beginner looking to start salmon fishing, what equipment do I need and what are the most suitable locations to start in both Scotland and Alaska?","answer":"For Scotland's big rivers (Tweed, Tay, Spey, Dee), beginners should start with a 14-15ft fly rod, such as the Shakespeare Oracle Scandi, a robust reel like the Vision Deep, and a short head Spey line for easier casting. The River Tay at Fishponds is recommended for beginners due to its good instruction and relatively inexpensive permits. In Alaska, the Kasilof River is an excellent starting point for beginners in May and June, as it's a quiet, drift-boat-only fishery. The Kasilof offers a more manageable experience with smaller king salmon (12-35 pounds) compared to the Kenai River, and has a liberal 2 king salmon per day limit due to its strong hatchery program.","context":["Everything you need to know about getting started with salmon fishing\nThis is a comprehensive no-nonsense guide to getting started, if you’re looking to learn how to fish for salmon.\nSo you want to get into salmon fishing but don’t know where to start? Hopefully this guide will help. This is a simple guide to help you get started. I’ve based the knowledge in this article on 16 years as a professional salmon fishing guide throughout Scotland.\nIt can be daunting starting out, where to go, what equipment to use, how to read a river, How to fish for salmon, what is the river etiquette? What Spey casts to use? How much do I tip the Ghillie? The insights are here, please read on:\nLet’s break his down into a step by step guide, beginning with:\nTactics for fishing for salmon\nThe first thing to understand is that salmon do not feed when they enter freshwater. They have two things programmed in their brain, reproduction and survival.\nWhy a salmon takes a fly nobody really can be certain. It’s thought to be a combination of aggression, curiosity and a conditioned response from when they fed in saltwater.\nMake no mistake, salmon fishing is a dark art. You need resilience as blank days are frequent, and determination to keep moving your flies through the pools with method, focus and a clear strategy. Usually you would cast your fly down and across and try to keep a steady swing on the fly, letting the current do the work. As you work through a pool, imagine you are playing battleships and draw a picture in your mind of the river as a god, and your prospecting all the squares hunting a fish. Work through the pool by casting and then taking a step downstream.\nMy best advice is listen to the experts, when you arrive at a river, speak to the ghillie, his advice is invaluable. Remember he lives and breathes his beat of the river, knows where the salmon lies are and importantly at what water level where to fish. Ask him also what tip to add to your fly line (sink rate or floater) and what fly. If you’re a beginner, get him to show you the correct knot for the fly. I recommend a double turle, for salmon fly in doubles (two hooks). Most of all keep it simple, persistence beats resistance and don’t overcomplicate your casting or try too hard to reach that extra few feet. Often fish can be a rod length or two away. Don’t make too much disturbance when wading.\nWhat equipment to use for salmon fishing in Scotland?\nMost rivers in Scotland are fly fishing only, and some allow spinning like the Tay and the Tweed. The sensible thing to do is to ask yourself, do I want to fish one of the big rivers? The Tay, The Dee, Spey and Tweed, r a smaller spate river, like the River Ericht, Orchy or Alness.\nSalmon Fishing Seasons in Scotland\n|Salmon Fishery District||Start of Rod Season||End of Rod Season|\n|1.

You don’t need to spend the earth, a Shakespeare Oracle Scandi 15ft rod will set you back £120.00 on Amazon and its a pretty decent rod, certainly good enough for a beginner to enjoy learning the fundamentals. The Scandi version is my pick (there are other Shakespeare Oracles) is that Scandi (short Spey) lines are easier to cast for beginners.\nIf you’re looking for a robust, great value salmon reel, the Vision Deep ticks many boxes. It will set you back about £80.00 can take a battering, has a decent drag and great line capacity. It does what it says on the tin.\nSo what salmon fly line is best for a beginner? If your setting out, do not use a long head Spey line, i.e. 65ft, opt for a Short head Spey line(sometimes called Scandi lines). These are easier to cast and I can tell you that in my years as a guide I have got literally thousands of people casting lines like this good enough to cover fish in under 30 minutes of tuition. You cannot go wrong with an Arflo Rage Shooting head kit. For £79 this gives you a running line/ short spey line and tips, floater, intermediate and sink tip. This will cover most scenarios and this is an extremely easy line to cast. If you’ve heard about lines called Scandi or Skagit, then this line sits somewhere in between. Take it from me, it’s easy to cast, and hugely versatile.\nSo there you have it. A complete, fly rod, reel and line for £280.00.\nSpate rivers: If you are looking at fishing smaller rivers, then use similar equipment to above but come down to an 11ft 8 weight. This will help you fish in tighter spaces and still give you enough clout to play a bigger multi-wintered fish.\nTippet. Go for Maxima. 15lb for bigger rivers and 10lb for the spate rivers. This line is reliable and tried and tested. It stretches when a fish lunges on a run, and it comes in two colours. Chameleon for peat stained water and Ultragreen for clearer rivers. It also changes colour when the line degrades and oxidises, going a pale pink colour.\nWhat are the best value breathable waders?\nWaders are an item you should be careful buying. Many people buy cheap and pay the price.. many people buy expensive and pay the price too. I cannot see past the Orvis Clearwater waders, they offer excellent value for money, and I would recommend trying them on with thickish socks and wading boots. Make sure you try bending down and standing up and all legs movements are easy and unrestricted. Get the Orvis Clearwater wading boots too, they are superb value, the waders and boots will set you back £368.00 but often Orvis offer deals and discounts, don?t be afraid to contact your local store and ask.\nSo in summary, £650.00 will get you properly set up, and enable you to be tooled up for a day on the river. (Excluding flies and nylon tippet)\nWhich river in Scotland is best for salmon fishing for beginners?\nThis depends where you live, but make sure you select a beat with a good Ghillie, preferably one who holds a casting qualification like SGAIC and therefore can give casting tips and tuition. If you want a more dedicated (one on one) guide for the day, then pay the extra and get a good one. You can meet the guide at the river, use your own gear and he or she can take you through the fundamentals and various casts. This can be invaluable in the beginning, so bad habits don’t set in. Salmon casting can also be physically taxing when you set out. First off you are using muscles and movements that are strange and alien to the norm. Having a guide and casting instructor can help you understand how to put less effort in and more technique, this can save you damaging muscles and getting a repetitive strain injury.\nThe River Tay at Fishponds is one such beat, a gem of a Ghillie in Iain Kirk, a casting instructor and rod designer for Mackenzie Fly Rods, he’s always willing to help. Its good water for learning and relatively inexpensive in the earlier parts of the season (spring and summer)\nWhilst were on the subject of ghillies and guides, it’s customary to tip them. This is the right thing to do and as a general guide, anything from £20-£50 depending on the day you’ve had is the norm. Some grilles are very helpful and get involved and work hard to keep you right, others will show you the pool and hide in the hut, there’s no right or wrong, that’s the way to is, this will help you decide how much to tip. Tipping isn’t mandatory, but if you don’t give them a “handshake’ don’t expect the same level of service next time or any worthwhile help. Ghillies never forget!\nHire a guiding company to take you out, they will provide you with quality fishing tackle, waders, boots, life vest and rain jacket. Well we do that certainly!\nRather than but all the gear and then discover its not for you, you may want to consider hiring a guiding company for your first trip. They will provide you with quality fishing tackle, waders, boots, life vest and rain jacket. This will set you back approx £375.00 for a full day including dedicated guide with you all day, permit, tackle and VAT. Our team of professional fishing guides include SGAIC casting instructors, so if you want to try various combinations fo rods and lines and learn various Spey casts, we can help.\nStewart Collingswood, Orvis Endorsed Guide/ founder Alba Game Fishing Ltd","Kenai River Fishing Through the Season\nKing Salmon May & June\nBefore we start the Kenai River fishing season, we start our salmon season fishing in the months of May and June for king salmon on the Kasilof river. This scenic river is approximately 13 miles south of Soldotna and is a quiet, drift boat only fishery. We fish out of my stable 20 foot willie drift boat, typically back trolling plugs and other baits through the holes where these fish lay. We will fish the Kasilof until early July. The First run King salmon in the Kasilof river average 12-35 pounds, but larger fish are possible. The Kasilof river is home to a strong hatchery program which allows for a liberal 2 King salmon per day limit. These first run Kings fresh from the ocean are fantastic light tackle fighters, and also make excellent table fare.\nKing Salmon July\nStarting in July we switch to Kenai river fishing, where we can target the largest kings in the world out of the comfort of my 20′ Willie Predator powerboat. We fish for these hard fighting fish by back trolling or back bouncing large plugs or spin-n-glos on a jet-diver, utilizing bait when legally allowed. Fishing for Kenai king salmon is not a numbers fishery, however the raw power and sheer adrenaline rush an angler experiences when they hook one of these giants more than makes up for it. The incredible fight these fish put up can defeat even the most experienced angler, although the largest fish of the 2017 season was caught by a 13 year old boy and was 50″ long and an estimated 50 pounds! Just imagine the battle that a fish like this estimated 60 pounder put up. These second run kings are the ultimate sport fish.\nSockeye (Red) Salmon June, July & Early August\nIf the priority for your Alaskan vacation is to bring home a box of fish, look no further than the sockeye salmon. Between 4-7 million of these tasty 6-13 lb fish return to the cook inlet every year, making them the ultimate sustainable resource. They first show up as a trickle in early June as the 1st run fish head to the Russian river, then again in July as the massive 2nd run brings tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of these fish into the river per day. Following these fish is a spike in tourism in July, as tourists by the thousands flock to the public fishing areas. This can make fishing for these fish a stressful, and some times dangerous affair as you stand shoulder to shoulder with other fishermen, all vying for the best spots.\nBy booking a guided trip for sockeyes, we can get well away from the stress of the public fishing areas as we fish the best spots which are accessible only by boat. Here you won’t have to worry about the stranger next to you hooking you or loosing your spot if you step out of the water for a minute to take a break. We use our 20′ Willie powerboats to get you to and from productive fishing spots, and to leapfrog huge schools of these fish as they head upriver.\nWhen fishing for sockeye you can choose to use either top of the line conventional or fly gear provided by myself, and we will teach you the very specific technique used to catch these fish. Typically the limit on sockeye will begin at 3 per person, then late July or early August becomes liberated to 6 fish if AK Fish & Game deems appropriate.\nCoho (Silver) Salmon August/September\nIf I had to pick one salmon to call my favorite, it without a doubt would be the silver salmon. No other fish in Alaska is as fast and acrobatic as a fresh chrome silver. Frequently you spot the silver thrashing on the top of the water before you even know you have one on! These fish can reach weights up to 20 pounds, although average 8-14 pounds. With the light tackle we use these fish are truly a riot! There are many productive ways of fishing for the silvers, and at times you may find us fishing plugs, bobbers, casting spinners or twitching hand tied bunny strip jigs. There are times we can even catch them on fly rods! If you are looking for a good time in August or September look no further than a trip targeting these feisty fish.\nSilver salmon have a delicate, flavorful flesh making them my favorite salmon to eat. When the bite is on, limits of silver salmon can come quickly resulting in full fish boxes and lots of good eating. Often times we will catch bonus sockeye salmon while working on reaching our limit of cohos. The limit is daily at 2 per person in August, and 3 per person after September 1st.\nRainbow Trout & Dolly Varden June 13-October\nThe Kenai River is home to some of Alaska’s largest trout, and is certainly the best drive to trout fishery in the state. Trout season opens in June, and the fishing just gets better as the season goes on, eventually reaching its peak as the salmon begin to spawn in August and September. Trout fishing trips are customizable and I can cater to both fly and spin fishers. Trout on the Kenai river average 12-25″, with larger fish very common. For an angler looking for lots of action this is the perfect trip, as some days we can boat 70-100 fish. By law all trout species on the Kenai river are catch and release only.\nAvailable on even numbered years pink salmon provide plenty of action, and they are a blast on light tackle. At times pink salmon are so abundant you can catch one on nearly every cast. These are a fine eating fish when they are bright and fresh from the ocean. Many people smoke or can these 3-8 pound fish. With a liberal 6 fish limit its easy to fill a fish box when fresh pinks enter the river. This is a great species to target for the angler just looking to bend a rod on many aggressive fish and have a good time.\nThe Kenai river kings are truly special because they are genetically unlike any other king salmon on earth. Historically they reached sizes up to 100 lbs, with the world record 97 lb 4 oz fish being caught by legendary angler Les Anderson in 1985. However, partially because of anglers selectively harvesting the largest fish the average size of the king salmon on the Kenai river has drastically decreased in the last two decades. The average size fish is now less than 50 lb, but each year we tend to catch several over 50 pounds. These are still truly incredible fish, and remain larger than the king salmon caught anywhere else on earth!\nTo do our part as good stewards of this increasingly rare, precious resource we have joined with a growing number of sport fishing guides who promote practicing CPR (Catch, Photograph and Release) on the trophy Kenai Kings. Starting in 2017 all large wild Kenai river King salmon will be released after a quick photo and video shoot. We will still harvest the more numerous small and medium sized king salmon. These fish are much better eating and their genetic removal will not harm the run. Doing this allows these amazing fish to continue on their epic journey and propagate the species. This is our way of doing what we can to save these incredible fish before these genetics are gone to history forever. These giants are truly too rare and special to kill, especially as we come out of a period of low abundance. It also helps to ensure that people can enjoy Kenai River fishing for years to come!\nState law dictates when Kenai River fishing, an angler who decides to harvest a king salmon may no longer angle out of a boat for the remainder of the day. By releasing your fish you may continue to angle, trying your luck at catching an even larger one. It has happened so many times in the past where an angler catches and keeps a king in the first hour of the trip, then is limited to spectating for the remainder of the day as the rest of the clients catch and release king after king, all the while wishing they were still able to wet their line. Our most popular trip is a full day King/Sockeye combo. Spend the morning catching world class king salmon, then loading the fish box with sustainable sockeye salmon in the afternoon.\nAn additional incentive to releasing your King Salmon is offered by Fish For The Future, a non profit organization dedicated to saving the unique genetics of the trophy king salmon that reside in the Kenai river. The organization has shown their dedication by offering weekly prizes and random drawings for photos submitted of King Salmon that were released out of the Kenai and Kasilof rivers. These prizes range in value up to $1000 and include replica fish mounts, prints, halibut and bear viewing charters and more!\nCheck out their page here. http://www.fishforthefuture.net"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:560d23c7-408e-4dd6-b60f-e0a92e6f402d>","<urn:uuid:1f59e17f-ba3d-44f5-8c11-39d8772e98e3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is ankh's symbolism in ancient Egypt, and how was it used as jewelry for protection?","answer":"The ankh was a hieroglyphic symbol meaning life or living in ancient Egypt. It was frequently seen in Egyptian tomb paintings and art, often shown being carried by gods or used to confer life on mummies. Gods were sometimes portrayed touching mortals with an ankh to symbolize conception. The ankh was commonly carried as a protective amulet, either alone or combined with hieroglyphs meaning 'strength' and 'health.' In terms of jewelry use, the ankh served both as a symbolic protective amulet and as a way to display religious affiliation, fitting into the broader cultural practice of wearing jewelry for protection and as magical wards against evil.","context":["The ankh is the Egyptian hieroglyphic character that means life or living. Ancient Egyptian gods are often portrayed carrying it by its loop, or bearing one in each hand with their arms crossed over their chest. It is also known as the Egyptian Cross, or as crux ansata, Latin for \"cross with a handle.\"\nThe ankh appears frequently in Egyptian tomb paintings and other art, often representing deities of the afterlife. An ankh was often carried by Egyptians as an amulet, either alone, or in connection with two other hieroglyphs that mean \"strength\" and \"health.\" Mirrors were often made in the shape of an ankh.\nOver time the ankh has come to symbolize life and immortality. In Egyptian art, gods were sometimes portrayed touching a mortal with an ankh, symbolizing conception, or conferring the gift of life on a dead person's mummy. Its key-like shape encourages the belief that it unlocks the gates of death, and it is viewed this way by the modern Rosicrucians and other hermetic orders. Coptic Christians have used it as a symbol of life after death.\nOrigins and Etymology\nThe is no single definitive interpretation of the ankh symbol by Egyptologists. Unlike most Egyptian sacred images, the ankh did not represent a human-like god with the head of an animal or the disk of the Sun, but a pure symbol of deity, the giver of life.\nDiverse theories for the origins of the ankh include the view propounded by E. A. Wallis Budge that the ankh might have originated as the belt-buckle of the mother goddess Isis. This hypothesis was supported by Wolfhart Westendorf with the notion that both the ankh and the \"Knot of Isis\" were used as ties on ceremonial girdles. Sir Alan Gardiner speculated that it represented a sandal strap, with the loop going around the ankle. The word for sandal strap was also spelled ʿnḫ, although it may have been pronounced differently.\nStill other theories include the notion that the ankh represents the sun crowning over the horizon and thus represents regeneration, re-growth, and renewal. The ankh does appear frequently in Egyptian tomb paintings and other art, often at the fingertips of a god or goddess in images that represent the deities of the afterlife conferring the gift of life. Additionally, an ankh was often carried by Egyptians as an amulet, either alone, or in connection with two other hieroglyphs that mean \"strength\" and \"health.\"\nIt is also believed to represent the path of the sun from east to west with the loop representing the Nile River, a stylized person, or a combination of the male and female symbols of Osiris (the cross) and Isis (the oval), and therefore signifies the union of heaven and earth. Together these symbols reflect a continued existence. The ankh was almost never drawn in silver because the ankh is associated with the Sun, and gold is the metal of the Sun.\nThe ankh appeared in the name of King Tutankhamun, meaning the \"Living Image of Amun,\" who was Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty (ruled 1333 B.C.E.–1324 B.C.E.).\nHermeticism is a belief system that unifies many of the ankh's meanings and may have originated in Egypt. It is unclear whether the Hermetics created the ankh or simply added many meanings. Their concept of God was The All, who purportedly claimed: \"Onus, God, being male and female, beginning as life and light, gave birth, by the Word, to another Onus, the Creator of the world\" (Salaman, 2000).\nIf the interpretation that the ankh suggests the joining of the masculine and feminine is correct, with the top opened up to look similar to a representation of the female genitals and the bottom shaft being a phallic symbol, then the rest may follow. If God is both male and female, the ankh is a symbol of hermaphrodites and can represent God. It also can be representing reproduction as both genitalia are pictured, with Onus having given birth.\nSimilarly, the symbol ♀ was used to represent the Roman goddess Venus. This symbol, known benignly as Venus's hand-mirror, is much more associated with a representation of the female womb. The same symbol is used in astrology to represent the planet Venus, in alchemy to represent the element copper, and in biology to identify the female gender.\nThe Ankh and the Cross\nThe Christian cross, which is today one of the most widely recognized symbols in the world, was not commonly used as a symbol during the first two and a half centuries after the death of Jesus. This was the case because the cross as a means of execution had been used by the Roman Empire for killing slaves and enemies of Rome. In Egypt, however, the indigenous religious symbol containing a cross, the ankh, was a general symbol of a “primal” deity. The ankh became a way that the cross could be pictured without insult to the memory of Jesus. An example of the ankh in transition was discovered in the Fayaom Oasis region on a third century Christian bust, excavated in the 1960s.\nElsewhere, the main Christian symbol at the time had been a stylized alpha, resembling a fish, and therefore known as Ichthys, the Greek word for “fish.” However, the new \"more positive\" symbol of a cross eventually spread throughout the Christianized Empire. The distinct circular or \"gothic arch-like\" upper part of the Ankh was kept well into medieval times. The Ankh symbol has often been used as a Christian talisman.\nThe Ankh in Modern Culture\nThe ankh is one of the best and most widely known symbols of ancient Egypt and it is often used as the graphic synonym for this ancient culture. Due to this context, as well as due to the fact that many pictures of Egyptian gods and goddesses contained the symbol ankh in their hands, this symbol was adopted as a symbol of modern religion called Kemetism (or Egyptian Neopaganism), the contemporary revival of Ancient Egyptian religion emerging from the 1970s onwards.\nMany neo-pagan, New Age, and pagan sects wear the ankh as a symbol of power and wisdom or to show that they honor the Egyptian pantheon. It is commonly seen in jewelry such as rings and necklaces, and despite its earlier uses it is cast in silver rather than gold or copper.\nHippies of the 1960s and 1970s wore it as a life-affirming sign indicating their disdain for materialism.\nIn Gothic subculture the ankh is a symbol associated with vampires. Jhonen Vasquez is known to have used the symbol in mockery of the gothic subculture of today in his work Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. The ankh was worn by David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve as a gold pendant, the bottom part concealing a knife used for blood drinking, in the 1983 film The Hunger, based on Whitley Strieber's novel of the same title.\nElvis Presley wore an ankh necklace during his concert documentary Elvis on Tour while wearing the Blue Nail Jumpsuit. He was also known to wear the Christian Cross and the Jewish Chai. He once remarked, \"I don't want to miss out on Heaven because of a technicality.\"\n- ↑ Mark Collier and Bill Manley, How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs: Revised Edition.

Numerous cultures move wedding dowries in the form of jewellery or create jewellery as a means to store or display coins. Alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good; an example being the use of slave beads.\nJewellery can also be symbolic of group membership, as in the case of the Christian crucifix or Jewish Star of David, or of status, as in the case of chains of office, or the Western practice of married people wearing a wedding ring.\nWearing of amulets and devotional medals to provide protection or ward off evil is common in some cultures; these may take the form of symbols (such as the ankh), stones, plants, animals, body parts (such as the Khamsa), or glyphs (such as stylised versions of the Throne Verse in Islamic art).\nAlthough artistic display has clearly been a function of jewellery from the very beginning, the other roles described above tended to take primacy. It was only in the late 19th century, with the work of such masters as Peter Carl Fabergé and René Lalique, that art began to take primacy over function and wealth. This trend has continued into modern times, expanded upon by artists such as Robert Lee Morris, Ed Levin, and Alberto Repossi.\nRead more about this topic: Jewelry\n...

{"question":"I'm curious about newborn babies - what kind of bacteria do they get in their bodies when delivered via c-section vs natural birth? 🤔","answer":"Infants born via c-section have a microbiome community composed mostly of skin bacteria, while vaginally-born infants have bacteria more similar to their mother's vaginal and gut microbiome. C-section infants are likely to maintain this different microbiome throughout their first year and possibly into adulthood.","context":["Infants born via c-section have a microbiome community composed mostly of skin bacteria [1-3], but the source of these skin bacteria is unknown. People quickly shed bacteria into their environment, leaving their own bacterial signature in a room within hours . Do hospital operating rooms harbor skin bacteria that could colonize c-section delivered infants? A study published earlier this week by Shin et al. in Microbiome addresses this question.\nTo characterize the microbiome of operating rooms, four hospital operating rooms in two different cities, New York, New York and San Juan, Puerto Rico, were sampled immediately after c-section births using culture-dependent and independent techniques. Dust was also examined under the microscope for skin cells. Sampling sites included walls, floors, return air vents, counters, cribs, and lamps above the operating table. Infant skin was sampled 1-7 days after birth in 3 locations and compared to operating room samples as well as human oral, fecal, and vaginal microbiome samples from the Human Microbiome Project datasets.\nOperating room samples were most similar to human skin bacteria, as compared to oral, fecal, and vaginal microbiome samples (Figure 1). All hospital samples were dominated by Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, common human skin bacteria. Lamps had the highest abundance of these two skin bacteria, including live cells that could potentially be transmitted to infants if the lamp is moved. Microscopy revealed human skin flakes in operating room dust samples. Bacterial beta diversity showed microbiome communities clustering by hospital and even differences between two different operating rooms in one hospital. Alpha diversity did not vary between hospitals. These results suggest that there may be differences due to either occupants in an operating room or cleaning regimes.\nSourceTracker  results suggested that the skin microbiome of c-section delivered infants has bacteria obtained from the operating room. In contrast, the microbiome composition of vaginally-born infants is more similar to that of their mother’s vagina and gut microbiome. C-section infants are more likely to maintain a different microbiome than vaginally born infants throughout the first year [2, 3, 6] and perhaps even into adult hood . Since C-section infants are also more likely to develop allergies, asthma, and digestive system disorders, understanding the source of the bacterial inoculum for C-section babies is important to determine. This paper is a first step towards understanding the potential role of the operating room in the colonization of infants during c-section delivery.\n- Dominguez-Bello MG, Costello EK, Contreras M, Magris M, Hidalgo G, Fierer N, Knight R: Delivery mode shapes the acquisition and structure of the initial microbiota across multiple body habitats in newborns.

{"question":"Which security measure is more effective for protecting photos - digital watermarking or multi-factor authentication?","answer":"Multi-factor authentication is more effective for protecting photos. While digital watermarking helps prevent unauthorized modifications to photos by adding a transparent stamp, multi-factor authentication can block up to 100% of automated bots, 99% of bulk phishing attacks, and 66% of targeted attacks according to Google's research. MFA provides an additional layer of security beyond passwords by requiring a second form of verification, making it significantly harder for unauthorized users to access your photos even if they obtain your password.","context":["One of the most important lessons that people have learned in the digital age is that storage can be fleeting. Unless you have a space in the cloud that is attached to a solid vendor or website, you may have already had the experience where you have lost some of your digital photos.\nHere are some tips on how to keep your priceless family photos safe in the cloud:\nPrioritize and Organize Accordingly\nIf you are trying to preserve family photos that have historical value, you might consider getting a digital account at your local bank. Several banks offer this service and will allow you to upload your pictures and save them forever as if it were a digital safe deposit box. The only downside to using a bank is that it can sometimes be a little bit more of a process to add things to your box or remove them because of the extra security. Another consideration is that they tend to cost more than regular web storage.\nFor the bulk of the items that are from everyday photo shoots that you have done, you might consider one of the free or inexpensive sites that allows you to upload a certain number of photos. Google, Apple, Yahoo, and Microsoft are all good examples of companies that have users that uploaded photos for over a decade without losing one piece of data. Which, for most people is a pretty good deal.\nCheck Security on the Sites You Select\nWhile you are choosing a site to put the bulk of your photos on, another consideration that is important is how secure the site is. Plenty of celebrities found out over the past few years that even with encrypted cell phones and secure storage, it is possible for someone to get your passwords and log in and take photos. In the wake of that type of experience, a couple of security notions that became popular are two factor authentication and multiple layers of permission when you share a photo. Two factor authentication is simply a system that uses two types of passwords or login identifiers to make certain that you are who you say. Multiple layers of permission are normally applicable to sites that lend themselves well to social media and let you decide what type of access each person you specify can have. Both types of security are available on most of the popular photo sites.\nUse Digital Watermarking\nOnce you have found a site and started using it, there is one more step that can help in the preservation process: digital watermarking. Digital watermarking is offered on some cameras and some software packages for photo manipulation that come with your camera. It is also a feature of full blown photo editors. It will put a transparent stamp over your photo to the degree that you specify so that you do not have to worry about someone making changes to that photo without you knowing about it. The process is automatic and well worth looking into to preserve your family photos.\nFollow Best Practices When Choosing a Password\nWhen you are getting ready to choose a password for your cloud storage site, it is important that you follow the best practices. Many people make the mistake of using the same password across multiple sites. Many easy to remember passwords can be easily hacked, leaving your confidential and sensitive information exposed to potential thieves.\nIt is best for you to use a unique password across all the sites you have accounts for, including the cloud storage for your priceless family photos. However, you can make certain that you will remember the password that you choose by using the same core term across all sites. You can then add other characters around the core term to make each password unique. For example, if you choose a long word such as “amygdala” as your core term, you can add the name of the site on which it is used to the end. For example, if you are using “amygdala” as your core term for your Facebook password, it can be “amygdalaFacebook.” To make it more unique, add some numbers in between your core term and the site name. For example, your password might then be “amygdala1030145Facebook” for your Facebook password. If you do this for every account that you own with unique site names, it can make it much more difficult for someone else to break your code and to access your information.\nIn addition to using numbers and different passwords for each site, adding special characters to your passwords can also make them more secure. You might want to add the special characters at the beginning of your password or interspersed in the spelling of your core term.\nOverall, the value of having reliable cloud storage for your family photos cannot be underestimated. By organizing, securing, watermarking, and password protecting your collection in the cloud, you will end up with memories that last you a lifetime.","We’re going to give you 8 tips on how to protect yourself online.\nHere’s a rundown:\n- Strengthen Your Passwords\n- Avoid Interacting with Suspicious Emails\n- Don’t Reuse Passwords\n- Activate Anti-Virus\n- Use Multi-Factor Authentication\n- Stop Using Public Wi-Fi\n- Don’t Share Your Passwords\n- Keep Your Devices Updated\nLet’s get into it.\n1. Strengthen Your Passwords\nYour password is the most important key to your sensitive data. When it comes to hacking, there are many methods a bad guy can use, but it all boils down to the strength of your passwords (plus some other things we’ll discuss later). These are the Top 10 Most Used and Exposed Passwords:\nPasswords like these can be cracked in no time at all. For example, a bad actor could use a brute force attack. This refers to a number of different attacks they perform to find credentials.\nEssentially the computer and software do all the work for them while they sit back and wait for a hit. The time it takes will vary on the hacker’s machine, knowledge, and your password strength.\nHowever, it doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. If they know enough about you, they might figure it out themselves. Check out Tip #3 for more information.\nClearly, an unknown person with your information is going to end up bad. Plus, the dark web is full of personal information that is sold by hackers. When someone purchases your login, who knows what could happen. Bad guys can even run stolen credentials to see if they are still active.\nThat’s why it’s important to choose a long password with multiple elements.\nHere’s some guidelines:\n- Upper and lowercase numbers\n- Nonsense words and phrases\n- Memorable to you, but no identifying information\n- 12+ characters\nSometimes it can difficult to remember such long passwords. We recommend purchasing a password manager. This way, your information is only accessible to you and you’re staying safe online.\n2. Avoid Interacting with Suspicious Emails\nWhile your email provider will block most spam, sometimes phishing emails slip through the cracks. You may be more trusting of an email from large companies such as Amazon and Google, but if these emails are unsolicited, grammatically incorrect, or requesting sensitive information, you’re better off ignoring them.\nHere’s an example of an email you might receive:\nWhile some traditional signs of a phishing email are still important, many phishing attempts have evolved. You can still look out for the telltale signs:\n- Spelling or grammatical errors: Sometimes there will be incorrect or missing punctuation, misspelled words, or wrong words. For example, they meant its but typed it’s. In the image above, we can see they spelled “Walmart” as “Wallmart” – a clear sign that this email is spam.\n- Odd phrasing: The senders of phishing emails don’t really care about sounding professional. They use social engineering tactics to distract you from their untrustworthy email. This results in emails with mixed up words or phrases that just don’t make sense.\n- Threats: Phishing emails come to you with a sense of urgency. They mostly make claims such as “Your account is suspended. Reset your password” or “There was a problem with your payment. Resubmit now” or something along those lines.\n- Phony email address: Check the email address. Many bad guys have learned to mask the true address, but many still don’t. If it’s supposed to be an email from Amazon, but you see “firstname.lastname@example.org” then it’s not something you should trust. Some might be from “email@example.com”. If you order often, you’d be right to feel suspicious. In the example above, we can see the incorrect email address with “wallmart” in it.\n- Unsecure redirection or attachment: Phishing emails are designed to make you click on something. This can be an attachment or link. Avoid clicking on anything – a URL can be masked and an attachment can contain malware that activates as soon as a download is complete.\nSecure your digital safety by going straight to the source instead of a link or attachment in a strange email.\n3. Don’t Reuse Passwords\nIn addition to weak passwords, you shouldn’t use the same passwords.\nYou may use the same (or very similar) passwords for everything. Once a bad guy figures this out, he can easily gain access to your accounts and information.\nLet’s say you have a very strong password you created after reading the tips above. Again, you use this password for everything. If a hacker gets ahold of it, your accounts are now at risk.\nFor the best cybersecurity practice, it’s best for each platform to have its own unique password. As mentioned before, you can use a password manager, like 1Password. This will help you keep track of each platform’s login while keeping everything safe.\n4. Activate Anti-Virus\nAnti-virus software is a simple, hands-off approach to detecting and removing malware. If you use the most common operating system, Windows, you can activate Microsoft’s built-in software: Windows Defender. If you want to explore other anti-virus options, there are many popular choices depending on your needs.\nWe recommend running frequent checks depending on your usage. This will range from once a week to once a day. Your anti-virus software will ensure any problems are found and solved quickly, allowing you to stay safe while you’re online.\n5. Use Multi-Factor Authentication\nTypically, when you make an account online, you have the option of adding your phone number, security questions, or some other form of communication. This is for your protection. If there is an unusual log in, the service provider may ask a security question or send a code to your cell phone. This is called multi-factor authentication, or MFA for short.\nIf a bad guy does have the correct password, he will not be able to access your account. Multi-factor authentication will prevent that.\nAccording to research done by Google, adding a recovery phone number to your Google Account can block up to 100% of automated bots, 99% of bulk phishing attacks, and 66% of targeted attacks.\nMicrosoft also encourages multi-factor authentication. For Microsoft accounts, adding MFA can block over 99.9% of account compromise attacks.\nIf you haven’t already, go ahead and add multi-factor authentication to your accounts for advanced online protection.\n6. Stop Using Public Wi-Fi\nMany people think connecting to public wi-fi networks would be harmless. That couldn’t be further from the truth.\nIf you’re on an open network – or even one with a simple password to access – you will never know who is connected to it. This person could use the network to gain access to your device.\nWe recommend doing either of these options:\n- Use a secure VPN\n- Use a secure hotspot\nA VPN will essentially hide your activity from anyone else on the network. It’s like your own secret tunnel. Most people use them for public networks, but you can use them on your home network as well.\nA hotspot is a portable Wi-Fi access point. This can come in the form as a small device or even your mobile phone. When you have a hotspot with a connection, you’ll have secure access to the Internet. Some examples of secure hotspots include Apple iPhone’s mobile hotspot and prepaid mobile hotspots (like the one pictured) that you purchase at major retailers.\nIn conclusion, avoid connecting to public networks. If you must, use a VPN. Remember to never shop online or input sensitive information while on a public network. Using a mobile hotspot will bypass these concerns altogether.\n7. Don’t Share Your Passwords\nSharing your passwords, virtually or face-to-face, could put your information in the wrong hands. No matter how much you trust the person, they may use this password on an unsecure network or infected device. They could seek revenge and do something malicious. Perhaps they will share it with another person that you won’t know about.\nIf you do this in a professional setting, there is even a higher risk. In a recent report, 2 out of 3 (69%) employees share passwords.\nThere are many reasons why this is dangerous.\nYour colleague may be using an unsecured device. Not to mention, they can mistakes using your credentials that could get you in lots of trouble. If a bad guy gets access to your network, shared passwords will make his job much easier.\nTo protect yourself, avoid sharing your passwords with anyone.\n8. Keep Your Devices Updated\nMany people ignore or delay software updates. However, the updates can have important security updates that are critical for cybersecurity.\nSometimes, there might be holes in software that expose security vulnerabilities. Threat actors love an easy way in, so they will take advantage of it. Those who have outdated software become the victims of these exploits.\nIt’s best to keep all your devices up-to-date so you’re always safe online.\nPlus, your experience with be enhanced with new features and improved usability. So why not do it? Dedicating some time to update your device could save you trouble later on.\nMake sure to keep your computer, mobile devices, and applications updated.\nSo what now?\nOur security tips should give you the upper hand when it comes to cybersecurity, so be sure to follow them so you can secure yourself online.\n- Use strong, individual passwords for everything and do not share them\n- Use multi-factor authentication and anti-virus software\n- Avoid public wi-fi\n- Ignore suspicious emails\nHave any questions or comments?

{"question":"Please compare the role of letting go in Buddhist meditation versus non-attachment (vairagya) in Yoga - I want to understand key differences.","answer":"In Buddhist meditation, letting go focuses primarily on releasing present preoccupations with sensual objects and thoughts - you actively cut away distracting thoughts to develop peace of mind, similar to letting go of thoughts to fall asleep. The process involves releasing attachments to the body, feelings, and the notion of self. In Yoga's concept of vairagya (non-attachment), the emphasis is different - rather than actively letting go, it's about not forming attachments in the first place. Vairagya involves losing desire for both worldly objects and even experiences described in scriptures. It's not about forcefully detaching but rather reaching a state where attachment simply doesn't occur. This progresses to supreme non-attachment (paravairagya) where one becomes free from attachment even to the most fundamental building blocks of existence through direct experience of pure consciousness.","context":["Translated from the Thai by\nWhen we meditate, we let go of our present preoccupations. Normally the mind is always preoccupied with the various objects that the eye sees, the ear hears, the nose smells, the tongue tastes, and the body comes into contact with. But when we want peace of mind, we have to see these objects as coarse and gross. We try to let go of things that are gross, things that are sensual. We focus instead on things that are more refined and of more lasting value, step by step.\nWe keep on getting the mind to gather in stillness, keep on letting go of everything else. It's like when we go to sleep: we have to let go of distracting thoughts, we have to stop thinking, have to cut those things away if we're going to sleep in comfort. As long as the mind is in a turmoil over those things and can't let them go, it won't be able to fall asleep. It'll have no sense of ease, won't gain any strength. Even more so when we meditate: we have to cut away all our other preoccupations, let them all go, leaving only buddho.\nAdjust your attitude so that you can find a sense of ease at the same time you're repeating buddho to yourself. Don't let yourself get bored or tired of the meditation. How do you develop a sense of ease? Through your conviction in what you're doing. No matter what the job, if you can do it with a sense of conviction, a sense of respect for your work, you can keep at it continuously. Even if the sun is beating down and you're all tired and worn out, you can keep on doing it. If you do it with a sense of desire (chanda) for the results, a sense of persistence (viriya), intentness (citta), and circumspection (vimansa), you can keep on doing it without getting tired. When you do your work with this attitude, you can keep at it always.\nThis is why our teachers were able to live with a sense of contentment even when they were out in the mountain wilds. They put effort into their meditation with a sense of ease and wellbeing in the peace of mind they were able to maintain through restraining the mind with mindfulness. If their hearts were already inclined to stillness and seclusion, then as soon as the mind had developed its foundation, they were able to keep it going without any difficulties. It became automatic, and they were able to experience a sense of wellbeing — the stillness, the fullness, the brightness of the mind.\nSo adjusting the mind properly in this way is something very important for anyone who wants peace of mind. Keep reminding yourself to develop an attitude of conviction, and this will give energy and encouragement to your efforts. If your conviction, persistence, and mindfulness are strong, you'll be able to win out over any restless, anxious, sleepy, or lazy states of mind. You'll be able to win out over these things through the qualities of mind you develop.\nThe qualities of mind we're developing are like strategic weapons. We develop mindfulness. We develop alertness. We pick out our one object of meditation — \"This is what I'm going to fasten on\" — and then we both keep it in mind and stay aware of it. When we refuse to let go of it, when we hold on tight to a single object, it becomes the quality called singleness of preoccupation. When this singleness of mind arises, it can cut through restlessness, cut through anxiety. It includes both mindfulness and persistence, and can keep the mind firmly gathered in one place.\nWhen this singleness of mind arises, it turns into firm concentration. The mind gets more refined and can let go of everything else, step by step. This singleness is the refined part that holds through all the levels of right concentration. In the first level you have to have singleness of preoccupation in charge. Even though there's also directed thought, evaluation, rapture, and pleasure, singleness of preoccupation has to be there. Directed thought and evaluation are the coarser parts of the concentration. You'll know as the mind gets more refined because it lets go of them, leaving just singleness of preoccupation, rapture, and pleasure. Rapture is the coarsest of these three, so you let go of it, leaving just pleasure and singleness of preoccupation. Pleasure is the coarser of these two, so you let go of it, leaving just singleness of preoccupation and equanimity.\nWhen the mind has a sense of steady equanimity, firm and unwavering... If you want to call it tender, it's tender in that it doesn't put up any resistance to the Dhamma, doesn't resist the truth of things as they are. It doesn't dispute. It's willing to accept that truth. But if you want to call it tough, it's tough in that it's firm and unwavering. Normally, when things are soft and tender they waver and move when they're struck by anything. But when the mind is tender in this way, it becomes tough instead. No one can fool it. It doesn't waver, it's not affected by anything. This is the nature of the mind in concentration. Why doesn't it waver? Because it's seen the truth. It's full. It's not hungry in any way that could make it waver, that could let it get tempted. It doesn't want anything else. We human beings: when we have a sense of enough, we're free.\nFor this reason, meditators need a solid theme that they can hold to. If you don't know or haven't studied much Dhamma, you can simply remember in brief that this body of ours is Dhamma. Every part of it is Dhamma. Conventional Dhammas, formulated Dhammas, all the way up to absolute Dhammas all can be found in this body. So we should pay attention to the body as it's actually present right here. When we know our own body, we won't have any doubts about other people, other bodies. So to give strength to the mind, we should repeat to ourselves any of the meditation themes dealing with the body so that the mind will settle down and come to rest.\nIf repeating buddho, buddho is too refined for you — if you can't find anything to hold to, or don't know where to focus — you can focus on the breath. It's blatant enough for you to fix your attention on it — when it comes in, you know it's coming in; when it goes out, you know it's going out. Or if that's too refined, you can focus on the 32 parts of the body. If you want to focus on hair of the head, repeat kesa, kesa (hair of the head, hair of the head) to yourself. You've seen head hairs, you can remember them, so fix the memory in your mind and then repeat kesa, kesa. For hair of the body, you can repeat loma, loma, and so on. Repeat the names of any of the 32 parts until your awareness gathers in with the repetition and settles down into stillness.\nIf you want, you can focus on any one of the bones. Repeat atthi, atthi. Where is the bone you're focusing on? It's really right there. What kinds of features does it have? It really has them — after all, you've seen bones before. You can remember what the big bones and little bones are like. So call them to mind, focus on them, and repeat their names so as to build a firm foundation for concentration and mindfulness in the mind.\nOnce your foundation is firm and steady from the practice of repetition, you move on to investigation, to insight meditation. You analyze these things to see them as aniccam, or inconstant. Why does the Buddha say they're inconstant? We want them to be constant. We don't want them to change. The Buddha teaches us to let go of them, but we can't let them go — because our views run contrary to the Dhamma. That's why we can't let go.\nThe word \"let go\" here means that we don't hold onto them. Even though we still live with them, we just live with them, nothing more. Even though we make use of these things, we simply use them, nothing more. Even though we make the body move, it's just movement. You have to keep this understanding in mind so that wrong views don't overwhelm you. So that delusion doesn't overwhelm you. As long as these things exist, we make use of them. After all, they're here to use. The Buddha and his noble disciples all made use of these things without any thought of their being anything other than what they are — that they might be constant, that they might give rise to true pleasure, that they might be \"us\" or \"ours.\" We use these things in line with our duties as long as they're here for us to use. When they change into something else, they change in line with their duties, in line with the laws of the Dhamma.\nThe Buddha thus taught us to familiarize ourselves with what's normal in life: aging is normal, illness is normal, death is normal, separation from the people and things we love is normal. When we analyze them, we realize that they're all going to have to leave us. They won't stay with us forever. When even these five khandhas that we're looking after all the time aren't really ours, how can our children really be ours? How can our parents really be ours? How can our possessions really be ours? They're all anatta: not-self.\nWe train and exercise our minds in this way until they're adept in the same way that we memorize our lessons in school. Once they're firmly imbedded in the mind, the mind won't go against the truth of the Dhamma. It will believe the truth of the Dhamma, be inclined to follow the truth of the Dhamma. It won't suffer, for it follows in line with the laws of truth. When we don't struggle against the truth of the Dhamma, there won't be any sorrow or distress when things change, for we've come to know and accept the truth.\nSo all we have to do is come and know the truth. It doesn't lie far away. The things that will cure our sufferings, the most important things that will help us cross over birth and becoming, all come simply from making our knowledge of what's truly here firm and unwavering so that it can push the mind, lift the mind, over and above any influences that might come to make an impact on it — so that it will gain release from defilement, release from sorrow, release from distress. The meditation we're practicing here is simply for the purpose of knowing the truth as it actually is. As long as we haven't yet reached it, we won't see it. When we don't see it, all we know about it is news: what we've read in books or heard on tapes or heard our teachers describe. That's simply news. The mind hasn't seen it. The ears have simply received it, the eyes have simply taken it in from books, but they're simply passive receptors, holding it as labels and memories, that's all.\nThe \"reaching\" has to be done by the heart. The heart is what reaches the truth. And once the heart has reached it, you don't have to worry. It'll be the heart's own treasure. So we have to train the heart to be intelligent, so that it will gain true happiness, true release from danger, from suffering and stress. Practice so that your mind reaches it, so that it will see it. At the moment, it hasn't gotten there yet. So far, it's all only in your ears and eyes.\nSo we all have to put our hearts into the meditation. Focus on what's truly here so that the heart will reach the truth — the noble truths. Whatever suffering or stress is here in your body and mind is all part of the dukkha sacca, the noble truth of stress. Whatever delusion, passion, or delight that depends on delusion — however much, whatever the object, within or without — is all samudaya sacca, the noble truth of the origination of stress. All the things that we like, that give rise to desire to the point of clinging: when we get them, we latch onto them. When we lose them, we look for them again. When we don't have them, we suffer. This is what makes the mind travel through all the levels of being, great and small.\nIn the teaching on dependent co-arising, the Buddha said that it all comes from not knowing. We don't discern contact, don't discern feeling, don't discern craving, don't discern clinging, don't discern becoming, don't discern birth: all of this is called avijja, or unawareness. So do you discern these things yet, or not? When sights strike the eye, day in and day out: is your mindfulness ready to handle them or not? Is your discernment up on the tricks of the defilements or not? If not, you have to be observant, to gather and restrict all your attention to what's right here, for when defilements arise, they arise right here. If discernment is to see the defilements to the point of giving rise to right view, it'll have to see and know right here.\nIf we gather and restrict our attention to what's right here, we're sure to know and see. If we want to be mindful and alert, we can't do it anywhere else. Remember this point well, and put it into practice. When these words are spoken you hear them, but when you get up you forget them. Then when the time comes to meditate again, you don't know what to pick as your theme of practice. You forget everything, throw it all away. So there's nothing but \"you\" — no Dhamma to know, no Dhamma to see, no Dhamma to put into practice. It's all \"you\" and \"yours\": your body, and when the body is yours, feelings are yours, perceptions are yours, thought constructs are yours, consciousness is yours. So you get possessive of what's yours, and there's nothing left to be Dhamma. That's why your practice doesn't progress.\nAll progress has to come from a point of \"one.\" Once \"one\" is firmly established, then there can be \"two\" and \"three.\" If \"one\" is lacking, everything else will be lacking. Actually, when we separate things out, there is no \"two\" or \"three.\" When we don't lump things together, there's only \"one.\" Even groups of ten or twenty people are all made up of one person — that one person, this one person, that one person over there.\nSo in our practice we first have to establish \"one\" — this body of ours. What's here in the body? We have mental events and physical phenomena: that's two. Then there's feeling: pleasure, pain, neither pleasure nor pain: that's three. When we separate things out, there's lots of them, but it's all this one person, this one lump sitting here encased in skin. But when you analyze things out, you have hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin... Here it's already a lot. Then you can analyze the eye, consciousness, forms. It's a lot of things, but all one thing: one mass of suffering and stress. Nothing else. Just know this one thing until it's all clear. You don't have to know a lot of things, just this one body. Once you really see the truth, the mind will let go of its burdens. We suffer because we keep piling things on — \"That's us, that's ours, that's them, that's theirs\" — through the power of attachment, clinging to things, not wanting them to change. When the mind starts meditating by mentally repeating its theme, it can let things go for a while. You hold onto buddho or any of the other themes. You don't take refuge in the body. You take refuge in buddho, buddho, until the mind settles down. That gives you a greater sense of wellbeing than you could get from these other things.\nWhen you can let go even of this level of wellbeing, you'll reach the real buddha. That's where there's purity, that's where there's true wellbeing, with no more need to go swimming through birth and death, no more need to torment yourself by having to sit and meditate like this again — because there will be nothing to torment, nothing to meditate on any more. When you let go of everything, there are no more issues.\nSo we meditate to give rise to the discernment that sees the drawbacks of things and lets go of them all. That's when there are no more burdens, no more kamma. It sounds easy, but you have to let go of everything. If you haven't let go of everything, there's more kamma to do, more work to do. So we're taught cago — renunciation; patinissaggo — relinquishment; mutti — release; analayo — no place for the defilements to dwell.\nSo. Keep on meditating.\n|Home | Links | Contact||\nCopy Right Issues 2005 © What-Buddha-Taught.net","Two core principles: Practice (abhyasa, 1.13) and non-attachment\n(vairagya, 1.15) are the two core principles on which the entire system of Yoga\nrests (1.12). It is through the cultivation of these two that\nthe other practices evolve, by which mastery\nover the mind field occurs (1.2), and\nallows the realization of the true Self (1.3).\nThey work together: Practice leads you in the right direction, while non-attachment allows you to continue the inner journey without getting sidetracked into the pains and pleasures along the way.\nSupreme Non-attachment: Gradually, non-attachment expands to the depth of the subtlest building blocks (gunas) of ourselves and the universe, which is called paravairagya, supreme non-attachment (1.16). Eventually the three gunas resolve back into their cause during deep meditation, leading to final liberation (4.13-4.14, 4.32-4.34).\nThese thought patterns (vrittis) are mastered (nirodhah, regulated,\ncoordinated, controlled, stilled, quieted) through practice (abhyasa) and\nTwo practices: Abhyasa and vairagya are companion practices, and are the means of mastering (nirodhah, 1.2) the many levels of mind, so as to experience the true Self (1.3). All of the many other practices of Yoga rest on these two principles.\nTwo directions: There are two directions that one can go in life as well as individual actions, speech, or thoughts. One direction is towards truth, reality, Self, or spiritual realization. The other direction is opposite, and involves those lifestyles, actions, speech, and thoughts that take one away from the higher experiences.\nDiscrimination is key: To be able to do the practices and to cultivate non-attachment, it is necessary to become better and better at discriminating between what actions, speech, and thoughts take you in the right direction, and those which are a diversion (2.26-2.29, 3.4-3.6). This discrimination is both a foundation practice and also the subtler tool of the inner journey.\nPractice (abhyasa) means choosing, applying the effort, and doing those\nactions that bring a stable and tranquil state (sthitau).\nTwo words for practice: There are two different words that are often translated into English as practice. One is abhyasa and the other is sadhana, which is the title of Chapter 2 of the Yoga Sutras (Sadhana Pada). It is important to understand the difference between these two words.\nStithau has two parts: Abhyasa is defined in this sutra as choosing or cultivating that which leads to sthitau. To understand the meaning of sthitau, it is necessary to combine two principles. First is that of tranquility, calmness, or peace of mind. Second is that of stability, steadiness, or being of firm ground. Thus, sthitau means a stable form of tranquility. In other words, it is the pursuit of an equanimity that is with you at all times.\nThis stability is not just a matter of regaining peace of mind when it has been lost, like having a weekend away from work or taking a vacation. One might be able to temporarily have some tranquility while avoiding the core decisions of lifestyle, attitudes, and practices. However, to have stable tranquility, which is with you all, or most of the time, it is necessary to take the extra steps in life planning that supports meditation. This is the meaning of sthitau.\nWhen that practice is done for a long time, without a break, and with\nsincere devotion, then the practice becomes a firmly rooted, stable and\nKeep practicing: One of the most important principles of living yoga meditation is that of continuing to practice without a break. Often a meditator gets started, practices for a few weeks or months, and then stops for a while due to some life situation. Then, he or she starts over again. While it is good to start again, it is better to choose a level of practice that you know you can maintain without a break. If, for example, you try to practice 2-3 hours per day when you are well aware you do not consistently have that much time in your current lifestyle, it is a set up for breaking practice. It's far better to choose an amount of time that you can consistently practice.\nChoose your level of practice: Because of the importance of consistency of practice, one of the later sutras (1.21-1.22) suggests that you choose one of nine levels of practice to which you commit yourself.\nDevelop attitude: The attitude satkara contains the principles of devotion, sincerity, respect, reverence, positiveness, and right choice. As you choose your proper level of practice, and decide to do that daily, the attitude will come more easily. It is like having a little flame of desire in the heart for the fruits of meditation, and then slowly starting to experience those benefits. That little flame starts to grow slowly and consistently into a burning desire to guide your life in the direction of spiritual realization.\nIt all rests on attention: Throughout the science of Yoga meditation attention is a critical principle to practice. This sharp, clear, assiduous attention (asevitah) is essential if you are to develop the attitude of conviction for practices over a long time, and without a break as described in this sutra. \"Attention, attention, attention!\" is the formula to follow, though done in loving kindness towards yourself.\nWhen the mind loses desire even for objects seen or described in a\ntradition or in scriptures, it acquires a state of utter (vashikara)\ndesirelessness that is called non-attachment (vairagya).\nLetting go and not taking on: The simplest way of describing non-attachment is as the process of letting go. We gradually learn to let go of our attachments and aversions, systematically moving subtler and subtler through the layers of attachments in the mind. However, non-attachment goes beyond this; it is not just a practice of letting go, but is a practice of not taking on in the first place.\nNon-attachment is not suppression: Non-attachment is not a mere personality trait that one practices in dealing with the other people of the world. It is very easy to fool oneself into thinking that non-attachment is being practiced when what is really happening is pretending to be non-attached. It is like saying that you have lost your inner craving to some object while inside you are longing for it intensely. Non-attachment is not a process of suppression or repression of wants, wishes, desires, thoughts, or emotions. It comes by the ongoing practice of awareness of the existence of attachments (kleshas, 1.5, 2.3) and gradually letting these weaken (2.4).\nNon-attachment is cessation: If attachment does occur (whether attraction or aversion), wherein attention wraps itself around a deep mental impression, the ensuing non-attachment comes from the cessation of mental clinging, not from an act of prying attention away forcefully. It is easy to hear of the philosophy of non-attachment and then mistakenly walk around lying to ourselves, internally saying something like, \"I'm not attached; I'm not attached.\" This is not non-attachment. It is better to see realistically where our minds are attached, and then learn to systematically release that coloring through the external and internal practices of yoga meditation.\nNon-attachment is not detachment: It is not mere semantics to say that non-attachment is different from detachment. Detachment implies that there is first attachment, and that you then apply some method or technique to disconnect that attachment. It implies an act of doing something to cause the separation to occur. Non-attachment, on the other hand, means that the connection simply does not occur in the first place. Non-attachment is not a case of doing something, but is instead a non-doing sort of thing. It means that your attention does not grab onto that impression in the mind in the first place.\nLike two ex-smokers: While the principle applies to all the gross and subtle levels, a gross level example will help. Think of two people who stopped smoking many years ago. One is still attached to cigarettes, and when he sees a cigarette, the craving begins. When he resists acting on that desire, and then let's go of the desire, this is the meaning of detachment. The other person also used to smoke, but when he sees a cigarette there is literally no reaction; the desire has completely disappeared at all levels of his conscious and unconscious mind. This is the meaning of non-attachment. The attachment is not released, but is simply not there any more; it is non or the absence of attachment.\nNon-attachment deepens through all levels: Patanjali explains that non-attachment applies to progressively deeper levels of our being. While we might begin with our more surface level attachments, such as the objects and people of daily life, the practice deepens to include all of the objects or experiences we might have only heard about, including the many powers or experiences of the psychic or subtle realm. We gradually see that even these are nothing but distractions on the journey to Self-realization, and we learn to set them aside as well.\nWhat to do with attachments: As you are reading this current sutra on non-attachment, it is useful to keep the perspective that the whole process of Yoga has to do with the mastery and integration of the fluctuations of the mind field, as introduced in Sutra 1.2. This allows the seer to rest in its true nature, the state of Self-realization, as outlined in Sutra 1.3. By also being mindful of the broad categories or clusters of sutras (as clustered on this site), it is relatively easy to see that we gradually need to stabilize the mind, weaken those attachments, and then start the ongoing process of letting them go entirely. In the meantime, we seek the direct experience of the Absolute, so that we might do an even more efficient job of letting go of the attachments. To better understand that process, take a look at the Chapter Outlines, which include the following:\nIndifference to the subtlest elements, constituent principles, or\nqualities themselves (gunas), achieved through a knowledge of the nature\nof pure consciousness (purusha), is called supreme non-attachment (paravairagya).\nNon-attachment to the building blocks: Sutra 1.15 describes non-attachment; it is a process that evolves progressively as practice deepens. Eventually it leads to a supreme non-attachment, which is described here. Paravairagya means there is non-attachment even in relation to the most fundamental building blocks of all manifestation. This level of non-attachment comes through the direct experience of pure consciousness or purusha (3.56).\nThree levels of non-attachment: We can think of this as a systematic process of developing non-attachment (vairagya) at three levels:\nAnalogous to freedom from atomic particles: This concept of levels may seem foreign, but we are all accustomed to this in our world. If we compare this to only the physical universe, it would be somewhat like becoming non-attached to protons, electrons, and neutrons, which are the particles that form atoms. Notice how the physical universe is also constructed in levels or layers:\nImagine that you were free from attachment and aversion to the particles (protons, electrons, and neutrons). Then (in our metaphor) you would be free from attachment and aversion to all of its evolutes as well, including, molecules, compounds, and all of the physical objects of the world.\nSupreme non-attachment: Similarly, this is the suggestion of supreme non-attachment (paravairagya) to the gunas, the three primal elements that the yogis speak of as the prime constituents of the manifest and unmanifest matter (prakriti). Non-attachment to the gunas includes non-attachment in relation to not only the gross world, but also the entire subtle, psychic, astral plane, as well as the causal out of which they arise.\nParavairagya comes after Self-realization: On a practical level, this is not to say that we must attain the paravairagya level to attain direct experience of the center of consciousness (purusha). Rather, it is describing where non-attachment ultimately leads once you have the tool of samadhi and direct experience.\n------- This site is devoted to\npresenting the ancient Self-Realization path of\nthe Tradition of the Himalayan masters in simple, understandable and\nbeneficial ways, while not compromising quality or depth.

{"question":"What are the height dimensions and flower characteristics that make Etlingera fimbriobracteata and Yucca filamentosa suitable as ornamental statement plants for gardens? Need detailed comparison!","answer":"Etlingera fimbriobracteata grows 1.5-6m tall with bright red bracts and intense yellow flowers in compact spikes, blooming gradually for several weeks. The inflorescences are about 12cm long and emerge from the rhizome. Yucca filamentosa, on the other hand, grows 3-5' (approximately 0.9-1.5m) tall and features dramatic flowering stalks with 2-foot sections of creamy white bell-shaped flowers in mid-summer that tower over its gray-green sword-like leaves. While both plants make striking ornamental statements, they differ significantly in their flowering patterns and overall appearance.","context":["Family : Zingiberaceae\nText © Pietro Puccio\nEnglish translation by Mario Beltramini\nThe species is native to Borneo (Brunei and Sarawak) where it grows at the margins of the pluvial forests and on the banks of the water streams, at low and medium altitudes.\nThe name of the genus is honoured to the XVIII century German botanist Andreas Ernst Etlinger, author of the “Commentatio Botanico-Medica de Salvia” (1777); the specific name is the combination of the Latin adjectives “fimbriatus, a, um” = fringed and “bracteatus, a, um” = equipped with bracts, with reference to the floral bracts with fringed apex.\nCommon names: tolidus (Sabah), layun (Singapore).\nEtlingera fimbriobracteata (K.Schum.) R.M.Sm. (1986) is a perennial rhizomatous herbaceous species, evergreeen, 1,5-6 m tall that forms tufts with pseudostems rather spaced provided of oblong leaves with entire margin and pointed apex, 120-130 cm long and 14-18 cm broad. Inflorescences on short peduncle, often hidden by the layer of vegetal debris covering the soil of the forest, directly from the rhizome close to the base of the pseudostem.\nThe inflorescences, about 12 cm long, are formed by sterile coriaceous bracts, imbricate, spirally arranged, that enclose a compact spike formed by bright red bracts with fringed apex, 3-3,5 cm long, that subtend up to a one hundred of intense yellow flowers that open gradually for some weeks.\nTubular calyx about 5 cm long, corolla with tube shorter than the calyx, about 4 cm, and 3 oblong lobes, obovate labellum, anthers with orange apex and red stigma. Globose fruit, about 8 cm long and 10 cm broad, fomed by a crowd of close capsules of reddish colour when ripe. It propagates by seed, but usually by division utilizing an about 20 cm long portion of rhizome with at least a pseudostem provided of leaves, shortened in order to reduce the transpiration, and some dormant buds. The rhizome is to be placed just under the surface of the loam, that must be rich of organic substance and particularly draining, to avoid stagnant water rottenness, in an ambient with temperatures of 26-30 °C and humidity around the 90%.\nSpecies with ornamental foliage and curious bright inflorescences, poorly known out of the origin zones and rarely cultivated in gardens and botanic collections. Markedly tropical, it needs a constant warm-humid climate, an exposition in full sun or partially shaded and draining soils rich of organic substance maintained constantly humid.Outside the tropical zones it can be cultivated in open ground or in capacious containers exclusively in large warm-humid greenhouses, with lowest temperatures not under the 18 °C and humidity of 80% and more. The waterings must be frequent, but without stagnations, being easily subject to root decay, allowing the superficial layer of the loam to dry up before giving water again. Useful are the nebulizations, to maintain a high level of humidity, with water at ambient temperature and not calcareous, to avoid unaesthetic spots on the leaves. The fertilizations are to be done in spring-summer, preferably with slow releasing hydrosoluble products with microelements. It is easily subject when in a confined space to attacks of parasites, therefore it must be frequently controlled in order to be able to intervene promptly with specific products. In the origin zones the fruits and the young buds are consumed as vegetable by the local populations, added in traditional dishes, furthemore the leaves are used for wrapping food, fabricating mats, hats and other handicrafts and as cover for makeshift shelters in the forest. Laboratory studies have evidenced in the extracts of various parts of the plant the presence of bioactive compounds with antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of potential interest for the official pharmacopoeia.\nSynonyms: Amomum fimbriobracteatum K.Schum.

The plant must be outstanding in some way; the color of its flower, the form, size or texture of its leaves, or the shear size of the whole plant. Many characteristics can make a plant stand out in the crowd or stand alone in a bed of its own. Here are five of my favorites.\nColewort (Crambe cordifolia)\nA lover of moisture and cool weather, colewort is a knock out when displays its fragrant cloud of white flowers on widely branching stems over its large, crinkled, deeply lobed leaves below. This is not a plant for the deep south as it does not do well in heat and humidity. Its leaves look poorly if the soil drys out and it should not be moved once established because of its tap root. Still, it puts on quite a show for several weeks and is worth pampering if you have the right climate for it.\nSize: 4-7’ H x 3-4’ W.\nBloom: Small creamy white flowers are produced in a cloud like effect in summer.\nLight: Full sun to partial shade.\nSoil: Deep fertile, moist, well drained.\nHardiness: Zones 5-8.\nFingerleaf Rodgersia (Rodgersia aesculifolia)\nAt my age wrinkles are an accepted fact of life but I actually love the wrinkled look of the gorgeous leaves of rodgersia. The coarsely toothed compound leaves 7” across resemble those of horse-chestnut (giving the plant its species name aesculifolia), and are composed of 7 leaflets. They form a clump beneath the tall flowering stalks that arise in late spring bearing small white or pink flowers in clusters up to 24” long. Shaggy brown hair covers the flower stalk, the stem like structures bearing the leaves (petioles) and the main veins of the leaves. The genus name was derived from the name of Admiral John Rogers, the American commander of the ship that went to China and Japan where Rodgersia podophylla was first found.\nSize: 3-5’ H x 3-5’ W.\nBloom: Small creamy white or pink small flowers are borne in panicles in late spring.\nLight: Part shade.\nSoil: Rich, humusy, and moist.\nHardiness: Zones 5-7.\nCardoon (Cynara cardunculus)\nThis Mediterranean native is eye-catching whether the plant is in bloom or not. The large leaves are silver-gray above, white and wooly below, and bear substantial spines. They are deeply lobed and coarsely toothed, and form a magnificent clump beneath the fragrant purple-blue flowers with spiny bracts. The flowers are good in both fresh and dried arrangements. A relative of globe artichokes, its leaf stalks and midribs are edible.\nSize: 3-6’ H x 1-3’ W.\nBloom: Purple, thistle like flowers.\nLight: Full sun.\nSoil: Rich, well drained.\nHardiness: Zones 7-10.\nOrnamental Rhubarb (Rheum palmatum ‘Atrosanguineum’)\nIf you want to have a bold plant with touches of red, ornamental rhubarb is a great choice. There is red at various stages of its development but never so much that the color dominates the scene; it just adds to the interest of this fabulous plant. In spring the young leaves are red and as they mature to green above, the undersides retain some red color. In early summer pink to red flowers arise on tall branched stems and later mature into attractive fruit. Even if their were no flowers, the leaves would be worth growing the plant; they are large (2-3’ across), rounded, and deeply lobed and toothed. Simply gorgeous but, alas, not tolerant of heat.\nSize: 6-10’ H x 4-6’ W.\nBloom: Clusters of small pink to red flowers borne in early summer.\nLight: Sun to part sun.\nSoil: Deep, organically rich, and moist.\nHardiness: Zones 5-9.\nAdam’s Needle (Yucca filamentosa)\nThe clump of gray-green sword like leaves is a bold statement by itself but when it puts up its flowering stalk in summer “WOW” is the only word for it. The huge stalk towers over the clump of leaves covered with 2’ bell shaped flowers and remain for several weeks. A striking contrast can be achieved by planting soft lamb’s ear next to yucca.\nSize: 3-5’ H x 3-4’ W.\nBloom: Creamy white bell shaped flowers are borne on tall spikes in mid summer.\nLight: Full sun.\nSoil: Sandy, dry, well drained but tolerates better.\nHardiness: Zones 4-11.\nSome are prickly, some are not; some are large and coarse, others are fine; all are striking and eye-catching.

{"question":"What role does temperature play in the operation of vertical centrifugal pumps versus progressive cavity pumps?","answer":"Temperature affects these pumps differently. In vertical centrifugal pumps, temperature is primarily monitored in the bearings, which should operate around 60 degrees with a maximum of 85 degrees - exceeding this requires immediate investigation of potential issues like impurities or water contamination. Progressive cavity pumps, however, are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations due to their rubber stator design. Temperature changes can cause the stator to swell, affecting the few millimeters of clearance between the stator and rotor, which impacts the pump's efficiency, flow rate, and pressure. Therefore, progressive cavity pumps must be carefully selected for specific temperature conditions and are not suitable for applications with significant temperature variations.","context":["The principle and composition of vertical centrifugal water pump\nBefore the vertical centrifugal water pump is started, the pump casing and the suction pipe should be filled with water first, and then the motor should be driven to make the impeller and water rotate at a high speed. At the same time, the center of the impeller of the vertical centrifugal water pump forms a vacuum due to the water being thrown out, and the water in the suction pool is released. Under the action of atmospheric pressure, it flows into the impeller suction port continuously along the suction pipe, and is thrown out of the impeller by the high-speed rotating impeller to enter the pressure water pipe. In this way, the continuous water delivery of the vertical centrifugal pump is formed.\nComposition of vertical centrifugal water pump: The vertical centrifugal pump consists of six parts, namely impeller, pump body, pump shaft, bearing, sealing ring and stuffing box.\n1. The impeller is the core part of the vertical centrifugal pump. It has high speed operation and high output power. The blades on the impeller play an important role. The impeller must pass the static balance test before assembly. The vertical centrifugal water pump manufacturer tells you that the inner and outer surfaces of the impeller are required to be smooth to reduce the frictional loss of water flow.\n2. The pump body is also called the pump casing, which is the main body of the pump. It plays the role of support and fixation, and is connected with the bracket to install the bearing.\n3. The function of the pump shaft is to connect the motor with the coupling to transmit the torque of the motor to the impeller, so it is the main part that transmits mechanical energy.\n4. The bearing is a part sleeved on the pump shaft to support the pump shaft. There are two types of rolling bearings and sliding bearings. Rolling bearings are properly lubricated using tallow as a lubricant. Generally, too much 2/3~3/4 of the volume will generate heat, too little will generate noise and heat. Sliding bearings use transparent oil as lubricant, add oil to the oil level line. Too much oil will seep down the pump's shaft and drift low, too little and the bearings will overheat and burn, causing accidents! During the operation of the vertical centrifugal pump, the temperature of the bearing is 85 degrees, usually around 60 degrees. If it is high, find out the reason (whether there are impurities, whether the oil is black, whether water has entered) and deal with it in time!\n5. The sealing ring is also known as the leakage reduction ring. The gap between the impeller inlet and the pump casing is too large, causing the water in the high pressure area of the pump to flow through the gap to the low pressure area, thereby affecting the water output of the pump and reducing the efficiency! If the clearance is too small, the friction between the impeller and the pump casing will cause wear. The vertical centrifugal water pump manufacturer tells you that in order to increase the return resistance, reduce internal leakage, and prolong the service life of the impeller and pump casing, a sealing ring is installed at the connection between the inner edge of the pump casing and the external auxiliary device of the impeller, and the sealing gap should be maintained Between 0.25 and 1.10 mm.\n6. Stuffing box is mainly composed of packing, water seal ring, stuffing tube, packing gland and water seal tube. The function of the stuffing box is mainly to narrow the gap between the pump casing and the pump shaft, so that the water in the pump will not flow outside, and the outside air will not enter the pump. Always keep the vacuum in the pump! When the pump shaft and packing friction generate heat, the water seal sends water through the pipe to the water seal ring to cool the packing! Keep the vertical centrifugal pump running normally. When inspecting the operation of the vertical centrifugal pump, special attention should be paid to the inspection of the stuffing box! The packing should be replaced after 600 hours of operation.\nThe above is a summary of the principle and composition of the vertical centrifugal water pump.","How do progressive cavity pumps work?\nProgressive cavity pumps, otherwise referred to as a helical rotor pump, eccentric screw pump or mono pump, are part of the positive displacement family. Positive displacement pumps are characterised by an operation that moves fluid by trapping a fixed volume and forcing that trapped fluid into the discharge pipe.\nThe progressing cavity working principle in particular consists of a spiralled helical rotor (like a cork screw, hence their names eccentric screw pump) that sits tightly inside a rubber stator/sleeve. As the rotor turns inside the stator, it forms a set of fixed-shaped cavities that progress along the length of the stator and force the fluid inside to move along with them as they turn.\nViscous & abrasive fluids - The progressive cavity pump is often seen as a solution when many other types fail thanks to their ability to handle difficult fluids. Its low internal velocity design means that viscous fluids and those containing solids can be handled effectively e.g. sewage, slurries, waste water and food waste. In addition, the stator has some flexibility reducing the wear particles cause as the come into contact. This is this reason why a mono pump is often selected over centrifugal pumps; a design most suited to water or fluids with a similar thickness, or vane and gear pumps that would simply clog with the presence of solids due to their close tolerances.\nSmooth, low pulsating flow - As the fluid progresses through the overlapping cavities steadily at a predictable rate, the progressive cavity design benefits from low pulsation pumping. This smooth operation means that in dosing applications, extremely accurate metering can be carried out. Less pulsations in the flow of fluid also limits the amount of stress the other components in the installation are put under.\nLow shear operation – Thanks to the low internal velocity compared to other pump designs, the progressing cavity pump results in low levels of shearing being applied to the pumped medium. This makes it ideal for handling shear sensitive products that need to maintain their structure during the pumping process. Examples include food products such as olives, adhesives that may lose their stickiness and water/oil mixes that need to keep the oil droplet sizes intact in order for a separator to work most efficiently. Another example of shear sensitive products are thixotropic fluids; those that are thick when static but become less viscous when shaken, agitated or stirred e.g. tomato ketchup, and rheopectic; those that when agitated become thicker e.g. cream. Thanks to their low RPM and gentle pumping motion, progressing cavity pumps keep agitation of the pumped medium to a minimum.\nConstant flow - As a progressive cavity pump is able to produce the same flow rate regardless of the viscosity of the medium being pumped, they are an ideal solution for when a constant flow is required but the thickness of the fluid may be variable.\nHigh pressures – High pressures can be achieved with eccentric screw pumps, ensuring that even difficult to pump fluids can be pump over considerable distances.\nGreat suction lift capabilities – The progressing cavity mono pump design benefits from a low Net Positive Suction Head (LPSH), which means that less inlet pressure is required for the pump to operate at the required duty point. Consequently, they are a good solution when the suction conditions of an application are not ideal.\nTypical applications of a progressing cavity pump\nGiven the above design benefits, progressive cavity pumps are commonly used, but are in no way limited to the following applications:\n- Sewage and sludge pumping\n- Dirty waste water\n- Bilge water removal\n- Viscous chemical pumping\n- Shear sensitive products\n- Pulp, paper paste and starch handling\n- Biomass transfer\n- Oil transfer\n- Fluid dosing applications\nProgressing cavity pumps are identified by their long, thin construction as the stator is often about ten times as long as its width as per the image to the right. This means that generally quite a large amount of space is required within the installation, which is sometimes a drawback. Models are available with a more compact design however this is usually at the cost of the maximum pressures they can work at.\nIt is important to note that progressive cavity pumps must be selected carefully for the temperature of fluid and are not a good solution where temperatures vary significantly. The stator and helical rotor can sometimes only have a few mm of clearance to enable the pump to be efficient and transfer fluids at the requested flow rate. As the stator is rubber, large temperature fluctuations can cause a slight swelling meaning a difference in efficiency, flow rate and pressure will be experienced. Eccentric screw pumps will be typically sized to the requested flow and pressure at a certain temperature and should this change then it is possible for the pump to still work but at reduced efficiency.\nProgressive cavity pumps are a robust and reliable design, yet as with anything issues can occur. Should you experience a problem there is a likely explanation which can be identified using the below progressing cavity troubleshooting table.\n|A||Pump won't start|\n|B||Pump has no suction|\n|C||Wrong flow rate|\n|E||Excessive vibration or noise|\n|F||Pump has seized/stopped conveying|\n|H||Faulty helical rotor|\n|I||Seal is leaking|\n|J||Drive is generating too much heat|\n|X||X||Adhesion between helical rotor and stator due to prolonged activity.

{"question":"Could you explain how coastal cities deal with subsidence risks and cultural preservation? 🏙️","answer":"Major coastal cities face significant subsidence challenges, with cities like Venice experiencing 0.22m subsidence over 150 km², Shanghai 2.63m over 121 km², and New Orleans 2m over 175 km². To preserve their cultural heritage while dealing with these risks, cities have developed various approaches. For example, in New York City, organizations like the Brooklyn Waterfront Research Center and South Street Seaport Museum work to maintain historical connections while adapting to environmental challenges. Cities implement both physical protections (like flood gates in Venice) and cultural preservation initiatives (like maritime heritage programs and waterfront exhibitions) to balance environmental threats with maintaining their coastal identity.","context":["Johnathan Thayer, who writes the guest blog below, will be known to many as one of our speakers at the ‘Firths and Fjords’ conference. He is a Visiting Lecturer and the Coordinator of the Archives and Preservation of Cultural Materials Certificate Program at the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies, Queens College, The City University of New York (CUNY). Johnathan is also a doctoral student in History at The Graduate Center, CUNY, focusing on the legal, labour, and cultural history of merchant seamen in the United States, as well as the cultural geography of New York City’s sailortown. Thayer’s projects include “Mapping New York City’s Sailortown” at the New Media Lab, CUNY (more below), the Seamen’s Church Institute’s American Merchant Marine Veterans Oral History Project, and the Seamen’s Church Institute Digital Archives [David].\nAs we have seen from Isaac Land’s post in this blog, “Coastal History: Who, What, and Why?,” coastal history, as we are coming to understand it, is inherently interdisciplinary. In his diagrams Land places coastal history alongside and overlapping with other fields, including maritime, naval, environmental, urban, and leisure history. The question that I intend to pose in this post both accepts and further questions this model. Specifically, I ask: is there also something inherently public-facing about coastal history? In other words, is coastal history public history?\nThis question first occurred to me in Dornoch, at the wonderful “Firths and Fjords” conference hosted by UHI. Like many other conference participants, I was inspired by the seamless integration of local public stakeholders into the conference program. From the start of the conference to its finish, we were greeted by local youths selling chocolates to raise funds for their school, as well as a miniature army of volunteers prepping lunches and snacks, local historians and heritage workers with information booths and book stalls, and a mixed audience of members from local communities. Amid this group, the presence of academics that one might expect to find at such a conference sometimes felt like a formality, or a sideshow to more interesting things happening and being discussed outside the confines of papers and PowerPoint presentations.\nAs both a PhD student and faculty member at the City University of New York (CUNY), I took these experiences of successful public engagement back with me to Queens. CUNY has a mandate to serve the public of New York City through its twenty-four campuses located throughout the city. All too often, however, I feel that institutions of higher education, even a university system with such a public mandate like CUNY, turn their backs on those who we are expected to serve in favor of the insular, safely familiar confines of academic scholarship and discourse.\nCoastal history seems like a perfect thematic platform upon which we, as an international, interdisciplinary group, can build a sustainable, public-facing community of like-minded academics, heritage workers, and stakeholders.\nThere does indeed seem to be something deeply engaging about the coast for all human beings. Consider the allure of the coast, and the dependency of coastal peoples on its food supplies, that have made human societies statistically a people clinging to the margins of our geographic worlds? And, there is no denying the urgencies placed upon coastal dwellers by rising tides and extreme weather, both in historical and current contexts. Then, there is the coast as a commercialized space, both as epicenter of commerce (ports), and as a booming site of real estate development and space of leisure and consumerism curated by retail businesses, developers, and commercial architecture firms. Finally, there is the epic arc of romanticism and mythology surrounding Jack Tar and the sea as seen and consumed from the coast, in the literature of Melville, Cooper, London, Conrad, et al, as well as visual art, music, poetry, film, and any other form of cultural expression imaginable.\nThis list of concepts does indeed seem to translate into a real market for public programming that engages our shared coastal histories. In New York City, for example, there are a number of initiatives that I see as representing an encouraging swell in interest among the public in the history of our identities as urban coastal dwellers. Public programming at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, including excursions hosted by Turnstile Tours, lend historical interpretation to a site that has transformed from maritime industries to new types of urban industrial development. The Brooklyn Waterfront Research Center at New York City College of Technology has recently hosted a conference focused on the theme of “Past, Present & Future of Manufacturing along the Brooklyn Waterfront,” and the Brooklyn Historical Society is currently planning an exhibition on the same topic. In the waterfront neighborhood of Red Hook, dedicated stewards of community history and culture work tirelessly against city regulations to preserve and maintain historic vessels like the Lehigh Valley no. 79 barge and the oil tanker Mary Whalen.  In Manhattan, the South Street Seaport Museum works towards restoration of the historic Wavertree, as well as the debut in March of its first exhibition since Superstorm Sandy in 2012, titled “Street of Ships: The Port and Its People.”\nThe project that I lead at the Seamen’s Church Institute of New York and New Jersey, “Mapping NYC’s Sailortown: A Networked Digital Archival Consortium” recently received a federal grant from the National Park Service that will provide funding to build a digital platform and conduct workshops with maritime heritage organizations in New York to create a public-facing digital archive for the city’s maritime history.\nConsidering all of this, and reflecting on my experiences in Dornoch, I would argue that there are indeed very real connections between coastal history and public history. Practitioners in both fields would benefit from recognizing these intersections, and collaboratively plotting a course forward.\n See, among others, John Gillis, The Human Shore: Seacoasts in History, (University of Chicago Press, 2012). Isaac Land suggests an expanded definition of “coastal squeeze,” a concept he attributes to coastal conservation scientist J. Pat Doody, to account for “recognizable human elements” within the “tug-of-war over values, resources, and turf” that occurs along coastlines. Isaac Land, “Coasts of the Anthropocene,” The Coastal History Blog, Port Towns and Urban Cultures, February 12, 2014, and J. Patrick Doody, “Coastal Squeeze—An Historical Perspective,” Journal of Coastal Conservation 10 (2004), 129-138.\n See, most recently, the “Keeping History Above Water: A Conference on Sea Level Rise and Historic Preservation,” held at Newport, RI in April 2016.\n James N. Lindgren, Preservation of South Street Seaport: The Dream and Reality of a New York Urban Renewal District, (New York University Press, 2014). Lindgren documents the history of contestations over the Seaport’s preservation and development, from the era of James Rouse’s waterfront “festival marketplaces” to more recent battles involving the Howard Hughes Corporation.","Environmental Geology lecture outline\n- Shorelines and related environmental concerns.

This product is used with other HIV medications to help control HIV infection. It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer) and improves your quality of life. Both lopinavir and ritonavir belong to a class of drugs known as HIV protease inhibitors. Ritonavir increases (\"boosts\") the levels of lopinavir. This helps lopinavir work better.\nLopinavir/ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, do all of the following: (1) continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor, (2) always use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms/dental dams) during all sexual activity, and (3) do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes, and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\nHow to use Lopinavir-Ritonavir Tablet\nRead the Medication Guide and, if available, the Patient Information Leaflet provided by your pharmacist before you start taking lopinavir/ritonavir and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nTake this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor, usually once or twice daily. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not crush, break or chew the tablets.\nThe dosage is based on your medical condition, response to treatment, and other medications you may be taking. Be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the products you use (including prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).\nFor children, the dosage is also based on age, weight, and height. Once-daily dosing of this medication is not recommended for children younger than 18 years of age.\nIf you are taking didanosine in addition to this product, you can take it at the same time as this product, but take them both without food.\nIt is very important to continue taking this medication (and other HIV medications) exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not skip any doses.\nFor the best effect, take this medication at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, take this medication at the same time(s) every day.\nDo not take more or less of this drug than prescribed or stop taking it (or other HIV medicines) even for a short time unless directed to do so by your doctor. Doing so may cause the amount of virus to increase, make the infection more difficult to treat (resistant), or worsen side effects.\nRemember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\nAs your immune system gets stronger, it can begin to fight off infections you already had, possibly causing disease symptoms to come back. You could also have symptoms if your immune system becomes overactive. This reaction may happen at any time (soon after starting HIV treatment or many months later). Get medical help right away if you have any serious symptoms, including: unexplained weight loss, severe tiredness, muscle aches/weakness that doesn't go away, headaches that are severe or don't go away, joint pain, numbness/tingling of the hands/feet/arms/legs, vision changes, signs of infection (such as fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, trouble breathing, cough, non-healing skin sores), signs of an overactive thyroid (such as irritability, nervousness, heat intolerance, fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat, bulging eyes, unusual growth in the neck/thyroid known as a goiter), signs of a certain nerve problem known as Guillain-Barre syndrome (such as trouble breathing/swallowing/moving your eyes, drooping face, paralysis, trouble speaking).\nTell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: increased thirst, increased urination, confusion, persistent nausea/vomiting, stomach/abdominal pain, yellowing eyes/skin, dark urine.\nGet medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, including: symptoms of a heart attack (such as chest/jaw/left arm pain, shortness of breath, unusual sweating), severe dizziness, fainting, slow/fast/irregular heartbeat.\nChanges in body fat may occur while you are taking this medication (such as increased fat in the upper back and stomach areas, decreased fat in the arms and legs). The cause and long-term effects of these changes are unknown. Discuss the risks and benefits of treatment with your doctor, as well as the possible use of exercise to reduce this side effect.\nThis medication may cause an increase in blood fat levels (cholesterol and triglycerides). Cholesterol and triglyceride testing should be done before and occasionally during treatment with this medication. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\nA very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing.\nThis is not a complete list of possible side effects.

This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.\nBefore using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: liver disease, diabetes, pancreatitis, high blood fat levels (cholesterol/triglycerides), heart problems (coronary artery disease, heart attack), bleeding problems (such as hemophilia), previous infection with certain diseases (such as hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection, tuberculosis).\nLopinavir/ritonavir may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm (QT prolongation). QT prolongation can rarely cause serious (rarely fatal) fast/irregular heartbeat and other symptoms (such as severe dizziness, fainting) that need medical attention right away.\nThe risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using lopinavir/ritonavir, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: certain heart problems (heart failure, slow heartbeat, QT prolongation in the EKG), family history of certain heart problems (QT prolongation in the EKG, sudden cardiac death).\nLow levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. This risk may increase if you use certain drugs (such as diuretics/\"water pills\") or if you have conditions such as severe sweating, diarrhea, or vomiting. Talk to your doctor about using lopinavir/ritonavir safely.\nOlder adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this drug, especially QT prolongation (see above).\nSee also How to Use section.\nDrug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. This document does not contain all possible drug interactions.

This could cause pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about additional or alternative reliable forms of birth control, and always use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms/dental dams) during all sexual activity to decrease the risk of spreading HIV to others. Tell your doctor if you have any new spotting or breakthrough bleeding, because these may be signs that your hormonal birth control is not working well.\nIf someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing, call 911. Otherwise, call a poison control center right away. US residents can call their local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. Canada residents can call a provincial poison control center.

{"question":"What are the primary differences between white gold and platinum when considering their cost and appearance in fine jewelry?","answer":"White gold and platinum have distinct characteristics in terms of cost and appearance. White gold is actually a gold alloy with a high percentage of silver or other white metals, and is often plated with rhodium to brighten its appearance when the alloy is somewhat off-white. It's typically more cost-effective than platinum while providing a similar appearance. White gold is also alloyed with stronger metals than yellow gold, making it more durable and scratch-resistant. Platinum, on the other hand, is a naturally white precious metal that's rarer than gold and more expensive. It's highly durable, doesn't tarnish or wear out like other metals, and maintains its lustre with just occasional professional polishing. The higher price of platinum reflects its superior durability and natural white color.","context":["Eternity rings are a traditional anniversary present with a timeless appeal. The design consists of a row of diamonds or other precious stones set in a band of precious metal and symbolises never-ending love. The eternity ring is said to have been invented in the 1960s by the diamond company De Beers. Today, it is made by many fine jewellers and can be found in many different styles with the same basic design. It makes a beautiful gift on the occasion of an anniversary, but shopping for one can be difficult because of the choices available.\nThere are full eternity rings and half eternity rings, rings made from various precious metals, different precious and semiprecious stones, and with different stone settings. Since an eternity ring is a significant purchase, all these things have to be taken into account when one is shopping. By learning about the different types of eternity rings, the precious metals and stones used in their construction, and the stone settings used to secure the stone in the ring, anyone can make an educated decision when shopping for an eternity ring for a loved one.\nTypes of Eternity Rings\nThe two basic types of eternity rings are the full eternity ring and the half eternity ring. The half eternity ring has stones only halfway around the ring. This is done more for comfort than for the price although the advantage of half eternity rings is their relative affordability. A full eternity ring can be uncomfortable to wear because of its thickness around the whole finger. They also have to be custom made because of the sizing difficulties, something which adds to their price. On the other hand, half eternity rings can be more easily made in all sizes, making them more popular with retail jewellers. When the significance of the ring is the most important factor, a full eternity ring is the best option. However, when comfort and affordability are important, a half eternity ring can make a beautiful statement as well.\nMetals Used for Eternity Rings\nSeveral precious metals are used for eternity rings. The most common are gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. Precious metals are priced by their purity. Understanding metal purity as well as the types of gold alloys commonly found on the market is important.\nPure gold is too soft to be used in jewellery. For this reason, gold jewellery is made up of an alloy with gold and other metals that add hardness. This can be zinc, nickel, silver, copper, or a mixture of those metals. The purity of gold is expressed in terms of carats. To find the percentage of pure gold in a gold alloy, simply divide the number of carats by 24. For example, a 22-carat eternity ring has 22/24 or 91.66 per cent pure gold.\nRose gold is actually a gold alloy with a high amount of copper. The copper adds a reddish tint to the gold. There is no such thing as 'pure rose gold' since rose gold by definition is an alloy of metals.\nSimilarly, white gold is a gold alloy with a high percentage of silver or another white metal. Some white gold jewellery is plated with a metal called rhodium. This plating is often confused with the white gold itself. Rhodium plating is used to brighten the look of the metal when the gold alloy is somewhat off-white.\nGold Plated Rings\nGold plated rings are not solid gold all the way through. Instead, they have a thin layer of gold which is fused to a base of a non-precious metal (like brass) through a process called electroplating. Plated gold wears out over a period of several years, exposing the metal underneath. Gold plating is most often found on costume jewellery but may also be found on low-end fine jewellery.\nGold-filled rings, while not solid gold, are a big step above gold-plated rings as far as quality. Solid gold is fused with heat onto a base metal and the amount of gold has to be at least 1/20 the weight of the base metal. This ensures that a thick layer of gold is placed on the ring so that it does not wear out quickly.\nSterling silver is marked with the number '925'. This indicates that the ring is 92.5 per cent silver and 7.5 per cent other metals. Other standards for silver also exist, depending on the country of origin of the ring. Like gold-plating, silver-plating also exists and consists of a thin layer of silver on top of a base metal like brass or pewter.\nPlatinum is a precious metal that is far more rare than gold or silver. Unlike these, platinum does not tarnish or wear out, making it ideal for jewellery. However, the rarity of the metal makes platinum expensive.\nThe least common of the precious metals, palladium has been used in jewellery since 1939. Its whitish colour made it ideal for making white gold, along with nickel and silver. However, when the price of platinum increased and the price of palladium decreased around 2008, palladium became a popular alternative to platinum.\nPrecious Stones Used in Eternity Rings\nDiamonds are the traditional stone in eternity rings. In fact, some accounts claim that the eternity ring was made popular as a way to use the abundance of small diamonds that were available since previously, only the large single diamond ring designs were in demand. In recent times, eternity rings have been made with many other precious stones in combination with diamonds. These include sapphires, rubies, and emeralds.\nCut, clarity, colour, and carat weight are the four criteria to consider when buying a diamond, and in large part, they are the same criteria to consider when buying gemstones. The difference is that cut is generally the main criteria with diamonds while colour is the most important factor with coloured gemstones. Synthetic stones are also available, and many lab-created synthetic gems provide the same qualities as the naturally occurring gems, at a fraction of the price.\nStone Settings for Eternity Rings\nRegardless of the stones used in an eternity ring, the setting type should be carefully considered. The setting secures the stone to the ring and when it is poorly made, the stones can slip out and get lost. There are four basic types of settings used for eternity rings.\nShared Prong Setting\nA shared prong setting uses small prongs made of metal to hold the gems in place. This setting allows the most light to enter the gem since the sides are exposed as well as the face. However, it may not be as secure as the other settings since a bent or broken prong is all it takes to lose a stone.\nThe stones in a channel setting are placed into a deep groove, channel, or metal. A lip at the top of the channel keeps the stones inside the groove. A regular channel settings has the stones touching one another, but there is also a variation known as the bar channel setting. This setting has small metal pieces between each stone, giving the ring a different look. Both are very secure settings but only let light enter the gem through the face.\nBezel set eternity rings have a separate metal 'holder' for each stone that surrounds the stone completely except for the face. While a bezel setting is usually used for single stones, there are several beautiful and creative designs for eternity rings in which each stone is in its own bezel all around the ring.\nHow to Buy an Eternity Ring on eBay\neBay offers a wide selection of eternity rings of all sizes and colours for anyone looking for a readymade ring.

Some use a combination of gemstones instead of pure diamonds while others have diamonds only halfway around the ring. Half eternity rings are much more affordable than full eternity rings and are generally also more comfortable. Eternity rings can be made of various types of gold, as well as silver, platinum, or palladium. They also use one of several setting types to secure the stones to the band.\nThe channel setting, shared prong setting, and bezel settings are all used to hold gemstones in a row.

A genuine eternity ring makes a wonderful anniversary present or wedding band and is a gift that will be treasured forever.","What are the precious metals?\nThe term ‘fine jewellery’ is used to describe any jewellery that is made from precious metals. If a metal is valuable, rare, and makes beautiful jewellery, it is considered precious. The precious metals, those used most commonly in jewellery, are platinum, gold, palladium and silver.\nOne of the most important things to look for when purchasing jewellery is the piece’s sustainability. The precious metals have a high surface lustre, and will not rust or corrode if taken care of properly, meaning that they are durable. The metal also plays an important role in the appearance, and cost of a piece of jewellery, which we will consider as we develop your understanding of each of the precious metals. To deepen your knowledge of jewellery, take a look at our articles about diamond shapes, ring settings and styles, and the diamond 4C's.\nAs well as beauty and sustainability, these metals have a high economic value, and in some cases, have been used as currency.\nWhat is metal carat?\nThe metal carat refers to the quantity of pure gold contained in a metal. The purity level is stamped on the piece of jewellery, which is called a hallmark.\nThe most cost effective metal carat is 9ct, which is hallmarked 375, meaning that it is 37.5% pure gold, the rest consisting of other metals. Next is 14ct, which contains 585 (58.5%) pure gold.\n18ct gold provides a rich yellow or rose hue due to its high content. Therefore, it is durable and considered ideal for engagement rings and wedding bands which are worn daily. Our gold engagement rings are all 18 carat hallmarked. The purest forms of gold are 22ct, and 24ct, which contain 91.6% and 99% respectively. These are less commonly available in the UK, and is usually reserved for bespoke commissions.\nWhich metal should I choose?\nGold is unique for its durability, non-corrosive nature, and lasting beauty. Whether you prefer yellow gold, white gold or rose gold, this precious metal brings unmatched beauty, timelessness and class to any piece of jewellery.\nThe most popular shade of precious metal has historically been yellow gold. Its spectacular ability to stay tarnish free, to not lose its colour over time, and to continually be cost effective makes it the perfect choice for many jewellery buyers.\nToday, white gold is another popular choice - it is alloyed with stronger metals than yellow gold, making it more durable and scratch-resistant. It gives the same look as platinum, often at a lower price. In the unlikely event that a gold piece does become damaged, it can be easily repaired or refinished.\nOf all the precious metals that are readily available in the UK, silver is by far the most cost effective. Silver contains 92.5% pure silver, mixed with other metals such as copper to prevent scratching.\nYou can find some very beautiful, silver pieces for a reasonable price. Silver’s value extends well beyond its price; its beauty, versatility, lustre and rarity makes this precious metal a very desirable choice for jewellery.\nKeeping silver looking its best, though, does require considerably more maintenance than the other precious metals. This is because silver can react with the air in a process called oxidation, which can cause it to become dull looking. However, this doesn’t extend to the metal underneath the top layer, meaning that the discolouration can be easily removed by a cleaning cloth, or by being cleaned or polished by a specialist.\nOver the past years, platinum has grown in popularity as a choice of metal in jewellery. Platinum is a hard-wearing metal, meaning that it is very durable and a popular choice for men’s wedding bands. Platinum is equally as beautiful as it is strong, even when subjected to daily wear and tear. Unlike silver, platinum is fairly unreactive, so will tarnish less over time. Lustre can be easily restored with a professional polish.\nThese desirable characteristics are reflected in its price, and it can be more expensive than the other precious metals.\nPalladium is part of the platinum family, and therefore, displays many of the same desirable qualities that are sought out by jewellery buyers. It is naturally white in colour, and lends a high sheen and is luxurious in appearance.\nPalladium is better for simple designs, as it can be difficult to work with. The strong and durable, and easy to maintain nature of palladium means that it is another great option for men’s wedding bands and jewellery. It is lighter than traditional platinum, harder and even more scratch resistant.\nHowever, despite these advantages, like any other precious metal, it is not indestructible and can scratch or dent."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:92618faf-58c3-4665-8d85-f6ad3208f09a>","<urn:uuid:76805995-7ba4-4569-9c9c-aa3768bc3d3a>"],"error":null}
