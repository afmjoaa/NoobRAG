{"question":"What are the key differences between fully bonded installation and floating installation methods for wood flooring in terms of their expansion requirements and installation process?","answer":"Both fully bonded and floating installations require expansion gaps, but there are several key differences in their installation and requirements. For floating installation, the boards are loose laid over the subfloor with boards joined together, using PVAC adhesive to bond the interlocking boards at tongue and groove joints. A 3mm or thicker purpose-made underlay is laid at 90° to the planned flooring direction. For fully bonded installation, the flooring is directly installed to concrete, sand-cement screed, or wood-based subfloors using permanently flexible adhesive applied with a V-notched trowel. Both methods require expansion spaces of minimum 12mm for floors less than 25m2 or minimum 15mm for larger areas wherever floors meet obstructions. Floating floors can move more freely as they aren't fixed to the subfloor, while fully bonded installations provide more stability but still require expansion gaps due to seasonal climactic changes.","context":["Step 1 – Before Your Flooring Arrives\nRelative Humidity Must Be Correct\nThe Relative Humidity (RH) which is a measurement of how much moisture is present in the air. The correct RH of a room’s atmosphere, for wood flooring to be installed, falls between 45-65% with an ambient temperature between 18 to 24°C. If necessary employ a dehumidifier to maintain suitable conditions.\nNOTE: Wood Floors are generally not suitable for bathrooms where there is regular running water or an accumulation of water vapour.\nWet Trades & Decorating Should Be Dry\nAll wet trades such as concreting, screening and plastering should be completed and the building should be thoroughly dried out. Wood is a hygroscopic material and will absorb any excessive moisture which can cause problems.\nNOTE: Plaster may take several months to dry satisfactorily and concrete screeds depending on thickness may take considerably longer. As a rule of thumb drying time for cement and water based screed is one day per millimetre for the first 50 mm and unto 2.5 days for each subsequent millimetre.\nIMPORTANT: As with all screeds please consult the manufacturer for precise drying times and accelerated drying with heat should be avoided as this may weaken the screed. Decorating should be completed where possible, and paint should be completely dry as this can also add moisture to the room. Any sanding should be done before the floor is laid as fine dust can permeate into the wood and can be impossible to remove without damaging the surface.\nRoom Temperature Must Be Just Right\nRoom Temperature will have an effect on relative humidity and should be stable before your flooring is delivered to site. Heating including underfloor heating should be fully tested and working for at least two weeks before the flooring is laid. Room temperature should be between 18 to 24°C.\nDirect Heat Sources Must Be Insulated\nFlooring must not be exposed to excess heat such as from hot water pipes below floors.\nStep 2 – Preparing The Subfloor\nThe subfloor is key to a successful installation and will help ensure your floor performs to its very best. The subfloor is likely to be either wooden or a cement based screed.\nSweep and vacuum to remove any dust and debris, Any decorators dust should be removed as this can be very abrasive and hard if not impossible to remove from the surface of a floor without drastic sanding and resealing. Existing floor coverings should be removed, this includes carpets, underlays, parquet blocks, ceramic tiles and any adhesive residues should be removed. It is important to do this so the subfloor can be verified as stable.\nSubfloors Should Be Level\nThe subfloor must be free from excessive undulation and flat to within 3 millimetres over 2 lineal metres across the whole floor area. This means a maximum 3 mm gap under a 2 m long straight edge, at any point across the subfloor. Failure to keep to these tolerances may result in squeaking or deflection which may produce undue stresses on the joints, cause gaps between flooring elements and with fully bonded floors may result in inadequate contact between flooring and adhesive.\nSubfloors Should Be Structurally Sound\nWood Flooring should only be laid on a subfloor which is structurally sound and free from movement. To prevent movement wooden subfloors must be of load bearing strength and free from deflection under loading. Suspended wooden subfloors should typically consist of a suitable board of 22 mm thickness on joist or battens at 600 mm centres or 18 mm thickness on 400 mm centres. For other types of suspended floor please check with the manufacturer.\nMoisture Content Of Wooden Subfloors\nWooden sub-floors should contain no more than 11% moisture content and must not be more than 2% higher in moisture than the Wood Flooring. When installing wood flooring at ground floor level (or below) above a ventilated cavity (e.g. floorboards suspended on joist), it is essential that a purpose made moisture barrier building paper is installed over the sub-floor before flooring can be installed. The moisture barrier must taken up the walls by 30 mm at the perimeter, and all joints overlapped by a minimum 200 mm and taped with a water proof jointing tape.\nMoisture Condition Of Concrete Subfloors\nConcrete slabs and sand-cement screeds must be sound, dry, free of laitance and other substances which may impair adhesion (e.g. Bitumen adhesive residues etc). Mineral based sub-floors must be less than 75% equilibrium relative humidity and less than 65% relative humidity for glue down of engineered flooring. Anhydrite screeds must be less than 0.3% actual moisture content. Sub-floors at ground level or below must contain an effective damp proof membrane to protect flooring from ground water in compliance with British Standards. If there is any doubt that the sub-floor meets the required standard for moisture or the sub-floor does not have an effective integral damp proof membrane, a suitable surface applied damp proof membrane must be installed.\nStep 3 – Once Your Floor Arrives\nAcclimatising is used to balance the wood flooring with the environment it is going to be used in. Once you are satisfied that the correct preparations have been made, your floor can be delivered and as part of your guarantee conditions, it is essential to acclimatise your flooring prior to installation. Your floor should be kept in it’s sealed, unopened boxes and should only be laid flat, ideally in the room in which it is to be installed or as close to typical living conditions as possible.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Do not store packs outside or anywhere with different ambient conditions to the rooms where it is to be installed. If your flooring is not correctly acclimatised planks can warp and bow and become difficult or impossible to install. Engineered wood floors should acclimatise for at least 3 days and solid floors should have at least 7 days. Note: A certain amount of bowing in engineered floors is common and if the bowing is no more than 25 mm then these boards can be installed and will lay flat with a random staggered laying pattern.\nNOTE: V4 Wood Flooring should be acclimatised in it’s sealed packaging. As the packs are not airtight and allow the wood to breath whilst supporting the boards so that they do not warp.\nStep 4 – Planning The Installation\nType Of Installation\nEngineered floors can be installed as floating floors over Wood’s Good underlay or fully bonded using Wood’s Good Flexible MS adhesives. 18 -20 mm floors may be fixed to wooden subfloors using secret nails.\nDirection Of Floor\nWhere practical install floor parallel to the longest walls so that the direction of greatest potential expansion (i.e. across the width and grain) does not coincide with the direction of greatest dimension of the floor, especially in large areas. Before you install the first row measure the width of the room and divide this measurement by the width of the board, this will give you the number of rows of boards. This is useful as the last row should not be less then 60 mm. If it is then the first down should be rip cut along the length to make the last row wider.\nWhen Your Are Ready To Lay – Check For Defects\nCheck each board before it is installed for possible damage or defects, this is important as installed defects are the responsibility of the installer as the installer is the last line of quality control.\nThe Installer Is The Last Line Of Quality Control\nSamples must be taken as a guide only and colour/shade and other characteristics will vary. Before installation commences rack out a small section of boards for the client approval. The installer is the last line of quality control. This product may include up to 3-5% of boards which do not meet the normal tolerances or grade.\nNOTE: The installer is the last line of quality control. DO NOT INSTALL BOARDS WITH OBVIOUS DEFECTS.\nWood flooring should always be over ordered by 10% of the actual area required. This allows for wastage material which may include boards with natural blemishes or filled knots that are within the grading tolerance but are not your taste. It is also good practise to keep at least a pack of flooring stored in case flooring from the same batch is required for any unforeseen repair work.\nTo achieve the desired mix of colours, shades and other characteristics in the final floor, and to avoid clusters of characteristics such as knots, the contents of multiple packs should be mixed during installation.\nAvoid Grouping similar colours and grain pattern By not mixing the planks before installation areas of dark and light planks can look patchy and out of place.\nFor installation of flooring planks which run in the same direction, header-joints must be staggered by a minimum of two board widths apart. It is also important to even patterns across the floor as this can cause dimensional weaknesses as the floor expands and contracts.\nCorrect Staggered Laying Pattern\nHeader joints should be staggered by length equivalent to at least two boards width. This random stagger will stabilise the floor and limit any dimensional movement as the wood naturally expands and contracts.\nIncorrect Pattern – Header Joints Are Too Close\nThe header joints are too close in this pattern and will cause a line of weakness in the floor which could open up as the floor expands and contacts.\nIncorrect Pattern – Header Joints Lined Up Across The Floor\nAvoid this type of ‘H’ pattern where header joints line up as it will lead to weak points in the floor where parallel boards may warp and cause an accumulation of excessive movement.\nStep 5 – Floating Installation\nEngineered wood flooring may be installed as a floating floor, which means that the boards are joined together and loose laid over the subfloor,, instead of being fully bonded with adhesive or secret nailed. This is achieved firstly by laying a 3mm or thicker purpose made underlay at 90° to the planned direction of the flooring, then laying the flooring and bonding the interlocking boards at the tongue and groove joints with a D3 grade moisture resistance PVAC adhesive.\nPVAC Adhesive Application\nWhen bonding tongue & groove parquet PVAC adhesive should be applied evenly with a continuous bead, along the top of the grooved joint. The following panel (tongue) should be firmly pressed in to the groove to ensure a tight fit. A wooden block can be used to assist and to prevent damage to the tongue. If extra strength is required PVAC adhesive should be applied evenly to both top and bottom of the groove. Do not inject adhesive into the base of the of the groove (e.g. as the groove edge of the boards face upward vertically) as this may prevent the tongue and groove joints from closing.\nNOTE: Its is strongly recommended that both header and length joints be bonded with PVAC and NEVER spot glue, to avoid weakness and potential gapping as the floor naturally expands and contracts.\nUnderlay & Damp Proofing\nIt is strongly recommended that a purpose made impermeable moisture barrier is used below floating wood floors. The moisture membrane may be used in the form of 1000 gauge polythene damp proof membrane for concrete which is laid over the sub-floor before the underlay, then flooring is laid. Alternatively an underlay which incorporates a moisture resistant barrier may be used. In either case the moisture membrane is taken vertically up the wall and trimmed off above the finished level of the wood floor surface. All moisture barriers must be taped at the joins with a purpose made jointing tape. Polythene damp proof membranes are overlapped by 200 mm or greater before joins are taped.\nFloated Installation – Important Notes\n- L-shaped halls are better suited to fully bonded installation than floating.\n- If installing as a floating floor in L-shaped areas, in commercial use, or over under floor heating ensure that the joints are double bonded with adhesive applied to the upper and lower portion of the groove.\n- Where necessary use flooring straps to achieve closed joints.\n- Flooring must not be exposed to artificial heat sources such as from heated pipes at shallow depth below screeds, or suspended pipes below floorboards. Pipes must be thoroughly insulated.\nProvision For Expansion – Important Note\nWood flooring is affected by seasonal climactic changes and will expand and contract, so it is important to allow room for this expansion. Expansion spaces of minimum 12mm for floors less than 25m2 or minimum 15 mm for larger areas must be left wherever the floors meets obstructions including all walls, door frames, thresholds, structural support, fireplaces etc. These expansion gaps can be covered using the skirting, or edge trim (e.g. Scotia, Quadrant). It is recommended that an expansion break is always employed where rooms join. T- Bar threshold strips can be used for this purpose. Alternatively where wood floors meet other floor coverings a suitable Reducer threshold strip may be used.\nStep 6 – Fully Bonded Installation\nEngineered wood flooring may be installed direct to concrete or sandcement screed sub-floors, or to suitable wood based sub-floors (e.g. Plywood, OSB) by fully-bonding with a purpose made permanently flexible adhesive (e.g. 1 component Polyurethane or SMP). Wood’s Good MS and MS Plus floor adhesive is fully tested with all V4 Wood Flooring products and is recommended. The adhesive is applied to the sub-floor only using a V-notched trowel, which creates ridges of adhesive which the flooring is bedded into when laid. Always use the trowel type which is recommended by the manufacturer of the flooring adhesive for the type of wood flooring being installed and replace worn trowels.\nFully Bonding – Important Notes\n- When installing flooring uplift occasional boards after placement and examine the residues of adhesive on the underside of the board to ensue the board is making full with the bed of adhesive.\n- For UFH hot water system embedded into concrete full bond is recommended as it improves the TOG rating.\n- Previous floor coverings and the adhesive residues used to adhere floor coverings to sub-floors must be removed before bonding of wood flooring.\n- Ensure screeds are of adequate cohesion strength of before installation.\n- Avoid accelerated drying of new screeds as this can lead to poor cohesive strength, especially over under floor heating.\n- Always check the recommendations of the applicable adhesive manufacturer, esp. regarding other sub-floors. e.g. asphalt, anhydrite etc.\n- Some chipboard products have a moisture resistant treatment which can seriously impair adhesion. A layer of plywood may be laid over and securely fixed to the chipboard before installation may commence.\n- Any residues of MS type adhesives which come into contact with the face of the board must be removed whilst wet, as cured residues are not removable.\n- Concrete slabs if fully bonding down engineered flooring must be <65% relative humidity. Testing of subfloors must comply with BS8201 Code of practice for wood based products & BS 8204 Screeds, bases and in situ flooring.\nProvision For Expansion – Important Note\nEven fully bonded wood flooring is affected by seasonal climactic changes and will expand and contract, so it is important to allow room for this expansion. Expansion spaces of minimum 12mm for floors less than 25m2 or minimum 15 mm for larger areas must be left wherever the floors meets obstructions including all walls, door frames, thresholds, structural support, fireplaces etc. These expansion gaps can be covered using the skirting, or edge trim (e.g. Scotia, Quadrant). It is recommended that an expansion break is always employed where rooms join. T- Bar threshold strips can be used for this purpose. Alternatively where wood floors meet other floor coverings a suitable Reducer threshold strip may be used.","Almost all timber flooring products require expansion gaps to cater for adequate floor expansion. This requirement is applicable to all timber related flooring products including laminate flooring, strand woven bamboo flooring, both tongue and groove and click lock joint system engineered Timber floorboards and solid tongue and groove.\nAlmost all timber related flooring products will contain hygroscopic materials like natural timber fibres that will attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is more likely to occur during more humid weather or weather with high relative humidity causing the floorboards to expand. During drier weather, the floorboards will lose moisture and contract. Laminate and engineered timber flooring maybe a little bit more resistant to obvious expansion and contraction due to their material make up. Laminate flooring is made of a timber fibre board core that is covered on top by several layers of melamine layers and a stabilising layer underneath while engineered timber flooring core is made up of cross laminated timber layers making them comparatively more stable to solid timber flooring.\nAll timber flooring installation instructions and local industry standards will require that floors are installed with expansion allowance. All timber floors will require expansion gaps at the perimeter of the floor, between the timber floorboards and the wall. The gap is then usually covered by skirting board or by beading or scotia. Sometimes it is also necessary to have expansion joints within the floor. As a general rule, an expansion gap will be required every 8-metre span for laminate flooring. However, different laminate flooring and other timber floorboards have differing requirements. It is best to consult the installation instructions of your flooring product or contact your supplier for advice.\nThere are numerous consequences of not installing adequate expansion allowance or insufficient expansion allowances that can affect the floor’s performance. This can come in visual forms such as buckling and peaking at board edges and ends or in other forms such as squeaking near the wall (and not of the subfloor/substrate). Ultimately, your flooring contractor or installer will decide if expansion joints are required within a floor and there may be room for negotiation in terms of where the expansion will be placed. If the flooring contactor or installer decides that an expansion joint is required, then there isn’t the option to not have them. A friend’s floor not having them is not a sufficient reason as the makeup of the dwelling, the location and the flooring product used will most likely be different and cannot be compared. Not having sufficient expansion allowance may affect your flooring product’s warranty as well.\nIt is also important to consider expansion allowance around all fixed objects, including internal columns, pipes and other floor surfaces such as ceramic tiles. The nature of floating floors is such that it is not fixed or anchored to the subfloor and their timber core is not orientated in any direction and so their expansion movements are not restrained and can expand at an equal rate in both their length and width. It is laid on top of foam or rubber underlay and will move to weather changes and to foot traffic. It is important that floating floor is laid around kitchen island benches and built-in wardrobes and its movement not be restrained by heavy benches and similar objects.\nThere are several expansion joints and trims that can be used to conceal the gaps between the floor and the wall and between two floor surfaces. The most common method used to cover perimeter gap is to install laminate beading or scotia that can be attached to the existing skirting board or the wall with either flexible timber adhesive or brad nails. Some customers may prefer to use new or the existing skirting boards but you may have to consider the damage that maybe caused by removing the existing skirting board from the wall, especially if it is a plasterboard wall. For expansion joints within the floor there is a range of profiles made from laminated MDF with matching decorative paper or coated aluminium with similar colours that are available for purchase.\nAll information and tips in this publication are of a general nature only and Advanced Flooring Services does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of the information and tips in this publication.

{"question":"HTTP redirect codes 308 vs 404 - how are they different?","answer":"308 and 404 serve completely different purposes in HTTP responses. 308 is a permanent redirect code that preserves the original HTTP method (like POST) when redirecting to a new URI, and tells the client to use the new location for future requests. 404, however, simply indicates that the requested resource was not found at the given URL, with no indication of whether this is temporary or permanent, and provides no alternative location for the resource.","context":["I find that many web minded people working client-side or even server-side have neglected to learn the subtle details of the redirects of today. Here’s my attempt at writing another text about it that the ones who should read it still won’t.\nNothing here, go there!\nThe “redirect” is a fundamental part of the HTTP protocol. The concept was present and is documented already in the first spec (RFC 1945), published in 1996, and it has remained well used ever since.\nA redirect is exactly what it sounds like. It is the server sending back an instruction to the client – instead of giving back the contents the client wanted. The server basically says “go look over [here] instead for that thing you asked for“.\nBut not all redirects are alike. How permanent is the redirect? What request method should the client use in the next request?\nAll redirects also need to send back a Location: header with the new URI to ask for, which can be absolute or relative.\nPermanent or Temporary\nIs the redirect meant to last or just remain for now? If you want a GET to resource A permanently redirect users to resource B with another GET, send back a 301. It also means that the user-agent (browser) is meant to cache this and keep going to the new URI from now on when the original URI is requested.\nThe temporary alternative is 302. Right now the server wants the client to send a GET request to B, but it shouldn’t cache this but keep trying the original URI when directed to it.\nNote that both 301 and 302 will make browsers do a GET in the next request, which possibly means changing method if it started with a POST (and only if POST). This changing of the HTTP method to GET for 301 and 302 responses is said to be “for historical reasons”, but that’s still what browsers do so most of the public web will behave this way.\nIn practice, the 303 code is very similar to 302. It will not be cached and it will make the client issue a GET in the next request. The differences between a 302 and 303 are subtle, but 303 seems to be more designed for an “indirect response” to the original request rather than just a redirect.\nThese three codes were the only redirect codes in the HTTP/1.0 spec.\nGET or POST?\nAll three of these response codes, 301 and 302/303, will assume that the client sends a GET to get the new URI, even if the client might’ve sent a POST in the first request. This is very important, at least if you do something that doesn’t use GET.\nIf the server instead wants to redirect the client to a new URI and wants it to send the same method in the second request as it did in the first, like if it first sent POST it’d like it to send POST again in the next request, the server would use different response codes.\nTo tell the client “the URI you sent a POST to, is permanently redirected to B where you should instead send your POST now and in the future”, the server responds with a 308. And to complicate matters, the 308 code is only recently defined (the spec was published in June 2014) so older clients may not treat it correctly! If so, then the only response code left for you is…\nThe (older) response code to tell a client to send a POST also in the next request but temporarily is 307. This redirect will not be cached by the client though so it’ll again post to A if requested to. The 307 code was introduced in HTTP/1.1.\nOh, and redirects work the exact same way in HTTP/2 as they do in HTTP/1.1.\nThe helpful table version\n|Switch to GET||301||302 and 303|\n|Keep original method||308||307|\nIt’s a gap!\nWhat about other HTTP methods?\nThey don’t change methods! This table above is only for changing from POST to GET, other methods will not change.\ncurl and redirects\nI couldn’t write a text like this without spicing it up with some curl details!\nIt turns out that there are web services out there in the world that want a POST sent, are responding with HTTP redirects that use a 301, 302 or 303 response code and still want the HTTP client to send the next request as a POST. As explained above, browsers won’t do that and neither will curl – by default.\nSince these setups exist, and they’re actually not terribly rare, curl offers options to alter its behavior.\nYou can tell curl to not change the POST request method to GET after a 30x response by using the dedicated options for that:\n–post301, –post302 and –post303. If you are instead writing a libcurl based application, you control that behavior with the CURLOPT_POSTREDIR option.\nHere’s how a simple HTTP/1.1 redirect can look like. Note the 301, this is “permanent”:","Blog » HTTP Status Codes for Beginners\nHTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the method by which clients (i.e. you) and servers communicate. When someone clicks a link, types in a URL or submits out a form, their browser sends a request to a server for information. It might be asking for a page, or sending data, but either way, that is called an HTTP Request. When a server receives that request, it sends back an HTTP Response, with information for the client. Usually, this is invisible, though I'm sure you've seen one of the very common Response codes - 404, indicating a page was not found. There are a fair few more status codes sent by servers, and the following is a list of the current ones in HTTP 1.1, along with an explanation of their meanings.\nA more technical breakdown of HTTP 1.1 status codes and their meanings is available at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html. There are several versions of HTTP, but currently HTTP 1.1 is the most widely used.\n- 100 - Continue\nA status code of 100 indicates that (usually the first) part of a request has been received without any problems, and that the rest of the request should now be sent.\n- 101 - Switching Protocols\nHTTP 1.1 is just one type of protocol for transferring data on the web, and a status code of 101 indicates that the server is changing to the protocol it defines in the \"Upgrade\" header it returns to the client. For example, when requesting a page, a browser might receive a statis code of 101, followed by an \"Upgrade\" header showing that the server is changing to a different version of HTTP.\n- 200 - OK\nThe 200 status code is by far the most common returned. It means, simply, that the request was received and understood and is being processed.\n- 201 - Created\nA 201 status code indicates that a request was successful and as a result, a resource has been created (for example a new page).\n- 202 - Accepted\nThe status code 202 indicates that server has received and understood the request, and that it has been accepted for processing, although it may not be processed immediately.\n- 203 - Non-Authoritative Information\nA 203 status code means that the request was received and understood, and that information sent back about the response is from a third party, rather than the original server. This is virtually identical in meaning to a 200 status code.\n- 204 - No Content\nThe 204 status code means that the request was received and understood, but that there is no need to send any data back.\n- 205 - Reset Content\nThe 205 status code is a request from the server to the client to reset the document from which the original request was sent. For example, if a user fills out a form, and submits it, a status code of 205 means the server is asking the browser to clear the form.\n- 206 - Partial Content\nA status code of 206 is a response to a request for part of a document. This is used by advanced caching tools, when a user agent requests only a small part of a page, and just that section is returned.\n- 300 - Multiple Choices\nThe 300 status code indicates that a resource has moved. The response will also include a list of locations from which the user agent can select the most appropriate.\n- 301 - Moved Permanently\nA status code of 301 tells a client that the resource they asked for has permanently moved to a new location. The response should also include this location. It tells the client to use the new URL the next time it wants to fetch the same resource.\n- 302 - Found\nA status code of 302 tells a client that the resource they asked for has temporarily moved to a new location. The response should also include this location. It tells the client that it should carry on using the same URL to access this resource.\n- 303 - See Other\nA 303 status code indicates that the response to the request can be found at the specified URL, and should be retrieved from there. It does not mean that something has moved - it is simply specifying the address at which the response to the request can be found.\n- 304 - Not Modified\nThe 304 status code is sent in response to a request (for a document) that asked for the document only if it was newer than the one the client already had. Normally, when a document is cached, the date it was cached is stored. The next time the document is viewed, the client asks the server if the document has changed. If not, the client just reloads the document from the cache.\n- 305 - Use Proxy\nA 305 status code tells the client that the requested resource has to be reached through a proxy, which will be specified in the response.\n- 307 - Temporary Redirect\n307 is the status code that is sent when a document is temporarily available at a different URL, which is also returned. There is very little difference between a 302 status code and a 307 status code. 307 was created as another, less ambiguous, version of the 302 status code.\n- 400 - Bad Request\nA status code of 400 indicates that the server did not understand the request due to bad syntax.\n- 401 - Unauthorized\nA 401 status code indicates that before a resource can be accessed, the client must be authorised by the server.\n- 402 - Payment Required\nThe 402 status code is not currently in use, being listed as \"reserved for future use\".\n- 403 - Forbidden\nA 403 status code indicates that the client cannot access the requested resource. That might mean that the wrong username and password were sent in the request, or that the permissions on the server do not allow what was being asked.\n- 404 - Not Found\nThe best known of them all, the 404 status code indicates that the requested resource was not found at the URL given, and the server has no idea how long for.\n- 405 - Method Not Allowed\nA 405 status code is returned when the client has tried to use a request method that the server does not allow. Request methods that are allowed should be sent with the response (common request methods are POST and GET).\n- 406 - Not Acceptable\nThe 406 status code means that, although the server understood and processed the request, the response is of a form the client cannot understand. A client sends, as part of a request, headers indicating what types of data it can use, and a 406 error is returned when the response is of a type not i that list.\n- 407 - Proxy Authentication Required\nThe 407 status code is very similar to the 401 status code, and means that the client must be authorised by the proxy before the request can proceed.\n- 408 - Request Timeout\nA 408 status code means that the client did not produce a request quickly enough. A server is set to only wait a certain amount of time for responses from clients, and a 408 status code indicates that time has passed.\n- 409 - Conflict\nA 409 status code indicates that the server was unable to complete the request, often because a file would need to be editted, created or deleted, and that file cannot be editted, created or deleted.\n- 410 - Gone\nA 410 status code is the 404's lesser known cousin. It indicates that a resource has permanently gone (a 404 status code gives no indication if a resource has gine permanently or temporarily), and no new address is known for it.\n- 411 - Length Required\nThe 411 status code occurs when a server refuses to process a request because a content length was not specified.\n- 412 - Precondition Failed\nA 412 status code indicates that one of the conditions the request was made under has failed.\n- 413 - Request Entity Too Large\nThe 413 status code indicates that the request was larger than the server is able to handle, either due to physical constraints or to settings. Usually, this occurs when a file is sent using the POST method from a form, and the file is larger than the maximum size allowed in the server settings.\n- 414 - Request-URI Too Long\nThe 414 status code indicates the the URL requested by the client was longer than it can process.\n- 415 - Unsupported Media Type\nA 415 status code is returned by a server to indicate that part of the request was in an unsupported format.\n- 416 - Requested Range Not Satisfiable\nA 416 status code indicates that the server was unable to fulfill the request. This may be, for example, because the client asked for the 800th-900th bytes of a document, but the document was only 200 bytes long.\n- 417 - Expectation Failed\nThe 417 status code means that the server was unable to properly complete the request. One of the headers sent to the server, the \"Expect\" header, indicated an expectation the server could not meet.\n- 500 - Internal Server Error\nA 500 status code (all too often seen by Perl programmers) indicates that the server encountered something it didn't expect and was unable to complete the request.\n- 501 - Not Implemented\nThe 501 status code indicates that the server does not support all that is needed for the request to be completed.\n- 502 - Bad Gateway\nA 502 status code indicates that a server, while acting as a proxy, received a response from a server further upstream that it judged invalid.\n- 503 - Service Unavailable\nA 503 status code is most often seen on extremely busy servers, and it indicates that the server was unable to complete the request due to a server overload.\n- 504 - Gateway Timeout\nA 504 status code is returned when a server acting as a proxy has waited too long for a response from a server further upstream.\n- 505 - HTTP Version Not Supported\nA 505 status code is returned when the HTTP version indicated in the request is no supported. The response should indicate which HTTP versions are supported."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6fc085c6-1494-403c-83fd-4f0295c658e4>","<urn:uuid:04a37397-d5bc-429d-bfde-8cf868d179fe>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which type of broadhead arrow is best for hunting mule deer?","answer":"An expandable broadhead is best for mule deer because it goes fast and has enough kinetic energy to penetrate the hide, which is thinner than an elk's hide.","context":["AUGMENT WITH ACCESSORIES\nImprovements in accessories also are making hunting easier. Foremost among them, especially when hunting deer, are scent controls.\n“Deer seem to be more sensitive to the things around them than elk, so scent controls can help cover something new to the environment,” says Kevin Rider, owner of Rifle’s Timberline Sporting Goods.\nCraig district wildlife manager Mike Swaro says maps and GPSs also are extremely useful when planning a hunt, allowing you to target specific locations. High-end binoculars, he adds, also are essential.\nWhile people have been hunting big game for centuries, advances in equipment keep making it easier.\nForemost on the list, says Rifle’s Kevin Rider, owner of Timberline Sporting Goods, are rangefinders, which help hunters discover exactly how far away a target is and the path their bullet or arrow will take.\nRanging between $200 and $1,000, they can be invaluable for the right hunt, he says.\n“Rangefinders help hunters become more accurate before they shoot,” he says. “They’re not necessary for all hunters, but they’re great for those who have a problem adjusting to distances between them and the animal.”\nCraig district wildlife manager Mike Swaro says rangefinders also help provide safety for hunters, keeping them in their distance comfort zone.\n“A lot of hunters hunt from longer distances, so a rangefinder is great for when they’re 400 or 500 yards out,” he says. “But hunters need to stay within a distance that they feel confident at and practice at.\n“If you can hit a range target at 200 yards, but get all over the place past that, you should stick at 200 yards when hunting,” he adds. “A rangefinder is great for letting you know exactly how far the animal is and to see if it’s within your practice zone.”\nRangefinders aren’t just for rifle hunters.\nBen Rice, manager at Meeker’s Rocky Mountain Bow Strings, says rangefinders, especially ones with Angle Range Compensation, also are useful for bow hunters because arrows, unlike bullets, don’t travel in a straight trajectory if shot from long distances.\n“If the trajectory changes from a straight shot to an uphill or downhill shot, the ARC technology helps,” he says. “With a 45- or 50-degree angle, the arrow has to travel an additional one to three yards. From 30, 40 or 50 yards out, knowing the exact trajectory with the ARC can be exceedingly helpful.”\nRifles and Arrows\nWhen it comes to selecting a rifle, the first thing to look at is what you plan on hunting, Swaro says. Next, be realistic about your skill.\n“The biggest thing to consider when deciding what rifle to use is how accurate and precise you can shoot,” he says. “If you have those skills, you can put down big game with a smaller caliber rifle. If you use a .243-caliber rifle and hit an elk at the right spot, it’ll go down.”\nSwaro adds that the state minimum caliber when hunting big game is set at .24.\nRice says knowing what game you’re hunting also is essential when choosing arrows.\nFor mule deer, he says the best arrow is an expandable broadhead, which will go fast and still has some kinetic energy to penetrate the hide. Mule deer speeds require a faster arrow, Rice says.\n“A deer hide isn’t as thick as an elk’s and the bones are smaller, so you don’t need as much penetration,” he says. “Deer stand about 4-feet high and elk about 6-feet, making them seem to move a lot faster, requiring a faster bow.”\nWith elk, Rice says hunters need an arrow that can cut through the thicker hide. If an arrow only penetrates one side, it won’t leave as big of a blood trail, making the animal harder to track, he says. “For elk I like to use a cut-on-contact broadhead,” he says. “Combined with a bow with more kinetic energy, the cut-on-contact heads make the elk easier to find after penetration.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:66fbf31b-1d07-4764-9635-f7e49f69a015>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I am doing research on recent protests in France - what caused the Yellow Vests movement to start and why are they called 'yellow vests'?","answer":"The Yellow Vests movement ('mouvement des gilets jaunes') began in November in response to a rise in fuel prices that was part of the Macron government's proposal to reduce France's carbon footprint. The protesters are called 'yellow vests' because they wear the reflective yellow safety vests that all French drivers are required to keep in their cars in case of breakdown.","context":["In the past few months, as series of protests have broken out in France against the government of Emmanuel Macron.\nSparked by a rise in fuel prices – part of a Macron government proposal to cut the country’s carbon footprint – the unrest saw demonstrations across the country, though the most high-profile of them were in the capital Paris.\nThe demonstrators, for the most part, wore the reflective yellow vests all French drivers are required to have in their car should it break down. The mouvement des gilets jaunes or “yellow vests movement” has become the face of French protests against austerity and attempts to reform some of legislature.\nThere have been many compelling news images of the protests since they began in November, the garish yellow vests standing out against the overcast skies and the stately stone of Parisian apartment buildings. But young French photographer Clement Marion has done something different – he has shot a day of protests using a Minolta SRT-100X camera and black-and-white film.\nKosmo Foto saw these images posted on a Facebook photography group. Quite simply, they are stunning. Marion’s heavy treatment has boosted contrast and grain; not the kind of thing you’d do for wedding shots, but perfectly suited to these smoke-shrouded winter streets. They remind me of a series of books about World War II my family had when I was a kid. Some of these gloomy, grainy images look a hangover from an even darker era in European politics.\nKosmo Foto spoke to Marion about the images and his enthusiasm for film. (Click on the galleries to see the images in more detail.)\nHow old are you and where are you from?\nI am 22, I studied photography for two years and during that time discovered film.\nI live in Marseille, in the south of the France. Actually I am working to earn money to pay the third year of photography school in Toulouse.\nWhat took you to Paris to shoot the protests?\nI had a stopover in Paris for two days, I was coming back from Germany. A friend offered me a place to stay, and he had already made a small series on the yellow vests, during the two previous acts. He suggested I join him for the protests the next day. So we spent a few hours in the afternoon in Paris, among the protesters and CRS.\nDescribe what happened on the day.\nMy friend and I are not used to demonstrations, it was the first time for me. At first, when a horde of CRS charges you, the adrenaline spreads in you like the gas in the street. And then you learn to position yourself between the two parts of the crowd, to be as safe as possible, while having a good field of vision. We could not enter the non-violence area because I was wearing a helmet. So we stayed in Saint Augustin Square, and on the Malesherbes Boulevard. On the day, that was where most of the clashes took place.\nAfter four hours of gas, screaming and moving crowds, we walked back, exhausted, almost all the subway stations had closed in the meantime.\nIs this the first time you’ve shot something like this?\nYes, definitely. And it’s hard to accept the fact that during the shoot, looking through the camera’s viewfinder for a moment, anything can fall on you and hurt you. It’s a bit too stressful compared to the photography I usually do. But it was a very good experience; humanely, artistically, and technically speaking.\nWhy did you use the Minolta?\nBecause it’s my favourite. Robust, not very expensive, refine, ergonomic. It is a good value for money. I started with a friend’s SR-T 101B model, and my dad gave me his SR-T 100. In my photos I do not necessarily seek a very fine definition of detail in the image, so it is a device that suits me. I also use a Minox, I like it a lot for discrete shots, and a Rolleicord, for more posed and thoughtful images.\nFor this series, I used the 50mm 1.4 Rokkor. It was new for me so I tested it. 50mm is a very good focal length. Also I use sometimes a 28mm 2.8 lens.\nWhy did you shoot it on black-and-white and not colour?\nI can assure the chain of production of images in my room, from the beginning to the end, development, and printing included. It’s harder in colour. The whole process is important, and I do not want to let it be done by a lab, or anyone other than me. And then I tend to prefer very drab colours, or black and white, in any case. I assume that for this topic, the yellow would have been important. But I had only Ilford HP5+ and Rollei RPX 400 in my bag, and they are both black and white.\nHow did you treat the negs to achieve this look?\nSince a few months, and during the trip to Germany and Holland, I’m looking for texture on my images, grain, but also surface effects on films, deterioration. Here, I pushed the development with Rodinal and a development time much too long, voluntarily.\nIt is risky, if you do not want to lose the negatives, but I often had a good surprise. I learned to do classic development in the right way, and then broke the rules. And I intend to continue in deterioration.\nHow long have you been shooting film?\nIt’s been almost three years now. Starting from the day I tried shooting film in photography school. I never used digital for any of my personal work after that! It’s something more manual, I am much closer to my image, than through a screen. Which does not prevent me from digitising my negatives and print sometimes!\nWhat kind of things do you usually shoot?\nI shoot the kind of things that appear in my field of daily view. Everything can be a good photo. Most of the time, I like to travel to provoke photography, to meet the moment. And I usually do a series of photographs. This is for me is the best way to show somethings: using series, and not one unique image.\nWhat image from the ones you sent sums up the day for you?\nThose with yellow vest, smoke, and CRS. Because it’s really what I’ve seen on this day. Artistically speaking, I really like the one with the bike. For the composition, frame and subject… and you look closer, you will see that there are three bikes in this image…\nWhat are you planning to do with the images?\nThe future will tell! Maybe some exhibitions in France. I like to believe that I testify to an event in the history of France, thanks to my photographs.\n- You can see more of Clement Marion’s images on his Instagram."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a5bf962a-9b1d-418b-8451-56e33c34e1c8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the deaths of Aretha Franklin and Heavy D compare in terms of their year of passing and age?","answer":"Aretha Franklin died in 2018, while Heavy D passed away in 2011. Heavy D died at the younger age of 44 due to a pulmonary embolism caused by deep leg vein thrombosis, while Aretha Franklin lived longer, passing away at 76 years old (born in 1942).","context":["September 11, 2018\nAuthored by: Caroline Ferrigan and Stephanie Moll\nPlease enjoy our first cross-Atlantic blog post since the merger of Bryan Cave and Berwin Leighton Paisner. Caroline Ferrigan is a Senior Associate in the Private Client team in Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner’s London office. Stephanie Moll is a Private Client Partner in Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner’s Denver and St Louis offices.\nThe music world was left mourning the death of another legend recently with the passing of the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. A woman with a voice full of power and emotion, her death leaves a musical landscape with few (if any) who can emulate someone rated by Rolling Stone as the greatest singer of all time. However, as well as leaving a gaping hole in the music industry, Aretha Franklin’s death may also leave an estate administration headache, as it is understood that she passed away without leaving a Will or trust.\nWith an estimated fortune of $80m, it may come as a surprise that someone of such significant wealth did not make a Will, but it is not the first time that such a high profile individual has passed away in these circumstances. The hugely talented singer and songwriter Prince also died without making a Will, leaving his estate in disarray – a situation still continuing two years after his death.\nSo what happens to someone’s estate if they die without making a Will? And is it a total disaster?\nFortunately, the law (in both the UK and the US) is at hand to ‘step in’ and direct how an estate passes where no Will has been made, or where a Will does not deal with the entire estate. These rules are known as the “intestacy rules” and they set out the way in which an estate passes according to the categories of family members the deceased leaves behind.\nUnder Michigan law, the two key categories of family members – spouse and descendants – are treated in priority to others. Since Aretha was not married at her death, her four children should be able to take comfort, at an otherwise sad and stressful time, that they do not have to overly worry about the need to bring any form of claim for provision from her estate. In fact, according to the Detroit Free Press, her four sons filed probate documents, listing themselves as interested parties in her estate, and her niece has also requested that she be appointed as personal representative of the estate.\nSo, no, relying on the intestacy rules is not a total disaster. However, the situation is best avoided, given the estate passes in accordance with statutory rules which may not correspond with the wishes of the deceased. Not every individual may want their children to receive potentially significant assets outright or for a spouse to receive only part of the estate – the potential effects of the intestacy rules.\nRelying on the intestacy rules can also give rise to some pretty undesirable tax consequences. For example, under US law in effect in 2018, Aretha had estate and generation-skipping transfer tax exemptions of $11.18m (reduced by any lifetime use), which could have been allocated to trusts created for her descendants, allowing the trusts to continue from generation-to-generation without being subject to estate or generation-skipping transfer taxes, for as long as allowable under state law. Also, in both the UK and the US, in most cases, there is a significant benefit in leaving your entire estate to your surviving spouse (either outright or on a special form of trust) as transfers to spouses generally benefit from a total exemption from UK inheritance tax or US estate tax, as applicable.\nAs Aretha Franklin died with children, it seems that it should be possible for her estate administrators to avoid some of the mess encountered in Prince’s estate – particularly as the passing of Aretha’s estate does not appear at this stage to be contested. However, estate administration can be difficult and complicated even where a Will was in place. Why make the position harder at such a difficult time (both emotionally and practically) by not drawing up a Will? Her long-time attorney, Don Wilson, was quoted in the Detroit Free Press article, saying “I was after her for a number of years to do a trust. It would have expedited things and kept them out of probate, and kept things private.”\nThere is great peace of mind that comes with knowing that your wishes will be followed and your loved ones provided for once you have gone.\nIn any case, whilst we see how the administration of Aretha’s estate unfolds, we can all be thankful to be left with a catalogue of hits from a woman whose voice brought together the traditions of gospel, jazz and rhythm & blues in the most incredible way and in whose own words used “to the highest degree possible the gift that God gave me to use.” Rest in peace, Aretha Franklin (1942-2018).","November 8: This Day in Black History\nFEATURED: Heavy D\n1898: In 2 days of racial violence, a mob of whites, led by some of Wilmington’s most respected and influential citizens, destroyed the state’s only daily African American newspaper.\n1920: Ester Rolle was born.

{"question":"I'm new to draughts history - who was first world champion Weiss or Dussaut? Facts only","answer":"While some sources indicate Anatole Dussaut as the first world champion, his victories (1885-1894) were actually in international tournaments held in France. Isidore Weiss is considered the first true world champion in draughts, winning eight world championships from 1894 to 1909.","context":["We’ve already discussed shots starting from squares 31 (Napoleon’s shot) and 32 (Beginner’s shot). The next thing I’m going to do is to introduce a shot, that starts from square 33. It’s called “the Bridge” and it’s very useful.\nLook on the diagram below. White’s position is quite strong in the center and he has an opportunity to finish this game quickly. White is to move. Do you see what he should do?\nThe best move here is 28-23.\nWhy? Because it forces Black to move his piece back from the square 29 to 18 (28×18). And after the capture situation will look like this.\nWhite is ready for another sacrifice. He plays 36-31.\nBlack is forced to capture forwards (26×37) but this is not a final destination of lonely black stone. Do you see where it goes?\nWhite makes another sacrifice – 38-32.\nThe lonely black stone is forced to jump again (37×28).\nAnd this way White build his bridge to victory. All he has to do now is to capture three pieces (33x22x13x4) and land in the king’s row.\nThis shot is called “The Bridge”. White don’t gains numerical superiority, but he gains a King. You can see this shot on video to better understand how it works.\nBridge shot – how it works?\n- If the shot is made by White, it starts from square 33 and usually ends on square 4 or 15.\n- If the shot is made by Black, it starts from square 19 and usually ends on squares 47 or 36.\n- The final shot starts from the middle, goes left and turns right after the first jump.\nAnalysis of the presented example\nIn the example shown below White player performed the following operations.\n- He moved one enemy man to square 19\n- He moved one enemy man to square 28, but this task required two sacrifices.\nNow, look at the initial position shown below to understand how the White player “saw” this combination in his mind. Squares marked in blue show points of final jump. Red lines show how Black men should be transported to make a final jump possible. Red squares indicate sacrifices.\nBridge for Black\nThe black player may also build a bridge. Look at the situation shown below. What should Black do? It’s easier to guess if you know that shot will start from square 19. You can also guess that Black must transport an enemy piece to squares 23 (because the rest of the bridge is already built at squares 33 and 42). So what Black has to do?\nThe answer is: Black must play 23-28! White is forced to answer with 32x23x14 so Black sacrifices two pieces at the start. But now he may play 13-19 and this forces White to play 14×22. The bridge is built!\nBlack makes a final shot – 18x29x38x47.\nBridges are quite common in practice. Theory of these shots was developed by Isidore Weiss (1867-1936) who is considered the first world champion in draughts and won eight world championships in total (from 1894 to 1909).\nTo be more precise, some sources indicate Anatole Dussaut as a first world champion, but Dussaut won three tournaments from 1885 to 1894 that were in fact only international tournaments held in France. They are sometimes called world championships because all leading players were present there.\nWhat’s interesting, Weiss was known as a player who downplayed the importance of openings. He used to say: “No matter how you played in the opening. It’s important what continuation you’ll found”. You have to admit that Bridges are great continuations and it’s a good idea to look for them in your games.\nIn this lesson you’ve learned a Bridge shot that can be made from squares 33 for White and 19 for Black. It usually occurs in the middlegame.\n- 28-23 29×18\n- 36-31 26×37\nExample for black:\n- … 23-28\n- 32×14 13-19\n- 14×22 18×47\nPrevious parts of this tutorial\n- International Draughts tutorial p. 1.

{"question":"I'm planning a weekend trip to Bangkok and love shopping. How does Chatuchak Weekend Market compare to Siam Paragon in terms of size and what they sell?","answer":"Chatuchak Weekend Market is significantly larger, spreading over 35 acres with over 9,000 stores and stalls, while Siam Paragon is a 9-level mega mall. Chatuchak offers a vast array of items including clothing, antiques, pets, plants, books, food, and collectibles at bargain prices, typically attracting 200,000 visitors on weekends. Siam Paragon focuses more on luxury and international brands, featuring clothing, jewelry, technology, and entertainment facilities like a cinema, bowling alley, and aquarium. While both are major shopping destinations, Chatuchak offers a more traditional market experience with bargaining opportunities, while Siam Paragon provides a modern, air-conditioned mall environment.","context":["We've hand-picked the best things to do in Thailand.\n27 Attractions in Thailand:\nSanctuary of TruthA majestic, castle-like wooden temple seemingly floating above the sea at the Ratchavete Cape beachfront.

{"question":"作为一个数据库管理员，我很想知道BCNF和B树索引结构之间有什么关系，以及它们如何影响数据库性能? 🤔","answer":"BCNF and B-tree indexes are two distinct but important concepts that affect database performance in different ways. BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) is a normalization form that eliminates certain types of anomalies by ensuring that for every functional dependency X->Y, X must be a super key. This makes BCNF stronger than 3NF and helps maintain data integrity. On the other hand, B-tree is the index structure used in MyISAM tables that enables fast data retrieval by organizing indexes in a tree structure with multiple levels. The B-tree allows searches, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time, with root nodes connecting to leaf nodes that point to actual data pages. While BCNF focuses on proper data organization, B-tree indexes focus on efficient data access, though both ultimately contribute to overall database performance.","context":["What is BCNF normalization example?\nBCNF is the advance version of 3NF. It is stricter than 3NF. A table is in BCNF if every functional dependency X → Y, X is the super key of the table. For BCNF, the table should be in 3NF, and for every FD, LHS is super key….EMP_DEPT_MAPPING table:\nHow do I use BCNF?\nA relation is in BCNF iff, X is superkey for every functional dependency (FD) X? Y in given relation. In other words, A relation is in BCNF, if and only if, every determinant is a Form (BCNF) candidate key.\nHow does BCNF decompose?\nDecompose R into BCNF form: If R is not in BCNF, we decompose R into a set of relations S that are in BCNF. Thus, R(A,B,C,D,E) is decomposed into a set of relations: R1(A,C,E), R2(A,B) and R3(C,D) that satisfies BCNF.\nWhy do we use BCNF?\nBCNF is a stronger form of normalization than 3NF because it eliminates the second condition for 3NF, which allowed the right side of the FD to be a prime attribute. Thus, every left side of an FD in a table must be a superkey. Every table that is BCNF is also 3NF, 2NF, and 1NF, by the previous definitions.\nWhy is BCNF used?\nBoyce–Codd normal form (or BCNF or 3.5NF) is a normal form used in database normalization. It is a slightly stronger version of the third normal form (3NF). BCNF was developed in 1974 by Raymond F. Codd to address certain types of anomalies not dealt with by 3NF as originally defined.\nWhat is a super key in BCNF?\nA superkey is a set of fields that contain unique values. You can use a superkey to uniquely identify the records in a table and recall that a candidate key is a minimal superkey. In other words, if you remove any of the fields from the candidate key, it will not be a superkey anymore.\nDoes all BCNF satisfies 3NF?\nIf a relation is in BCNF, it will satisfy 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF by default. It ensures that for every functional dependency X->Y, X is a super key of the table, making BCNF a stronger variation of 3NF.\nHow does BCNF differ from 3NF?\nThis relation is in 3NF as it is already in 2NF and has no transitive dependency. Also there is no non prime attribute that is deriving a non prime attribute….Difference between 3NF and BCNF :\n|3.||In 3NF the functional dependencies are already in 1NF and 2NF.||In BCNF the functional dependencies are already in 1NF, 2NF and 3NF.|\nWhat does BCNF stand for?\nBoyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF) RDBMSDatabaseMySQL BCNF is an extension to Third Normal Form (3NF) and is slightly stronger than 3NF. A relation R is in BCNF, if P -> Q is a trivial functional dependency and P is a superkey for R.\nWhat is BCNF (Boyce-Codd normal form)?\nBoyce-Codd Normal Form or BCNF is an extension to the third normal form, and is also known as 3.5 Normal Form. Before you continue with Boyce-Codd Normal Form, check these topics for better understanding of database normalization concept: Follow the video above for complete explanation of BCNF.\nIs a relation in BCNF or normal form?\nA relation is in BCNF, if and only if, every determinant is a Form (BCNF) candidate key. Note – To test whether a relation is in BCNF, we identify all the determinants and make sure that they are candidate keys. You came across a similar hierarchy known as Chomsky Normal Form in Theory of Computation.\nWhat are the rules for BCNF in DBMS?\nRules for BCNF. For a table to satisfy the Boyce-Codd Normal Form, it should satisfy the following two conditions: It should be in the Third Normal Form. And, for any dependency A → B, A should be a super key. The second point sounds a bit tricky, right?","Before we jump into the complex detailing of MyISAM, it’s time to learn some of its important characteristics:\n- MyISAM stores each table in two files — one containing data, and the other, indexes. The extensions of these two files’ names are\n.MYIrespectively. Using the\nINDEX DIRECTORYoptions to the\nCREATE TABLEquery, you can put the above mentioned two files in different directories. These two directories, put on different disks, can offer significant performance improvement. This technique is often used in case of very heavily loaded databases, and is supported by many databases.\n- The data stored in these files is platform-independent — or, more technically put, is not dependent on the endianness of a machine. In other words, you can simply copy (literally) data and index files from an Intel x86/x64 machine to PowerPC or Sun SPARC.\n- MyISAM doesn’t support transactions. Only table locks are available. Row-level locks, which are a must for MVCC capabilities (transactions, to put it in simple words) are not available in MyISAM.\n- All the readers (with\nSELECTfamily of queries) have to obtain read locks. Multiple users can acquire read locks at the same time; hence, the common term shared locks is frequently used.\n- All the writers have to obtain exclusive locks. In simple words, two users cannot perform writes (\nDELETEfamily of operations) at the same time. This is very important to remember. A write operation must finish very quickly. Otherwise, in case of a database with a heavy load, there will be a long queue of connections waiting for exclusive (write) lock. In general, write operations are not time-consuming; however, the indexing strategy plays a role here. More on this later.\n- One great feature offered by MyISAM is called concurrent inserts. These allow the insertion of new records while\nSELECT-family queries are running. However, as insertion requires an exclusive lock, only one user can perform concurrent inserts.\n- MyISAM supports full-text index.\n- MyISAM supports compressed tables. When a table is compressed using the\nmyisampackutility, individual rows are compressed and not the entire table as a single entity. Please remember that compressed tables are read-only. When a\nSELECTquery is issued on a compressed table, rows are decompressed based on the requirement. A query causing a full-table scan can be a disaster in such a case; however, a well-indexed table performs pretty well. Compressed tables are a great utility when distributing a database on space-constrained media like CDs.\n- MyISAM permits NULL values in indexed columns.\n- Each character (\nVARCHAR) column can have a different character set. For instance, in one column you may store ASCII character values, and in the other you may store UTF-8 or UTF-16 values.\nUnderstanding the B-tree\nAnybody dealing with a respectable database-management system must have heard the term “B-tree”. Some systems and databases also use the notion of B+tree. What is it and how does it fit into the picture of database-management systems? Here is what Wikipedia says on the topic:\nIn computer science, a B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic amortised time. The B-tree is a generalisation of a binary search tree, in that a node can have more than two children. Unlike self-balancing binary search trees, the B-tree is optimised for systems that read and write large blocks of data. It is commonly used in databases and filesystems.\nFigure 1 shows a very simple B-tree. Notice the difference between conventional binary search trees and a B-tree. A B-tree is not “binary”, that is, each node having 2 child nodes. Essentially, a B-tree allows storing data in a manner so that searching records, inserting new ones, and deleting existing ones is very fast.\nNow, let’s come back to the question about what the relationship between MyISAM and a B-tree is, and how you can write better queries by getting details on this subject.\nThe B-tree index\nWhen you create an index in a MyISAM table, its type is B-tree. Figure 2 shows how MyISAM stores the index(es) in the .MYI file and data in the\nDon’t be bothered if this appears a bit daunting. The following is a description of how data and indexes are stored in case of B-tree indexes, in MyISAM tables:\n- On top, we have the root node of the B-tree. This is not specific to MySQL or MyISAM. Every tree has to have a top-level/root node. Traversal starts from this node in most cases. In B-tree terminology, this is called a non-leaf node. Leaf nodes are those that have no child nodes.\n- Below the root node, we have leaf nodes that are connected with the root node. The link between the root node and the immediate children is shown as “pointers”; however, it is not necessary that these be C/C++ style pointers.\n- Figure 2 shows a B-tree with two levels; however, in a real case, the tree may be much more complex, with multiple levels. This representation is to give you a basic idea about how B-tree works in the case of MyISAM.\n- In this figure, three leaf nodes are shown. Each leaf node holds the keys of a different range: 1 to 40, 41 to 80, and 81 to 100. Please note that the set of ranges is purely arbitrary, and meant purely for discussion purposes. This has no connection with how MyISAM breaks down the B-tree.\n- Below the leaf nodes are the actual data pages — i.e., the table data. These are connected with leaf nodes on the basis of key values. This is how searches on a well-indexed table get results at lightning speed.\n- Please note that the link between leaf nodes and data pages, which is marked as “Pointer to Data Pages” isn’t a C/C++ style pointer. Instead, leaf nodes hold enough information required to access the exact position of a row (or rows) in the\n.MYDfile. In other words, data can be read/updated/deleted with the least required file I/O.\n- To make this a little simpler, let’s take an example query:\nSELECT * FROM SOME_TABLE WHERE SOME_COLUMN = 15;\n- It is assumed that the column\n- From the root node, follow the left channel. This is based on simple maths,\n15 < 40. This lands you at the left-most leaf node.\n- In the left node, you will find the key with the value 15.\n- Once you find the key, you’ll know if there is any data in the\nSOME_COLUMN = 15.\n- If so, retrieve the information required to reach that exact location in the\n.MYDfile, to read the row in question.\n- It is assumed that the column\nAfter a close look at Figure 2, you can answer a question that is often a matter of debate — or rather, confusion. Does MyISAM support clustered indexes? The answer is, “NO!”\nIn case of a clustered index, data is stored in a sorted order, which is based on the keys/indexes. This isn’t how MyISAM works. Data isn’t stored in a sorted order. Instead, data is stored in the order in which it is inserted. It is the indexes that are sorted, and these are not stored with data — MyISAM stores data and indexes separately. However, indexes have enough information to point at the exact location of the data in the .MYD file.\nPlease note that in case a MyISAM table contains multiple indexes, all the indexes are stored in the same\nPlease bear in mind that even though B-tree provides a facility for very fast lookup of indexes (and thus the data), everything comes at a cost. You must have heard that indexes improve the speed of searches (\nSELECT family of queries); however, insertions and deletions are slowed down. This is because whenever data is inserted/deleted, MySQL has to alter the indexes in the\n.MYI file. In case there are no indexes, then there is almost no need to deal with the\n.MYI part of a table. In this case, one can experience the fastest insertions, however, at the cost of extremely bad performance of\nPractically, no application relies on this approach. Indexes must be well-thought-out to avoid the cost of B-tree-driven index management while doing insertions/deletions, and yet getting the best results in case of searches. Whenever dealing with indexes, keep index selectivity in mind.\nThough not talked of very often, index selectivity is a very critical issue, and when attended properly, can answer two of the most common questions: why isn’t MySQL using my index, and why isn’t MySQL performing well even when I have properly indexed my table.\nIndex selectivity, in the simplest words, describes how different the values of a column are. This is assuming that the index contains only one column. In case there are multiple columns in an index, selectivity describes how different the values of those columns are.\nSelectivity is a number from 0 to 1 — or think of it as a percentage. A value of 1, or 100 per cent, means that each value in the column is unique. This happens with\nPRIMARY keys, although non-unique fields may have a selectivity of 1. This depends on the nature of values in the column(s) in question.\nSELECTIVITY = NUMBER OF DISTINCT RECORDS / TOTAL NUMBER OF RECORDS\nThis implies that\nPRIMARY indexes always have a selectivity of 1. The higher the selectivity, the faster the searches are going to be. For example, consider the following table:\n|Column name||Data type||Indexed?|\n|email_address||VARCHAR (100)||Yes, Primary|\nWe have two indexes in this table —\ncountry_code — and 10,000 records. Now let’s try to figure out the selectivity:\nemail_address: Being the primary key, all values in this column must be unique. Hence selectivity is 1, an extremely good index.\ncountry_code: Although there are many countries in this world, I am assuming that you have users coming from 100 countries. Selectivity = 100/10000 = 0.01 or 1 per cent. This is too low to serve as a good index.\nLower selectivity is treated by MySQL as an expensive operation. Higher selectivity is treated as an inexpensive operation.\nPlease note that the correct/scientific way to calculate selectivity is to use a production-class database, and find the distinct rows using a\nCOUNT (DISTINCT <COLUMN>)-like query. If you assume that the number of distinct values in a column do not always work well, avoid heuristics as much as possible.\nMySQL has a cost-based optimiser. This means that MySQL calculates the costs of different ways of performing a query, and then chooses the cheapest one. In order to calculate the exact cost, the optimiser would actually have to run the query. If MySQL finds the selectivity of an index (using the above formula) for each query, this will, by all means, kill the machine. So an estimate is taken.

{"question":"What is the best way to make participants understand their own communication patterns in nursing and cultural awareness exercises?","answer":"Participants best understand their communication patterns through structured activities that restrict verbal communication. In Barnga, players must navigate different card game rules using only gestures and pictures, creating a mini culture shock that forces them to recognize and adapt to differences. In nursing, simple improvisational exercises like pretend ping-pong games allow nurses to observe their nonverbal communication patterns, leadership tendencies, and relationship dynamics. Both approaches require post-activity debriefing or discussion where participants reflect on their experiences, feelings of discomfort, and realizations about their communication styles. These exercises help participants recognize their preconceived notions and expectations that may hinder effective interpersonal skills.","context":["Barnga: A Game About Inter-Cultural Awareness\nDescription by Andrea MacGregor\nTime Requirement: 60-80 minutes\n- Realization that different cultures perceive things differently, and/or play by different rules.\n- Students must understand and reconcile these differences if they want to function effectively in a cross-cultural group.\nIntroduction: In Barnga, participants experience the shock of realizing that despite many similarities, people of differing cultures perceive things differently or play by different rules. Players learn that they must understand and reconcile these differences if they want to function effectively in a cross-cultural group.\nOverview: Participants play a simple card game in small groups, where conflicts begin to occur as participants move from group to group. This simulates real cross-cultural encounters, where people initially believe they share the same understanding of the basic rules. In discovering that the rules are different, players undergo a mini culture shock similar to actual experience when entering a different culture. They then must struggle to understand and reconcile these differences to play the game effectively in their “cross-cultural” groups. Difficulties are magnified by the fact that players may not speak to each other but can communicate only through gestures or pictures. Participants are not forewarned that each is playing by different rules; in struggling to understand why other players don’t seem to be playing correctly, they gain insight into the dynamics of cross-cultural encounters\nSet-up: Set up (approximately) 6 tables (about 4 people per table), depending on the number of people participating. On each table there should be a copy of the rules for that table per player plus a deck of cards (use only A-10, no face cards). To start, let the’ participants play a few rounds with the rules and with talking allowed. Next, EVERYTHING is removed from the playing tables. Play continues with everyone at his own table. From now, talking is prohibited. Winners will receive one popsicle stick (see below for how to win).\nAfter allowing a few rounds without talking at the home table, participants must switch tables—the person who won the most tricks moves clockwise to the next table, the person who loses the most tricks moves counter-clockwise to the next table. What the players do not know is that each table has learned a different set of rules (see below).\nThe rules: Depending on the number of players, rule sheets can be altered or discarded for the number of tables being used. Some samples of rules are as follows:\n- Table 1: Ace high, no trump\n- Table 2: Ace low, diamonds trump\n- Table 3: Ace low, clubs trump\n- Table 4: Ace high, hearts trump\n- Table 5: Ace high, spades trump\n- Table 6: Ace low, no trump\n- In all cases, other cards will be worth face value—10 high, 2 low.\nEach table shares the following rules:\n- Players are dealt 5 cards each\n- Whoever wins the most tricks will move clockwise to the next table\n- Whoever loses the most tricks will move counter clockwise to the next table\n- Everyone else stays at the same table\n- Ties are resolved by paper rock scissors\n- Each round will be about 5 minutes long (longer if time allows) and each round will consist any number of games that the time allows.\n- After the initial round, players will not be allowed to see the rules or speak to each other. Gestures and pictures are allowed, but players are not allowed to use words.\n- The game “winner” will be the person who has won the most tricks in total. (Of course, once game play starts, winning will likely take a back seat to trying to figure out what everyone else is doing, as they are playing by different rules.)\n- Players can keep track of scores with popsicle sticks (one stick per trick won).\n- The dealer can be anyone at the table, the person who plays first will be to the right of the dealer .\n- The first player for each trick may play ANY suit. All other players must follow suit (play a card of the same suit). For each round, each player plays one card.\n- If a player does not have that suit, a card of any suit must be played. The trick is won by the person with the HIGHEST card of the ORIGINAL suit (players will begin to become confused when some players believe their card is trump, and others disagree or contradict this).\nDebriefing: After playing a number of rounds—either use a set time limit, or allow the number of rotations according to the number of tables in play (6 rounds for 6 tables). Students should be aware that they were playing by different rules, and the following questions should be discussed. Students can stay in the last group they were in, or return to their home groups at the teacher’s discretion.\n- If you could describe the game in one word, what would it be?\n- What did you expect at the beginning of the game?\n- When did you realize that something was wrong?\n- How did you deal with it?\n- How did not being able to speak contribute to what you were feeling?","Nursing requires an effective set of interpersonal skills. A key to meeting this expectation is the ability to develop effective interpersonal communication. This is best accomplished by being able to self-reflect as a nurse. Basic theater improvisational exercises promote a person’s ability to recognize the impact of their communication patterns as part of their interpersonal skills. The teamwork of nurses working together on a unit, dynamics of nurses and managers, and relationships with patients all can benefit from simple improvisational (improv) games tailored to your specific needs.\nMy experimental foundation for using theater improvisational activities as an instructor derives from the Dramaturgic Model, Rehearsals for Growth (RfG) developed by psychologist Dr. Daniel J. Wiener. Summarized, a goal for RfG improvisational games is for the participant to relinquish set expectations, reduce reliance on control, and embrace the spontaneity of the present moment during interactions with others. The seminal work that Dr. Wiener builds on is the theory of Dramaturgy set forth by sociologist Dr. Erving Goffman in the late 1950s. Essentially Goffman says life is a stage, we are always performing, and what others see from us is what we choose to reveal to them.\nApplication to nursing\nThe goal of improvisational activities for our purposes is to help nurses reflect upon their verbal and nonverbal communication patterns, self-evaluate what is being communicated by their interactions, and recognize what the interpretation might be by others. Whether we are managers, instructors or bedside nurses, our personal interactions matter because of our invested common goal of providing quality care to patients.\nIf the improvisational exercise is successful, the participants have recognized their preconceived notions and expectations that may hinder effective interpersonal skills. Further goals would include encouraging acceptance, promoting attentiveness and responsiveness to cues from others (especially the nonverbal ones), and preventing impulsive reactions by nurses. Ultimately, the hope is that the nurse is able to replace a reliance on controlling relationships with being self-aware and responsive to the interpersonal nature of relationships.\nSetting the stage\nTheatrical improvisational games can be integrated into a variety of settings. First, the leader considers the desired outcome of the exercise. If you are the leader, ask yourself what you are hoping to accomplish. As a nurse instructor, you can use these activities to help novice nurses develop interpersonal skills. If you are working with expert nurses, maybe you are using this activity to relieve burnout. For managers, goals may include determining the dynamics, resolving the conflicts, or improving teamwork among nurses on the unit. These activities could be connected to performance evaluations.\nHere are two tips for the process known as “playing the game.”\nTip #1: Don’t discuss the goals for the activity in too much detail or you will lose the element of spontaneity. Of course, if you are asking for volunteers, it is only fair that they be aware of the elements of the game. For example, share that the nurse will be pretending and relying on only nonverbal communication as the form of interaction. The most important guideline is to convey that the atmosphere is intended to be supportive, and that there is no right or wrong response. If nurses are anticipating that you are critiquing them for correct or expected behaviors, then that influences the interactions that you wish to be real.\nTip #2: Keep the game brief. Two minutes seems like an eternity to the players. One minute will likely suffice. I would also suggest not keeping score. It is human nature to feel competitive when someone is keeping score. The goal of the game is not winning. Instead, encourage that it is an opportunity to let down, let go, and feel safe to put it all out there.\nPlaying the game\nPing-pong is the game I choose to promote discussion about interpersonal skills and the impact of nonverbal communication. Ask for two volunteers. Player one is P1 and player two is P2. Avoid using the word opponent. Offer the explanation mentioned above for the rules of the game (no talking; rely on nonverbal communication). Have the nurses pretend to choose their ping-pong paddles and choose their side of the table. Then simply say something like, “Okay, let’s play pretend ping-pong for a minute.”\nNext, observe during the game. Depending on what you are hoping to accomplish, here are some general observations. Assess if one or both players pretend to pick up the ping-pong ball to begin the game. What does that say about who assumed to be the leader or assumed they would serve first? Do the players volley back and forth endlessly? This may indicate hesitation on both players’ part to really engage.\nDuring their plays, are there aggressive hits that P1 may hit like it is an obvious ace but P2 returns the ball? What patterns of dominance, passiveness, willingness to relent, or refusal to appear as the loser take place? Would you consider that pairing different players would result in a different game?\nA key to evaluating attentiveness and responsiveness of the nurses is to observe whether P1 and P2 seem to be playing the same game or each his or her own game. How much eye contact takes place? Were the efforts coordinated so that the appearance was a fluent game? Are the players accepting of each other’s actions and enjoying the activity? Does there appear to be a struggle to gain control of the game, which may reveal the climate of their working relationship? Were the players comfortable with pretending? Did anyone volunteer to shake hands before or after the game? Was there any mention of keeping score? Was there a sense that the game increased a sense of partnership versus opposition? Are the nurses in the moment of the game or too aware of the observer’s reactions? How real did the game seem?\nDid either player pretend to miss the ping-pong ball and act like they were walking over and picking up the ball from the floor? This would show a true investment in the game by a player wanting to make it believable. What does that say about the player’s investment as a nurse?\nAfter the match\nOnce you have concluded the game, you can decide how much of the discussion among the players, you, and the others present is guided from your preset agenda. l would suggest not having a true agenda. Allow the players to interpret the meaning of their interaction. You may learn the most by not directing the discussion with specific comments. Instead, ask the players about how they felt. If the discussion doesn’t flow, open communication by complimenting the fact that the nurses’ volunteering shows their ability to take risks. This can be tied to conversations about when nurses share about themselves it indicates a willingness to grow. Continue with the comment that discussions about a pretend game still serve to solve real-life challenges in the work setting.\nFurther prompts include asking the players if they felt hesitant or uneasy like they were on display. This works well when exploring nurses’ vulnerabilities. This can be tied to appreciating patients’ vulnerabilities if you are hoping to improve caring behaviors in nurses. This also can be used to support education about developing a self-awareness of the nurses’ responsiveness and attentiveness skills regarding the needs of others. The game can be focused on just one aspect of the examples mentioned here or tailored to many situations.\nFinding the “real moments”\nMy suggestion would be for whatever game or activity (the Internet has dozens of them for group work) you choose, appreciate the “real moments” that reveal themselves. Those real moments are the teachable moments—the moments that make the difference. The realization by nurses that their nonverbal communication is misrepresenting them or they are being misunderstood based on their interpersonal skills is very powerful.\nIn psychiatric nursing, therapeutic communication includes understanding the term transference. Defining transference can be long and complicated. The definition includes the impact of every important relationship we have experienced in our lives since infancy on who we are as individuals. According to transference, all of the interactions of our past contribute to our perceptions and interpersonal skills. Simply stated, transference is the baggage we bring into relationships. Improvisational games help nurses identify their baggage.\nIn all circumstances, quality patient care and outcomes will improve when nurses know themselves. Theater improvisational games can contribute to this goal.\nElizabeth Delaney is an assistant professor of nursing in the Ohio University Southern School of Nursing in Ironton.\nFrom our readers gives nurses the opportunity to share experiences that would be helpful to their nurse colleagues.

{"question":"Hey! I'm studying economics and climate - why does food instability lead to conflicts, and how does climate change make this worse?","answer":"Food instability leads to conflicts through multiple mechanisms. When food prices spike, it can trigger social unrest, particularly in developing countries where people spend up to 60% of their income on food. This led to riots in at least 40 countries in 2008 and contributed to the Arab Spring in 2011. Climate change worsens this situation by affecting food production through extreme weather events, droughts, and water scarcity. For example, Syria experienced its worst long-term drought before its civil war, affecting over 1 million farmers, while in Africa, the Sahara Desert's advancement has forced herders into farming communities, creating conflict. Climate impacts are expected to worsen, with a projected 3 degrees Celsius rise in temperature forcing 122 million more people into poverty and hunger.","context":["Climate change is affecting food production, in the context of rising pressure on land and water\nBy Lin Taylor\nLONDON, May 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Swelling populations and demand for food combined with ever scarcer water and land resources could lead to a doubling of food prices and trigger civil unrest in some developing countries, a new report says.\nDemand for food with a higher environmental impact, such as meat, has surged as emerging countries like China and India grow in size and in wealth, said Martin Halle, policy analyst at Global Footprint Network (GFN).\n\"A few things are very clear: the demand for food is going up tremendously because of population growth,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"[Food production] is becoming more unstable because climate change is affecting production, in the context of growing land and water scarcity. There's very little leeway between supply and demand.\"\nIn the past, countries were able to meet those demands by growing more food on more land. But this has come at a cost, Halle said, since the planet is now running out of water and arable land.\nThe last time the world saw a severe food crisis was in 2007 and 2008, the report said, when extreme weather events hit major grain producing regions the year earlier, causing spikes in the demand and cost of food.\nThe higher prices led to social and political unrest in North Africa, the Middle East and South East and South Asia.\nThe report published this week by GFN and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said most of the same countries, namely Morocco, Bangladesh, Tunisia and Indonesia, are again at risk if food prices were to increase in the next few years.\nCLIMATE CHANGE VOLATILITY\nClimate change and extreme weather patterns will further increase volatility in food production, Halle added, meaning food prices will become more unstable in the coming years.\n\"The real game-changer comes when you factor in the environmental constraints - climate change, land scarcity and water scarcity, and all of these are linked,\" said Halle.\nDrought is becoming more frequent and severe in places like southern Africa, and that - combined with the recent El Nino phenomenon - is taking a heavy toll on rural lives and economies.\nFor example, maize prices in South Africa, the continent's top producer of the staple crop, reached near record highs late 2015, in the face of rolling heat waves and poor rains over key growing areas.\nUsing models from data across 110 countries, the study found that if the cost of food doubled, household spending would increase by more than 10 percent in 37 countries.\nFive African countries - Benin, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Ghana - would be the worst affected in terms of highest percentage loss to GDP.\nThe major emerging economies of China and India are forecast to lose $161 billion and $49 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) respectively with a doubling of food commodity prices.\n\"What this provides is a litmus test,\" said Ivo Mulder, economics advisor at UNEP. \"We are overusing what is available for us and we don't really know what the magnitude of the risk is.\"\nWhile higher income countries, like the United States, could benefit from food price hikes, Mulder said, their high demand for meat-based products is contributing to the problem.\n\"It's important to be honest about the types of risks that countries face,\" he said. \"Because even if developed countries are less exposed than developing countries, it doesn't mean there is no risk at all.\"\n(Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Ros Russell; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters that covers humanitarian news, conflicts, land rights, modern slavery and human trafficking, women's rights and climate change.

More people are currently displaced from their homes because of violence, conflict and persecution than any other time since the World War II. One of the consequences is that we’ve seen an uptick in the number of hungry people on the planet for the first time in over a decade.\nThat war and conflict produce poverty and hunger is something that we’ve long understood – it has been proven in every major sustained violent confrontation in human history. By some accounts, more people died in World War II from starvation than from fighting. What we are learning in the context of modern crises is that hunger is not simply a byproduct of war, but can be the root cause of instability. From competition over land and water for food production to violent protest in urban centers from food prices spikes, food-related instability features in many modern conflicts.\nFood security is a fundamental requirement of any stable society. Senator Pat Roberts from Kansas once said: “Show me a nation that can’t feed itself, and I’ll show you a nation in chaos.” More and more countries today face this precise challenge. Over 124 million people are in need of lifesaving humanitarian food assistance today, up from 80 million just two years ago.\nHunger produces profound desperation, the type that can cause a parent to put a child in a raft on a perilous journey to Europe; or that forces a young man with no income, limited opportunity and a hungry family to pick up arms for a cause he doesn’t even believe in. In a comprehensive review of the work on this topic, a new report from World Food Program USA shows that food insecurity has been empirically linked to at least nine separate types of instability, ranging from protest to interstate conflict, with terrorism and civil war in between.\nWhen we think of food-related instability, food riots very often come to mind. Food riots have played a role in the French Revolution and have been captured in headlines worldwide for generations – pasta riots in Italy, tortilla riots in Mexico, bread riots in the Middle East. Americans spend only 10 percent of their income on food, while citizens in the world’s poorest countries spend closer to 60 percent. Global food price spikes can have major effects on political stability in these settings.\nFood price spikes were responsible for social unrest in at least 40 developing and middle-income countries in 2008 in what has been termed the “silent tsunami.” These spikes and the resulting unrest are widely recognized as leading to regime change in Haiti during this period. A second wave of price spikes owing to agricultural commodity production shocks in China and Russia in 2011 has also been linked to the rise of the Arab Spring in the Middle East.\nWe also see food-related instability playing out in conflicts between pastoralists and farmers over dwindling agriculture resources and territory. This is the modern story of the African Sahel. In the decades leading up to the 2003 outbreak of war in Sudan, for example, the Sahel region of northern Sudan had witnessed the Sahara Desert advance southward by almost a mile each year, forcing Arab herders into ethno-African farming communities and producing unrest.\nPrice spikes and resource competition are increasingly driven by the impacts of climate change. Climate change disproportionately impacts the agricultural sector –especially in the global south – and is the subject of a growing body of research on the climate-conflict nexus. It is estimated that 80 percent of agricultural production in developing countries does not employ any form of irrigation.\nIn the lead-up to the civil war in Syria, more than 1 million farmers were affected by crop loss from long-term drought. One author called this “the worst long-term drought and most severe set of crop failures since agricultural civilizations began in the Fertile Crescent many millennia ago.” As a result, the southwestern city of Daraa, situated in one of the traditionally fertile areas of Syria, saw a large influx of migrants and was one of the first sites of social unrest in the country in 2011.\nMeanwhile, the rise of Boko Haram in Northern Nigeria has been linked by some to prolonged drought conditions in the Lake Chad Basin of West Africa. In recent decades, the water surface of Lake Chad has shrunk by over 90 percent compared with its size in the 1960s, contributing to a loss of livelihoods and threatening food security in the region. Climate impacts are expected to worsen as the Earth faces a 3 degrees Celsius rise in mean temperature in the coming decades, forcing another 122 million people into poverty and hunger.\nModern crises are almost never driven by a single cause. But when food insecurity meets with poor governance, a lack of economic opportunity and existing societal grievances, the conditions for conflict to emerge – or re-emerge – can be met.\nWith the rise in state fragility and a proliferation in conflicts involving non-state actors, the U.S. defense and intelligence communities are beginning to turn their eyes toward non-traditional security threats and root causes of instability like food insecurity. As a salient example, U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, commander of U.S. Africa Command, said in the AFRICOM 2018 posture statement to Congress, “None of Africa’s challenges can be resolved through the use of military force as the primary agent of change. Therefore, our first strategic theme is that AFRICOM activities directly support U.S. diplomatic and development efforts in Africa.”\nLegislation has also been introduced to encourage further collaboration between the traditional “instruments” of U.S. foreign power – defense, diplomacy and development – in order to tackle these same root causes.\nBreaking the cycle of hunger and conflict is among the great challenges of our day. Doing so, however, begins with acknowledging the link between food insecurity and global instability. Surely, one of the best investments we can make in global stability is to help people who can’t feed themselves or their families."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:63ca15df-13fa-483f-9233-ee3a9caebdba>","<urn:uuid:f4539a09-4a4f-4288-984d-943e50c754ee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between prevention and treatment approaches for dealing with garden pests, particularly when using natural methods?","answer":"Prevention and treatment approaches differ significantly. Prevention focuses on soil management and cultural control - this includes conducting soil analysis, using well-aged compost instead of chemical fertilizers, removing weeds and dead plants that harbor pests, and inspecting trees and bushes for pest eggs in fall. Treatment methods, on the other hand, include both immediate responses and ongoing controls. These include applying garlic-chile spray (made with garlic, hot peppers, water, and biodegradable soap), releasing beneficial insects like ladybugs and parasitic wasps, using yellow sticky traps, and applying soap sprays. Treatment often requires multiple applications - for example, the garlic-chile spray needs to be applied multiple times for serious infestations, while soap sprays might need daily application initially, then twice weekly, then weekly until the situation is controlled.","context":["Garlic and chile spray ingredients.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nAll you need for this insecticidal spray are chiles and garlic.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nCombine the ingredients in a blender with water.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nPuree the spray in a blender.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nLet the spray sit for a few hours or overnight.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nStrain the liquid so it doesn't clog the sprayer.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nAdd just 1 teaspoon of soap.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nA little of the concentrate goes a long way.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\nApply to the tops and undersides of leaves.Photo/Illustration: Susan Belsinger\n10 to 12 large cloves of garlic\n4 to 6 hot chile peppers, dried or fresh\nGenerous 2 cups water\n1 tablespoon liquid castile soap (like Dr. Bronner’s), Basic H ™ (Shaklee), or any biodegradable liquid dish washing soap\nI have been making this spray for more than 20 years–I don’t remember where the idea came from–perhaps an old issue of Organic Gardening or Mother Earth News. I do know that the recipe works. It is not an exact science; use a handful of dried cayenne peppers or other hot chiles and about a bulb of garlic to make the base concentrate. Mix the concentrate with water and spray it on plants with an infestation of aphids, mealybugs or white flies.\nEvery year, I move all of my plants out of the greenhouse for the summer. Before moving them back into the greenhouse after spending the summer outdoors, I routinely spray them with this spray before bringing them back inside; it makes all of the critters take off and leave. My herbalist friend Tina Wilcox adds 10 drops cinnamon, vetiver, or eucalyptus essential oil to this concentrate when she makes it.\nThe recipe is loose; it makes about 3 cups of concentrate.\nPut the garlic, chiles, and water into the blender and blend until the garlic and chiles are pureed. It will make a lovely orange-pink concoction that is foamy. Let stand for at least 2 hours or overnight.\nOnce it settles it will separate and you will have a coral-colored liquid with sediment in the bottom. Pour the mixture through a strainer lined with fine cheesecloth, through a coffee filter, or even a jelly bag; this takes a little while to strain. You can also use a wet paper towels, however this takes even longer to strain. The idea is to get rid of all of the particles because they will stop up the valve of your sprayer.\nOnce strained, pour the concentrate into a jar with a plastic lid (not metal), add the soap, stir, and label. The concentrate is ready to use, or it can be stored in a cool dark place for a few months to be used as needed.\nOur spray bottles holds about a liter (or a quart), so we add about 2 tablespoons of the concentrate to the bottle and fill it with water. We spray the plants late in the day, so that hot sun doesn’t shine on them once they are sprayed, making sure you cover both sides of the leaves. If the hot sun shines on the just-sprayed leaves it can burn them. Also if you use too much concentrate it will also burn the leaves. If you have a serious infestation, you will need to apply the spray a few times, waiting a few days in between.\nGet our latest tips, how-to articles, and instructional videos sent to your inbox.","Aphids and Nitrogen\nAphids are one of the perennial pests that gardeners deal with, often with very mixed results. What works one year seems to fall flat on its face the next, with the reverse also being true. Aphids are tiny, soft bodied insects that have piercing, sucking mouthparts to feed on plant saps. They live in colonies, most often the underside of leaves and where the tender young growth is on a plant.\nBy themselves, aphids rarely outright kill a plant but they can inflict serious damage to both its flowers and fruit. It only takes a few aphids sucking on a young flower or fruit to weaken it or damage it beyond being edible. The sap they extract weakens the plant, stunting its growth and food production. The aphids can also be carriers or vectors of diseases or viruses, which they infect the plant with as they pierce the cell walls and extract the plant sap. Just a few seconds is all it takes for a virus to transfer from the mouth of an aphid to the plant.\nAphids will often arrive in a garden or on a plant by flying in. A small number will arrive and leave their wingless young who feed on the plant and immediately lay eggs, increasing the population quickly. The adults will then fly off and repeat this several times. This is why gardeners will often complain that the aphids overwhelmed the garden “overnight”. Each adult aphid can produce up to 80 offspring every week!\nSo what can be done about these insects? There are several methods of dealing with them, broken down into two main approaches – prevention and treatment. The prevention phase happens in the fall and early winter with soil testing and amendments that set the stage for success the next growing season. Treatment is just that – what to do when those pesky insects show up uninvited in your garden!\nAphids Love Nitrogen\nLet’s start at the beginning, shall we? Nitrogen is a big, big player in the aphid dance. Aphids love nitrogen, plain and simple. They are attracted to the soft growing parts of a plant that are high in nitrogen, as it is a major factor in plant growth. Aphids are also really attracted to young seedlings, since everything on a seedling is growing and there is lots of nitrogen to be had.\nNitrogen plays a very important part in a plants growth as well as the content of its sap. Soils with excessively high nitrogen create very fast growing plants. This leads to rapid cell wall growth, which are elongated, thinner and much easier for the piercing mouth-parts of an aphid to penetrate than normal. The plant sap will also be high in nitrogen and will be especially attractive for the aphid. It is very important to understand that high nitrogen sap will be lower in overall sugar content – also known as brix – because nitrogen forms amino acids and proteins – such as chlorophyll – but specifically needs magnesium, phosphorus and carbon to form sugars. This can’t happen if there is excess nitrogen, as there aren’t enough of the other elements to form those sugars. Once the soil is amended with the correct nutrients, the plant will increase the brix/sugar levels and the aphids will die from sucking high sugar content plant sap as it is deadly – aphids can’t digest the sugars with no pancreas and thus die.\nWhat all this means is that using high doses of chemical fertilizers will encourage aphids to call your garden home! Almost all commercial fertilizers are high in nitrogen and release their nutrients much faster than compost or other soil amendments, making aphid pressures much worse than they would normally be. They also contribute to lots of flowers with little fruit production or stunted and smaller than normal sized fruit.\nIt is interesting to note with soybean studies at Penn State University naturally occurring nitrogen-fixing bacteria – called rhizobia – provided a better form of naturally occurring nitrogen than the laboratory bred inoculated strains did. Plants growing in the naturally occurring rhizobia soils had markedly fewer aphids and stress than the inoculated ones. The amount of nitrogen provided by the lab developed rhizobia and the naturally occurring strains were the same, with the natural rhizobia having much lower aphid populations on the plants. They are continuing the study to see why this happens.\nThere is a concept at work here that we need to briefly discuss so that you can understand where we are going from here. The “Law of the Minimum” shows how interrelated many nutrients and elements are to healthy plants, not just the N,P and K that are listed on fertilizer bags.\nThe Law of the Minimum states,\n“Plant growth is determined by the scarcest, “limiting” nutrient; if even one of the many required nutrients is deficient, the plant will not grow and produce at its optimum.”\nPrevention and Preparation\nThe preventative method is to have a complete, comprehensive soil analysis done by a professional lab. I’ve mentioned these before, but they bear another – Crop Services International and Texas Plant and Soil Lab are great labs. They are thorough, friendly and will give you the info you need at a reasonable price. From this analysis, you will know exactly what soil nutrients, amendments and trace minerals are needed to eliminate a high nitrogen condition in your soil and plants, and by extension reducing the population and attraction of aphids.\nAnother, very simple method is to stop using commercially available chemical fertilizers! Without naming names, these come in a bag and sometimes have the word “miracle” attached to them. There are a number of brands that can be bought at any garden center or big box store in their garden section. Well-aged and decomposed compost – especially if you’ve worked with it how we discuss in our articles on compost – will give you a continuous supply of “soil food” to apply to your garden twice a year, in the early spring and again in the late fall. This compost with the amendments will slowly release the nutrients that the garden needs, along with attracting the biological elements in the soil that do the real work – earthworms, pillbugs, beneficial nematodes, fungi and all sorts of other hard-working critters that seriously improve the soil on a continuous basis.\nAnother aspect of prevention is cultural control, or removing the suitable environments where aphids can overwinter or establish an initial population to then swarm your garden. Standing weeds can be harbors of aphids, so remove them and remove dead plants from the garden in the fall. Don’t wait until the springtime to clean up the garden, as this can provide the perfect habitat for aphid eggs to be sheltered under. Inspect trees and bushes for aphid eggs in the fall, remove them by hand, vacuum or with a strong blast of water.\nNow that you’ve got the prevention and preparation covered, what can be done if and when the nasty aphids arrive? This is where the treatment portion comes in, and it would be wise to prepare for this as well. Early detection is very important for successful treatment, as if the aphids get a toe-hold, it will be much more difficult to rid your plants of several sizable populations instead of just one or two small ones. The incoming flights of adult aphids are random, so consistent inspection is best. This is very easy, just flip over the top, youngest leaves of several plants and look for the clusters of small aphids on the underside. Look around bud areas as well. If you see any aphids, they will be in small clusters or colonies and can be easily dealt with at this stage. Crush them by hand or prune the leaves or buds to remove them. Once you see the first small populations, go back and be very thorough with the rest of your plants, taking the time to examine them well. Trust me on this, the time spent now will save you much heartache, back ache, time and frustration in the very near future!\nAphids will excrete “honeydew” – a sweet, sticky substance – and is sometimes fed on by ants. This isn’t always the case; but in your inspections look for travel pathways of ants up and down the plant where the aphid colonies are. Sometimes the ants will lead you to the aphids that you would have otherwise missed.\nAnytime you see any aphids, it is a good practice to set out yellow sticky traps. Aphids are highly attracted to the color yellow, which lures these little monsters into the traps. They are available at most garden centers and will be in squares or strips. Place several of them in the area where you find the aphids, and put out a few more than you might think. They are good inexpensive insurance.\nIf the aphids have colonized more than about 5% of the bud and young leaves of a plant, or are on more than that amount of your total garden plants, then it’s time for the next round of action.\nBeyond physically removing the aphids, there are two approaches to treatment – biological and chemical controls. Biological controls use biology – predatory insects – to eat and control the aphids. Chemical controls are just what they sound like – using sprays of varying toxicity to reduce the aphids’ population.\nUsing the biological approach first combined with a non-toxic soapy spray is often the knockout punch needed for smaller aphid infestations. Releasing parasitic wasps that lay their eggs inside the aphids, ladybugs, lacewings, soldier beetles and the syrphid fly larvae are all highly effective if done in time, before the aphids’ population explodes. One of the best resources for biological controls is Arbico Organics. They will help you decide what species will work best for your garden situation, how many to release and how many times. Keep in mind that the goal is not to completely eliminate every single aphid, as then the beneficial and predatory insects won’t have a food source. The goal is to keep the aphids controlled, where they aren’t damaging the plants.\nRemember, weather can be on your side when dealing with aphids. Heat and high humidity can really knock them back as they are fairly fragile and die off in droves when temperatures are over 90°F.\nSoap sprays work by smothering the aphids by coating their skins. Start with a completely harmless soapy water spray like Dr. Bronner’s – using a tablespoon per half gallon in a hand sprayer. Make sure to apply the spray when beneficial insects aren’t around, as they will also be affected. From there, work up to an insecticidal soap like Safer Brand or horticultural oil such as neem oil. With both of these approaches, make sure to cover the underside of the infested leaves well for the smothering effect to work. These are contact controls, and depend on contact with the aphids to work, so they will need to be re-applied as often as needed until you’ve gotten control of the situation. This could mean once a day for a few days, then twice a week for a week or so, then tapering down to once a week. It might well take 2 – 3 weeks to really get a handle on persistent outbreaks, so be patient but persistent!\nMoving up the toxicity ladder, multi part sprays such as our Home Garden Bug Solution work very well, but need to be used carefully as they do have a high level of insect toxicity even though they are made with no petrochemical ingredients. If you do need to bring out these big guns, test in a small area to see the effects before spraying your entire garden!\nHopefully you now see that there are a number of ways to reduce and control the pesky aphids in your garden. It all starts with prevention and preparation with improving the soil and balancing the nutrients it needs. From there you now have several new tools in your “pest control” toolbox to help you manage aphids in your garden next growing season."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8878c38c-fe5d-4cfd-99c3-75881fd8ec22>","<urn:uuid:a9f3b073-cdd9-4229-ab95-759f716a1044>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between hand wrapping for boxing and applying rubbers to a table tennis paddle in terms of protecting the equipment and impact on performance?","answer":"Hand wrapping in boxing and applying rubbers to table tennis paddles serve different protective and performance functions. In boxing, hand wraps protect the small joints and bones of the hand from fractures during impact, secure loose joints, and redistribute shock across the entire hand. The wrapping process requires specific techniques like making three X's through the fingers and proper tension to prevent injury. For table tennis paddles, rubbers protect the wooden blade and transmit energy from the swing to the ball. The rubbers come in two colors (red and black) and can be installed with pips facing inward or outward, affecting spin and speed. Additionally, the thickness of paddle rubbers is regulated to no more than 2 millimeters including sponge and adhesive, while boxing wraps come in 180\\\" or 120\\\" lengths depending on hand size. Improper application in both cases can impede performance - too much tape and gauze in boxing can add weight and slow punches, while incorrect rubber installation on table tennis paddles can affect ball control and energy transfer.","context":["All About Hand Wrapping for Boxing\nThere are a few things boxers need for training: gloves, good shoes and hand wraps. Hand wrapping is usually the last thing boxers think about. However, your ability to punch lies just as much in your hand wrapping as it does in your mind. Without a good hand wrap, you may be open to injury and hesitate to take a punch.\nThe History of Hand Wrapping\nThe first time that hand wrapping for boxing was mentioned in history was in Ancient Greece in 688 B.C.E. Boxing was a part of the very first Olympics and was often used in gymnasiums among the Grecians as part of their education as young men. The Ancient Greeks used strips of oxhide softened with olive oil, called himantes, to wrap their hands.\nBoxing was outlawed in Rome after 500 C.E. So, it went underground, and bare-knuckle matches became the norm. In 1743, a rudimentary padded glove was used during training but was not used in professional fights. That changed in 1867 when the 9th Marquess of Queensberry, John Douglas, endorsed the code of modern boxing. Gloves were finally considered normal boxing equipment. From the 19th century up to the 1920s hand wrapping became popular. In the 1920s it became the standard for glove boxing to protect the hands.\nIn the 1920s, gauze and tape became the norm for hand wrapping. With the invention of masking tape, boxers had the ability for the first time to have an adhesive to secure the gauze.\nThe Purpose of Hand Wrapping\nThe purpose of hand wrapping has a few objectives. One is to provide a protective barrier for the fighters’ hands. The hand structure consists of small joints and small bones that are fragile and subject to fracture from the impact of repetitive punches. Hand wrapping also protects the tendons, muscles and cushions the impact of the wrist.\nThe second purpose of the hand wrap is to keep the loose or moving joints in place. It provides restriction for these joints, so the shock is absorbed and redistributed across the entire hand. If your joints are moving around when the fist makes contact with an object, a fracture could occur. Additionally, there could also be other injuries to the tendons and muscles. These injuries could interfere with your everyday activities.\nHow to Wrap Your Hands\nYou will need 180” cotton wraps for average size hands or 120” for smaller hands. Mexican wraps are semi-elastic and are also acceptable wraps for you to use. However, they will break down faster than cotton wraps.\n- Loop the thumb and wrap behind the hand. Make sure you have adequate tension so that when you make a fist, the wrap tightens around it. However, make sure it doesn’t constrict the hand too much. Don’t run the wrap around the front of the hand instead of the back first; this will loosen the hand wrap when you make a fist.\n- Wrap three times around the wrist. This will support the bone structure and tendons in the wrist. Note: if you have larger than average hands, wrap only two times. Make sure that you keep the wrap free from wrinkles or lumps. These can cause gaps in protection of the hand. Finally, keep your wrists straight to keep them stable for a fight.\n- Wrap three times around the palm of your hand. You’re focused on wrapping around the palm rather than the knuckles at this point. Bring it back down to the back of your thumb. Also, make sure your fingers are spread the same width apart. You want to mimic the movements you will be making in a spar or bout as you wrap.\n- Make three X’s through the fingers. Cross over the back of your hand. You want your knuckles secured together for support. Keep your knuckles separated, not bunched on top of each other. This will keep them from collapsing or fracturing.\n- Wrap between your ring finger and pinky and then to the other side. Wrap down to the bottom of your hand. You will form an X on the back part of your hand, then wrap back up to the top of your thumb one more time. Go between the middle and ring finger until you have made a second X. Go back to the top again, weaving between the index and middle fingers. This is the third X. Finish on the top portion of the thumb. Keep all your fingers separated while doing this step.\n- Wrap around the thumb once. Then go down the back of the hand.\n- Lock your thumb. Go behind the thumb and down the palm. This will lock the hand wrap into place and secure the thumb.\n- Wrap three times around your knuckles.\n- If you have extra wraps left, you can do more X’s around the back of your hand. Finish by fastening the velcro on the wrist. Throw a few punches to see how it feels before putting on your gloves.\nMistakes Made in Wrapping\nUsing too much tape and gauze can cause a problem for a fighter. Tape and gauze are porous and can allow moisture to seep through. This can cause sweat to accumulate, adding additional weight to the fighter’s hands and gloves. Additional weight to the boxer’s gloves means their punches will become slower.\nAnother mistake you can make is not understanding the anatomical structures of the hand when wrapping them. Also, be mindful of your medical history when wrapping. Any injuries or other hand, wrist or finger issues should be addressed before wrapping to better protect them.\nLast, but not least, choose the right wrap. Wraps that are thick and inflexible don’t secure the hand properly when making a fist.\nHand wrapping is an important process before training or getting into the ring. Lack of proper wrapping can impede your performance. Make sure that you follow the tips above and practice them.\nRemember, if hand wrapping is a challenge for you, our coaches are here to help. We also have wraps available at the studio during your session, so get your hands wrapped up and get in the ring!","Creating your own custom table tennis paddle can seem like a difficult task, especially if you've never done it before. What equipment do you need? What blade should you select? How do you actually assemble a custom table tennis paddle? These are questions I asked myself and honestly, finding the answers was a little challenging. So, I watched a ton of videos, read loads of articles and decided I'd compile my notes and create this helpful guide for anyone looking to create and assemble their first custom table tennis racket.\nWhat To Know About Custom Table Tennis Paddles\nSo, you’ve decided to abandon the standard premade ping pong paddle mold and play with a paddle all your own. Whether you just want to change it for different looks or change the way you play, custom ping paddles are fairly easy to create, customize and best of all - use.\nIn this section, we’re going to cover the basic information you should keep in mind. Making a custom paddle requires you to make a new blade and new rubbers.\nThese are two main parts of paddles. The blade is the skeleton of the paddle, and the rubbers located on blade determines how the ball travels. The good news is, its not overly complicated. With this helpful walkthrough, you can do it!\nWhat Is A Custom Ping Pong Paddle?\nStandard ping pong paddles like the Killerspin Jet 800 come with the blade and rubbers as a single assembly. They are designed for a specific style of play and grip. A custom ping pong paddle is made to each player’s personal specifications and preferences.\nIf you have a custom paddle, you can have a thin blade paired with thick rubbers or vice versa. You can also have the handle shaped to accommodate either of the two types of grips: pen or handshake.\nBefore we go too far, I should point out that there are a few negatives to custom table tennis paddles. First, depending on the materials used, it can be expensive to make one compared to buying it premade paddle. Secondly, you have to ensure that your materials fall within the rules of the International Table Tennis Federation.\nMy take: If you're not willing to truly make your paddle an investment, then I suggest you find the best possible premade paddle for your style of play and stick with it. If that describes you, then I highly recommend looking through my premade ping pong paddle guide...I've compiled the most complete list of premade paddles for literally any skill level across all budgets. If you've played with many premade paddles are eager to go \"custom\", then let's continue.\nGetting back to ITTF approved materials - you've got to do your research. For example, your blade must be at least 85% natural wood, and your rubbers can be no more than 2 millimeters thick including sponge and adhesive. The ITTF requires strict paddle specifications and rightfully so, their job is to make sure there is no serious competitive advantage when it comes to a paddle.\nNow let’s take a look at each of the parts of the paddle and discuss how you can customize them to suit your style of play. We’ll start with the blade.\nCustom Ping Pong Paddles - The Blade\nBlades are made of several layers of ply, usually three to seven. Unless you’ve got some pretty advanced equipment, you're not going to be able to make your own plywood, so you’ll have to stick with prefab. Trust me, leave that part up to the experts. The different thicknesses of ply will influence how force is transferred from the paddle to the ball.\nThin plywood works best for paddles dedicated to controlling the ball and executing trick shots. This is because they’re flexible and have plenty of give to them. These properties of the wood lend themselves well to slower-paced games. If you’re just batting a ball back and forth across a table casually, keep a lighter blade on hand.\nThick blades, on the other hand, work best for power players. If you use a thicker paddle, odds are you prefer to send the ball blistering across the court at your opponent....So fast, you don’t want your opponent to see it. It’s similar to the differences between power hitters and place hitters in baseball. For speed, you need something that’s between three-quarters and a full inch thick.\nCustom Ping Pong Paddles - The Rubbers\nNext, let’s consider the rubbers. The rubbers are actually two separate pieces that glue onto the blade. Its purpose is to transmit the energy from your swing to the ball; if you didn’t have good rubber, your paddle will not last very long due to the thinness of plywood and the constant stress it would be under.\nNow, here's the cool part. You’re going to have two different rubbers, one on each side of the paddle. The official tournament rules were updated in 1986 to require the two rubbers to be of different colors: red and black. In theory, the red side imparts more speed and the black side produces spin. Whether this is true is up for debate. However, if you’re good enough and have proper technique (which you probably are because you're interested in making a custom table tennis racket), then you should notice little difference. Even so, the rules are that you need red and black rubbers.\nWhat are Pips?\nThe pips are the small protrusions that give the rubber its textured surface. Some are long and some are short depending on your style of play. They're also sometimes called \"pimples\". The next thing to think about is how you want the rubbers installed. Do you want the pips facing inward or outward?\nEach rubber has a pimpled side and a smooth side. It's up to you which one you want to play with. Attach the smooth side to the sponge and you'll be playing with the pimpled side. Attach the side with the pips, and you'll be playing with the smooth side (good for spin). It's up to you and how you play. Some players have have the smooth rubber one on side and a pimpled side on the other. So, there are many different combinations to try.\nIf you're playing with one or two sides with pimples out, then you'll want to choose between long pips or short pips. Long pips are used for a more defensive game where you are countering top spin and back spin shots from an aggressive opponent. Short pips are the opposite and tend to play in a more offensive minded way - creating fast rebounds and power.\nHow To Make A Custom Ping Pong Paddle\nIt’s definitely possible to make a custom ping pong paddle from scratch. Here’s a great guide on how to do so.\nHowever, we’re going to assume you have your blade and rubbers already picked out and ordered, now it’s just a matter of putting them together. You will need table tennis glue; it is specially formulated to work with your rubbers. If you try to use other types of glue it will not hold properly. I do NOT recommend this!\nUse a small sponge to spread a thin layer of glue on your rubber and allow it to dry. Not waiting for it to dry can impact how well everything holds together, so don't get impatient - wait for EVERYTHING to dry properly.\nNew rubbers are going to be more absorbent than you’d expect so it’s going to take two layers of glue. So, allow the first layer of glue to dry. It should still be a little sticky to the touch. Next, apply a second layer. Remember that you can always add more glue if needed.\nWhile you’re waiting, sweep any packaging debris or dust off your blade, put a thin layer of glue on it, and let that dry. This shouldn’t take more than fifteen to twenty minutes as long as you don’t overdo it. Then apply the glued rubber to the blade, ensuring that it adheres to it correctly. Now, take a sharp pair of scissors and cut around the blade so the rubber matches the blade shape.\nRepeat the entire process for the other rubber. If you try to attach both of them at once, it will be tricky to cut them properly. This is not ideal. Trust me, do one side of your paddle at a time. After both sides of the blade are covered and the glue has set, place it on a flat surface and put a heavy object on top to compress it further.\nVideo Source: Ben Larcombe\nMy Recommended Products for Assembling Your First Custom Table Tennis Paddle\nOk, let's get into what products to select. There are many, many different mix and match combinations from loads of manufacturers, so choosing where to begin can be overwhelming. When in doubt, start simple and choose quality materials. That's what I did. I could have spent three to four hundred dollars putting together a custom ping pong paddle but I wasn't ready to create my version of a tournament ready excalibur...at least not yet.\nSo, if you've never done his before, I recommend starting somewhere in the middle. The sweet spot (no pun intended) for your first custom ping pong racket is somewhere ahead of a really good premade ping pong paddle, and below an elite custom racket. In my opinion, that's a good place to start. And these are the products that will get you there.\nBest Ping Pong Blade Under $150\nFor the best Ping Pong Blade under $150, in my opinion you’ll want the Butterfly Viscaria paddle. This paddle features a carbon-poly fiber and plywood construction, giving it loads of extra power! If you’re a player that likes to put speed and power into your shot, the Butterfly Viscara is right for you.\nIt is heavy and relatively inflexible, so it sends balls in a flatter arc - provided you have good table tennis fundamentals. Novice players will struggle controlling this paddle. However, if you have solid attack technique, this paddle gives you ample speed and power that will overwhelm an unprepared opponent, and is well worth the price.\nBest Ping Pong Blade Under $100\nNeed something with a lower price point or different play style? Look for the Joola Rossi Emotion. The main draw of this blade is that it has a penhold handle, making it best suited to players with a penhold grip.\nThe penhold grip places the index finger and thumb on one side of the paddle so that only one side is used. It’s harder, and more unpredictable because most players use a handshake grip.\nThe blade is made of five layers of plywood coupled with two layers of veneer. The relative thickness leads to more power without sacrificing control. Its main disadvantage is that it’s not suited for defense. It's purely an offensive geared racket.\nThe layers of carbon increase the optimal striking surface of the blade, so it is a little more forgiving to newer players who haven’t gained most precision yet. he penhold grip will take some getting used - so be patient if your trying that style for the first time.\nBest Ping Pong Blade Under $50\nIf you’re really on a budget, check out the Petr Korbel. This blade, unlike the others on this list, does not have any augmentation to the material. It is pure plywood, which makes it a little stiff, powerful and appealing to people who prefer simpler aesthetics.\nThe flared handle lends itself well to penhold and shakehold grips, so no matter which style you learned you’ll be able to use this blade. Like the other blades we’ve seen, this one isn’t ideal for defensive minded players.\nThe Best Table Tennis Rubbers to Consider\nThe Tenergy 05 rubber sheet can compensate for many weaknesses of a stiff blade. It has proprietary sponge technology that is able to compress and keep the ball on the paddle for longer periods of time - perfect for spin!\nThis imparts an unpredictable spin on the ball and can throw opponents off their rhythm! However, the extra springiness can make the ball move too fast for players to control until they get used to it.\nBest Affordable Ping Pong Rubber\nIf you’re someone who’s just starting out or who’s on a budget, the Mark V Yasaka might be a great choice. It uses speed glue technology, which, while outdated by later models can still hold up. This rubber has a good all-around performance profile.\nIt works well for power, spin, and control, so using this on a blade allows new players to become acquainted with their playing style. Serious players who are looking for characteristics that stand out might want to try another rubber.\nIf you've never assembled you're own custom table tennis paddle, you're not alone. Many ping pong fans like myself were unsure where to start, how to do it, and what products to choose. I hope the walk-through has given you confidence, direction and some buyer knowledge to get you off to the right start.\nIf you're unsure which blade and rubber combo to go with, I'd recommend starting more on the basic side and NOT get a blade and rubber that will be too fast and too difficult to control. That'll make the whole experience for you a negative one and you'll wonder why you even ventured away from your classic premade paddle. So, start simple, assemble a custom ping pong paddle that's tailored more towards your current skill level versus one that you're hoping to get to. Good luck!\nFor another great in-depth article, I recommend reading this one."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b76d7637-5dee-4531-a2fd-856987486709>","<urn:uuid:b91ce39f-e51d-4371-b526-3332d783e240>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Podría explicarme qué es el lavado de dinero y qué medidas específicas deben tomar las empresas de criptomonedas para prevenirlo?","answer":"Money laundering is the process by which criminals process 'dirty' money from criminal activities to make it look legitimate or 'clean' by introducing it into the financial system. For cryptocurrency businesses, they must take several specific measures to prevent money laundering: 1) They must develop, implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, 2) Register as a money services business with FinCEN if they qualify as money transmitters, 3) File Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for transactions over $2,000 that appear suspicious, 4) Have written policies and procedures, a designated AML compliance officer, independent review of their AML program, and training for relevant personnel. Additionally, they must watch for red flags indicating potentially tainted funds and maintain proper customer identification procedures.","context":["DNFBP stands for \"Designated Non-Financial Business or Profession\"(DNFBP). Certain types of \"non-financial\" businesses have been identified as being susceptible to money laundering and terrorist financing due to the nature of their business and the transactions that they may conduct.

Money launderers and terrorist financiers are continuously looking for new methods of disguising their funds; they will actively seek to exploit weaknesses in AML systems and controls and will gravitate to countries and financial systems with weak or ineffective controls. Importantly, it is not just the financial sector which is at risk of being misused by money launders and terrorist financiers. The non-financial sector (DNFBP) including jewelers, dealers in high value goods, lawyers, accountants, real estate developer/agents, company service providers are also vulnerable. The DCI, therefore, has put in place measures to prevent and deter money laundering by requiring DNFBPs to be registered with the DCI and to have systems and controls in place to scrutinize transactions and report suspicious behaviour. DNFBPs are also required to comply with specified sections of the AMLRs.\n(A) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an independent inter-governmental body that develops and promotes policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nMoney laundering describes the method by which criminals process money obtained from their criminal activities (\"dirty\") to look legitimate (\"clean\"). They aim to introduce their \"dirty money\" into the financial system without detection or arousing suspicion. Once their \"dirty money\" is in the financial system, it can be transferred between different bank accounts or financial products in The Cayman Islands or abroad, or used to purchase goods and services. The aim of money laundering is to make this \"dirty money\" look like it has come from a legitimate source, and therefore difficult to connect the money with its criminal past.\nTerrorist Financing is the financial support of terrorists, or those who encourage, plan or engage in terrorism.\nTerrorist financing may involve funds raised from legitimate sources, such as personal donations and profits from businesses and charitable organizations. It may also be drawn from criminal sources, such as the drug trade, the smuggling of weapons and other goods, fraud, kidnapping or extortion. People who finance terrorism often use similar methods and tools to those used for money laundering.\nAn AML/CFT programme sets out a reporting entity’s internal policies, procedures and controls to detect money laundering and financing of terrorism and to manage and mitigate the risk of it occurring. The programme must be in writing and be based on its risk assessment.\nCertain elements of a programme are specifically required by the regulations, including:\nRisk-based systems and controls should be based on the nature, size and complexity of a reporting entity’s business, along with any money laundering and financing of terrorism risks it may face.\nReporting entities are required to assess the money laundering and financing of terrorism risk that they may reasonably expect to face in the course of their business. In making this assessment, the regulations requires that a reporting entity considers:\nReporting entities should consider whether any of their products involve new or developing technologies that may favour customer anonymity. The regulations also specify that reporting entities should consider particular activities, such as wire transfers and correspondent banking relationships.\nCustomer Due Diligence (CDD) involves:\nIn many cases, reporting entities also need to establish the identity of the beneficial owner, meaning the person who ultimately controls the customer.\nOngoing Customer Due Diligence means regularly reviewing customer information and having systems to conduct account monitoring. This is required for all customers, including existing customers.\n\"Politically-Exposed Persons\" (PEPs) are individuals who, by virtue of their position in public life, may be vulnerable to corruption. The New Zealand legislation currently limits this concept to foreign PEPs, and does not include domestic (New Zealand-based) PEPs. Reporting entities are required to give specific consideration to the risks involved with PEPs and so should:\nAssessing the money laundering and financing of terrorism risk that it may reasonably expect to face in the course of its business; establishing, implementing and maintaining an AML/CFT Programme (procedures, policies and controls) to detect, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering and the financing of terrorism; customer due diligence (identification and verification of identity) and ongoing CDD; suspicious transaction reporting; and record keeping.\nThe AML/CFT supervisors are focusing on whether the reporting entity has an appropriate and reasonable risk assessment, and an AML/CFT programme that reflects and controls those risks. The AML/CFT supervisors take a risk-based approach to supervision - selecting from the supervision and enforcement tools available. Supervision will take into account the nature of the business and the risks that each reporting entity is managing.","Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules and with the economic sanctions administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) can be a daunting task for any business. When it comes to the fast-moving world of token sales and cryptocurrencies in general, much of the legal and regulatory landscape is yet to be settled, but the obligation to comply with AML and OFAC laws is clear. This quick start guide to AML and OFAC compliance aims to provide entrepreneurs and in-house counsel an early roadmap for planning and reaching their compliance goals as they think about kicking off a token sale.\nThis guide focuses on U.S. laws, but be aware that other countries also have laws in these two areas.\nSteer Clear of Tainted Funds: Watch for Red Flags\nIt states the obvious, of course, to say steer clear of tainted funds. But whether you are starting a new cryptocurrency exchange business or selling tokens to raise money for your new project, it takes intentional focus and care to ensure that the funds moving into and through your business are not the product of illegal activity. With several recent notorious examples of theft, fraud and money laundering fresh in the minds of government regulators and investigators, it is even more imperative that entrepreneurs establish and use the right anti-money laundering procedures up front.\nWhether your business model or planned token sale requires that you have a formal anti-money laundering program in place or not, you are always required to avoid conducting transactions involving criminal proceeds. Among others things, federal anti-money laundering laws prohibit the following types of financial transactions:\n- Concealment or Promotion Money Laundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1): This statute prohibits a transaction in the proceeds of crime in which a person knows that the property involved comes from some form of unlawful activity, even if that person does not know the precise nature of the underlying criminal activity. To be in violation of this law, there must be an intent on the part of the person conducting the transaction — most often proven through circumstantial evidence — to conceal the true nature, location, source, ownership or control of the funds, or to reinvest in or “promote” future criminal activity.\n- International Money Laundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(2): This law applies even to “clean” funds that are not currently the proceeds of criminal activity but are sent internationally to “promote” certain categories of criminal activity.\n- Money Spending Statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1957: Applicable to transactions in criminal proceeds over $10,000, this law simply prohibits transactions where the participant (including currency exchangers, money transmitters, and brokers or dealers in securities or commodities) knows the funds are from some unlawful source.\n- Money Laundering Conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h): Two or more individuals who intend to conduct a transaction in criminal proceeds may be liable for any foreseeable offenses committed by their co-conspirators in furtherance of the scheme.\nNot only are the above offenses subject to criminal or civil prosecution, but the proceeds of criminal activity, as well as any property “involved” in a money-laundering offense — which may include such things as non-tainted funds in the same account, commissions or fees, websites or even an entire business — are subject to criminal or civil forfeiture.\nIn this environment, then, is it enough, for example, to require a buyer of your tokens to represent to you in writing that the funds they are paying you with are “clean”? Maybe, but maybe not. If your buyer makes that representation but there are red flags around the transaction suggesting otherwise, those representations by themselves will not insulate you from liability.\nAs we discuss below, if your business model puts you in the category of being a money services business, you will need to take additional steps. If not, you will still want to make sure you know and understand your customer and their transaction; be on the lookout for transaction details that are not customary; and keep records of your due diligence.\nYou May Need to Register as a Money Services Business\nProbably the most significant question you will need to answer in relation to your anti-money laundering obligations as you prepare to undertake a token sale is whether your sale amounts to “money transmitting” under federal law. Be aware that “money transmitters” are also highly regulated under each state’s laws, many of which require advance licensure; however, because state money transmitting laws are typically aimed at consumer protection rather than anti-money laundering, we do not address the issue of state regulation here other than to note that there is no uniform licensing scheme across the 50 states.\nUnder federal law, “financial institutions,” which include “money transmittersx” (a category of “money services businesses”), are regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5311, et seq., and are subject to a number of specific requirements that are defined and overseen by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). According to FinCEN, “money transmitting services” means:\nthe acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.\nFinCEN issued guidance in 2013 making clear that it views its money-transmitting regulations as applying to “persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting or transmitting virtual currencies.” With regard to token issuers using a decentralized network, FinCEN has concluded that anyone who qualifies as a virtual currency “exchanger” is a money transmitter.\nEven more specifically, while not formal industry guidance, in a letter responding to a Member of Congress (that became public in early March but was issued on February 13, 2018), FinCEN expressed its view that initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) qualify as money transmitting, stating:\nA developer that sells convertible virtual currency, including in the form of ICO coins or tokens, in exchange for another type of value that substitutes for currency is a money transmitter and must comply with AML/[Combating the Financing of Terrorism] requirements that apply to [MSBs].\nImportantly, entities or individuals who do not follow these rules and that operate an unlicensed money transmitting business are subject to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1960. Yet, to further complicate matters, FinCEN’s letter also noted that an ICO involving securities or derivatives might instead be subject to the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission, each of which have separate — although similar — AML/CFT requirements.\nUltimately, whether you will need to register with FinCEN as a money transmitter is going to depend on the specific facts and circumstances of your token sale and business model, but you will want to consider this question carefully.\nIf You Are a Money Services Business, Special AML Requirements Apply\nIf you are a money transmitter and subject to FinCEN’s regulations, you are subject to a number of specific requirements. First, you must register as a money-transmitting business within 180 days from the date the business was established and maintain a list of any agents working with you. Most broadly, money transmitters are required to:\ndevelop, implement and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program, reasonably designed to prevent the money services business from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.\nAdditionally, you will be subject to a number of reporting and record-keeping requirements, particularly the requirement to file Suspicious Activity Reports, or SARs, for transactions over $2,000 that appear to involve funds from illicit activity; be designed to evade reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act; or serve no apparent lawful or business purpose.\nTo meet AML requirements, money transmitters must have a formal AML compliance program that includes the following four elements: 1) written policies and procedures; 2) a designated AML compliance officer; 3) independent review and monitoring of the AML program; and 4) a training program for relevant personnel regarding their AML responsibilities.\nFinally, while it may be possible to assign the responsibilities for your AML program to a founder, manager or employee with other duties if your business does not currently support a stand-alone function, keep in mind that it is critical that this function be resourced and, most importantly, free from the influence of the business or sales side of the organization.\nOperating a money transmitting business without meeting these requirements established by the Bank Secrecy Act could subject both your business and the individuals involved in it to civil and criminal penalties.\nDo You Have Foreign Partners or Corporate Customers? Take These Extra Steps\nMany participants in the cryptocurrency and token sale marketplace are based outside of the United States. If you have what FinCEN refers to as foreign “agents” — a term it uses to include “authorized delegates, foreign agents or counterparties, agents and sub-agents” — your AML program must meet additional requirements.\nFor example, if you have a contractual arrangement to make your tokens available to a foreign company or its customers through the foreign company’s software platform, you must:\n- conduct due diligence on foreign agents and counterparties;\n- consider a number of particular risk factors and do risk-based monitoring of your agents and counterparties; and\n- develop and implement a policy for corrective action and termination for non-compliant entities.\nWhile you may be able to contractually allocate the responsibility for developing these policies, procedures and internal controls to your agent or counterparty, you will remain liable to ensure that they are fully operational.\nOFAC Compliance: An AML Program Is Not Enough\nEvery U.S. person and business is required to avoid engaging in financial transactions with certain individuals, entities and countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Accordingly, when you offer your tokens for sale in a public or private offering, it is your obligation to ensure that none of your purchasers are on the list of prohibited individuals or entities maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). You also need to be sure that your customers and other business partners are not based in countries subject to broader economic sanctions, the list of which currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and the Crimean region of Ukraine.\nCompliance with the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC and compliance with the AML laws established under the Bank Secrecy Act are often considered in the same breath. And, while effective OFAC screening and AML programs will certainly have areas of overlap, namely a robust customer identification procedure, they are two separate and distinct programs and responsibilities and you should have separate procedures for each.\nOFAC compliance involves screening the names of individuals or entities against a highly complex and often-changing list of sanctioned parties, countries and regions. Most companies make use of third-party servicers to conduct this screening on their behalf, but it is prudent to do some due diligence to ensure those service providers themselves have the sophistication required to capture any potential prohibited transactions.\nCan you shortcut this process by simply having your token buyer represent they are not on the OFAC sanctions list? While such representations are helpful, they are not sufficient. Unlike the risk-based compliance expectations, with AML requirements, you are strictly liable for OFAC screening failures and OFAC can pursue even minor violations.\nNonetheless, should you be found to have violated economic sanctions laws, the strength of your OFAC compliance program, along with your state of mind and other factors, will be considered in the determination of any penalty.\nBe Ready to Demonstrate Your AML and OFAC Compliance\nAs with any business, when operating in the cryptocurrency space, you should be prepared for questions from a regulator or investigator with jurisdiction over the activity. Whether you are a money transmitter with a formal written AML program or not, one of the first demands you are likely to receive in any federal or state inquiry is to produce a copy of your AML program and policies as well as your customer identification procedures and screening protocols.\nExaminers or investigators will be looking at whether you have taken the time to recognize and identify risk factors and risk categories for the counterparties with whom you are doing business. And they will look to see whether you have developed procedures intended to mitigate those risks and avoid conducting transactions with or for blocked parties or illicit funds. If you are equipped with written AML guidance and OFAC screening processes, including a clear allocation of responsibility within your company for ensuring compliance, you will be off to a good start.\nThere Is Room for Innovation\nFederal agencies involved in regulating and overseeing the marketplace for token sales recognize the value to our society of the emerging technologies behind this activity, even if they are scrambling to catch up with the technology on an institutional level. While the burden to a new company of meeting the legal and regulatory requirements for AML and OFAC compliance is not insignificant, prior planning in these areas will protect your investment of time and resources and create room for greater innovation.\nThis is an guest post by Laurel Loomis Rimon, Senior Counsel at O’Melveny & Myers LLP .

{"question":"Hi! As an insect enthusiast, I'm curious about metamorphosis in New Zealand stick insects compared to butterflies. Could you explain the key differences in their life cycle stages and whether stick insects undergo complete or incomplete metamorphosis?","answer":"Stick insects undergo incomplete metamorphosis, unlike butterflies which go through complete metamorphosis. Stick insects have simpler life stages - they hatch looking similar to adults and go through 4 ecdyses (molts) to reach maturity, with the main difference being size and development of adult features. They always hatch green colored but may change to brown at the second molt. In contrast, butterflies have 4 distinct stages: egg, larva (which looks like a worm), pupa (where major transformation occurs), and adult butterfly. The butterfly larva must molt multiple times as it grows due to its exoskeleton before entering the pupal stage where it develops wings and other adult features.","context":["Tuatara: Volume 5, Issue 3, March 1955\nFew people there must be who have not at some time or other come lace to face with one of those most peculiar of insects popularly known as ‘Stick Insects’. These grotesque animals, which at close quarters wear an almost human quizzical expression, are normally denizens of tropical lands, but strangely enough they are very common throughout the length and breadth of New Zealand.\nTropical forms of stick insects are generally winged, but all the New Zealand forms, some 19 species in all, are apterous and occur from North Auckland to Stewart Island, on the lowlands and on the highlands, up to heights of 4,000 to 5,000 feet. Some dwell on scrub, others in the forest, while high-mountain forms are usually found on tussock, sedges or Dracophyllums. Of cryptic colouration and concealing habit, they are seldom seen except when moving, and are obtained by collectors usually through the beating or sweeping of foliage. When disturbed stick insects are generally cataleptic, and will release their hold on foliage and fall or slide down the stems of a plant to the ground, or some other solid resting place, where they will remain motionless for hours with the fore legs held outstretched and parallel beyond the head, and with the middle and hind legs directed posteriorly and pressed against the sides of the body. When at rest amongst foliage, these insects either hang below branches and twigs or arrange themselves in such a way that their elongate bodies merge with the surrounding branch system so as to resemble a twig; hence the popular name of stick insect. All New Zealand species are protectively coloured so that their colour and colour pattern blends with their surroundings. This is particularly so with one species of Clitarchus which normally rests with its body pressed flat against the trunk or branches of manuka and kanuka trees. Except to the trained eye this species would pass unnoticed on the bark until it moved, so beautiful is its camouflage.\nAll stick insects are foliage feeders, but except for odd occasions they do little visible damage to shrubs or trees, and cannot be classed as economic pests. Occasionally, however, large numbers are found defoliating a single tree, sometimes in a private garden. Outbreaks of this nature arise from a culmination of factors such as the continued presence of a gravid female insect in that locality during the preceding season, favourable and mild climatic conditions, and luscious growth of the plant. Usually they last for one season only, the insect numbers being rapidly reduced with the onset of early winter frosts and cold weather.\nThe male stick insect is easily recognised, having a body shorter than and very much thinner than that of the female; some males are mere page 78 match-sticks', and they are always difficult to identify correctly when separated from the appropriate female. But in many species of stick insects males do not exist; or, if they do, they occur only at long intervals of several years. The females continue to reproduce by parthenogenesis. For this reason most species are known from the females only. With one exception, no males have ever been found belonging to the New Zealand species of the genus Acanthoxyla; all these species exist as females only, reproducing parthenogenetically. That one exception is A. senta found only on Great Island of the Three Kings group, North Auckland. To the genus Acanthoxyla belong all the common medium-sized green and brown spiny stick insects of New Zealand which range over the lowlands of the North, South and Stewart Islands. The very large brown spiny stick insects found in forest trees in many parts of New Zealand, and measuring up to 14 in. in length, belong to the genus Argosarchus.\nReturning to the breeding habits of these insects, in those New Zealand species in which males do occur both fertilized and unfertilized eggs are laid by the female, and both hatch. The fertilized eggs produce both males and females but the unfertilized eggs produce females only. The common smooth-bodied New Zealand stick insects belonging to the genus Clitarchus behave in this way, and will reproduce either parthenogenetically or sexually, though males of the species are almost as common as females. Clitarchus hookeri can produce two broods during the spring-summer season by parthenogenesis, and from a single original female kept in captivity I have continued to breed successive parthenogenetic generations for five years.\nWhen mating occurs the male stands upon the back of the female and passes its abdomen down and round one side of the female's abdomen to reach the genitalia below. In this position the male is carried around by the female, often for several days or even one to two weeks at a time, each insect feeding independently as the female moves from place to place. The coitus is periodically interrupted while some eggs are laid, but during this egg-laying period the male does not necessarily leave the back of the female.\nWith insects kept in captivity it is not unusual to find males of one species attempting to mate with females of another species, or even another genus.\nAlthough foliage feeders, each New Zealand species of stick insect has very definite food requirements. All species will eat manuka, but only Clitarchus hookeri can be successfully brought through its entire life history on a diet of manuka alone. Species of Acanthoxyla or Argosarchus confined on manuka will thrive for a few weeks, but then slowly die unless fed some of their specific food plant. In the case of species of Acanthoxyla rata or pohutukawa leaves are essential, or possibly also rimu and totara. With Argosarchus, Myrtus bullata, the ramarama is the essential food plant.\nAcanthoxyla geisocii on totara tree, illustrating cryptic colouration and form.\nJ. T. Salmon photo.\nStick insects will feed during the daytime, but for the most part they are nocturnal, remaining concealed in foliage during the day. They walk fairly rapidly with a peculiar ambulatory or swaying motion, and individuals will travel considerable distances, often over open country, for no apparent reason other than an urge to migrate.\nOne of their most fascinating habits is the performance of the ‘dance’, a peculiar motion in which the body is swayed from side to side by a flexing motion of the legs at the trochanteral-femoral and femoral-tibial joints. This may continue for half an hour or more without stopping. It starts and stops for no apparent reason, and has no apparent purpose. I have seen more than a hundred young stick insects standing on the glass of a breeding cage, all performing this dance together and in unison — an extraordinary sight. I have also seen lone individuals in the field going through the same antics, usually at a little before sunset.\nMost stick insects in New Zealand occur in two forms, a green form and a brown form. They always hatch green coloured, but may change to brown at the second moult. The adult insects cannot change colour, though green ones do tend to go a brownish green a week or so before dying. All species undergo four ecdyses during growth to maturity, and some can live for periods up to two years.\nStick insects are sometimes found with one or more legs shorter than the others. This arises from the accidental loss of a leg which is later regenerated. A regenerated leg is always shorter than the normal leg, its actual length depending on the instar in which it was lost. For instance, if it is lost in the first instar it will be only slightly shorter than normal when the insect is full grown; if it is lost in the second or third instars it will be correspondingly so much shorter; a leg lost after the last moult cannot be regenerated, and remains as a stump. Legs lost are usually broken off at the coxal-trochanteral joint which covers over with a small black cap, underneath which the new leg gradually grows. As growth proceeds, the cap extends until a small loop or hook-like structure results, within which can be seen the perfect leg in miniature. This persists in this state until the next moult, and when the insect emerges from its old skin the loop has been replaced by a perfect though smaller leg.\nIt is not unusual for a leg to be lost during moulting, and in fact stick insects suffer a severe mortality rate during moulting as they sometimes fail to emerge properly from the old skin and become strangled, as it were, by it.\nRegeneration of legs in Acanthoxyla prasina. of the loop containing the regenerating leg.

Salmon photos.","Think of a puppy, a kitten and a baby. When they are small and when they are grown up, they almost look the same. Their bodies just went through different stages and they got bigger.\nThe same with a plant - it started of as a small plant and then grows into an adult plant but still almost looks the same as what is did when it was small.\nAll living things (plants and animals) grow and go through different stages in their lives. This is called a life cycle, but not all animal look the same from when they were born to when they become adults.\nSome animals like insects and frogs looks totally different from when they were born and some just undergo a few changes. These changes that take place from one stage to another (and make them look different) is called metamorphosis.\nIf you look at the life cycle of a frog it all start with a female frog lying eggs. From the egg a tadpole hatches that almost looks like a little fish (it looks nothing like an adult frog). Changes will start taking place and the tadpole will first start growing hind legs and then front legs and lungs will also develop.\nEventually the tadpole will turn into a frog which then will grow to become an adult frog and if it is a female, it will lie eggs and the whole process or life cycle will start again.\nThere is a huge difference between the tadpole and the frog and this is called complete metamorphosis (the baby and the adult looks different from one another and the life cycle consist of 4 stages - the egg, tadpole, small frog/froglet and adult frog.)\nFor more information on the life cycle of a frog you can read here.\nAnother animal that goes through complete metamorphosis is a butterfly or a moth. There are also 4 stages and it is called the egg, the larva, the pupa and the adult.\nThe butterfly or moth does not hatch from the egg but it is a larva coming out of the egg - this looks like a worm. This larva will eat and grow.\nInsects have an exoskeleton which means it has a hard covering on the outside of the body which cannot stretch, so the larva will have to shed its skin. We say it molts.\nIf the larva has eaten and grown enough it will enter the next stage where it will rest and become a pupa. Inside of the pupa the butterfly or moth is forming with wings and antennae and after a certain time the adult butterfly or moth will emerge.\nHave a look at the video on the life cycle of a butterfly.\nSome insects looks almost the same as the adults when they hatch but will only undergo a small change. An example of this is the locust. The baby looks like the adult with one small difference - it does not have wings.\nAs the baby grows it will molt a few times and start growing wings until it is an adult. The stages in between each time it molts is called an instar.\nThis is called imcomplete metamorphosis and has 3 stages - the egg, the baby (which is called a nymph) and the adult.\nWatch the video on the differences of a complete and incomplete metamorphosis.\nFor more information on metamorphosis you can read here.\nCan you explain the following words in your own words (if you are not sure, read the piece again and find the meaning)\n- life cycle\n- complete metamorphosis\n- incomplete metamorhosis\nTeam South Africa banner designed by @bearone"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a71d9313-c057-4ec6-9acf-de7cb106f577>","<urn:uuid:f175ccfb-1871-4c79-b30d-9118b6f6c21c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"when did norm bellingham win olympic gold?","answer":"Norm Bellingham won an Olympic gold medal in kayaking at the 1988 Olympics.","context":["If you know the story of the 1500 meters at the 1936 Berlin Games, you know how it was one of those races that carried with it great expectations. If most such events never live up to such expectations, this was one for all time. Among the starters were six of the top seven finishers from the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, including the defending champion, Luigi Beccali of Italy. Also in the field: the American Glenn Cunningham, whose leg had been badly burned when he was a boy, and Jack Lovelock of New Zealand, a former Rhodes Scholar who was now a medical student.\nLovelock had meticulously trained for a killer final sprint and that, ultimately, is what won him the race, in world-record time, after a race marked by fantastic strategy and tactics, one that pushed the standards of human excellence of all who were in it to a higher level, four minutes in time to celebrate then and forever after.\nHanging now outside the fifth-floor executive offices of the U.S. Olympic Committee's new headquarters building is an oversize black-and-white photo from that race.\nThat's Norm's doing.\nAround the USOC offices in Colorado Springs, Colo, in fact, there are hundreds of photos from the last 100 years of the modern Olympic Games. There's a fascinating quality to the pictures. They show winning, of course. But not in any of those moments of triumph can you find anyone else's despair.\nNot even in the photo depicting the 1980 U.S. men's hockey team famous semifinal-round victory. Here, instead, the shot is of the Americans shaking hands with the Soviets.\nThat's Norm's doing, too.\n\"To have a chance to have been part of something that has a big impact and that brings the world together -- it has been great,\" Norm Bellingham was saying the other day on the phone.\nNorm's last day as the USOC's chief operating officer is this coming Friday. They announced his resignation last Friday -- the USOC playing it smart, announcing it essentially right before Super Bowl Sunday, knowing it would essentially get little play in the mainstream media.\nAnd that's pretty much what happened.\nThe USOC played it that way for three reasons:\nOne, Norm made a lot of money. It's all public information, right there in the Form 990s the USOC puts out every summer.\nTwo, Norm was at the center of the aborted launch in the summer of 2009 of the USOC television network.\nThree, Norm was a candidate to be the USOC boss and didn't get the job.\nAs for the money, Norm never negotiated his salary. Former USOC chairman Peter Ueberroth told him, here's your package.\nThe aborted network launch remains, in many regards, a mystery. But this much is certain: There will, at some point, be an Olympic channel. It's inevitable.\nAnd though Norm didn't get the CEO job -- the fact that he stayed on for more than a year, and helped Scott Blackmun, who did get the job, speaks to Norm's character.\nNorm came to the USOC in the first instance because he wanted to give back to a movement that has made a difference in his own life.\nNorm is an Olympic gold medalist, in kayaking in 1988. \"Chariots of Fire\" is without a doubt his favorite movie; he has an original poster from the movie in his office.\nNorm has a remarkable background. He grew up in India and Nepal. His personal hero is Sir Edmund Hillary, who climbed Mt. Everest. Norm has an MBA from Harvard. And on and on.\nA big part of Norm's job over the past four-plus years was to make business decisions. Some of those decisions didn't sit well with certain constituents within the so-called U.S. Olympic \"family\" (these decisions came in the ordinary course of USOC business and for purposes of this point stand apart from the 2009 drama over the TV network).\nSo what? None of that has anything to do with the big picture: Doesn't any entity want its senior officers to get it? To understand the mission?\nIn Norm's case, it can be said that he not only understood the mission -- he has a genuine soulfulness for it.\nThat's why that picture of the 1936 1500 hangs outside the executive offices.\nIt's why Norm was rapt when Lou Zamperini came through Colorado Springs recently, the World War II hero telling Norm what it was like to compete at those 1936 Games. Norm, meanwhile, played Zamperini an audio tape of the race and when the call to the line went out over the loudspeaker went out -- in German, of course -- Zamperini, all these years later, froze for a brief moment.\nLike being there all over again, he whispered to Norm.

{"question":"What are the key differences between exercise stress tests and pharmacologic stress tests for diagnosing heart conditions?","answer":"Exercise stress tests involve walking on a treadmill while monitoring heart activity, aiming for 5-15 minutes of intense exercise to reach target heart rate. They provide additional prognostic information through exercise capacity and hemodynamic response. In contrast, pharmacologic stress tests are used when patients cannot exercise and rely on medications to simulate stress on the heart. Exercise stress is preferred unless contraindicated, as it provides more information beyond what pharmacologic stress can reveal. Both types can be combined with imaging modalities like echocardiography or nuclear perfusion studies, with pharmacologic stress using adenosine showing slightly better negative likelihood ratios in imaging studies.","context":["Cardiac stress tests serve the purpose of diagnosis as well as prognosis of those who have symptoms compatible with myocardial ischemia. They are also used for prognosis in those known to have ischemic heart disease.\nThe clinical gold standard for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the coronary angiogram. This is costly, invasive, requires expertise and is associated with the minor but significant risk of bleeding and contrast nephropathy. The prognosis of CAD is dependent on the amount of left ventricle that is burdened, which is in turn dependent on the anatomy of the coronary vasculature. The more vessels that are involved and the more proximal the lesion is, the greater is the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.\nStress testing serves the purpose of non-invasively determining which patients have a high enough risk of adverse cardiovascular events to have a mortality benefit from revascularization. It can also determine the physiologic significance of a flow-limiting lesion whereas angiography provides a static assessment of a stenotic lesion.\nII. Identify the Goal Behavior\nThe first step in the assessment of a patient with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia is the clinical assessment of pretest probability. Making a determination of the likely prevalence of CAD in a patient will direct the decision to further risk stratify with stress testing. The pretest probability, or Bayesian probability, uses the history, physical exam, electrocardiogram (ECG), and cardiac biomarkers and is crucial in assessing the result of a stress test.\nThe next step is the selection of the type of stress test, including exercise or pharmacologic stress along with myocardial perfusion imaging, echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CT), or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selection of the most appropriate test is based on a combination of patient factors, initial ECG and local institution factors. The last step is to determine the post-test probability of disease and if angiography or medical management is appropriate.\nIII. Describe a Step-by-Step approach/method to this problem.\nThe evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain that is suspected to be due to CAD should have an initial assessment of the likelihood of disease. Multiple large cohort studies have demonstrated that patient’s age, gender, cardiac risk factors, and characterization of the chest pain can estimate the probability of disease. It is important to remember that these cohorts were derived from referral populations, which may have a higher prevalence of disease and thus these models may overestimate the pretest probability.\nCharacterization of the chest pain is based on three questions:\nIs the pain retrosternal?\nIs it reliably brought on by exertion or emotional stress?\nIs it reliably relieved within minutes of resting or sublingual nitroglycerin?\nTypical angina is defined as the presence of a positive answer to all three questions. Atypical angina is the presence of two positive answers. Non-anginal chest pain is the presence of one or none of the factors. The type of chest pain can then be combined with the patient’s age and sex to generate a pretest probability. SeeTable I\nFor the purpose of diagnosis, only those patients who fall in the intermediate pretest probability (i.e. more than 10% but less than 90%) should be tested, since it is only this group of patients in whom a positive or a negative stress test will make a significant post-test change in the probability of significant CAD.\nThe American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2002 guidelines do not recommend routine testing for those patients with low pretest probability as the positive predictive value of an abnormal test is only 21%.\nInpatients who present with acute chest pain but with symptoms suggestive of “intermediate probability” for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should undergo stress testing for the purpose of diagnosis. As per the ACC/AHA guidelines, this should be done within 72 hours of presentation and it may be done as an outpatient if arrangements can be made reliably.Those patients who have a high pretest probability based on the presentation may be referred for coronary angiogram or may undergo stress testing to determine prognosis. A negative stress test in these patients does not rule out CAD, however it portends a relatively good prognosis.\nThere are two considerations in choosing a stress test. First, what will be the type of stress used: exercise or pharmacologic? Second, what testing modality should be used: electrocardiography or imaging (echocardiography or nuclear perfusion)?\nImaging based testing offers the advantage of localizing ischemia and assessing myocardial viability. Exercise stress provides additional information beyond pharmacologic stress and should be chosen unless contraindicated or the patient is unable.\nExercise increases demand of myocardial oxygen and changes in ECG or anginal symptoms correlate with myocardial ischemia. Exercise capacity and the hemodynamic response to exercise are predictive of prognosis independent of ischemia. The inability to exercise is also associated with a higher cardiovascular risk. Standard exercise ECG testing is preferred if a patient can exercise and has no baseline ECG abnormalities (except for right bundle branch block or less than 1mm ST depression), is not on digitalis therapy and has not had previous revascularization.\nIn the presence of significant baseline ECG abnormalities, digitalis therapy or previous revascularization, exercise stress imaging should be performed. If a patient cannot exercise, pharmacologic stress should be used in place of exercise. Local expertise or availability will also influence the test choice.\nThere is limited research comparing the different stress testing modalities directly. One study compared exercise ECG testing, dobutamine-atropine echocardiography, dipyridamole echocardiography, and radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi with dobutamine stress. These four tests had similar positive predictive values but the imaging modalities had greater negative predictive value than standard exercise ECG testing.\nOne meta-analysis compared several modalities of pharmacologic stress testing. Angiographic data was compared to echocardiography or nuclear perfusion studies using adenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine. Adenosine and dipyridamole perfusion imaging had the best negative likelihood ratio with adenosine being slightly better. Echocardiography is more operator dependent and affected by pulmonary disease than are the nuclear imaging modalities.\n|Asymptomatic||Non-anginal chest pain||Atypical angina||Typical angina|\nIV. Common Pitfalls.\nIt is important to remember that chest pain can represent a serious non-cardiac condition. Keep in mind a broad differential and allow initial impressions to change as you gather information. Pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, cardiac valvular disease, esophageal disorders, and peptic ulcer disease can mimic angina.\nDiagnosing CAD in women is challenging. Women are less likely to present with typical angina. False positive test results during exercise ECG testing are more common in women possibly owing to a lower prevalence of coronary disease than in men of the same age.\nIt is important to remember that patients who present with definite ACS, such as ST segment elevations, other ECG changes suggestive of a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina with high risk features (ST depressions, prior history of MI, significant change in prior symptoms of stable angina, or initially positive cardiac biomarkers) benefit from prompt coronary angiography and appropriate revascularization.\nRecognition of any of these factors should prompt immediate cardiology consultation, transfer to a facility with interventional cardiology capabilities or consideration of thrombolysis.\nV. National Standards, Core Indicators and Quality Measures.\nRecent advances in medical therapy for CAD highlight the importance of aggressive risk factor modification. Recent trials have shown equivalent outcomes between revascularization and optimal medical therapy in certain populations. In light of this, appropriate screening and treatment of lipid disorders, blood pressure and diabetes, as well as antiplatelet therapy for secondary or primary prophylaxis are crucial.\nVI.

This test may show areas of low blood flow and damaged tissue.\nWhy do I need a stress test?\nIf the doctor suspects you have coronary artery disease or if you are experiencing symptoms of chest pain or sudden shortness of breath.\nTo asses the amount of a possible blockage within the vessels of the heart.\nA stress test may be advised to you even if you have already been diagnosed with coronary artery disease to asses the effectiveness of the treatment you are on.\nAn accurate stress test Decreases the use of unnecessary stenting.\nHow do I prepare for the test?\nWear sneakers and comfortable clothes (preferably a button down shirt with no metal buttons or zipper).\nAvoid wearing long chains and necklaces.\nContinue your medications up to the day of the procedure.\nStop this medication on the day of the test-\n- Beta blockers including: Atenolol, Toprol, Metoprolol, Lopressor, Coreg, Zebeta, Betapace, or Corgard\nIf you have asthma and use an inhaler, bring it with you to your test.\nDo Not smoke on the day of the test… or ever!!!\nDo not apply body lotion on the day of the test\nIf you need to cancel your appointment, please do so at least 24 hours prior to your test or you may be charged.\nWhat should I expect during the test?\nA trained technician will place electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes connect to wires on an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine. The EKG records the electrical activity of the heart.\nNext, you will slowly begin walking on the treadmill. As the test progresses, the speed and incline on the treadmill increases. Your blood pressure and EKG will be monitored throughout the test.\nThe length of the test depends on your physical fitness and symptoms. The goal is to have your heart working hard for about 5- 15 minutes in order to thoroughly monitor its function. Exercise is continued until you reach your target heart rate.\nDuring the test you may develop symptoms or signs of:\n- Chest pain\n- Shortness of breath\n- High or low blood pressure\n- Abnormal heart rhythm\nYou may stop the test at any time if uncomfortable. Symptoms typically disappear once you rest.\nThe test lasts about 30 minutes.\nWhat are the risks?\nStress tests are generally safe and complications are very rare. Although with any medical procedure, it does carry a small risk of complication.\nThese complications include:\n- Hypotension: blood pressure may fall during or after exercise that can cause dizziness. This will usually ease off once you stop exercising\n- Abnormal heart rhythms may occur during exercise. This usually returns to normal once exercise is ceased.\n- Chest pain or flushing feeling may occur\nOnce the test is completed, the results of your test will be assessed to determine the condition of your heart.\nThis is useful in planning for your treatment and also helps in determining whether further testing is needed.\nA stress test may reveal:\n- The results may be beneficial in confirming or ruling out the diagnosis of heart disease\n- Confirm whether you are in a stable state\n- Assess the development of new blockage\n- Some patients may be unable to exercise due to joint/muscle pain or limitation. In some of theses cases, a chemical stress test may be appropriate."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:693f8208-0de7-417d-92bd-6142eaddfb98>","<urn:uuid:adc4ed46-f892-44a5-9c42-4380c53c5070>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm an IT manager preparing for system upgrades. What are the key steps for planning a firmware upgrade, and how does this relate to broader disaster recovery preparedness?","answer":"For firmware upgrades, you should first understand the new version by reading release notes and testing in a lab environment. Create a detailed plan that includes business approvals, maintenance windows, and backup procedures. Key technical steps include: backing up configurations, keeping copies of old firmware, ensuring console access, and having disaster recovery options ready. For broader disaster recovery preparedness, it's essential to recognize that disasters are unavoidable - around 15,000 hard drives fail daily in the US alone. Organizations should implement both cloud and in-house backup solutions, regularly practice recovery procedures with employees, and ensure proper data encryption and access controls are in place. The plan should be regularly tested and all employees should understand their roles in both upgrade and recovery scenarios.","context":["Firmware change management\nConsider the following five points when performing firmware upgrades, not only in FortiOS but in general. This applies to pretty much any change you have to do in a production environment.\nUnderstanding the new version first\nBefore attempting any changes in production, first make sure you set up a laboratory where you can freely play with the new features, and understand them with enough time and no pressure. Read the Release Notes, Manuals, and other documentation like presentations, videos, or podcasts about the new version. Youare ready to explain the need for an upgrade once you understand:\n- The differences and the enhancements between the new version and the previous version(s).\n- The impact of the upgrade on customers and the users of the operating platform.\n- The known limitations that might affect your environment.\n- The potential risks when performing the upgrade.\n- The licensing changes that may apply.\nHave a valid reason to upgrade\nThe reason can NOT be “Because I want to have the latest version”. The reason has to be explained in terms of business, technical, and/or operational improvement. Affirmative answers to the following questions are valid reasons to upgrade:\n- Does the new version have a feature that helps to ensure compliance?\n- Does the new version have an enhancement that allows 40% decrease (40% improvement) on the time to perform a certain operation?\n- Does the new feature correct a known defect/bug found on a previous version that affects the company business/operations?\n- Will the new version allow your organization to deploy new services that will help to gain new customers or increase loyalty of existing ones?\n- Is the vendor cutting support for the version your organization is currently using? If the best reason to upgrade is “Because the new features seem to be cool” or “Because I want to have the latest version”, a little more understanding and planning may be necessary.\nPrepare an upgrade plan\nIf you choose to upgrade because you found a valid reason to do so, make sure you create a plan that covers business, technical, and operational aspects of the upgrade:\nProper planning and justification for an upgrade should be proportional to how critical the system is to the business.\n- Make sure you can clearly articulate the benefits of the upgrade in business terms (time, money, and efficiency).\n- Understand the business processes that will be affected by the change.\n- Make sure the upgrade maintenance window is not close to a business-critical process (such as quarterly or monthly business closure).\n- Obtain executive and operational approval for the maintenance window. The approval must come from the owners of ALL the systems/information affected by the upgrade, not only from those that own the system being upgraded. The approval must be done in a formal (written or e-mail) form.\nTechnical and operational:\n- Re-read the Release Notes for the technology you are upgrading. Supported hardware models, upgrade paths, and known limitations should be clearly understood.\n- Make sure your upgrade maintenance window does not overlap with any other maintenance window on your infrastructure.\n- If you have any premium support offer (such as TAM, Premium Support), do a capacity planning exercise to ensure the new firmware/software version does not take more hardware resources than you currently have.\n- Create a backup, whether or not you have scheduled backups. Create a new fresh backup.\n- Obtain offline copies of both the currently installed firmware and the new version.\n- Create a list of systems with inter-dependencies to the system you are upgrading. For example, if you are upgrading a FortiGate; understand the impact on any FortiAP, FortiAuthenticator, FortiToken, FortiManager, or FortiAnalyzer you have on your environment.\n- Ensure you have a list of adjacent devices to the upgrading platform and have administrative access to them, just in case you need to do some troubleshooting. Are you upgrading FortiWeb? Make sure you can administratively access the Web Applications. Are you upgrading a FortiGate? Make sure you can administratively access the surrounding switches and routers.\n- Have a step-by-step plan on how to perform and test the upgrade. You want to make sure you think of the worst situation before it happens, and have predefined courses of action, instead of thinking under pressure when something already went wrong.\n- Define a set of tests (that include critical business applications that should be working) to make sure the upgrade went fine. If any test does not go well, define which ones mandate a rollback and which ones can be tolerated for further troubleshooting. This set of tests should be run before and after the upgrade to compare results, and they should be the same.\n- Define a clear rollback plan. If something goes wrong with the upgrade or the tests, the rollback plan will help you get your environment back to a known and operational status. The plan must clearly state the conditions under which the rollback will be started.\n- Declare configuration freezes. A little bit before and after the upgrade. The idea is to reduce the amount of variables to take into consideration if something goes wrong.\n- Perform a “Quality Assurance” upgrade. Grab a copy of the production configuration, load it on a non-production box and execute the upgrade there to see if there are any issues on the process. Then adjust your plan according to the results you obtained.\n- Have a list of information elements to be gathered if something goes wrong. This ensures that, even if the upgrade fails, you will collect enough information so you can troubleshoot the issue without needing to repeat the problem. Get help from TAC/Support departments if you need to check what else could be missing on your list.\n- Define a test monitoring period after the change was completed. Even if the upgrade went smoothly, something could still go wrong. Make sure you monitor the upgraded system for at least one business cycle. Business cycles may be a week, a month, or a quarter, depending on your organization’s business priorities.\nExecute the upgrade plan\nExecution of an upgrade is just as key as planning. Once you are performing the upgrade, the pressure will rise and stress might peak. This is why you should stick to the plan you created with a cool head. Resist the temptation to take decisions while performing the upgrade, as your judgment will be clouded by the stress of the moment, even if a new decision seems to be “obvious” at such time. If your plan says you should rollback, then execute the rollback despite the potential “We-can-fix-this-very-quickly” mentality. While performing the upgrade, make sure all the involved components are permanently monitored before, during, and after the upgrade, either via monitoring systems, SNMP alerts, or at least with tools like a ping. Critical resources like CPU, memory, network, and/or disk utilization must also constantly monitored. To avoid misunderstandings, when performing the tests for each critical application defined on the planning, make sure there are formal notifications on the results for each user area, service, system, and/or application tested. Regardless if you have to rollback or not, if a problem occurs, make sure you gather as much information about the problem as possible, so you can later place a support ticket to find a solution. Last but not least, document the upgrade:\n- Enable your terminal emulation program to leave trace of all the commands executed and all the output generated. If you are performing steps via GUI, consider using a video capture tool to document it.\n- Document any command or change performed over the adjacent/interdependent systems. Make sure they are acknowledged by the relevant administrators\n- Document any deviations performed over the upgrade plan. This is planned-versus-actual.\nLearn more about change management\nChange Management and Change Control are huge knowledge areas in the field of Information Systems and Computer/Network Security. This document is by no means a comprehensive list on what you should do when performing an upgrade, with either Fortinet or any other technology. It is merely a list of important things you should take into consideration. Firmware when performing upgrades which are the result of years of experience dealing with changes on critical environments, as it is common that security devices are protecting critical applications and processes. There are vast resources on the topic: books, public whitepapers, blog entries, etc. If you search the Internet for the “Change Control Best Practices” or “Change Management Best Practices” you will get many interesting documents.\nPerforming a firmware upgrade\nUpgrading a firewall is something that should be compared to upgrading the operating system on your computer. It’s not to be taken lightly! You want to make sure everything is backed up and you have some options available if things go awry. Assuming it all seems to work you also want a list of things to do in order to confirm everything is working properly. Finally, you need enough time to do it. All really simple stuff, but what does this mean in relation to upgrading your FortiGate? It means, you follow these simple steps:\n1. Backup and store old configuration (full configuration backup from CLI). Digging into this a little, step 1 is easy to understand. Do a full backup of your old configuration. This is all part of your disaster recovery plan. If the upgrade fails in some way you need to make sure you can get the Firewall back up and running. The best way to do this is to get it back to a state where you know what the behavior was.\n2. Have copy of old firmware available. Step 2, is also part of your disaster recovery. If the upgrade fails you might be able to switch the active partition. But as a Professional, you need to be prepared for the worst case scenario where you can’t do that. Which means you’ll need your old firmware.\n3. Have disaster recovery option on standby — especially if remote. Step 3, is your plan for what to do in the event of a critical failure. As we’re talking FortiGate this means that your firewall doesn’t come back after the upgrade. What this means is that you need to be able to get to the console port in order to find out why. Maybe it’s DHCP and the IP changed, maybe the OS is corrupt, who knows? Get to the console and find out. There could be a simple fix. If there’s not, then be prepared for a format and TFTP reload.\n4. Read the release notes, including the upgrade path and bug information. Step 4, READ THE RELEASE NOTES. They contain all kinds of information, known bugs, fixed bugs even upgrade issues like lost configuration settings. Not all upgrade information is ever contained in any products release notes. That does not mean they are devoid of good/useful information. Read them, digest them, then a few days later read them again.\n5. Double check everything. Step 5, do a double check of everything. Is your TFTP server working, does your console connection function, is there anything in the release notes that could impact your upgrade procedure, do you have your configuration backed up? Make sure you’ve done everything.\n6. Upgrade. Step 6, do the upgrade. Doing an upgrade doesn’t take very long, a few minutes (less a lot of times) but make sure you schedule enough time for it. At the end of the day an upgrade can succeed or fail. If it succeeds you want some time to check/confirm that any important features you have are working (VPNs etc). If it fails you’ll need time to sort things out.\nHaving trouble configuring your Fortinet hardware or have some questions you need answered? Ask your questions in the comments below!!!

This is especially true for businesses that store a lot of data, and put a lot of faith in their IT department to ensure that their company continues to operate smoothly. So, what constitutes a disaster in terms of information technology? There are many different occurrences that can lead to data loss, including but not limited to things like user error, theft, natural disasters, equipment failure, and fire.\nThe potential for loss is huge and putting that much faith in your IT department’s ability to ensure that no data is lost is a losing battle for many companies. Most companies will experience significant data loss at some point and being prepared to deal with this data loss is a good first step. Each year in the United States alone, 15,000 hard drives fail every single day. Much of the data on these hard drives is lost and may not be recoverable.\nTo avoid serious data loss and financial hardship for your company, having a plan in place to mitigate the effects of the data disaster is imperative. With the disaster recovery plan, you will be able to deal with these circumstances, and have a clear plan laid out for your employees to follow so that no guess work is required regarding what steps need to be taken immediately following a data disaster, which can be a chaotic and hectic time for your IT department.\nReduce Unnecessary Risk\nThe first and most important aspect of an excellent disaster recovery plan is being able to reduce unnecessary risk. There is no sense in putting your company in the way of harm. There is also no way of knowing when a data disaster is about to strike. However, by identifying the potential unnecessary risks that are already in place, and taking steps to limit them, you can help to ensure that any data loss is not significant in that you are able to recover quickly and easily.\nSome of the best practices for reducing unnecessary risk for your business include ensuring that you are encrypting important and sensitive data, having the proper mobile security policies in place, and educating your users on virus and malware prevention and best practices. All companies should be using an offsite cloud backup solution, preferably with military grade data encryption. Additionally, having strong user access controls and permissions can help to minimize incidences where employees purposefully harm your data, or steal it for their own purposes.\nKnow that Disasters are Unavoidable\nOne of the biggest mistakes that many businesses make is assuming that they are going to be able to avoid data disasters completely, throughout the life of their business. Data disasters often strike without warning, and crucial elements of your organization may be put at risk in the process. As you are putting together your disaster recovery plan, focus on making sure that you are optimized for speed. This means that employees should have a good idea of what is expected of them in the event of the data disaster, and be able to react accordingly. Additionally, have strong testing principles in place to ensure that you can catch equipment before it inevitably fails.\nPractice Makes Perfect\nAnother mistake that companies often make is putting together an excellent disaster recovery plan, and then never going over it with the employees that will actually be executing the plan. Occasionally, at least several times per year, you and your employees should be walking through the plan in full. Make sure that you are working with the employees that will actually be expected to handle the tasks, in the event of the data disaster.\nPractice makes perfect. By walking through your data disaster recovery plan several times per year, when in actual disaster strikes your employees will be ready to execute your plan, and know the role that they play in recovering from the disaster.\nAlthough cloud backup solutions are an excellent choice for any business that is storing a lot of data, they should be used in conjunction with in-house data backup policies. An in-house backup of your data helps to ensure that you can quickly recover the data that is important for your operations in the event of the data disaster. With online backup solutions there can be a lot of data transfer required before you have access to the files, which can slow things down. Although when online or cloud hosted solution is imperative for ensuring that you are protecting yourself, and in-house backup solution is going to provide you with the quickest disaster recovery.\nFamiliarize Yourself with the Technology\nYour data protection policies are likely going to be handled by your IT team. However, it is a big mistake of business owners to leave their disaster recovery policies to chance. Try to familiarize yourself with the different technologies that you are using to ensure that your data is properly backed up, so that you can have insightful conversations with your IT team and other consultants during a data disaster. Having the business owner not have a full understanding of the situation is not going to help things quickly resolve themselves.\nData disasters are a serious problem for any company that stores sensitive customer data, or data that is critical to their operations. Knowing the steps that you can take to help ensure that your company is adequately protected will help to ensure a smooth data recovery operation, in the event that the unthinkable happens."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9b1addb5-f8ab-4624-a086-0ebd9c3afe2f>","<urn:uuid:bf203b81-46e5-47f2-8d75-eb2ae2981677>"],"error":null}

The mellow flavours and strength make this a popular profile for beginners and experienced enthusiasts alike.\nSweet & spicy\nExpressions within the Sweet & spicy flavour profile can vary, but common flavour experiences can include gingerbread, hot cross buns, mulled wine and even balsamic strawberries. Think about the culinary experience of bringing spice into sweet dishes, the addition of cinnamon to pastries or sweet chili flavours from East Asia.\nSpicy & dry\nThe Spicy & dry flavour profile contains expressions from all over Scotland. The iconic flavour experiences captured in the profile evoke memories of cooking with nutmeg, cloves and peppercorns. On the nose this profile delivers rich experiences and includes whiskies with strong aromas of sandalwood, pencil shavings and even tree bark.\nDeep, rich & dried fruits\nThe Deep, rich & dried fruits profile offers a wonderful selection of aromas and flavours. Our Tasting Notes describe fruity whisky profiles on the nose such as marmalade, honeycomb toffee, balsamic glazed fruits and demerara. If you discover flavours of rum truffles, molasses and salted caramel, you're probably not far off for this profile.\nOld & dignified\nOur Old & dignified flavour profile exudes the characteristics that can only come from long, careful maturation and older, well-balanced age statements. The Tasting Notes typically refer to rich flavours with clear aromas, such as honeycomb, brandy snaps, polished wood, and dark chocolate orange to excite the palate and make this flavour profile a must-try.\nLight & delicate\nThe Light & delicate flavour profile is one to confound your expectations, as it may not reflect a whisky's age. The light whisky focuses more on subtle and delicate flavour experiences emerging from the drams, with softer flavours such as fresh laundry, peach, flower meadows and green tea.\nJuicy, oak & vanilla\nA complex flavour profile, Juicy, oak & vanilla offers an interesting assortment of flavour experiences. Our exacting Tasting Panel describes clear aromas of honeysuckle, coriander seed and even dunnage warehouses. Flavours in this profile often include exciting, juicy fruits and a deeper wood flavour. Think chocolate-coated cherries, passion fruit or pineapple sorbet, and toasted oak.\nOily & coastal\nOur Oily & coastal flavour profile certainly contains coastal whiskies, but it isn't limited to them. That's because the Society challenges traditional whisky convention to focus on flavour as the main guide. The flavours in this category remind us of coastal settings and the foods and experiences available there, with oysters, barbecued prawns, seaweed, driftwood and beach bonfires.\nThe Lightly peated flavour profile is the first of three covering the sought-after Peated category. Lightly peated whiskies in this collection evoke intriguing flavours and aromas, from toasted marshmallows to smoky garden bonfires and wood ash. This profile makes an excellent first step into peated whiskies for those exploring whisky flavours and is a great offering for more seasoned peated whisky fans.\nThe Peated flavour profile sits between lightly and heavily peated whiskies, offering a clear sense of peat for peated whisky enthusiasts and an intriguing step into the world of peated whisky for explorers new to the category. The profile has robust perfumed aromas on the nose, while the flavour delivers rich meats and roasted foods. Expressions can deliver herbal flavours and aromas that give this category a wide range of flavour experiences from lavender smoke to hospitals and a ship's engine room.\nHeavily peated whisky comes with the territory of strong smoky flavours and earthy tones. Smoky whisky fans will love the rich aromas of cigar butts and wood burning stoves. On the palate, heavily peated whiskies often deliver smoked fish or meats. The flavour combinations and intricate aromas make this a compelling and powerful category to explore.","Bourbon is a type of whiskey that has been aged for at least four years in new, charred oak barrels.\nThis aging process gives the bourbon its dark color and distinctive smoky flavor.\nBourbon can be made from corn, rye, or wheat, and it must have an alcohol content of at least 40% ABV (80 proof).\nBourbon is typically drunk neat or on ice with a twist of lemon peel.\nThe how long does bourbon the last question is not easy to answer because it varies depending on how you store your bourbon.\nWhat is Bourbon?\nBourbon is an alcohol distilled from corn, rye, and barley.\nThe first written mention of bourbon is in 1785.\nBourbon can be made anywhere in the United States, but most bourbons are from Kentucky because that state produces a high-quality product.\nThe Bluegrass State requires bourbon to be at least 51% corn and aged for two years in new oak barrels before it may carry the name “bourbon”.\nAny whiskey age less than four years cannot legally be called “straight” or “aged,” although producers may label their products as if they contain no additives—a distinction irrelevant to many drinkers.\nBourbon was initially known as Monongahela rye whisky (RYE) when distilled near present-day Pittsburgh, PA, which was then part of Virginia and considered an essential trading item.\nOver time bourbon has been produced in other countries, such as Canada or Scotland, where distilleries use wheat instead of oats to make their whiskey (Scotch).\nHow to Store Bourbon?\nIf you value the contents of your bourbon bottle, store it in an upright position.\nBourbon has a much higher alcohol content than wine, so if the cork and bourbon are left together too long, they might corrode one another.\nIt must be kept in an area with temperatures between 50-70 degrees Fahrenheit and not exposed to direct sunlight or moisture.\nThere is no hard proof that direct sunlight will ruin bourbon (it may or may not), but it certainly won’t help the quality.\nPut your collection in an area that does not get direct sunlight to avoid any risk.\nThe ideal bourbon storage area has consistent temperatures.\nAvoid storing your drinks in an attic space in which the temperature varies, as this can lead to rapid evaporation of aroma and flavor compounds from the glass.\nA well-ventilated living room where air circulates freely will produce the best results.\nStoring bourbon can seem like a difficult task, but it doesn’t have to be with the right know-how.\nAllow yourself to get creative and try new things for an occasional treat.\nHow Long Does Bourbon Last? Does Bourbon Go Bad?\nExpect a bourbon to be aging nicely after one year in oak barrels; however, if it has been sitting on store shelves for too long, its flavors will become less complex, and it will still be drinkable.\nThat’s not to say bourbon never goes bad, however.\nIt can go “bad” for several reasons: exposure to light or heat, being stored in an unsuitable container, changes in the temperature range exposed to overtime, and how often the bottle has been opened and closed.\nAll these things can hasten oxidation, leading to change in flavor compounds and loss of aromatic complexity (i.e., less intense).\nThough not much different from other whiskeys, bourbon’s lifespan is relatively brief once it has been opened.\nYou may store an unopened bottle for decades, but 1 to 2 years after the bottle is opened, its flavor will be altered.\nHow to Tell if Bourbon is Bad?\nBourbon lovers enjoy the drink for its sweet taste, resulting from competing for smoky and sugary flavors.\nThe term “Bourbon” has been debunked as a marketing tool to emulate French Cognac, but it is recognized as an American spirit that can be diluted according to preference.\nDuring aging, the whiskey’s color is primarily dictated by barrel char.\nThe charred wood in a bourbon barrel gives off compounds like vanillin and oak lactones responsible for flavors such as vanilla, caramel, or buttery tones.\nHowever, if aged too long, it can result in tannins that impart an astringent taste to the drink when diluted with water.\nA bottle of bourbon goes bad when its distinctive brown color fades away.\nThe satisfyingly sweet, spirited, and smoky flavor turns to dullness when tasted from the bottle.\nIn extreme cases, a Bourbon that has been opened for too long can cause the alcohol to evaporate faster than the water, providing an environment for mold growth inside of it.\nIn conclusion, bourbon has a relatively long shelf life, so you can save it until the time is right.\nBourbon does not go bad most of the time as long as you store it in a cool dark place like your basement or cellar, where the temperature remains stable year-round.\nIf you keep your bourbon in a room where it’s exposed to light, then oxidation may cause the taste of the bourbon to become changed over time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c3c6bb70-7da6-46dc-8a10-fadd48c8ef49>","<urn:uuid:b2c354d8-761e-428a-9fb4-dc306d4ec788>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What recent actions have the US and Marshall Islands taken to show support for Taiwan's international participation?","answer":"Both countries have demonstrated support for Taiwan's international participation in different ways. The US has shown support by easing diplomatic restrictions, allowing more open interactions between US and Taiwanese officials, including permitting meetings in government buildings and at Taiwan's mission in Washington. The Marshall Islands has taken more direct action by adopting a unanimous resolution calling on the United Nations to resolve Taiwan's exclusion from the UN system, with President Kabua personally delivering this message during his state visit to Taiwan and publicly stating that Taiwan must be given every opportunity to be a contributing member of the international community.","context":["US loosens restrictions on Taiwan contacts in defiance of China\nChanges will allow US officials to invite Taiwan officials into government buildings in Washington and attend meetings at the Taiwan mission.\nThe State Department has announced that it will make it easier for US officials to meet Taiwanese representatives, defying pressure from China at a time of high tensions, and as the US Congress considers sweeping legislation to counter Beijing’s influence.\nThe United States still considers Beijing to be China’s legitimate government, consistent with its switch of recognition in 1979, but will do away with some of the convoluted rules that restricted dealings with Taiwan, including in-person meetings.\nThe updated guidance “underscores Taiwan is a vibrant democracy and an important security and economic partner that is also a force for good in the international community,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said.\n“These new guidelines liberalize guidance on contacts with Taiwan, consistent with our unofficial relations,” he said in a statement.\nThe move by President Joe Biden’s administration formalises increasingly vocal US support for Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, and came in response to an act of Congress that required a review.\nTaiwan’s mission in Washington – officially called the “Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States”, rather than an embassy – welcomed the new guidelines, saying they reflected a bipartisan consensus for closer relations.\n“Taiwan and the US share a deep and abiding partnership based on our common values and joint interests,” it said, pointing to cooperation on global health, space, trade and democracy promotion.\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a staunch critic of Beijing, in his last days in office, said that he was getting rid of previous guidelines on dealing with Taiwan but not issue new ones, drawing confusion in some quarters on what had changed.\nUnder the guidelines issued by the Biden administration, US officials will be allowed to invite Taiwanese representatives into government buildings in Washington or attend working-level meetings at the Taiwanese mission, both of which were previously prohibited, a State Department official said.\nThe US began allowing open interactions with Taiwanese diplomats after Pompeo ended the earlier guidance.\nThe Biden administration last month sent the US ambassador to Palau on a visit to Taiwan to accompany the president of the island nation – one of a dwindling number of countries that recognise Taipei. The ambassador was the highest-ranking US diplomat to visit Taiwan in 42 years.\nSimilarly, the acting US ambassador in Japan in March tweeted a picture of himself meeting at his official residence with his Taiwanese counterpart – the type of day-to-day diplomacy that is usually a non-event but which Washington had previously shied away from with Taiwan for fear of upsetting Beijing.\nThe new guidelines are also expected to relax the strict protocol on whether junior US officials can appear at Twin Oaks, the lush, forested residence of Taiwan’s envoy in Washington.\nTwin Oaks events routinely draw a who’s who of US lawmakers and former officials but sitting government employees are careful to steer clear.\nSenior US officials have periodically visited Taiwan, with former President Donald Trump’s health secretary travelling in August, although Washington has remained careful not to anger China by sending cabinet members involved in national security.\nChina considers Taiwan, where the mainland’s defeated nationalists fled in 1949 after losing the civil war, to be a territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.\nTaiwan in recent days reported growing air incursions by Beijing. Joseph Wu, Taiwan’s foreign minister, has called the approach “self-defeating.”\nThe US has voiced concern about the Chinese moves and warned against the use of coercion against Taiwan.\nUnder the Taiwan Relations Act approved by Congress when the US switched recognition, Washington is required to provide Taiwan with weapons for its self-defence.\nThe easing of rules comes amid soaring tensions between the US and China on multiple fronts.\nOn Friday, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced that it will consider sweeping legislation to counter China’s influence on April 21.\nThe “Strategic Competition Act of 2021” includes a range of diplomatic and strategic initiatives to counteract Beijing, reflecting hard-line sentiment on dealings with China members of both political parties.\nThe 280-page bill addresses economic competition with China, but also humanitarian and democratic values, such as imposing sanctions for the treatment of the minority Muslim Uighurs and supporting democracy in Hong Kong.\nRelations with China is one of the most bipartisan issues in Washington, with both Democrats and Republicans generally backing efforts to do more to compete against Beijing.","President David Kabua and a delegation left the Marshall Islands Monday afternoon on a Taiwan government-chartered flight to Taipei to launch a five-day state visit.\nThe state visit, at the invitation of the Taiwan government, will run through March 25. This is the President’s first state visit to Taiwan since taking office in 2020. Accompanied by the Taiwan Ambassador Jeffrey SC Hsiao and Madam Jasmine Hsiao, the RMI delegation includes the President, First Lady Ginger Kabua, Foreign Minister Casten Nemra and Terry Nemra, Nitijela Member Joe Bejang and Mary Bejang and four staff.\nDuring the RMI delegation’s stay in Taiwan, the ROC President Dr. Tsai Ing-wen formally welcomed President Kabua and his delegation with full military honors on the morning of March 22, before awarding him the Order of Brilliant Jade with Grand Cordon for his outstanding contributions to the advancement of the Taiwan-Marshall Islands bilateral relationship. The same day, President Tsai hosted a state luncheon at the Presidential Office for the visiting delegation, at which discussions were held on bilateral cooperation and issues of mutual concern.\nThe Taiwan government in a statement said it highly values President Kabua’s visit, which further strengthens both countries’ partnership and continued cooperation, advances the well-being of the people of both countries, and deepens bilateral international engagement, showing the spirit of the two maritime nations with honor and dignity.\nTaiwan has been recognized as the Taiwan Model for its successful anti-pandemic measures. To ensure safe travel, a private jet was chartered for the RMI delegation’s direct flight to Taiwan. During their stay in Taiwan, the RMI delegation also moved in a “Diplomatic Bubble” under a set of strict pandemic preventive measures.\nTaiwan President Tsai announced Tuesday, as part of an official welcome for President David Kabua and his delegation, plans to establish the Taiwan-Marshall Islands Adaptation and Contingency Fund for Climate Change.\n“Moving forward, our countries will conduct more exchanges and cooperation on green infrastructure, disaster warning systems, and personnel training,” said Tsai. “Together, we will build a resilient system for adaptation and response.”\nIn addition, during the five-day state visit to Taiwan, the two governments are expected to complete amendments to a bilateral agricultural technical cooperation agreement.\nPresident Tsai emphasized that Taiwan will work together with the Marshall Islands to lay “a firm foundation for our nations’ sustainable development, contributing even more to global progress.”\nPresident Kabua highlighted the bond of democracy and freedom that tightly links the RMI and Taiwan. “The Republic of China (Taiwan) is an important ally and friend of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and we are proud of what we have achieved together in promoting and strengthening our shared values, democratic principles, and respect for human rights,” he said to President Tsai during their formal exchange of remarks.\nKabua said he would be presenting the Taiwan President with a “resolution by the people and government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands reiterating our appreciation for the support of the people and government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and calling on the United Nations to take immediate action to resolve the inappropriate exclusion of Taiwan’s 23.6 million people from the United Nations system.” This resolution was adopted unanimously by Nitijela a week ago Friday in anticipation of the President’s visit.\nTsai welcomed Kabua and his delegation with full military honors Tuesday morning in Taipei. The welcome ceremony was held in the plaza fronting the Presidential Office. Following a 21-gun salute, the two presents delivered their remarks. The event also included the playing of the national anthems of both countries.\nFollowing a welcome ceremony with military honors and bilateral talks, President Tsai accompanied by Vice President Lai Ching-te, conferred a a special award on President Kabua and hosted a state luncheon in honor of President and First Lady at the Presidential Office.\nIn remarks at the event, President Tsai thanked President Kabua for his tremendous efforts to advance the friendship between Taiwan and the Marshall Islands, and for his unwavering support for Taiwan’s international participation. President Tsai also expressed hope that the two countries will continue to support each other in the international community and cooperate closely on national development.\nDuring the decoration ceremony, President Tsai personally conferred the Order of Brilliant Jade with Grand Cordon upon President Kabua, and then delivered remarks. She noted that the Marshall Islands was the “first diplomatic ally in the Pacific that I visited after taking office more than five years ago.” She added that she’d been to RMI twice.\nIn his remarks, President Kabua commented on the bonds of democracy and rule of law.\n“In this day and age, when our common humanity stands at the brink of collapse, and the future is uncertain, it is incumbent on all of us to do our part to preserve, protect, and promote our shared ideals of democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law,” he said. “I believe that unless we are able to safeguard these most basic tenets, our common future cannot be assured. There is an old Marshallese adage, it goes like this ‘an piliñliñ koba komman lometo,’ which translates to ‘many drops together make a mighty ocean.’ This means that every nation, regardless of size, wealth, or standing in the world must be allowed to contribute to our common global humanity. The Republic of China (Taiwan) too must be given every opportunity to be a contributing member of the international community of nations, especially the United Nations. We reiterate our message that this shameful silence must end.”\nAmong those in attendance at the banquet were Secretary-General to the President David T.

{"question":"How does the time cycle duration compare between Minecraft and Dying Light?","answer":"In Minecraft, one full day-night cycle lasts 20 real-time minutes. In Dying Light's Normal mode, daytime lasts 3840 seconds (64 minutes) while nighttime lasts 420 seconds (7 minutes). The duration varies by difficulty in Dying Light, with Nightmare mode having double the night duration compared to Normal mode, and daytime lasting 89% as long.","context":["Virtually Jenna V.33 !EXCLUSIVE! Full Game 18-mediafire.27\nMinecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021[update] and has been ported to several platforms.\nVirtually Jenna v.33 Full Game 18-mediafire.27\nIn Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight). There is also a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.\nThe game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player). There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical issues when extremely distant locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30 million blocks from the center.[j][obsolete source] The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller sections called \"chunks\" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby. The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields; the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava. The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.\nIn survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night. The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game (except in peaceful difficulty). If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.\nThe first major update, dubbed Alpha, was released on 30 June 2010. Although Persson maintained a day job with Jalbum.net at first, he later quit in order to work on Minecraft full-time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded. Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically. These updates included new items, new blocks, new mobs, survival mode, and changes to the game's behavior (e.g. how water flows). To back the development of Minecraft, Persson set up a video game company, Mojang, with the money earned from the game. Mojang co-founders included Jakob Porser, one of Persson's coworkers from King, and Carl Manneh, jAlbum's CEO.\nMojang moved the game out of beta and released the full version on 18 November 2011. On 1 December 2011, Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten took full creative control over Minecraft, replacing Persson as lead designer. On 28 February 2012, Mojang announced that they had hired the developers of the popular \"Bukkit\" developer API for Minecraft, to improve Minecraft's support of server modifications. This acquisition also included Mojang apparently taking full ownership of the CraftBukkit server mod which enables the use of Bukkit, although the validity of this claim was questioned due to its status as an open-source project with many contributors, licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser General Public License.\nSince the first full release of Minecraft, dubbed the \"Adventure Update\", the game has been continuously updated with many major updates, available for free to users who have already purchased the game. Early updates frequently introduced gameplay-altering mechanics while more recent updates tend to enhance the game through additional content or tweaks to existing features.[better source needed] The most recent major update to the game was \"The Wild Update\", which released in June 2022 and added new creatures, biomes, and items.\nAn initial beta test was carried out between 9 June and 1 November 2016. The full game was then released on Windows 10 and MacOS on 1 November 2016. On 20 August 2018, Mojang announced that it would bring Education Edition to iPadOS in Autumn 2018. It was released to the App Store on 6 September 2018. On 27 March 2019, it was announced that it would be operated by JD.com in China. On 26 June 2020, a public beta for the Education Edition was made available to Google Play Store compatible Chromebooks. The full game was released to the Google Play Store for Chromebooks on 7 August 2020.\nAfter nearly one and a half years in beta, Microsoft fully released Minecraft for Windows on December 19, 2016. Called the \"Ender Update\", this release implemented new features to this version of Minecraft like world templates and add-on packs. This version has the ability to play with Xbox Live friends, and to play local multiplayer with owners of Minecraft on other Bedrock platforms. Other features include the ability to use multiple control schemes such as a gamepad, keyboard, or touchscreen (for Microsoft Surface and other touchscreen-enabled devices). Virtual reality support has been implemented, as well as the ability to record and take screenshots in-game via the Windows built-in GameDVR.\nAround 2011, prior to Minecraft's full release, there had been collaboration between Mojang and The Lego Group to make a Lego brick-based Minecraft game to be called Brickcraft. This would have modified the base Minecraft game to use Lego bricks, which meant adapting the basic 11 block to account for larger pieces typically used in Lego sets. Persson had worked on the preliminary version of this game, which he had named \"Project Rex Kwon Do\" based on the joke from Napoleon Dynamite. Lego had greenlit the project to go forward, and while Mojang had put two developers on the game for six months, they later opted to cancel the project, as Mojang felt that the Lego Group were too demanding on what they could do, according to Mojang's Daniel Kaplan. The Lego Group had considered buying out Mojang to complete the game, but at this point Microsoft made its offer to buy the company for over $2 billion. According to the Lego Group's Ronny Scherer, the company was not yet sure of the potential success of Minecraft at this point and backed off from acquisition after Microsoft brought this offer to Mojang.\nMinecraft is recognized as one of the first successful games to use an early access model to draw in sales prior to its full release version to help fund development. As Minecraft helped to bolster indie game development in the early 2010s, it also helped to popularize the use of the early access model in indie game development.\nIn April 2014, the Danish Geodata Agency generated all of Denmark in fullscale in Minecraft based on their own geodata. This is possible because Denmark is one of the flattest countries with the highest point at 171 metres (561 ft) (ranking as the country with the 30th smallest elevation span), where the limit in default Minecraft is around 192 metres (630 ft) above in-game sea level.\nMinecraft has also been used in educational settings. In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing Minecraft into schools. The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools. The version of Minecraft through MinecraftEdu includes unique features to allow teachers to monitor the students' progress within the virtual world, such as receiving screenshots from students to show completion of a lesson. In September 2012, MinecraftEdu said that approximately 250,000 students around the world have access to Minecraft through the company. A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects, including history, language arts and science. For an example, one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore. Another teacher created a large-scale representation of an animal cell within Minecraft that student could explore and learn how the cell functions work. Great Ormond Street Hospital has been recreated in Minecraft, and it proposed that patients can use it to virtually explore the hospital before they actually visit. Minecraft may also prove as an innovation in Computer Aided Design (CAD). Minecraft offers an outlet of collaboration in design and could have an impact on the industry.","As a namesake feature to Dying Light, Night is a time period ingame which naturally sees Harran become very dark, very quiet (regarding ambient noise, not including noises made by the infected) and given the night-only infected that come out in the open, makes all outside areas of the city (except safe zones) far more dangerous than the daytime. Night starts at 21:00 (the warning/sound effect for it starts at 20:57) and night ends at 06:00. On Normal mode, daytime lasts 3840 seconds and night lasts 420 seconds. Hard and Nightmare have modified timescales, with Nightmare's night having exactly twice the duration of Normal's, and the day lasting 89% as long (numbers are precise because they were taken from game scripts).\nAt 20:57 the initial scream will sound alerting the player to coming change to night, along with a corresponding set of screams/howls (from the night infected). Crane will raise his watch and observe it for a few seconds until the onscreen message \"Night is Coming\" announces the official changeover. On various nights, the sound effect of the Night Hunter's howl might also occur whilst on other nights the Night Hunter won't howl at all during the \"Night is Coming\" phase. You earn survivor points based on how long you remain outside of safe zones during night-time. Staying outside of them all night can award you up to and around 10000 survivor points, if you stay out all night and survive until dawn. After night ends, you will be awarded the \"Unnoticed\" or \"Explorer\" rank based on whether or not you were seen and pursued during the night (Unseen and seen respectively), or \"Runner\" if one spent most of the night being pursued. Being in an indoor area (such as a Quarantine Zone) does not actively count as night-time in most circumstances (even if not in a safe zone), and so you will typically be greeted with day-time infected instead, including virals instead of volatiles. Time will also tick by at daytime speed while indoors.\nAt night the biters and infected in general become more aggressive than during the day. At night, different enemies also appear such as:\n- Volatiles - A type of infected with extreme speed, strength, high amounts of health and aggression; These are far more lethal and deadly than other types of infected, including Demolishers and Goons. Any attack on a Volatile immediately results in a Pursuit (calling more and more of them to come investigate/attack). On Nightmare difficulty, a good swat from a Volatile can do roughly 120 damage, and they have the equivalent of thousands of health, meaning inexperienced or low-level players should avoid them at all costs.\n- Night Walkers - Initially similar to the Biters in appearance and function, the Night Walkers are effectively Biters until they change into Night Walkers with a rather violent and noisy transformation (during which they must be immediately killed to avoid a Pursuit). Passing by Biters in a Pursuit increases the chances of a transformation, and transformed Night Walkers can start a Pursuit (calling in Volatiles and more Night Walkers). They have the same cone of vision as Volatiles do, but are only roughly as dangerous as Virals by themselves... though their speed and agility roughly matches that of the player, and are much harder to outrun than their Viral counterparts.\n- Bolters - Bolters are the only targetable enemy type in game that have no hostile actions or aggression towards the player. As the name implies, they bolt/run away from the player upon seeing them. They come out at night mainly to feed on corpses (marked as Bolter Feeding Grounds on the map) and remain stationary and unaware for the duration of the night. They have the same cone of sight as most enemies, and are best carefully approached from behind and killed in one hit to avoid the fleeing altogether. Hunting them down and scavenging their tissue can be very profitable when sold to traders... though their feeding grounds are guarded and patrolled by the Volatiles and alerting a Bolter will automatically engage a pursuit from the nearby Volatiles.\n- Night Hunter - As a player-controlled infected encountered as part of Be The Zombie (when playing as the Night Hunter) as well as during game invasions (when playing as humans), this is almost an entirely different entity altogether. This has speed, lethality and somewhat comparable (albeit enhanced) characteristics to the Volatiles, but has various abilities and skills available for the player-controlled infected to use in their goal to eliminate all humans/drain the humans' lives before all the Volatile nests are destroyed. This can technically appear during various parts of the day - Depending on what settings that human players have in their games' settings providing that Hunter invasions are enabled, Hunters can invade the game during the daytime (albeit Night will come very fast/the clock and sun's time to set will progress extremely fast from whatever time of day it is to nightfall) or only when players are approaching/at the time of sunset in their games. It is also worth noting that as long as the invasion session is active/is not finished, the game will be stuck at night time and will only progress to daytime once the invasion ends.\nAs a general pointer, it's best to avoid any infected at night (even regular Biters, as they can change suddenly into Night Walkers and start a Pursuit). Try to use your flashlight rationally during night-time, but don't leave yourself blind out of fear that something will see your light. It can make you visible from slightly further away than usual, encouraging volatiles to investigate, but the effect is very slight, and the main methods of detection for all zombies remains cone of sight/player movement. Taken from the scripting, the only things that can even sense a flashlight or react to it is Volatiles, and experience (from always having a light on, even during the day) says it doesn't really matter. It's entirely possible to sneak up on volatiles with a flashlight on and get into melee range before they notice... so they will generally only detect the player's flashlight if they would have seen the player anyway (though possibly from a few meters further away). It only matters if you absolutely must remain undetected, and even then being nearly blind yourself may be more likely to get you detected, so mileage may vary. The best applicable use of it is when you're uncertain of what's ahead of you or while performing parkour and looking to see what objects you can climb on or over. If you need to track volatiles, use Survivor Sense instead of your flashlight. This will mark even further away ones temporarily, so you can use it to keep an eye on volatiles you can't see directly, if necessary (even through walls, Sense also marks Night Walkers and Virals).\nAt night killing any infected does earn players double points for the combat skill tree, whilst running/doing parkour at night earns double points for the agility skill tree. The overall risks of dying and sustaining damage are increased given the dangerous nature of night-time, but players will not lose double points/overall points gained during the night outside of safe zones if they die/are killed at night-time (on normal difficulty). If one is in an area where many corners can be turned and objects quickly leapt over, intentionally causing Pursuits and outrunning Volatiles can give thousands of extra agility experience per Pursuit (depends on the duration and \"level of Pursuit\"/number of nasties chasing you). This is on top of the doubled experience from the parkour itself.\nAt night, the nature of gameplay changes mainly from the fact that the feature of Pursuits are in effect as Pursuits can only happen at night.\nAs mentioned above, infected such as Volatiles and Night Walkers have a cone of vision (similar to how enemies' cone of vision works in the Metal Gear Solid series) of which players must avoid - On Nightmare difficulty the cones will be invisible to see and thus players will not know whenever they are at risk/close to being spotted by the night infected. Goons and toads still appear during the night, and they will have a much larger cone of vision (As well as any Virals that were active before night time initiated) than volatiles and night walkers, but the cone will be invisible. Being seen by them will also not initiate a pursuit, nor will they alert volatiles or night walkers to your position. However they will still attack you if given the chance. Be careful if you choose to fight them, as any nearby volatiles or night walkers may be drawn to the fight, possibly resulting in additional headaches showing up after intending to only eliminate a single threat. As a result, it's usually best to avoid or ignore them, unless you're ready for a fight, or they are alone.\nPursuits by definition are where players are chased/pursued by the night infected (Volatiles and Night Walkers). Pursuits can be triggered by one of several ways - One is being spotted for long enough/for the alert meter that Volatiles and Night Walkers have to be full and start chasing after the player(s). The other is to attack a Volatile/Night Walker or kill a Bolter (killing a Bolter will always initiate pursuits regardless of the method used or whatever skills the players involved may have). If attempting to kill a bolter, try to do it from a distance (Such as a rooftop) with a ranged weapon, so volatiles have to move further to reach you, giving you more of a chance to escape them.\nPursuits can also be evaded by one of two ways. The most common means of players to evade the pursuit is to get into a safe zone such as The Tower as the safe zones will have UV light systems on their entrances/around the perimeter which prevents the Volatiles and Night Walkers from getting in/pursuing the player(s) any further. The other method is to break line of sight with the pursuing infected for a long enough period of time of which they eventually give up the pursuit - This is slightly more difficult as the higher the levels of pursuits are, the infected will be far more persistent and unrelenting in their chase after you. After breaking line of sight for long enough, volatiles and night walkers will continue to search the immediate area. Their cones of vision will reappear on the map (Outside of Nightmare difficulty), but will have slightly extended range. Upon successfully evading a pursuit, the cones of vision will return to normal size, and you will be awarded agility points based on how long the pursuit was maintained.\nPursuits at night have various levels, from level 1 to level 4 - Indicated by the amount of vertical red pulsing markers on the left hand side of the minimap, as a visual indicator of how severe the level of infected are in their aggression and persistence in chasing their target(s). Some of these are fixed at points of quests i.e. in Extraction, the pursuit in the tunnel of Volatiles will instantly go to level 4, your first introduction to night-time mechanics starts you off at a level 2 pursuit, etc.\nIf being pursued by the night infected, shine your UV light at them or use UV flares - They only come out/come into effect at night for a reason. Night infected will also be easy to kill if led toward traps (bar Bolters as they will avoid traps as a whole). Technically, pursuits can also be evaded upon the ingame clock reaching 06:00, as all night infected will immediately stop chasing the player and either cower from the sunlight (Night Walkers) or will become terrified and run towards the nearest Dark Area (Volatiles).\nPointers for Surviving The Night\n- Safe Zones often have a resting place/sleeping bag as an option to skip through the night and go to daytime instead (often just after 07:00 instead of just at sunrise which would be at 06:00).\n- If at any time at night you are caught/pursued by the biters, volatiles, night hunters, use these tips: Shine your UV light and throw flares down to use as portable safe zones - Do be quick in getting to a safe zone/evading the infected as the UV light and flares will not be a permanent solution to the scenario, and sometimes volatiles may still be tempted to pounce on you, even while you're in the UV light.\n- Having the Vault skill can improve your odds during a pursuit, as occasionally your way forward may be blocked off by something even as minor as a biter, that can allow your pursuers to catch up with you. Being able to jump off of that biter can allow you to maintain your flow unhindered. You can also vault off of volatiles and night walkers, if necessary. However, this is obviously more riskier, and volatiles are most likely to attempt to jump if you attempt this on them, unless you blind them with the UV flashlight first.\n- Firecrackers, while dubious, could divert your pursuers if used at the right moment, such as being thrown down one path of a junction while taking another, provided you have broken line of sight with them when doing so. This could effectively throw them off your trail and give you a chance to escape, provided you are not seen again.\n- Make use of traps as these can be very useful especially if making use of traps unlocked at higher levels. Traps can in a pinch mean the difference between being caught and killed by the infected and evading (as well as possibly getting some easy kills via the traps).\n- A well-timed block with an elemental shield can immobilize an attacking volatile, giving you a chance to either punish with heavy attacks or escape.\n- Pay attention to the mini map; the mini map it will display where the volatiles and Night Walkers are, also showing their cone of vision unless playing on Nightmare difficulty. If they haven't spotted you/started seeing you, this does allow for sneaking/stealthily going past them instead of engaging in combat and most likely resulting in death - Unless using really powerful weapons, volatiles will not go down easily, and even combating just one can prove extremely difficult for a full team of 4 players, if they are woefully under-equipped.\n- The weather in Harran tends to get very stormy during the night. As a result, it's a good idea to have some electrically-charged weapons prepared in advance for the night, as they have significantly more efficiency when used in the rain, allowing you to whittle away hordes of biters, the occasional night walker, or even a volatile with a strong enough weapon.\n- If your character's combat level is higher/is far more able in combatting Volatiles, then it's recommended to take advantage and engage in combat with them - Try to be careful as being too reckless could result in you being overwhelmed.\n- Going out at night for newer players can be a very daunting experience - Wait until you're levelled up and are more confident in terms of agility (for evasive purposes) as well as combat (for dealing serious damage to Volatiles and quickly dispatching of Night Walkers).\n- Although the tutorial warning that making noise attracts virals can trigger at night, no virals will show up if you make noise. However, you can still attract the attention of volatiles from making loud noises."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5c6482af-4253-443b-8af1-2acd9a0874ad>","<urn:uuid:687354a0-edd3-4a72-8fb4-77a99e79b034>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the main goal of the Strategic Framework (2018-2030) regarding drought management?","answer":"The Strategic Framework aims to mitigate, adapt to, and manage the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems. This is one of the framework's five strategic objectives.","context":["Drought is a worldwide threat to food and water security and is a constant presence in all Central Asian countries. Past droughts revealed the gaps and limitations in drought management in the region and drought impacts are further aggravated by the scarcity and uneven distribution of water resources in most parts of Central Asia. It is also revealed that drought management need is further heightened by any analysis of future climate conditions in the region which, based on regional climate simulations, highlighted the likely future increases in temperatures, decreases in rainfall and increases in extreme events, particularly drought.\nCurrently, the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC) Program in partnership with the UNCCD is implementing a project to develop regional approaches for combating drought and sand and dust storms. The need for drought monitoring and early warning systems to support drought management efforts has been identified. During the first virtual workshop held in July 2020, local stakeholders, local and international experts including UNCCD, UNEP, UNDRR, FAO, CAREC and ICBA, highlighted the need for strengthening national knowledge and capacity on drought and sand and dust storms related events, understanding the vulnerability indicators, use of monitoring and forecasting tool to ensure long term strategic planning, that will be beneficial across borders.\nThrough the new Strategic Framework (2018-2030), the UNCCD is increasing its attention to drought. One out of the five strategic objectives of the framework are focusing on drought with the aim to “mitigate, adapt to, and manage the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems”. This prioritization was confirmed in the COP 13 (2017) decision. COP13 guided the process of developing national drought plans and drought preparedness systems, promoted the use of the UNCCD drought resilience, adaptation and management policy (DRAMP) framework that aims to reduce drought risk and increase resilience, and most importantly the COP requested the secretariat to implement a drought initiative (Decision 29/COP.13).\nFollowing the endorsement of the Advocacy Policy Framework, UNCCD Secretariat launched the Regional Pilot Project in CA aimed at developing and implementing the Drought and SDS risk reduction strategies at national and regional levels utilizing the methodological frameworks and tools developed by the UNCCD Secretariat. The Pilot Project will be implemented during the 2020 – 2021 in five CA countries under the supervision of the UNCCD Secretariat, in close collaboration with UNCCD National Focal Points and management of Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC).\nIn January 2021, CAREC jointly with UNCCD and ICBA initiated a thematic discussion meeting with UNCCD National Focal Points, drought and climate experts from the region of Central Asia and HydroMet services representatives from each Central Asia country, to discuss drought monitoring and forecasting systems for the region. During this virtual meeting, ICBA presented a prototype of a drought monitoring system and the methodology to develop an early warning system for the Central Asian countries. An interest and specific requests from participants and countries for this system were voiced. The requests were diverse, both in terms of complexity and in terms of sectors of the economy they intend to cover. The participants noted that the system is of interest to them and that it should be tested and adapted to the realities of Central Asian countries.\nThe Drought Monitoring and Early Warning System (DMEWS) will monitor and predict regional drought conditions, assist officials who are charged with relief efforts by providing “value-added” information during drought events. A critical part of this project’s mission is to provide training and capacity development throughout the region in the operation of monitoring and early warning, developing communications and delivery technology, and conducting stakeholder engagement activities.\nThis project will partner with and build on previous and on-going efforts in the region including the current project on regional approaches for combating drought and sand and dust storms. The outcome will be a unique capability for regional drought management, providing effective, collaborative, science-based programs for developing a unified regional platform for drought monitoring and early warning to support policy and preparedness.\nPurpose of the Consultancy:\nThe purpose of this assignment is to carry out a drought impact assessment and identify stakeholders need in terms of drought monitoring and early warning and develop a full proposal document to be presented to potential donors.\nEnvisioned Tasks under this assignment include:\nMilestone 1: Supervision of national consultants (20 days)\n- Jointly with CAREC and ICBA prepare ToR for national consultants to assist in achieving the Milestone 2 of this Consultancy;\n- Supervise the national consultants in their tasks of data collection;\n- Assess and approve submitted reports;\n- Synthesis the data collected in accordance with tasks under milestones 2 and 3.\nMilestone 2: Past droughts characteristics and their impacts (10 days)\n- Assemble and share previous projects reports on drought in the countries using meteorological and other primary data.\n- Undertake literature review on drought history (occurrence, severity, duration, extent) at the regional, national and sub-national/river basin/water utility levels (Departments).\n- Assemble and share primary and secondary data and write synthesis report on the impacts of past droughts on water supply systems at the national and/or river basin/water utility level including details of the effects on people and the economy.\n- Assemble and share primary and secondary data and write synthesis report on the impacts of past droughts on rainfed agricultural systems and agro-pastoralism systems at the national and/or more local level including details on the effects of droughts on people and the economy.\nMilestone 3: Needs assessment, stakeholders’ engagement, and proposal development (60 days)\n- Coordinate with the national consultants the organization of meetings with local partners and key stakeholders involved in drought management (including ministries of agriculture and water) in each of the 5 countries to identify their needs in terms of drought monitoring and early warning systems and write a synthesis report on the matter.\n- In partnership with ICBA and CAREC, write a comprehensive methodology to validate the drought monitoring prototype and to develop an early warning system for Central Asia.

{"question":"Do emotional reactions or self-esteem have a stronger correlation with long-term commitment?","answer":"Based on the research findings, emotional reactions show a stronger correlation with long-term commitment than self-esteem. Studies involving over 20,000 participants demonstrated that attitudes based on emotional reactions were particularly long-lasting, while self-esteem showed only a modest correlation of .21 with volunteerism, which is a form of long-term commitment.","context":["Summary: Researchers have found that emotionality—the degree to which an attitude is based on feelings and emotions—can create enduring opinions, shedding new light on the factors that make attitudes last.\nDepending on the topic, people’s attitudes can change from moment to moment or last a lifetime. The factors that make one opinion long-lasting and another ephemeral, however, are not always clear.\nPast studies have demonstrated that opinions based on hard facts and data can remain constant over time, but new research published in the journal Psychological Science reveals that attitudes based on feelings and emotions can also stand the test of time. This research has implications for both predicting whose attitudes are fixed versus fleeting and how to nudge people to form more long-lasting opinions.\n“We have known that encouraging people to think carefully and rationally can produce attitudes that change less in the future,” said Matthew Rocklage, a researcher with the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and co-lead author on the paper. “Our research, however, shows that opinions based on people’s emotional reactions can be particularly long-lasting as well.”\nAs part of their study, the researchers asked more than 1,000 people to what extent they believed attitudes based on feelings or emotional reactions were more stable over time than those based on thinking and rational analysis. Only 15% expressed any belief that attitudes based on emotion would be more stable over time.\nTo test the role that emotion plays in forming long-lasting attitudes, the researchers conducted seven independent studies involving more than 20,000 participants in a variety of real-world situations.\nEmotionality is an unappreciated predictor of long-lasting attitudes.”A. Luttrell, Ball State University\nThe first survey, which was conducted the day after Christmas, measured feelings about recently received gifts. The timing of this survey allowed the researchers to measure real-world reactions to a relatively newly formed attitude.\nThe participants were given a list of adjectives to describe their attitudes toward their gifts. Adjectives like “worthwhile” were associated with a practical reaction to the gift, whereas words like “delightful” were more strongly associated with an emotional reaction.\nOne month later, the participants completed a follow-up survey to test the endurance of their opinions. The results showed that the stronger the initial positive emotional reaction, the more likely that opinion remained fixed one month later.\nThe researchers conducted similar tests using virtually the same procedure but involving other scenarios, such as how much the participants supported consumer brands over time and how favorable their online restaurant reviews were between visits.\nIn the final test, participants read one of two messages about a fictitious aquatic animal. One message contained encyclopedic facts about the animal (low-emotion condition). The other message was about a swimmer’s underwater interaction with the animal (high-emotion condition). The participants in the high-emotion condition showed significantly less change in their attitude across time.\n“Emotionality is an unappreciated predictor of long-lasting attitudes,” said Andrew Luttrell, a researcher at Ball State University and the other lead author on the paper. “These findings are important for understanding why some opinions are so difficult to change as well as how to create opinions that stick.”\n# # #\nPsychological Science, the flagship journal of APS, is the leading peer-reviewed journal publishing empirical research spanning the entire spectrum of the science of psychology.

A cross-sectional survey design was adopted for the study. Employees in the health industry in Lagos State, Nigeria constitute the population of this study. A total of 250 clinicians across state hospitals, in Lagos, Nigeria were sampled using accidental sampling technique. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale was used to measure self-esteem, Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS) developed by Salovey, Mayer, Goleman, Turvey and Palfai (1995) and volunteerism was measured using Volunteerism questionnaire developed by Clary and Snyder, (1999). In order to determine the extent and direction of associations among the study variables, Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC) analysis was conducted. The result show that self-esteem have a significant relationship with volunteerism [r (250) = .21; p > 0.05]. Emotional intelligence showed significant positive relationship with volunteerism [r (250) = .32; p < 0.01]. Findings of the study have some direct practical implications for management and boards of directors in ministries of health in government owned hospitals in Nigeria and Africa. Based on the findings of this study, the researcher recommended that colleges of medicine and various schools of Nursing under the Ministry of Health should take adequate steps to encourage volunteerism among clinicians in Nigeria. In other words, clinicians who work in healthcare environments in Nigeria should be encouraged to enroll in volunteer programmes.\nKeywords: Self-Esteem, Emotional Intelligence and Volunteerism\nAlavi HR, Askaripur MR (2003).

{"question":"Does compensation for retaliation differ between NSW and California law?","answer":"Yes, compensation frameworks differ between the jurisdictions. Under NSW's PID Act, compensation covers losses from detrimental action including injury, damage, loss, intimidation, harassment, employment discrimination, dismissal, and disciplinary proceedings, though it's unclear if damages are capped by the Civil Liability Act 2002. In California, workplace retaliation compensation typically includes damages for emotional distress (including physical pain, loss of enjoyment of life, anxiety), harm to professional reputation, and lost wages from retaliatory actions like demotion or denial of promotion. California's False Claims Act specifically provides for two times the amount of back pay plus interest, special damages, and possible punitive damages.","context":["To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\nIn 1994, the NSW Government introduced the Public Interest\nDisclosures Act 1994 (“PID Act”) to offer protection\nto whistleblowers who disclose evidence of corrupt conduct or\nmaladministration by a public authority or its officers. The PID\nAct not only declares it illegal to take detrimental action against\na whistleblower for making the disclosure, but it also provides\ncompensation for any loss suffered by the whistleblower if they do\nexperience retaliation. This article explains the compensation\navailable to whistleblowers in New South Wales.\nWhat is a Public Interest Disclosure?\nA Public Interest Disclosure is the disclosure of information\nrelating to a public authority including:\n- Corrupt conduct: Any conduct that seeks to\nadversely affect the honest or impartial exercise of official\nfunctions by any public official or public authority or any conduct\nwhich involves a breach of public trust.\n- Maladministration: action or inaction of a\nserious nature that is— contrary to law, or unreasonable,\nunjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory, or based wholly or\npartly on improper motives.\n- Serious and substantial waste of government\n- Government information contravention: conduct\nthat amounts to a failure to exercise functions under the\nGovernment Information (Public Access) Act 2009.\n- Local government pecuniary interest\ncontravention: the breach of an obligation imposed by the\nLocal Government Act 1993 in connection with a financial\nUnder the PID Act, a disclosure made by a person in relation to\nthe above conduct will only be treated as a Public Interest\nDisclosure and thereby receive protection under this Act if the\ndisclosure is made to a specific authority by a certain class of\nMaking a valid public interest disclosure\nWho can make a public interest disclosure?\nTo be protected by the PID Act, the disclosure must be made by a\nA “public official” is defined as an individual who is\nan employee of or otherwise in the service of a public authority\nsuch as a public service agency, local government authority or the\nThe public official making the disclosure, must honestly believe\non reasonable grounds that the information they seek to disclose\nshows or tends to show, that another public official or public\nauthority has engaged, is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the\nA disclosure will be protected under the PID Act regardless of\nwhether the person who made the disclosure is still a public\nTo whom must the public interest disclosure be\nFor a public interest disclosure to be valid, the public\nofficial must make the disclosure to an investigating authority,\nthe principal officer of a public authority or to a member of\nParliament. A disclosure may also be made to an officer of a public\nauthority or investigating authority to which the public official\nbelongs to, or alternatively, the relevant authority to which the\ndisclosure relates to. In this situation, the disclosure must be\nmade in accordance with any procedure established by the relevant\nauthority reporting allegations of public concern.\nAn “investigating authority” includes the Independent\nCommission Against Corruption (ICAC), the NSW Ombudsman, the\nInformation Commissioner, the New South Wales Crime Commission, the\nlocal government investigating authority and the Law Enforcement\nWhat is not a valid public interest\nA public interest disclosure that is made largely for the\npurpose of avoiding disciplinary action (not being disciplinary\naction taken in reprisal for the making of a public interest\ndisclosure) will not be protected by the PID Act.\nSimilarly, a disclosure made by a public official that\nprincipally involves questioning the merits of government policy\nwill not be protected.\nProtection of misdirected disclosures\nIf a public official makes a disclosure to the wrong\ninvestigating authority, that disclosure will be protected under\nthe PID Act, if the public official honestly believed that they had\nmade their disclosure to the appropriate investigating authority to\ndeal with the matter and provided:\n- the investigating authority refers the disclosure to another\ninvestigating authority or to a public official or public\n- the investigating authority could have referred the disclosure\nbut did not do so because it has power to investigate the matter\nconcerned under the relevant investigation Act.\nCompensation for detrimental action taken against\nUnder the PID Act, it is an offence to take detrimental action\nagainst another person in retaliation for that person making a\npublic interest disclosure.

While employees are protected against wrongful termination in a variety of circumstances, employees who do not lose their jobs--but instead experience adverse employment actions, abuse or other forms of retaliation at work--have a harder time finding legal remedies.\nBut the workplace retaliation provisions of California's whistleblower laws and Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\") retaliation laws provide a legal remedy for employees whose employers retaliate against them--but do not fire them--for exercising their rights under these laws.\nBelow, our California labor law attorneys discuss the following topics:\n- 1. How to Tell If Your Employer is Engaging in Workplace Retaliation\n- 2. Employer Retaliation for Whistleblowing / Reporting a Violation of Law\n- 3. FEHA Workplace Retaliation\n- 4. False Claims Act (Qui Tam) Workplace Retaliation\n- 5. Lawsuits and Damages for California Workplace Retaliation\nIf you have further questions after reading this article, we invite you to contact us at Shouse Law Group.\nThe basic legal definition of workplace retaliation in California is:\n- Your employer takes an adverse employment action against you or treats you in a discriminatory manner,\n- Because you engaged in a protected activity.\nWhen the adverse employment action is a termination (job loss), then it is easy to identify this as a case of potential wrongful termination.\nSimilarly, if your employer responds to the exercise of your legal rights by making your working conditions so intolerable that you have no choice but to resign, then you have a case against the employer for wrongful constructive termination.\nBut other forms of employer retaliation can be more subtle--and harder to spot. Some telltale signs that your employer might be retaliating against you include:\n- You begin receiving negative performance reviews even though your previous reviews were positive;\n- Your workload is increased;\n- You are assigned to less desirable shifts;\n- Your supervisors exclude you from meetings or correspondence or otherwise make it difficult for you to perform well on your projects;\n- You are denied a promotion or raise that you think you deserved;\n- You are subject to disciplinary action on trumped-up charges or inadequate grounds; and\n- You are denied access to resources or training that would help you maintain your work quality or advance your career.\nUnder California Labor Code 1102.5 LC, employers may not engage in retaliation against employees who\n- report suspected criminal activity by their employer to a government or law enforcement agency,\n- report a suspected violation of a law or regulation to a supervisor or other person at the employer who has the authority to investigate the violation, or\n- provide information to or testify before any government body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into a potential violation of law by their employer.5\nLC 1102.5 is a so-called \"whistleblower protection\" law. A whistleblower protection law generally protects employees from both firing/termination AND less severe forms of employer retaliation for reporting suspected legal violations by their employer.\nYou are protected by this whistleblower retaliation law even if it turns out that your employer did not actually break the law. All that matters is that you reasonably believed that your employer may have done something illegal.6\nExample: Nikolai works for a software company. Based on some conversations he has overheard, he believes that his company may be engaging in violations of antitrust laws with another similar company. Nikolai reports his suspicions to an in-house lawyer at the company.\nThe lawyer investigates the report and determines that nothing illegal is going on. But she also lets the CEO of the company know that Nikolai was the one who reported his suspicions to her.\nAfter that, Nikolai is not given assignments on important projects at work. His performance reviews also suddenly turn negative. He is passed over for a promotion that he had previously been told he could get.\nNikolai may be the victim of workplace retaliation for his whistleblowing activities.\nThe California Fair Employment and Housing Act (the \"FEHA\") protects employees from retaliation if they do any of the following:\n- Oppose acts of harassment or employment discrimination or an employer's failure to grant required pregnancy/family leave;\n- File a complaint about harassment or discrimination;\n- Testify or assist in any proceeding under the FEHA; or\n- Request workplace accommodations for their religious beliefs or observance or for a disability.7\nFEHA retaliation under California employment law occurs when any of the above activities by an employee is a substantial motivating factor for adverse employment actions against, or discriminatory treatment of, that employee.8\nExample: Robia is a Muslim. She gets a job at a call center working long shifts.\nRobia's religious beliefs require her to take regular breaks to pray over the course of the day. She asks her boss if she can take these breaks and use a supply closet for her prayers.\nRobia's boss agrees because he does not want to be accused of religious discrimination. But he is not happy about the inconvenience this causes. So he begins assigning Robia to less desirable night and weekend shifts, and he does not allow her to attend several trainings that could have helped her rise in the company.\nRobia's boss is guilty of workplace retaliation under the FEHA.\nThe California False Claims Act also prohibits employer retaliation against employees who take advantage of their rights under that law.\nThe California False Claims Act gives employees the right to file a so-called \"qui tam\" lawsuit against an employer who is committing fraud, theft or embezzlement with respect to government funds. (A \"qui tam\" lawsuit is a suit filed by a private citizen on behalf of a government entity.)9\nThe workplace retaliation provisions of the California False Claims Act prohibit your employer from retaliating against you if you\n- file, or assist in any way with, a qui tam suit, or\n- make an effort to stop a violation of the California False Claims Act.10\nExample: Ted is a manager for a construction company that does a lot of work under state government contracts. He suspects that his company has been overbilling the government. So he files a qui tam suit in state court. The California Attorney General's office then takes over the lawsuit.\nTed's boss understands that it would be illegal to fire him over the qui tam suit and that it would probably make the company look bad in the lawsuit. But the boss demotes Ted instead.\nTed probably has a case against his employer for California False Claims Act workplace retaliation.\nDifferent California workplace retaliation laws offer different options for employees who are retaliated against by their employer.\nLabor Code 1102.5 LC\nIf you think you have been a victim of whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code 1102.5 LC, you must first notify the California Labor and Workplace Development Agency through an online form and your employer via certified mail.11\nAfter you file this notice, the Labor and Workplace Development Agency may decide to investigate your complaint itself. If it chooses not to do so, you may file your own lawsuit in California Superior Court.12\nFEHA workplace retaliation\nIf your employer retaliates against you for exercising your rights under the Fair Employment and Housing Act, then your first move is to file a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).\nYou may then sue your employer for workplace retaliation once the DFEH issues a \"right to sue\" notice.13\nCalifornia False Claims Act workplace retaliation\nYou may file a lawsuit against your employer immediately if you are a victim of workplace retaliation under the California False Claims Act.14\nDamages for workplace retaliation\nDamages in a workplace retaliation case will be somewhat different than damages in a California wrongful termination case. This is because wrongful termination damages typically include the value of lost pay and benefits attributable to the loss of the plaintiff's job.\nIn a workplace retaliation case, though, damages are more likely to include:\n- Damages for emotional distress arising from your mistreatment at work--including physical pain, loss of enjoyment of life and/or anxiety;\n- Damages for harm done to your professional reputation as a result of retaliatory adverse employment actions (such as demotion, being denied a promotion or being denied professional development or work opportunities); and/or\n- Lost wages from a retaliatory demotion or denial of a promotion or raise.15\nCall us for help...\nFor questions about California law on workplace retaliation or to discuss your case confidentially with one of our skilled California labor and employment attorneys, do not hesitate to contact us at Shouse Law Group.\nWe have local employment law offices in and around Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, San Jose, Oakland, the San Francisco Bay area, and several nearby cities.\n- Labor Code 1102.5 LC -- Employer or person acting on behalf of employer; prohibition of disclosure of information by employee to government or law enforcement agency; suspected violation or noncompliance to federal or state law; retaliation; civil penalties [whistleblower workplace retaliation].

{"question":"Please tell me what type of fishing line is best for catching snook versus bonefish?","answer":"For snook, Power Pro braided line is preferred, while monofilament line is better for bonefish. This distinction in line choice helps optimize fishing success for these different species.","context":["Fly Fishing and Light Tackle\nMy fishing method of choice has almost always been the fly rod... but years of experience as a fishing guide and angler has taught me that the fly rod is not always the right tool for the job. Often, weather conditions, the species of fish and geography may call for using spin or plug tackle.\nFor example, many of the places that I guide in the Everglades are small bays connected by narrow creeks... too tight for a back cast or even a roll cast, but the fish are there. The challenge and skill level required for making a great presentation to a fish with plug or spin tackle is no less demanding or fun.\nAt the risk of not being considered a \"purist,\" by some of those who think they are, I would encourage anyone to become the \"complete\" angler by mastering all the different methods of casting, whether it's fly fishing, spin, or plug tackle.\nYour guides knowledge, experience and willingness to travel and fish different areas will lead to greater success on all target species throughout our fishery. I believe that fishing should be fun regardless of the method you choose. In my opinion, you and your your fishing guides willingness to do whatever it takes to make the most of the fishing conditions is the key to success. Selection of flies, artificial's and baits, presentation, know-how and a little luck, all lead to the mastery and enjoyment of the sport.\nThere's no accurate way to predict or guess the \"best\" time of the year to target a particular species of game fish. There are however, higher percentage months or \"seasons\" for most. Weather, migratory patterns, feeding & spawning habits and environmental impact all play roles in the game fishes predictability. Expect the unexpected; sometimes the best fishing of the year is unexpected, such as a warm up in January, providing great tarpon fishing.\nFishing locations throughout South Florida will have different populations of fish throughout the year; most fishing guides would agree that there is no accurate way to predict these subtleties. For example, tarpon fishing in January and February can be the best of the year... but weather dependent and not the \"sure thing\" like May or June. It pays to be flexible; letting the following conditions dictate the best game plan such as water temperatures, air temperature, tides/moon, wind velocity/direction, current and time of year. One my customers reminded me last year when we had a significant 'later than usual' cold front... he said \"You can plan your fishing but you can't plan the conditions.\"\n- 8 weight with floating line, for almost all conditions on the flats.\n- 9 weight with floating, clear floating, best all around on the flats for all fly fishing conditions, capable of delivering slightly larger flies to snook, small tarpon, and permit.\n- 10 weight with floating, clear floating and additional \"clear sink tip\" line, for fly tarpon fishing. This rod will also come in handy on really windy days, delivering the fly to snook, bones and permit.\n- 11 weight with floating, clear floating and additional clear sink tip, best all around tool for big tarpon.12 weight is optional but great to have that windy day, for a little more punch, with a floater, sink tip, and especially with an intermediate line.\nLight Tackle - Spin and Plug\n- 6' to 7' rods with 10 to 12 LB test is just right for most of our species. Saltwater style reels such as the Shimano Calcutta are ideal... they have great drags and are corrosion resistance vs. most plug reels designed for fresh water fishing.\n- Most of the time, whether you're fishing for bonefish, permit, redfish or snook, a 7' 10 LB test outfit will be just right for the job. Fresh line and quality reels with superior drags are important. I prefer using monofilament for bonefish, permit and redfish and Power Pro braided line for snook.\nTo Have or Have Not\n- If you're fishing with a guide, most Florida Keys fishing guides that specialize in fly and light tackle will have high quality fly spin and plug outfits available for your use. This makes it easy if you want to travel light without your all your own gear. But don't leave home without your hat, rain gear, sunscreen and polarized sunglasses.\nGetting Better all the Time\nA good article written by my friend and experienced angler - John Sieffer\nIn my career I'm constantly reminded by my colleagues that we always need to be getting better. Even more so, if possible, we should be helping others \"get better\". So, after my most recent fishing trip, I'm trying to figure out...how can I get better? Clearly, I have been drinking the corporate kool-aid and I'm sure you're thinking \"can't we just have fun when we're fishing\"? And, I guess my question is wouldn't getting better make fishing more fun? So, how do I get better?\nFirst, I realized that I need to practice more, especially with a spinning rod! Over the years I've had this mentality that all I've wanted to do is fly fish. And, sometimes fly fishing is impossible whether because of wind or because of where you are fishing; like the Everglades where on many occasions casting a fly is impossible because there is no room. So, why not cast a spinning rod into the super narrow creek and see what happens. For me, easier said than done and that is why I have to practice to get better, especially with a spinning rod!\nSecond, I realized that I have to try to fish faster. I'll try to explain. On many ocassions I'll wait too long to make a cast. Either because I'm not sure the fish I see is a fish or I'll wait for a better position and a better cast. I think that if I fished \"faster\" or more reactive, I'd be better.\nThird, when it comes specifically to fly fishing, I take WAY too many false casts. The time it takes to get the fly from my hand to the fish is usually one back cast too long. For me, there is only one reason for the extra back cast, accuracy. But, more times than not, I would be just as accurate with one fewer back cast. I suppose too many back casts is mostly mental, but nothing a little practice woudn't fix.\nSo, how do we getter better? Practice! Practice! Practice! I'll steal the quote from ESPN's American Hunter, \"shoot more and shoot more often\". I'll fish more and fish more often."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b6c66d1e-b9f3-4830-910c-c1817d045675>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between GSQL's SumAccum and Neo4j's PageRank in terms of their functionality and use cases?","answer":"GSQL's SumAccum and Neo4j's PageRank serve different purposes in graph analytics. SumAccum is a basic accumulator type that allows adding integer values to its internal state variable, producing a simple sum of accumulated values. In contrast, PageRank is a more complex algorithm that estimates a node's importance by analyzing its linked neighbors and their neighbors recursively. PageRank derives a node's rank based on the number and quality of its transitive links to estimate influence. While SumAccum is used for basic numerical aggregation, PageRank has broader applications like suggesting Twitter accounts to follow, conducting sentiment analysis, and even analyzing species extinction impact in biological food webs.","context":["23 Jul Accumulator 101\nOriginally featured on DZone\nGSQLÂ is a Turing complete Graph Database query language. Compared to other graph query languages, the biggest advantage is its support of Accumulators â€” global or attachable to each vertex.\nIn addition to providing the classicÂ pattern matchÂ syntax, which is easy to master, GSQL supports powerful run-time vertex attributes (a.k.a local accumulators) and global state variables (a.k.a global accumulators). I have seen users learning and adopting pattern match syntax within ten minutes. However, I also witnessed theÂ uneasinessÂ of learning and adopting accumulators for beginners.\nThis short tutorial aims to shorten the learning curve of accumulator. Supposedly, after reading this article, everyone can master theÂ essenceÂ of accumulator by heart, and start solving real-life graph problems with this handy language feature.\nWhat Is Accumulator?\nFigure 1. The left box is a GSQL query with different accumulators being accumulated. The right box shows the accumulator variables’ final results.\nAccumulator is a state variable in GSQL. Its state is mutable throughout the lifecycle of a query. It has an initial value, and the user can keep accumulating (using its “+=” built-in operator) new values into it. Each accumulator variable has a type. The type decides what semantics the declared accumulator will use to interpret the “+=” operation.\nIn Figure 1’s left box, from lines 3 to line 8, six different accumulator variables (those with prefix @@) are declared, each with a unique type. Below, we explain the semantics and usage of them.\nSumAccum<INT>Â allows the user to keep adding INT values into its internal state variable. As the lines 10 and 11 have shown, we added 1 and 2 to the accumulator, and ended up with the value 3 (shown in line 3 on the right box).\nMinAccum<INT>Â keeps the smallest INT number it has seen. As the lines 14 and 15 have shown, we accumulated 1 and 2 to the MinAccum accumulator and ended up with the value 1 (shown in line 6 on the right box).\nMaxAccum<INT>Â is symmetric to MinAccum. It returns the MAX INT value it has seen. Lines 18 and 19 show that we send 1 and 2 into it, and end up with the value 2 (shown in line 9 on the right box).\nOrAccumÂ keeps ORing the internal boolean state variable with new boolean variables that accumulate to it. The initial default value is FALSE. Lines 22 and 23 show that we send TRUE and FALSE into it and end up with the TRUE value (shown in line 12 on the right box).\nAndAccumÂ is symmetric to OrAccum. Instead of using OR, it uses the AND accumulation semantics. Lines 26 and 27 show that we accumulate TRUE and FALSE into it and end up with the FALSE value (shown in line 15 on the right box).\nListAccum<INT>Â keeps appending new integer(s) into its internal list variable. Lines 30 – 32 show that we append 1, 2, and [3,4] to the accumulator and end up with [1,2,3,4] (shown in lines 19-22 on the right box).\nGlobal vs. Vertex-attached Accumulator\nAt this point, we have seen that accumulators are special typed variable in GSQL language. We are ready to explain the global and local scope of them.Â\nGlobal accumulator belongs to the entire query. Anywhere in a query, a statement can update its value. Local accumulator belongs to each vertex.Â It can only be updated when its owning vertex is accessible. To differentiate them, we use special prefixes in its identifier when we declare them.\n@@ prefix is used for declaring global accumulator variable. It is always used stand alone. E.g @@cnt +=1.\n@ prefix is used for declaring local accumulator variable. It must be used with a vertex alias in a query block. E.g. v.@cnt +=1, where v is a vertex alias specified in a FROM clause of a SELECT-FROM-WHERE query block.Â\nFigure 2. A social graph with 7 person vertices and 7 friendship edges connecting them.\nConsider a toy social graph modeled by a person vertex type andÂ a person-person friendship edge type shown in Figure 2. Below we write a query, which accepts a person, and does 1-hop traversal from the input person to its neighbors. We use @@global_edge_cnt accumulator to accumulate the total edges we traverse. And we use @vertex_cnt to write to the input person’s each friend vertex an integer 1.Â\nFigure 3. The top box shows a query that given a person, accumulate the edge count into @@global_edge_cnt. The bottom box shows that for each friend of the input person, we accumulate 1 into its @vertex_cnt.Â\nAs Figure 2 shows, Dan has 4 direct friends — Tom, Kevin, Jenny, and Nancy, each of which holds a local accumulator @vertex_cnt. And the @@global_edge_cnt has value 4, reflecting the fact that for each edge, we have accumulated 1 into it.Â\nACCUM vs. POST-ACCUM\nACCUM and POST-ACCUM clauses are computed in stages, where in a SELECT-FROM-WHERE query block, ACCUM is executed first, followed by the POST-ACCUM clause.Â\nACCUM executes its statement(s) once for each matched edge (or path) of the FROM clause pattern. Further, ACCUM parallely executes its statements for all the matches.Â\nPOST-ACCUM executes its statement(s) once for each involved vertex. Note that each statement within the POST-ACCUM clause can refer to either source vertices or target vertices but not both.\nWe have explained the mechanism of accumulator, their types, and the two different scopes–global and local. We also elaborate the ACCUM and POST-ACCUM clause semantics. Once you master the basics, the rest is to practice more. We have made available 46 queries based on the LDBC schema. These 46 queries are divided into three groups.Â\nYou can follow GSQL 102 to setup the environment. You can also post your feedback and questions on the GSQL community forum. Our community members and developers love to hear any feedback from your graph journey of using GSQL and are ready to help clarifying any doubts.Â","Neo4j includes a growing, open library of high-performance graph algorithms that reveal the hidden patterns and structures in your connected data.\nIn this series on graph algorithms, we’ll discuss the value of graph algorithms and what they can do for you. Last week, we explored how data connections drive future discoveries and how to streamline those data discoveries with graph analytics.\nThis week, we’ll take a detailed look at the many graph algorithms available in Neo4j and what they do.\n15 Graph Algorithms Optimized for the Neo4j Graph Platform\nUsing Neo4j graph algorithms, you’ll have the means to understand, model and predict complicated dynamics such as the flow of resources or information, the pathways that contagions or network failures spread, and the influences on and resiliency of groups.\nAnd because Neo4j brings together analytics and transaction operations in a native graph platform, you’ll not only uncover the inner nature of real-world systems for new discoveries, but also develop and deploy graph-based solutions faster and have easy-to-use, streamlined workflows. That’s the power of an optimized approach.\nHere is a list of the many algorithms that Neo4j uses in its graph analytics platform, along with an explanation of what they do.\nTraversal & Pathfinding Algorithms\n1. Parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS)What It Does: Traverses a tree data structure by fanning out to explore the nearest neighbors and then their sub-level neighbors. It’s used to locate connections and is a precursor to many other graph algorithms.\nBFS is preferred when the tree is less balanced or the target is closer to the starting point. It can also be used to find the shortest path between nodes or avoid the recursive processes of depth-first search.\nHow It’s Used: Breadth-First Search can be used to locate neighbor nodes in peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent, GPS systems to pinpoint nearby locations and social network services to find people within a specific distance.\n2. Parallel Depth-First Search (DFS)What It Does: Traverses a tree data structure by exploring as far as possible down each branch before backtracking. It’s used on deeply hierarchical data and is a precursor to many other graph algorithms. Depth-First Search is preferred when the tree is more balanced or the target is closer to an endpoint.\nHow It’s Used: Depth-First Search is often used in gaming simulations where each choice or action leads to another, expanding into a tree-shaped graph of possibilities. It will traverse the choice tree until it discovers an optimal solution path (e.g., win).\n3. Single-Source Shortest PathWhat It Does: Calculates a path between a node and all other nodes whose summed value (weight of relationships such as cost, distance, time or capacity) to all other nodes are minimal.\nHow It’s Used: Single-Source Shortest Path is often applied to automatically obtain directions between physical locations, such as driving directions via Google Maps. It’s also essential in logical routing such as telephone call routing (least-cost routing).\n4. All-Pairs Shortest PathWhat It Does: Calculates a shortest path forest (group) containing all shortest paths between the nodes in the graph. Commonly used for understanding alternate routing when the shortest route is blocked or becomes sub-optimal.\nHow It’s Used: All-Pairs Shortest Path is used to evaluate alternate routes for situations such as a freeway backup or network capacity. It’s also key in logical routing to offer multiple paths; for example, call routing alternatives.\n5. Minimum Weight Spanning Tree (MWST)What It Does: Calculates the paths along a connected tree structure with the smallest value (weight of the relationship such as cost, time or capacity) associated with visiting all nodes in the tree. It’s also employed to approximate some NP-hard problems such as the traveling salesman problem and randomized or iterative rounding.\nHow It’s Used: Minimum Weight Spanning Tree is widely used for network designs: least-cost logical or physical routing such as laying cable, fastest garbage collection routes, capacity for water systems, efficient circuit designs and much more. It also has real-time applications with rolling optimizations such as processes in a chemical refinery or driving route corrections.\n6. PageRankWhat It Does: Estimates a current node’s importance from its linked neighbors and then again from their neighbors. A node’s rank is derived from the number and quality of its transitive links to estimate influence. Although popularized by Google, it’s widely recognized as a way of detecting influential nodes in any network.\nHow It’s Used: PageRank is used in quite a few ways to estimate importance and influence. It’s used to suggest Twitter accounts to follow and for general sentiment analysis.\nPageRank is also used in machine learning to identify the most influential features for extraction. In biology, it’s been used to identify which species extinctions within a food web would lead to biggest chain-reaction of species death.\n7. Degree CentralityWhat It Does: Measures the number of relationships a node (or an entire graph) has. It’s broken into indegree (flowing in) and outdegree (flowing out) where relationships are directed.\nHow It’s Used: Degree Centrality looks at immediate connectedness for uses such as evaluating the near-term risk of a person catching a virus or hearing information. In social studies, indegree of friendship can be used to estimate popularity and outdegree as gregariousness.\n8. Closeness CentralityWhat It Does: Measures how central a node is to all its neighbors within its cluster. Nodes with the shortest paths to all other nodes are assumed to be able to reach the entire group the fastest.\nHow It’s Used: Closeness centrality is applicable in a number of resources, communication and behavioral analysis, especially when interaction speed is significant. It has been used to identifying the best location of new public services for maximum accessibility.\nIn social network analysis, it is used to find people with the ideal social network location for faster dissemination of information.\n9. Betweenness CentralityWhat It Does: Measures the number of shortest paths (first found with Breadth-First Search) that pass through a node. Nodes that most frequently lie on shortest paths have higher betweenness centrality scores and are the bridges between different clusters. It is often associated with the control over the flow of resources and information.\nHow It’s Used: Betweenness Centrality applies to a wide range of problems in network science and is used to pinpoint bottlenecks or likely attack targets in communication and transportation networks. In genomics, it has been used to understand the control certain genes have in protein networks for improvements such as better drug- disease targeting.\nBetweenness Centrality has also be used to evaluate information flows between multiplayer online gamers and expertise sharing communities of physicians.\nCommunity Detection Algorithms\nThis category is also known as clustering algorithms or partitioning algorithms.\n10. Label PropagationWhat It Does: Spreads labels based on neighborhood majorities as a means of inferring clusters. This extremely fast graph partitioning requires little prior information and is widely used in large-scale networks for community detection. It’s a key method for understanding the organization of a graph and is often a primary step in other analysis.\nHow It’s Used: Label Propagation has diverse applications from understanding consensus formation in social communities to identifying sets of proteins that are involved together in a process (functional modules) for biochemical networks. It’s also used in semi- and unsupervised machine learning as an initial preprocessing step.\n11. Strongly ConnectedWhat It Does: Locates groups of nodes where each node is reachable from every other node in the same group following the direction of relationships. It’s often applied from a depth-first search.\nHow It’s Used: Strongly Connected is often used to enable running other algorithms independently on an identified cluster. As a preprocessing step for directed graphs, it helps quickly identify disconnected groups. In retail recommendations, it helps identify groups with strong affinities that then are used for suggesting commonly preferred items to those within that group who have not yet purchased the item.\n12. Union-Find / Connected Components / Weakly ConnectedWhat It Does: Finds groups of nodes where each node is reachable from any other node in the same group, regardless of the direction of relationships. It provides near constant-time operations (independent of input size) to add new groups, merge existing groups and determine whether two nodes are in the same group\nHow It’s Used: Union-Find / Connected Components is often used in conjunction with other algorithms, especially for high-performance grouping. As a preprocessing step for undirected graphs, it helps quickly identify disconnected groups.\n13. Louvain ModularityWhat It Does: Measures the quality (i.e., presumed accuracy) of a community grouping by comparing its relationship density to a suitably defined random network. It’s often used to evaluate the organization of complex networks and community hierarchies in particular. It’s also useful for initial data preprocessing in unsupervised machine learning.\nHow It’s Used: Louvain is used to evaluate social structures in Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube. It’s used in fraud analytics to evaluate whether a group has just a few bad behaviors or is acting as a fraud ring that would be indicated by a higher relationship density than average. Louvain revealed a six-level customer hierarchy in a Belgian telecom network.\n14. Local Clustering Coefficient / Node Clustering CoefficientWhat It Does: For a particular node, it quantifies how close its neighbors are to being a clique (every node is directly connected to every other node). For example, if all your friends knew each other directly, your local clustering coefficient would be 1. Small values for a cluster would indicate that although a grouping exists, the nodes are not tightly connected.\nHow It’s Used: Local Cluster Coefficient is important for estimating resilience by understanding the likelihood of group coherence or fragmentation. Analysis of a European power grid using this method found that clusters with sparsely connected nodes were more resilient against widespread failures.\n15. Triangle-Count and Average Clustering CoefficientWhat It Does: Measures how many nodes have triangles and the degree to which nodes tend to cluster together. The average clustering coefficient is 1 when there is a clique, and 0 when there are no connections. For the clustering coefficient to be meaningful, it should be significantly higher than a version of the network where all of the relationships have been shuffled randomly.\nHow It’s Used: The Average Clustering Coefficient is often used to estimate whether a network might exhibit “small-world” behaviors which are based on tightly knit clusters. It’s also a factor for cluster stability and resiliency. Epidemiologists have used the average clustering coefficient to help predict various infection rates for different communities.\nThe world is driven by connections. Neo4j graph analytics reveals the meaning of those connections using practical, optimized graph algorithms including the ones detailed above.\nThis concludes our series on graph algorithms in Neo4j.

{"question":"What role does proper form play in archery execution, and what are the essential safety statistics of the sport?","answer":"Proper form in archery execution is crucial, with specific drills designed to maintain correct posture and head position. The Posture Drill involves a coach resting their hand on the archer's head during the shot cycle to control head movement. Clean execution is particularly important as it significantly affects arrow direction, and all shot cycle steps are designed to enable the cleanest possible execution. Regarding safety, archery is statistically one of the safest sports, ranking just above Ping-Pong and Bowling in annual injuries. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's data, it's twice as safe as golf and fishing, maintaining this safety record despite having participants ranging from grade-school children to seniors, including many beginners.","context":["This is an excerpt from Archery by USA Archery.\nExecution Improvement Drills and Activities\nDeveloping a clean execution is very important because execution plays such an important role in the direction the arrow goes. All the steps of the shot cycle are designed to allow you to execute the shot as clean as possible. The actual execution and release should be subconscious actions. There are a few activities and drills that help in developing clean execution.\nOne drill involves using a training aid such as a Formaster (by Range-O-Matic) or the Shot Trainer (by Astra Archery). This training aid attaches the bow string to your drawing elbow (see figure 8.10). When you release, you must continue to expand and increase your back tension to resist the force of the bow and cord from pulling you forward. It can be used with or without an arrow. This type of training aid is excellent in improving reaction time of the release when using a clicker, and it is preferred to use this training aid while aiming at a target. This training aid can also be used indoors without using an arrow and is an excellent way to train when weather or time prevents outdoor target training.\nBow Release Drill\nThe Bow Release Drill teaches you how to correctly release the bow. A correct release requires you to release both the bow string and bow grip simultaneously to consistently put a constant amount and direction of momentum into each arrow and to maintain the barrel of the gun through the release. The Bow Release Drill can be practiced first without a bow or stretch band. Mimic the action of the steps of the shot cycle. At release, try to synchronize the release of your drawing hand and bow hand. Notice that your thumb and index finger are pointed straight down. After you have developed the ability to synchronize the release of your drawing hand and bow hand without using a stretch band, you can start doing the same drill with a stretch band. Next perform this drill with the bow. To perform this drill with a bow, shoot without a finger sling; have your coach catch the bow where the stabilizer connects to the riser (see figure 8.11). Caution: Do this drill only with a qualified coach and take all necessary precautions.\nThe Posture Drill is excellent for helping you maintain your head position and posture throughout the shot and can be used while you are using a stretch band or shooting. To perform this drill, your coach rests her hand slightly on your head while you are going through all the steps of the shot cycle (see figure 8.12). If your coach feels your head move, he presses down firmly on your head, enough to prevent you from moving your head throughout the entire shot process for a few shots. After a few shots, your coach then presses down firmly on your head just from set to setup position. After setup your coach removes his hand to see whether you can better control your body and head. Do this drill only if you are having trouble controlling your head and posture during the shooting process.","No matter what type, size, brand, or style of arrow you choose to shoot, you must always inspect each arrow for damage before each shot. Proper care of your new arrows can ensure years of quality performance. However, shafts can become damaged, and shooting a damaged arrow is extremely unsafe! Never assume ANY arrow is safe -- not even a BRAND NEW arrow --until you have verified it yourself. It is your responsibility to check your equipment and be sure your arrows are always in good condition.\nTo inspect the arrow for defects, hold it on both ends and flex it away from yourself (and others) while visibly and audibly checking for splinters, cracks, nicks, or dents. Rotate and repeat this inspection several times to make certain the arrow shaft is not damaged in any way. If you find the arrow to be damaged - destroy it immediately. Shooting damaged arrows can result in arrow failure and possible bodily injury.\nIronically, the reason most arrows get damaged is because modern equipment is simply too good. In years past, the recreational archer was often happy with paper plate accuracy and groups of 4-8\" within a typical bowhunting range. But those days are long gone. With modern equipment, even a novice archer can practically pile arrows into the same hole at 20 or 30 yards. Unfortunately, shooting tight groups means there is a chance that an incoming arrow can strike and damage an arrow that's already in the target. If one arrow strikes another, the force of the impact can cause lateral cracks or dents on the arrow shaft. This dramatically weakens the arrow shaft. AND IF YOU DON'T FLEX-TEST all your arrows before shooting the arrows again, you may not detect the damage. So when you fire the arrow again later, it can buckle and snap upon release. This will put your bow hand (the hand holding the bow) at great risk of making contact with the moving segments of the broken arrow. Unfortunately, in a toughness contest between your hand and an arrow shaft, the arrow shaft always wins.\nIt is very important your graphite arrows are trimmed to the correct length to match your equipment. Arrows that are too short can become lodged in the arrow rest or behind the riser of the bow (obstructed path). Shooting an arrow that is lodged in a bow or arrow rest in this manner will almost certainly result in arrow failure, damage to your equipment, and/or personal injury. The end of your arrow shaft (not including the tip) should sit approximately 1 inch (2.4 cm) in front of the arrow rest (or more) when you are at full draw. An arrow that is “just” long enough is too short! Please note that changing your bow’s draw length and/or draw stop peg setting (for bows equipped with this feature), will likely change your arrow length requirements. Also, as your bowstring ages and stretches (as all bowstrings do) your bow's effective draw length will slowly increase - particularly if the string set is left in service for an extended period. If you choose not to have your string serviced and replaced at regular intervals, be advised that your bow's arrow length requirements may change over time.\nBefore firing your arrow, make sure the nock is properly seated all the way against the string. Be advised that some nocks use a “2-click” procedure, where the nock isn’t fully seated until you hear the second click. Failure to properly nock your arrow on the string may cause the arrow to fall (or partially fall) from the string during the drawstroke. This could result in a dry-fire or an obstructed path shot which could damage your equipment and/or cause bodily injury.\nTake a look at the painful photograph at right, provided by fellow archer P. Giblin from Houston, TX. THIS IS A WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF YOU FIRE A DAMAGED ARROW. While statistically this type of injury qualifies as a \"freak accident,\" it does happen to a number of archers each season. And while it may be intuitive to \"blame the arrow,\" the reality is that all brands, all types, all models, and all sizes of arrows can fail upon release if they are damaged prior to the shot.\nDon't assume that expensive arrows are any less susceptible. They are not. Any arrow, aluminum or carbon, small diameter or large diameter, camo finish or black finish, light or heavy, cheap or expensive, popular or obscure, WILL BREAK IF THE ARROW IS DAMAGED PRIOR TO THE SHOT.\nIf you ignore flex-test safety procedures, your damaged arrow shaft can buckle and snap when you shoot it again. Unfortunately, some of the broken pieces will likely continue accelerating, often with unpredictable direction. If you're lucky, the broken pieces will fly away from you and your bow hand (the hand holding the grip). If it's not your lucky day, you'll be making a trip to the emergency room. So don't risk it. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR EQUIPMENT FIRST!\nIf you have other questions about arrow safety or any other concerns about your new arrows, please call our pro-shop for further assistance. We hope you get years of safe and trouble-free enjoyment from your new custom arrows.\nNo, Statistically, Archery is twice as safe as Golf and Fishing. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) operates the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS)1, which is a database used to track hospital injuries for more than 15,000 kinds of consumer products used in sports and recreational activities in and around homes and schools. Their study confirms that archery is among the safest of all sports, ranking just above Ping-Pong and Bowling in number of injured participants per year.\nEspecially impressive is the fact that archery maintains a consistently high safety record despite the fact that participants range from grade-school children to senior citizens, many of whom have never before picked up a bow and arrow. Nonetheless, periodic archery injuries are a reality of our sport -- most often because archers simply forget to follow safety procedures. So don't be the 1 in 1,000 archers who end up in the ER. FLEX-TEST YOUR ARROWS EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU SHOOT! We sincerely hope you have a safe and enjoyable archery experience and we strongly encourage you to practice and share this information with other archers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5ce223a2-7a05-40e2-8404-9029dc323b96>","<urn:uuid:1a6a0b11-5227-4cb6-9bfa-62cb5ed1bf4d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference in how cards are dealt in Hold'em vs Open Face Chinese Poker?","answer":"In Hold'em, players receive two private hole cards at the start, followed by five community cards dealt in stages (three on the flop, one on the turn, one on the river) that all players can use. In Open Face Chinese Poker, players initially receive five cards and then are dealt one card at a time until they have 13 total cards, with each player placing their cards in three different hands (front, middle, and back). There are no community cards in Open Face Chinese Poker, and players must arrange their cards into three distinct hands that follow specific strength requirements.","context":["Open Face Chinese Poker (OFC)\nA variation of Chinese Poker called Open Face Chinese Poker (OFC) has been spreading wildly across the world. In OFC the basic gameplay is as follows:\n- Each player is dealt five cards initially.\n- These cards are set in either the front, middle or back hands in any way the player sees fit.\n- Play continues in rounds with each player being dealt one card at a time and placing that card in any available hand.\n- Play rotates clockwise with the ‘under the gun‘ player always revealing his cards first. This process is repeated until all players have been dealt 13 total cards.\n- The hands and royalties are scored and each player settles with the other players. Rules for fouling a hand are the same as traditional Chinese Poker.\n- A 52-card deck is used (2 to Ace, excluding Jokers). The card suits are equivalent.\n- The maximum 3 number of players at a table\n- 17 pocket cards.\n13 of 17 cards must be laid out into 3 boxes.\nThe remaining 4 cards must be discarded.\n- No community cards.\n- No betting rounds (no blinds, ante, etc.)\nEvery player at a table takes one seat with 3 boxes to lay 13 cards out into (5 cards into the middle and back (the lowest) boxes, 3 cards into the front box (the highest). At the end of a hand, the back box hand must be stronger than or equal to the middle box hand, and the middle box hand must be stronger than or equal to the front box hand.\n- The game is played for points. The goal of the game is to achieve more points than your opponents by winning more hands and/or by collecting royalties on premium hands.\nPoint score is the cost of one point (for example, 1 cent for 1 point). The calculation is made at the end of a match.\n- Cap – the maximum limit of loss in one match. Thus, over a match, a player can lose the maximum amount of money equaling to that specified in Cap.\nHand Structure in Open Face Chinese\nIn both traditional Chinese Poker and Open Face, players will look at their cards and begin setting up three different poker hands,\n- A three card hand, known as the Front\n- A five card hand, known as the Middle\n- Another five card hand known as the Back\nFor a hand to be valid, the back hand must be the strongest of the three hands in accordance with traditional poker hand rankings. The middle hand must be of a lower rank than the back hand, but higher than the front hand. The front hand must be the lowest strength. A valid hand would look like:\n- Front – 2 2 7 (Pair of Twos)\n- Middle – A A 4 4 J (Two pairs: Aces & Fours)\n- Back – 8 9 T J Q (Straight)\nIf the order of strength does not go front to back, weakest to strongest, it is called a fouled hand.\n- Front – 2 2 7 (Pair of Twos)\n- Middle – K K 3 3 9 (Two Pairs: Kings & Threes)\n- Back – Q Q 8 8 J (Two Pair: Queens & Eights)\nOnce all three hands have been set, players will compare front, middle and back hands. Each hand is worth one point. If one player has won two of the three hands they will score 1 point (winning two points and losing one for a net of +1 points). More points can be earned if the player wins all three hands, known as scooping. Players can also earn points by making high ranking hands known as royalties.\nA player scoops the hand by winning all three showdowns with their front, middle, and back holdings. The player is awarded one point for each showdown won, and three bonus points for scooping for a total of six points.\nWhen a player has fouled their hand, it counts as an automatic scoop and is worth six points. If both players have fouled their hand, the game is considered a tie.\nFront, middle and back rows may earn points for making certain hands as long as the hand does not foul. The type of royalties and how much they are worth varies from game to game. Below is one common scoring chart:\nMulti Player Scoring\nIn a game with more than two players, scores are settled by position. The player under the gun will settle with each player in a clockwise order. The player to the left of the under the gun player will then settle their debts. This continues until are players have paid.\nIf a player fouls in a multi-player game, that player will pay 6 units to each player plus any royalties on hands that have not fouled.\nFantasyland is a type of ‘bonus round’ in Chinese Poker. A player may enter Fantasyland when they have made a pair of Queens or better in the front hand without fouling.\nEntering Fantasyland means that on the next hand, they receive all 13 cards at once. They make all three hands at once, a huge advantage as they’ll be able to see if they hit any straights or flushes in advance, and lay cards perfectly without any risk of fouling.\nOther players play as normal, with just one card dealt at a time. The button does not move during Fantasyland – this is considered a continuation on the previous hand.\nA player may stay in Fantasyland (and receive the same advantage next hand) if they make any of the following hands:\n- Three of a kind in the front\n- Full House or better in the middle\n- Four of a Kind or better in the back","Introduction to Hold’em Poker\nHold’em poker is a community card game that requires skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. The game revolves around 텍사스홀덤 making the best possible hand using a combination of your hole cards (private cards) and the community cards dealt on the table. With its origins in Texas, Hold’em quickly spread to become a global sensation, both in casinos and online.\nMastering the Basics of Hold’em\nHold’em is played with a standard 52-card deck and can accommodate 2 to 10 players. The objective is to form the strongest five-card hand, using any combination of the seven available cards. Here are the essential steps and rules to get you started:\nThe Blinds and Dealing\nIn Hold’em, two players post forced bets known as the small blind and big blind. These bets initiate the pot. Each player receives two private hole cards, and the dealer then places five community cards face-up on the table.\nThe Rounds of Betting\nHold’em consists of four betting rounds: Preflop, Flop, Turn, and River. Players have the option to fold, call, raise, or check, depending on their strategy and confidence in their hand.\nThe Community Cards\nThe community cards are dealt in three stages: the Flop (three cards), the Turn (one card), and the River (one card). Players use these cards, along with their hole cards, to form the best possible hand.\nAfter the final round of betting, if more than one player remains, a showdown occurs. The player with the best hand wins the pot. Hands are ranked from high to low, including combinations like pairs, straights, flushes, and more.\nStrategies to Dominate Hold’em\nTo excel in Hold’em, a strategic approach is crucial. Here are some proven strategies that can significantly enhance your chances of success:\nApplying controlled aggression can put your opponents on the defensive. Aggressive betting and raising can force weaker hands to fold, giving you the upper hand.\nYour position at the table is vital. Being in a later position allows you to gauge your opponents’ actions before making your move, granting you more information to make informed decisions.\nStarting Hand Selection\nChoosing the right starting hands is paramount.

{"question":"Default mode network social processing vs temporal lobe activation patterns?","answer":"The default mode network, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and medial parietal cortex, continuously processes social relationships during non-demanding tasks. In contrast, temporal lobe activation patterns are more task-specific, showing increased activation during specific social cognitive tasks like working memory, face processing, and theory of mind tasks. The temporal lobe, particularly the superior temporal gyrus, shows distinct activation patterns during social processing tasks, while the default mode network operates more continuously in analyzing social relationships.","context":["Taken together, our data may be interpreted as suggesting that the human facility in understanding observed social relationshipsis provided by the combined activity of an action recognition system in the inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices, an anterior STS system that interprets the social significance of actions, and a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and medial parietalcortex system that analyzes social relationships and considers their implications.The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and medialparietal cortex system for thinking about social relationships is apparently part of the brain’s default state circuitry; it may continuously, often without effort or intention, assess and analyze past, present, or possible future social relationships whenever non-social tasks do not demand full attention. Given the complexity and pervasive importance of social relationships, this ongoing social processing may be crucial to sustaining adaptive social relations.\nI also speculated that these neurons can not only help simulate other people's behavior but can be turned \"inward\"—as it were—to create second-order representations or meta-representations of your own earlier brain processes. This could be the neural basis of introspection, and of the reciprocity of self awareness and other awareness. There is obviously a chicken-or-egg question here as to which evolved first, but... The main point is that the two co-evolved, mutually enriching each other to create the mature representation of self that characterizes modern humans.\"\nInvestigations of brain substrates for social cognition have polarized in two camps. The simulation camp focuses on so-called shared circuits (SCs) that are involved in one’s own actions, sensations and emotions and in perceiving those of others [1,2]. The theory of mind (ToM) camp emphasizes the role of midline structures in mentalizing about the states of others .\nAn embryonic and speculative working hypothesis  for the link between classical SCs and midline structures, which is inspired by these findings but differs from that in Uddin et al. ,is shown in Figure 1. While dealing with states of the self, areas of the SCs represent pre-reflective bodily states. If asked to introspect and report these states, subjects additionally activate (v)mPFC structures. When dealing with states of other individuals, activity in SCs might represent the empathic transformation of the bodily states of others into pre-reflective neural representations of similar states of the self. These simulated pre-reflective representations correlate with empathy [6–8] and might provide an intuitive understanding of what goes on in others . If asked to reflect on the states of others, the pathways that are normally used to reflect on the bodily representations of the self are now used on simulated bodily states of others, leading to simulated reflective representations.Thus, SCs and midline structures form an integrated system that applies to cases where we perceive the other as similar enough for simulation to be useful . In this view, both SCs and vmPFC reflect simulation, albeit at different levels (pre-reflective versus reflective), rather than radically different processes (SC versus ToM). This route is complemented by a more dorsal, less embodied and more cognitive route that becomes essential when simulations lead to wrong conclusions (e.g. others considered to be dissimilar in this aspect\nSelv om jeg ikke er sikker på at jeg helt forstår modellen, er ideen klar nok, og den korresponderer smukt med V. Ramachandrans overvejelser: Der er to niveauer hvor det ene har udviklet sig oven på det andet - som en form for intern reflekterende simulation med afsæt i det som spejlneuronerne skaber af interne ubevidste emotionelle identifikationsprocesser.","What is the temporal lobe?\nThe temporal lobe is structurally divided into the superior, middle, inferior and medial gyri. The superior temporal gyrus comprises the primary auditory cortex, while nearby temporal regions function in higher level auditory processing, including speech and language. Inferior temporal regions are involved in higher level visual processing and the temporal-occipital gyrus is involved in face processing. The medial temporal lobe comprises the hippocampus and is thought be involved in the formation and propagation of memory.\nWhat is the evidence for temporal lobe alterations?\nModerate to high quality evidence found reduced grey and white matter in the temporal lobe of people with schizophrenia, particularly in the superior temporal gyrus, medial and middle temporal gyrus, and the occipito-temporal gyrus. There was also an absence of normal leftward asymmetry in the planum temporale and excess rightward asymmetry in the superior temporal gyrus (particularly posterior). The severity of auditory hallucinations was associated with grey matter volume reductions in the left superior temporal gyri, (including the rolandic operculum and Heschl’s gyri), and a trend effect for the right superior temporal gyri (including the medial temporal gyrus and Heschl’s gyri).\nPeople with first-episode schizophrenia showed the greatest reductions in the superior and inferior temporal and transverse gyri. There were common decreases in grey matter volume in the left superior temporal gyrus of antipsychotic-naïve and treated first-episode patients compared to controls. Grey matter in the left middle temporal gyrus was increased in antipsychotic-naive patients compared to controls but decreased in treated patients compared to controls.\nPeople at high risk of schizophrenia (relatives or people showing subclinical symptoms) had decreases in the right superior temporal gyrus compared to controls. Relatives also showed reductions in the left inferior temporal gyrus when compared to controls. Relatives showed greater right superior temporal reductions than people with subclinical symptoms, who showed increases in the left superior temporal gyrus compared to controls. People at risk of schizophrenia who developed a psychotic episode showed greater decreases in the right superior temporal gyrus than people at risk who did not develop psychosis.\nModerate quality evidence found increased activation in the superior and middle temporal gyri during auditory hallucinations and decreased activation in the superior temporal gyrus during auditory stimulation in patients compared to controls.\nThere was increased activation in; the left middle temporal gyrus during episodic memory encoding; the medial temporal gyrus during episodic memory retrieval; the superior temporal and medial temporal gyri during working memory tasks; the right superior temporal gyrus during executive functioning tasks; and the right middle temporal gyrus during timing tasks. There was decreased activation in; the medial temporo-occipital gyrus during memory retrieval tasks; in the superior temporal gyrus of people with schizophrenia during reward anticipation tasks; and lateral and middle temporal regions during linguistic (mostly semantic reading) and theory of mind tasks.\nModerate to high quality evidence found first-degree relatives compared to controls showed increased activation in the right posterior and anterior superior temporal gyrus during cognitive tasks. Moderate to low quality evidence also found increased activation in the right middle temporal gyrus of relatives during emotion tasks. There was decreased activation in schizophrenia compared to autism in bilateral superior temporal gyri during face emotion recognition.\nModerate to high quality evidence finds a medium-sized increase in phosphodiesters in the temporal lobe of people with schizophrenia, with no differences in phosphomonoesters levels. Moderate to low quality evidence found reduced phosphomonoesters and increased phosphodiesters levels in the temporal lobe of people with first-episode psychosis. Moderate to high quality evidence also found decreased N-acetyl aspartate in the temporal lobe of people with first-episode or chronic schizophrenia. There may also be reduced N-acetyl aspartate in people at high-risk of schizophrenia. Moderate quality evidence found reduced translocator protein in the temporal lobe of people with schizophrenia.\nGreen - Topic summary is available.\nOrange - Topic summary is being compiled.\nRed - Topic summary has no current systematic review available."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9722b2c9-914a-4ca9-ac93-7500ba36085d>","<urn:uuid:de5cc126-5963-4871-94fa-57e3e0e83530>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the total area of the new residential development project in Kirov and where exactly is it located?","answer":"The development project covers an area of 43 hectares and is located in the west of Kirov, next to the village of Perestorontsy, while still remaining within the city limits.","context":["At the Junction of Geometry and Landscape\n- contemporary architecture\nThe \"main stage\" of the new residential area designed by Aleksey Ivanov at a suburb of the city of Kirov will be presented by a natural park that will also serve as a multifunctional entertainment center.\nRussian regions have seen \"Archstroydesign\" do a lot of successful work. The city of Kirov is hosting one of the most interesting programs; several projects are being developed, the settlement of ILand getting the Russian Business Class award in 2014. When his trusted partner - the same company that built ILand - invited Aleksey Ivanov to take part in the closed tender for the best architectural proposal for yet another land site, the architect, though somewhat surprised, took the proposition with all due seriousness. And won the contest.\nWith an area of 43 hectares, the territory to be developed is located in the west of Kirov, next to the village of Perestorontsy (but still within the city limits). The terrain here gradually lowers towards southeast where a small forest and a swamped pond are situated. Yet another landscape \"given\" is a road that has already been designed and that partially runs through the planned territory. In each of his projects, Aleksey Ivanov, as one of his main tasks, sets making the most the already-existing conditions - in other words, what he does is not transform the reality but make the reality work for him. For one, the transient highway for him is not only the inevitable \"evil\" (meaning, noise, ecology issues, and deteriorating of viewing value) but also a \"blessing\" because the automotive accessibility is always a great plus for a new residential area. And as far as the limitations are concerned, they can be minimized if we separate the residential buildings from the road by a green zone with culture and sports objects, this green zone taking on the honorary function of the center of the district's social activity. Some extra attractiveness will be given to the park by a cascade of creeks that the swamped reservoir and the nearby brook can be turned into.\nHaving decided on the social \"nucleus\", the architects came up with a planning layout based on green rays running away from the center, combining this geometry with the natural lines of the landscape. Separated by boulevards and parks, the blocks have lined up to become a clear-cut composition whose plan looks a bit like an antique amphitheater. It was in fact the pilot name that the future district got.\nThe development of \"Amphitheater\" will be multifunctional: it will consist of multi-apartment 3-4-5-story buildings and blocked double-sided townhouses; a land site for custom-designed houses is also provided for. According to Aleksey Ivanov's plan, the multi-apartment buildings will be placed in the northeast part of the territory so as to offset to a certain degree one of the site's limitations consisting in the chaotic surroundings that include a whole range of the suburban housing, from the old \"birdhouse\" buildings to the typical 17-story high-rises. The latter are just being built to the northeast of \"Amphitheater\". As for the custom-designed houses, they are \"tucked away\" in the western segment. Still, though, their construction is only scheduled for the last stage of the land site development, and the experienced architect cannot be quite sure if by that time the construction will not undergo some considerable changes. \"Over the long term of construction, the customer demand goes through ebb and flow, there are approvals and extra approvals to be obtained, and the custom-designed houses can easily give way to townhouses or even high-rises, and if you do not predict and provide for this system of possible changes, this could easily kill your project\" - Aleksey Ivanov explains. In order to avoid this extremely undesirable scenario, the architect divided the process of developing this territory into phases, each of which can develop more or less independently from all the others, i.e. on each of the planning stages the character of the development can be modified or changed altogether - with no harm to the general picture. Even the construction camp is designed in such a way that the development and the construction could meet each other halfway, and the construction machinery would not go through the already populated quarters.\nThe architects also ensured that the first people to live in \"Amphitheater\" would not get the heavy financial burden of servicing the park with all of its sports, children's, and social/recreation facilities: the organization of the public zones is planned in such a way that they will be launched into operation in accordance with the number of people moving in to live in the residential buildings. By the way, the functional spaces are important for Aleksey Ivanov not only in terms of their social function: he treats them as some sort of \"development backbone\", especially at night when the lights go out, the parks and boulevards will illustrate the architect's idea with their punctured lines of lights.\nWhen the project was all but completed, it turned out that the land site that cuts in like a wedge into the development territory from the east side, now also belonged to the customer - which meant that now the architects had an opportunity to include it into the plan of the micro district. Aleksey Ivanov proposes to build on this land site a curious quarter under a pilot name of \"Bastion\": a dense one, oriented inside itself, 6 to 8 stories high, so, the transition to the nearby 17-floor buildings turned out all the more smoother. Interesting is the fact that from the ideological standpoint this peripheral and, actually, modestly sized plot of land can indeed become the new \"gravity center\" of the whole district: the architect likens it to the Kremlin, while the buildings that stretch away from it (and gradually lowering their number of floors) he likens to the settlements that used to be built beyond the fortress walls.\nThe appearance of the new center falls in perfectly with one of the main working principles of \"Archstroydesign\" - the multi-central organization of development - that Aleksey Ivanov seems to be consistently sticking to in all of his planning solutions. This project also provides for a number of gravity points at the crossings of pedestrian and vehicle routes, these points being functionally diverse, from bakeries to recreation centers. Furthermore, building these connections, the architects did not limit themselves with \"their own\" territory - they decided it was worth their while to trace the pedestrian routes from the designed district to the city's cultural centers: the Monastery of the Holy Dormition, the hippodrome, and the central movie theater. It turned out that all of these were located within but an hour's walk from here that, with some territory improvements, could become both interesting and educational. Aleksey Ivanov considers this work to be of extreme importance: due to it, this basically suburban area gets included into the city fabric in a fully-fledged way, while the city, with minimal financial investment, gets a new humanitarian dimension.\nMost Recent Stories:\n18.03.2019A String of Impressions\n12.03.2019Garden and Arch Etude\n19.02.2019The “Ray” Approach to Architecture\n13.02.2019A Zeppelin Designed by Roman Leonidov"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:290fbfe7-546f-414b-826a-592eefbe5482>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do BIM and AutoCAD store project data differently?","answer":"BIM and AutoCAD use different layer structures for storing project data. BIM combines all project information into a unified 3D model that includes systems, functional characteristics, and physical characteristics displayed in relation to each other. In contrast, AutoCAD is composed of three distinct layers: the application layer (containing user interface and controls), the drawing layer (where data and models are created), and the model layer (where data and models are stored). This fundamental difference in data organization affects how each software handles project information and coordinates between different aspects of the design.","context":["Whether you’ve embraced BIM (Building Information Modeling) or still have your doubts, it’s here to stay. And it’s already changing the construction process in some pretty fundamental ways.\nWhat is BIM?\nDefinitions of BIM range greatly, but they all have one thing in common—big words. So I merged the explanations from various sources, stripped out the fancy jargon, and came up with this:\nBIM is blueprints on steroids.\n…but those are some powerful steroids!\n#BIM is blueprints on steroids...but those are some powerful steroids! #construction #tech Click To Tweet\nTo expand a little, BIM is a virtual 3D model that represents the facility to be built, with all of its systems and functional and physical characteristics displayed in relation to each other, as well as data about every aspect of the project.\nBIM for Contractors\nIf you’re an owner, architect, or designer, you probably already understand the value of BIM: find conflicts earlier, visualize the finished facility, automate repetitive tasks, and make sure all parties are on the same page from the start of the project.\nBut as the project moves into construction, what benefits does BIM have if you’re a GC or a subcontractor?\nDetect and resolve conflicts between systems before construction begins.\nUsing BIM saved SERA ARCHITECTS and JE DUNN CONSTRUCTION $10 million on a 650,000-square-foot life sciences building for the Oregon Health & Science University. For example, BIM helped them identify a pipe intersecting with a vent so they could make changes before construction began.\n“While architects are early adopters of 3-D technology, to demand that all of our contributing consultants use it, and for the contractor to demand that all of their subcontractors use it is rare.”\nCommunicate More Efficiently\nBecause everyone is working from the latest version of the plans, you’ll never miss an update and your questions can be answered faster.\nTURNER CONSTRUCTION found BIM to be invaluable when building a high school in California, because it nearly eliminated the time needed for RFIs.\n“In the old days, it would have taken us a week to generate an RFI, reference the appropriate documents for the architects, and wait for the response. [BIM] helps speed up our coordination process by having the most current model available all the time, reducing the amount of time it takes to get questions answered from the design team.”\nTest New Procedures\nVisualize untested or complex processes to predict problems before they happen.\nSUNDT CONSTRUCTION did its own concrete work for a water processing facility project. They used BIM to plan the sequencing of the individual pours.\n“Our crews had a better understanding of what each concrete pour entailed and how it related to the work of other trades. We compared [this project] to a similar project that was done without BIM…there was 67 percent less concrete rework.”\nReduce risks created by inadequate perimeter protection and unsafe site layouts.\nSubcontractor SOUTHLAND INDUSTRIES uses BIM to block off areas that require regular maintenance and make service aisles safer.\n“On a recent project, I told our team that I would like to be able to walk freely down the service aisle with a 32-inch-wide cart, and have key service areas within an arm’s reach of the main aisle.”\nUse #BIM to plan safer #construction sites and reduce risk. Click To Tweet\nSave cost by prefabricating some items in the shop instead of on the spot.\nDPR CONSTRUCTION and its subcontractors saved 18.75% on mechanical systems and 50% on the fabrication and installation of drywall by using BIM data to prefabricate steel-framed drywall panels and have them shipped to the site in sequence.\n“People say ‘modular and prefabrication means it has to constrain the design.’ The message we’re trying to say here is really ‘BIM allows prefabrication to be flexible’ because no matter how unique and one-off the design is, as long as we know it is constructible in the model, we can prefabricate it and install it.”\nSave on Materials\nKnow upfront what materials you’ll need to take advantage of economies of scale and just-in-time ordering, resulting in lower costs and less waste.\nOn the expansion of a children’s hospital in Alabama, HOAR CONSTRUCTION invited all subcontractors to use the BIM model before construction even began.\n“The plumbing subcontractor, SUPERIOR MECHANICAL, used their models to really plan installation steps, and they actually ordered pipe to length from their supplier, rather than having to make stock lengths fit the design. It made a huge impact. On a large healthcare project, you might expect a plumbing subcontractor to generate as much as 10 percent material waste. Superior Mechanical generated only 1 percent material waste on this project.”\nAvoid project delays by making sure everybody has the equipment, materials, plans, and instructions they need, when they need them.\nTOCCI BUILDING COMPANIES uses BIM to pinpoint a temporary site exposure, identify the window of time it will be a safety risk, and quantify the materials needed to protect the area.\n“People are prepared on a specific day with 30 sheets of 3/4-inch plywood to cover 15 floor penetrations. There’s no arguing about who is responsible for executing the work. It just gets done.”\nWith #BIM, there's no arguing about who's responsible for the work. It just gets done. #construction Click To Tweet\nGive Input on Designs\nCollaborate with designers to ensure constructability and potentially cut costs.\nAs construction manager at risk for a residence hall at Framingham State University, CONSIGLI CONSTRUCTION needed to save time and money wherever possible. With BIM, they could find opportunities to reduce materials costs and streamline the construction process without making significant changes to the design.\n“Ultimately, the designers and the owners make design decisions. As a construction firm, we use models to drive conversations around choices that could enhance the project. [BIM] models make it easier for designers and owners to visualize how our insights could make their process more efficient.”\n#BIM makes it easier for contractors to advise designers about constructability and cost. Click To Tweet\nBIM for Manufacturers\nAs an integral part of the construction process, manufacturers can also benefit by using BIM.\nDevelop BIM Objects for Your Products\nBIM models are more accurate when they include representations of actual products instead of generic placeholders. If you have a BIM object for your product and your competitor doesn’t, who’s going to get spec’d?\nIf you have a #BIM object and your competitor doesn't, who's going to get spec'd? #construction #mfg Click To Tweet\nCELOTEX was the first insulation manufacturer to create BIM objects for its entire product line. Having that edge has directly led to sales inquiries from architects during the design phase.\n“BIM has enabled us to improve lead times and increase productivity, so it was a no-brainer really.”\nUse BIM to Fabricate Custom Products\nWith the information from a BIM model, you can build more accurate products and develop more efficient schedules. And creating a BIM object for the custom product before you begin fabrication will let you (and your customer) see how it will fit into the space and integrate with the systems.\nCUBICLE CENTRE estimates that it saves five working weeks by making 3D product data available to design teams, who output fabrication drawings faster and more accurately.\n“We decided to engage early with BIM as we understood the crucial role that manufacturer data plays in its success. We shared the view that BIM is ‘the future of specification.'”\nWhat Do You Think About BIM in Construction?\nAre you convinced about the benefits of BIM for contractors and manufacturers?

But I don’t want to do that anymore. So I’m taking matters into my own hands with the Urban-Tech Smart Garage Door Opener. Instead of having to walk to the door, I just need to press a button.\nThe company I work for — Ting, a Chinese company based in the US — was one of the first to start pushing the envelope of what smart home products can do. Before we got into the smart home game, we worked on some of the products that built the foundation for other smart devices, like the thermostat that eventually became Nest. With an emphasis on high-quality products that are affordable, we’ve created a few products that are truly innovative.\nOne of them is the Urban-Tech Smart Garage Door Opener. It works with the Ting app, which is free on iOS and Android. Through the app, you can connect up to four devices to the same account and interact with each one through voice control.\nThere are several reasons why I like the Urban-Tech Smart Garage Door Opener so much. It works with my doorbell because, at some point, I probably needed to get a new doorbell. I have a cordless phone, so there’s no need for a landline. And it’s really useful on my bike. I’d have to disconnect it from my bike because I don’t want to wear a headset while riding. But I don’t want to carry an extra piece of gear.\nThis Smart Garage Door Opener basically takes my phone and controls the door. It even stores my information.\nIt doesn’t take anything out of your hand, so it’s really easy to carry around. It connects to your door with a magnetic sensor and is small enough to fit in your bag. It is also built to last, with a durable steel frame and aluminum door, as well as rotational hinges. I had no trouble hanging it on the wall, and it actually works better for me than a traditional garage door opener.\nThis is something I’m used to. I’ve used a smartphone to open my garage door before, and it’s pretty cool. But it wasn’t that reliable or intuitive. I would often end up hitting a button that didn’t work, or I would accidentally set it to the wrong setting.\nWhat’s New in the AutoCAD?\nMarkup Assist: Import and create markup quickly with the new mark window and optimize your design space for vector graphics.

{"question":"What were the defensive wall characteristics of Nowy Sącz compared to Sudak fortress?","answer":"The Nowy Sącz defensive walls were 1.4 to 2.3 meters thick and 5.5 to 8 meters high, with a total length of over 1700 meters enclosing 19 hectares. They were crowned with battlements and strengthened by buttresses. The Sudak fortress had two main defensive lines - an outer line consisting of fourteen towers and fourteen curtains spanning about 925 meters (458.5m eastern section + 466.5m western section), protecting about 14 hectares, and a citadel line stretching about 580 meters. The Sudak walls featured narrow vertical slits in their lower parts and were built according to 14th-century European fortification principles.","context":["The time of building of the defensive walls of Nowy Sącz is not exactly known. There are many indications that the town walls were built shortly after the location of the town in 1292 on the initiative of the Czech king Wenceslaus II. The end of their construction probably occurred during the reign of Polish king Casimir the Great.\nThe period of the castle’s creation is unknown. Many authors attributed its construction to Casimir the Great, pointing out that as early as in the second half of the 14th century, the royal congregations took place in Nowy Sącz, and there in 1376 queen Elżbieta embraced the Polish rule in the name of Ludwik Węgierski. However, the old manor could serve this purpose. It seems that the stone medieval castle was erected at the turn of the 14th and 15th century, when the royal residence was not used, probably due to construction works. Another possibility is that the construction of the castle began in the time of the last two Přemyslid kings, after the location of the town in 1292, and was only rebuilt in the time of Casimir the Great.\nIn 1405, the defensive walls required repairs, as evidenced by the privilege of king Władysław Jagiełło. In the town defenses were vividly interested successive monarchs, who assisted the work at the walls with numerous privileges. With their help, after the mid-sixteenth century, modernization of the Nowy Sącz fortifications began, adapting them to the requirements of firearms. In 1555-1557, the Hungarian Gate was extended by erecting new towers next to it. Also other elements of the fortifications were remodeled, especially the towers. A large investment was the construction of a second, external defense wall, which gradually surrounded the town from the south and west. The works began in the second half of the 16th century and continued in the first half of the 17th century. The pace of the fortification works was temporarily impeded by the town fire in 1611, as a result of which the roofs on the walls and towers burnt down. During the reconstruction after the fire, the starosts Lubomirski carried out a general expansion of the castle. At that time, a wall was built from the side of the town, and in its eastern section a Castle Gate was erected, which from the town side entered the castle inner courtyard. The main range from the north and the towers received a renaissance decor with attics.\nThe new royal privileges in 1639 and 1649 and the war with Bohdan Chmielnicki in 1648 and the invasion of Poland by the Swedes in 1655 gave rise to intensification of fortification works. It included towers, gates, and work on the outside walls were also continued. In total, in the years 1646-1657 a considerable amount of over pln 1,000 was spent on town walls.\nReconstruction after the Swedish Wars completed the period of modernization of the defensive walls of Nowy Sącz. In the 18th century, the defensive walls of Nowy Sącz definitely declined. Some towers were used for housing and the material from fortifications was used to build houses. Planned demolition of fortifications began after the second partition of Poland. All three town gates and most of the walls were dismantled then. The castle also fell down, and its ruins were caused by fires and landslide in 1813, as a result of which its western part with the corner tower collapsed into the Dunajec river. The northern range of the castle was finally destroyed during the last war.\nThe fortifications line of Nowy Sącz created a rather irregular form, adapted to the terrain layout. In the northern part there was a castle on the promontory. Nowy Sącz belonged to the large towns of medieval Poland, had an area of 19 ha, enclosed by a line of walls over 1700 meters long. Along the walls from the town side there was a strip of land free of buildings, in the Middle Ages occupied only by a castle. The stone defensive wall was crowned with a battlement. Its location, usually along the upper edge of the escarpments, meant that from the very beginning, it was strengthened from the outside by buttresses. The dimensions of the wall were variable: from 1,4 to 2,3 meters in thickness and around 5,5 to 8 meters in height. During the modernization of the fortifications in the 16th-17th century, the culmination of the defensive wall has changed. The primal battlement were ended straight, and the defenders walkway received a shingled roof.\nIt is not known whether the fortifications of Nowy Sącz were provided with towers from the very beginning. This is suggested by laconic documents mentions, but from iconographic sources and seventeenth-century documents emerges a picture of early modern type of towers, adapted to artillery defense. In the 16th and 17th centuries, major construction works were carried out at the towers. It could consist of a thorough reconstruction of existing ones, as well as construction of new defensive facilities. From sources we know about five towers: three from the east (Potter, Brewery, and Cloth Tower), one in the south-west corner of the town (Stall Tower) and one from the west (Butcher). There were three towers in the castle, including the preserved Smith Tower. This list, however, is not full. The spacing of known towers is very rare, which is characteristic of early modern times. Only the castle towers stood at intervals of about 50 meters. In the early modern period, the towers had semicircular or quadratic forms. It were closed from the town side and had roofs covered with tiles. Its interiors were divided into two floors: in the vaulted ground floors there were weapons depots, on the floors were battle stations with timber scaffolds for setting cannons and devices for their pulling. In early modern times, individual towers and gatehouses were looked after by the guilds, from which these objects took their names.\nNowy Sącz had three gates. Two of them: Cracow Gate from the north and Hungary Gate from the south, lay on the main communication route. The third Mill Gate, led east. There was also a fourth, early modern Castle Gate leading from the town to the castle. The gates probably had the typical form of rectangular, transitive towers. Initially, they were very low, with a height of the defensive wall. The Hungarian Gate was enlarged first and the most. For it was turned towards the greatest threat, and moreover it was from the least defensive side. In the mid-sixteenth century, this gate received two semicircular towers flanking the passage, which were probably the end of foregate.\nThe castle was an urban stronghold, because it lay within the town walls at its northern end, in the most exposed point of the area. It was built in the place of the hillfort or maybe only the royal court. It was stretched over a hundred meters along the town walls, to which it was probably added. On this section there were three towers. These were adapted town towers or new buildings, erected during the construction of the castle. The role of the eastern one, Smith Tower is unclear. Probably it was not originally part of the castle buildings, because, as we know from later sources, it was defended by townspeople. One of the other two towers was called Nobilities and it housed a prison for the nobility. The castle also had the chapel and the main house, added to the perimeter wall between the Smith and the central tower. In the Middle Ages, the castle was probably not separated from the town by a wall, but it could be defended from this side by a moat and a earth rampart.\nFrom the west, north and east the town was well defended by the slopes of the terrain. On the other hand, the southern side of the town, deprived of natural protection and defending the town from the greatest threat, was secured with an additional dry moat and earth ramparts. The outer zone of defense from the south was expanded, among others in relation with the construction of the external wall.\nThe best preserved relic of the defensive walls of Nowy Sącz is located in the eastern part of the town, behind the church of St. Margaret. It is over 20 meters long and 1,4 meters thick. To the south of it, at Zakościelna street, there is over forty meters of wall, completely reconstructed in 1918. At the northern end of the town there are the remains of the castle with the reconstructed square Smith Tower on renaissance forms. A fragment of the defensive wall adjacent to it has reconstructed timber porches with a roof.\nLeksykon zamków w Polsce, red.

It consisted of two lines of defense. The strategic core of the defense system of the city was a port part and tops of the Fortess Mountain and of the Plvani-oba. It was protected by a defensive wall that stretched along the rocky ridges of two mountains and reliably defended the only easy passage between them. Because of the peculiarities of the relief the defense system of the port was the least vulnerable border. In case of break of outer line of defense, which covered the Fortess Mountain, there was a possibility of further resistance, and also the evacuation of the city’s defenders on the ships that were in the harbor. Conditionally, this line of defense can be divided into two parts: citadel on top of the Fortess Mountain and the port defensive line.|\nThe citadel of Soldaya has been located along the ridge of the Fortess Mountain and was extended through the east-west axis. It consisted of a line of fortess walls with three towers and four curtains and a complex of consular castle and Watch tower atop of the Fortess Mountain. Fighting side of the defense system of Soldaya’s citadel was on the north side. On the southeast citadel has been protected by impregnable slopes and was not strengthened. The total length of the line of citadel’s fortess walls was about 580 m. Battle way was wooden and relied on beams that were horizontally embedded in the thick walls.\nFrom the east to the defensive line of the citadel adjoins a complex of the Consular castle, which has been a closed knot of defense. The castle consisted of a tower-donjon, small angular tower, oriented toward the city. Donjon and tower have been connected with curtains that form a small well protected courtyard. South Curtain has a tower projection towards the sea. In place of integration of the northern curtain to donjon the entrance has been located, additionally secure by rectangular fortification.\nArea built up with residential buildings within the citadel was minimal and was about 0.21 ha in the area between the consular castle and “St. George’s” tower. Along the rest of the entire line of the fortess walls there was only a narrow path with steps carved in the rock. The citadel has had a great strategic importance to concentrate on its area the defenders of the city in case of break of the outside line of defense. From the citadel there were two convenient escape routes to the coast: one from the consular castle, another through the top of the mountain in the port part of the town.\n|The port’s defensive line has blocked the access to port’s part (the area not less than 7 hectares), located on the southern slopes of the mountains – the Fortress and the Plvani-oba. It was held in the narrowest part of the gorge between the slopes of the mountains. In the east it apperently faced the citadel’s fortess walls and outer line of defense.\nA connecting link was a Nameless tower no. 20. The port’s defensive line consisted of a minimum of three towers, three curtains and one gate. The length of this line of walls was 254.5 m. Nowadays the line of the port’s defensive walls practically can not be observed.\nThe outer line of defense encompassed much of northern gentle slope of the Fortress Mountain. It consisted of fourteen towers and fourteen curtains and also a Barbican, which defended the only common gate. To the east, it faced the impregnable rock near the consular castle. From the west it faced the citadel’s line of defense and fortress walls of the port part of the city. The fortess’ serf ground has almost a triangular shape, with its northern corner located near the city gates. Thus, the outer defense line consisted of two approximately equal length sections: eastern (458.5 m) and western (466.5 m). The area of urban territory, protected by this line of defense, was about 14 hectares and strengthened the city from the field side. In the lower part of the walls in regular order there were placed narrow vertical slits.\nMost of the towers of the outer line of defense were three-wall and had four storeys. The lower floor of the towers has been used as a storehouse for ammunition or as a guard room. From the side of the city to the level of the second storey they were covered with stone walls. During the archaeological research there were opened bases of these walls, as well as stoves and fireplaces for heating. In walls of the second storey there’re narrow vertical embrasures. In the third storey walls there are wide rectangular windows. The fourth storey there’s the top battle ground under the protection of a number of merlons. All fortifications have been built by the best fortification principles that existed in Europe of 14th century, and had much in common with similar structures of Genoa.\nIn the present relief and on the plans of the fortress of the late 18th century (plan of the year 1775) it is traced the line of the fortress’ rampart (length 860 m). The rampart with its shape repeats the line of fortess walls of the outside line. Nowadays there’re preserved fragments of the rampart on the eastern section. At various times there were held numerous sensings in front of the rampart. It was ascertained that from the outside it raised above the surrounding terrain at least for 6 m. The shaft’s profile is triangular. Its width is now 9-10 m. Infront of the rampart in the second half of 18th century flowed streams that flooded a place in front of it. Taking into consideration this fact, it can be affirmed that the rampart was probably reinforced on top with wooden palisade, was a serious obstacle for the enemies. The construction of the shaft should be refered to the first few years of the Genoese presence in Soldaya.\nIn the structure of the Sudak Fortress defensive systems of the citadel have played a particularly important role, the former convent near the eastern wall, a powerful unit of the Main Gate and the system of port fortifications.\nStructuraly, the defense system of Genoa’s Soldaya has not been formed immediately. Construction of major buildings was made since 1365 to at least 1414. Further there were repairings and reconstructions of only individual nodes of defense that did not change the appearance of the defensive line."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bcd26f59-e184-4bb7-8d82-c4e4acc887f0>","<urn:uuid:5acac535-a483-4f62-abfe-56043c4e8c73>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do oil ratios play in soap making, and how does sustainable sourcing affect ingredient choices?","answer":"In soap making, specific oil ratios are crucial - for example, recipes typically use 15% palm oil, 20% palm kernel oil, and varying amounts of other oils like coconut, babassu, and rapeseed oil to achieve desired properties. However, sustainability concerns, particularly around palm oil production which has led to widespread deforestation and ecosystem damage in Southeast Asia, are prompting businesses to seek alternatives. Companies like Unilever and Nestle are setting ambitious zero-deforestation targets, though these have proven difficult to achieve, leading to calls for new approaches that consider ecosystem health and restoration.","context":["Anne-Marie note: Elham sent me a baby care package months ago with a wonderful bar of beer soap. I couldn’t get over how nice it was in the shower with luxurious, soft lather that felt silky on the skin and rinsed away cleanly. She has graciously agreed to do a tutorial on this wonderful soap. Thank you Elham!\nHi, I’m Elham from SkinChakra® and I am so excited to be here for a guest post.\nI have been a cosmetic chemist for almost half of my life, and I’ve had my own line of hand-crafted soap and skin care products for the past two years (in addition to my consulting activities in the cosmetic industry). I live in Bavaria in Germany, and so I have had the opportunity to experiment with countless beer soap variations. I am surrounded by small, handcrafted breweries, and I consider myself a specialist in beer soap. Not surprisingly, beer soap is one of my best selling products!\nToday, I’ll show you how to make a marbled beer soap. I hope you enjoy this recipe! (Note from A-M: If you’ve never made Cold Process soap before, stop here! I highly recommend checking out our FREE four part SoapQueen.tv series on Cold Process Soapmaking, especially the episode on lye safety. And if you’d rather do some reading, Bramble Berry carries a wide range of books on the topic, including my newest book, Soap Crafting. You can also checkout the digital downloads for that instant gratification factor. — A-M.)\nNotes from Elham before you begin:\n1. The color of the soap depends on the beer and on the origin of all other oils. Lighter beers may cause slightly lighter colors while darker beers can cause more brownish colors. I’ve mainly applied virgin plant oils with intensive inherent colors, so the color of your oils might be different from mine. (Keep in mind that the color and even the scent of plant oils and essential oils differs from harvest to harvest and from batch to batch)\n2. I understand that babassu oil is not available to most of you and that Bramble Berry doesn’t supply this oil at the moment. The only oil with exactly the same SAP value is palm kernel oil, and you can replace babassu with palm kernel oil in a 1:1 ration without running the whole calculation through the Lye Calculator. However, if you decide to replace it with any other oil, you have to recalculate the lye. I do not recommend increasing coconut oil, but you may replace babassu oil with each one of or a combination of : (perilla seed oil, rice bran oil, camelina seed oil, sesame oil, sweet almond oil etc.) I do not recommend applying cocoa butter in this recipe but you may apply shea butter, mango seed butter or partially hydrogenated soybean oil instead of babassu oil (don’t forget to run it through the lye calculator!)\n3. I have not considered the superfat (soybean oil in my case) in the lye calculation. It means you can easily replace it with your preferred oil without any need to redo the lye calculation. I do not recommend green-colored oils in this recipe (Avocado, Tamanu or Hemp Seed Oil for example). My soybean is a virgin oil with a very intensive yellow color but it doesn’t affect the beer soap that much.\nYou need about two standard bottles of beer (12 oz. each, 24 oz. total). Our Bavarian bottles are bigger (500 ml or 16.9 oz) and I evaporated one bottle to about 1/3 of the original volume (5 oz or 150 ml). In this particular recipe, I knew I needed about 4.5 oz. of beer so I boiled much more than I needed to start with. (P.S. For more on preparing beer for soapmaking, check out a beer soap tutorial we did back in August. – A-M)\nBefore you begin, remember this important safety information:\nEven if you are an experienced soapcrafter, it doesn’t hurt to review Anne-Marie’s fabulous video on lye safety or my blog post on safely handling sodium hydroxide. Remember: the most severe accidents tend be caused by experienced soapmakers and not beginners.\nFor this project you’ll need:\nChilled Beer (after evaporation): 4.6 oz\nCold distilled water: 4.6 oz\nSodium Hydroxide: 3.6 oz\nPalm kernel oil: 20.0% (4.8 oz)\nPalm oil: 15.0% (3.6 oz)\nCoconut oil: 15.0% (3.6 oz)\nBabassu oil: 5.0% (1.2 oz)\nRapeseed (Canola) oil: 20.0% (4.8 oz)\nSunflower oil: 20.0% (4.8 oz)\nCastor oil: 5.0% (1.2 oz)\nSoybean oil (superfat): 7.0 % (2.1 oz) based on oil content\nCedarwood Essential Oil: 2.5% (0.6 oz) based on oil content\nSAFETY FIRST: Suit up for safe handling practices! That means goggles, gloves and long sleeves. Make sure kids, pets, and other distractions and tripping hazards are out of the house or don’t have access to your soaping space. Always soap in a well-ventilated area.\nOne: Prepare your lye solutions by slowly pouring the sodium hydroxide into the cold water and beer separately and stirring until the the lye has dissolved. (This means adding 1.8 oz lye to 4.6 oz water and 1.8 oz lye to 4.6 oz beer). The beer turns to an ugly dark color with a disgusting smell (don’t be disappointed, it is temporary). I prefer to keep my liquid pot in a cold water bath to better control and reduce the temperature of the lye water. If you’re working in a cold lab or soap kitchen you may rely on the room temperature to adjust the temperature.\nTwo: As the lye solution becomes cold, melt your solid oils in a water bath. Do not let the water temperature exceed 170 degrees F.\nThree: When the solid oils are melted, add the Babassu, Rapeseed, Sunflower and Castor oils and mix gently with a spatula. (Note: If you don’t have any Babassu oil, you can substitute more coconut oil in its place. If you use more coconut oil, you’ll need to run the recipe through Bramble Berry’s lye calculator to get the new amounts of lye and liquid).\nFour: Then combine the Soybean Oil and Cedarwood Essential Oil in a separate container. Mix well and then set aside for later.\nFive: Measure the temperature of water-lye, beer-lye and the oil mixture. They should be around 100-120 degrees F with a max. of 10 degrees F difference between oil and lye as you mix lye and oil together.\nSix: Divide your oil phase in two. Eyeballing is okay. If you’re working in a cold soap lab or kitchen, keep one part in the still-warm water bath to avoid cooling as you’re adding lye to the other part.\nSeven: Gently tap your stick blender in the oil pot to get rid of air bubbles. Gently and slowly pour the lye (I prefer to start with the water-lye at first) over the blender. Turn the blender on and stir in short bursts. Avoid over mixing. You need a mixture with a thin trace. Keep in mind that this mixture doesn’t come to a heavy trace so don’t wait for it.\nEight: After you’re satisfied with the mixture, go to the second half of the oil blend and apply beer-lye over the stick blender and blend.\nNine: Apply the superfat and essential oil blend. Eyeballing is enough. Divide the mixture between two soap pots. Mix gently with a spatula.\nTen: The fun part begins from here. Alternate between pouring the dark soap and the light soap into the mold. There are no strict rules and there isn’t a ‘wrong’ way to do it! For this soap, I poured the batter from the middle of the mold, but you can try pouring from one side or one corner for different looks. Each time you marble, you’ll end up with a unique, beautiful result.\nPour both batters until you’ve poured all of the soap into the mold.\nEleven: Spray the surface with rubbing alcohol to avoid soda ash on the surface of the soap. As you see, I keep the surface rather rough. It’s up to you if you prefer a smooth surface or not.\nTwelve: We’re almost done now! Cover the mold and insulate the soap and keep it warm for at least 24 hours. I recommend waiting at least 48 hours before unmolding the soap.\nAs you can see, I like to use soap stamps in the finished bars. Then I set them on a curing rack and give them at least 8 weeks to fully cure.\nYou’re welcome to visit my blog for other tutorials, and enjoy your beer soap! — Elham","2018 went down as the ‘year of corporate caring’ about the palm oil controversy. A banned TV advertisement promoting a Palm Oil free Christmas by the UK supermarket Iceland went viral on social media with over 5 million views in merely a couple of weeks. Shortly after, on the south bank in London, Iceland responded to the ban with a displaced Orangutan hanging from a Christmas tree surprising tourists and drawing attention to the loss of biodiversity due to the clearing of virgin rainforests. Debates about palm oil in Malaysia and Indonesia are far from new. But recent events are surely stirring up the conversation and attention to the issue is at an all time high.\nProponents are reacting to the complete ban of palm oil with statistics on the efficiency yields from the fruit of oil palm trees and claim boycotting palm oil would simply shift demand to other types of vegetable oil to meet demand. Palm oil has climbed the charts in popularity because it is cheap, versatile and efficient. While others argue that despite the efficiency benefits of the crop, new approaches are needed to tackle this pressing humanitarian and environmental issue.\nBusiness and Palm Oil\nCEOs of multi-national corporations that depend on palm oil and tropical timber in their supply chains are well aware of their impacts and the consequences of deforestation. Outgoing Unilever CEO Paul Polman already stated back in 2015, “We are seeing the effect of climate change in our own business. Shipping routes cancelled because of hurricanes in the Philippines. Factories closing because of extreme cold weather in the United States. Distribution networks in disarray because of floods in the UK. Reduced productivity on our tea plantations in Kenya because of weather changes linked to deforestation of the Mau forest. We estimate that geo-political and climate related factors cost Unilever currently up to €300 million a year.”\nMany companies are working hard to address the issue. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, established in 2004, brings together palm oil producers, traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers and NGOs to improve environmental and social criteria for the certification of sustainable palm oil. The roundtable boasts that 13.20 million tonnes of palm oil is RSPO certified, amounting to 19% of the global volume. Palm oil certification is expensive for farmers to obtain and has yet to solve issues of deforestation or poverty.\nBeyond certification, companies are setting ambitious targets. Unilever’s touchstone Sustainable Living Plan aims to become carbon positive by 2030 and halt deforestation by 2020. And Nestle is ‘striving for zero’ environmental impact including emissions and deforestation. Yet, ambitious corporate targets are not translating into concrete results on the ground. Recent reports demonstrate that emissions and deforestation rates are still rising. In advance of 2020, at the Consumer Good Forum, brands admitted that reaching zero deforestation targets by the end of the decade is unlikely. The head of sustainability and procurement at Mars, Barry Parkin, is calling for strategies that go beyond certification that consider “new theories of change.”\nCurrent efforts aren’t cutting it\nDespite these ambitious efforts, the situation in Malaysia and Indonesia remains bleak and deforestation continues at alarming rates. In Borneo, only 43 percent of its original lowland rainforests remained by 2015. Lowland rainforests are optimal for palm oil production plants but are also home to many rare species. The consequences of deforestation extend beyond biodiversity loss to land degradation, droughts and forest fires, which interact to further increase emissions.\nEven if companies successfully meet ambitious zero deforestation targets, halting deforestation may prevent further increases in emissions, but is unlikely to restore societal and environmental resilience to future shocks. If certification and deforestation targets are not the solution, then what is?\nLessons for business\nHow can business leaders approach palm oil production differently? Based on our latest article, we offer several suggestions:\n- Focus on a different scale. Firm-centric approaches, such as mitigation and adaptation to the effects of climate change, may keep companies afloat in the meantime, but are unlikely to offer a long-term solution. Mitigation and adaptation aim to enhance firm performance and respond to the effects of the problem, but do little to consider the eco-systems on which the companies depend. Complex interactions in local societies and ecosystems go unnoticed and leave companies vulnerable to future disturbances. New approaches should consider how to develop healthy ecosystems that can continue to provide services for the local community and companies for decades to come.\n- Look closer. When considering the intricacies of ecosystems, managers can monitor slow variables and feedbacks. Slow variables such as the amount of soil organic matter, insect populations or the level of rainfall can control how an ecosystem functions. Managers can identify the slow variables that govern how ecosystems behave and what levels of these variables puts the ecosystem at danger. Feedbacks offer managers warning signals that changes are occurring and allow to detect when ecosystems may be at risk. Managers can seek to tighten their recognition and action to feedback loops in order to minimize time delays and improve chances of avoiding ecosystem collapse.\n- Manage ecosystem diversity and redundancy. Moderate levels of diversity and redundancy allow ecosystems to thrive. When a disturbance strikes, response diversity allows ecosystems to react in numerous ways. Redundancy provides substitute functions when elements that preform similar functions fail. When diversity and redundancy are compromised, ecosystems become brittle and vulnerable to even small disturbances. Firms can move beyond halting deforestation by actively building viable business models for land restoration. For example, effective cropping system diversification can lead to landscape restoration, increased economic viability and enhanced ecosystem resilience.\nAs companies such as Mars are calling for an overhaul in corporate efforts to tackle deforestation, we hope these lessons offer some inspiration.\nWilliams, A., Whiteman, G., & Kennedy, S.

{"question":"How does modern aerial surveillance technology handle detection challenges, and what are its implications for wildlife conservation?","answer":"Modern aerial surveillance technology, specifically holographic radar, can effectively handle detection challenges by producing complete 3D images of airspace and distinguishing between different types of moving targets. This technology, which was originally developed to track military shells, can now reliably differentiate between various aerial objects, even in challenging conditions like near wind farms. Regarding wildlife conservation implications, aerial structures pose significant risks to bird and bat populations. Studies have documented collision rates varying from 0 to over 50 collisions per structure per year. The impact is particularly concerning for certain species - population models show that even small increases (0.1%) in annual mortality rates can cause significant decreases in bird and bat populations, especially affecting short-lived species with high reproductive rates.","context":["In November 2017, Thales – the Paris-headquartered electronics group – made a noteworthy acquisition. Its target was Aveillant, a Cambridge, UK-based start-up that has pioneered a technology called holographic radar.\nAveillant’s “3D holographic radar” does away with the familiar radar sweep in favour of a flat-panel phased array that effectively stares in all directions continuously, with “hundreds” of beams. The result – made possible by computing power that 20 years ago could only have been achieved using a Cray supercomputer – is to produce a 3D image that characterises targets and gives range, direction and altitude.\nThe technology was first tested from late 2012 at an installation near Cambridge airport – not, incidentally, in the vicinity of Wadlow wind farm. Wind farms – arrays of big, spinning blades – pose a particular challenge to normal radar systems, but the Aveillant technique promises to distinguish reliably between wind farm Doppler returns and aircraft of all sizes and speeds. The first airport installation came last summer, at Paris Charles de Gaulle, to detect drones.\nAt the time of those first trials, chief executive David Crisp told FlightGlobal that the technology, originally devised to track shells on military gunnery ranges, could be described as “disruptive” but not as a replacement for standard air traffic management radar; rather, it should be deployed as an extra layer of detection in difficult areas.\nIndeed, Thales announced its acquisition as “a new capability complementing its surveillance offering”, adding that holographic radars provide “a permanent and complete picture of the total air space volume”. The technique, in short, “is ideally adapted to the growing drone market, enabling the detection, tracking and classification of very small, moving targets such as UAVs.”\nAs Thales’s head of unmanned air systems traffic management (UTM), Olivier Rea, puts it, the acquisition “shows our commitment” to safe drone operations.\nFor the UAV community generally, and Thales as a company developing UTM systems to manage operations in ordinary civil airspace, Rea believes the key challenge for the coming year or so is to demonstrate that unmanned systems can be operated safely. But, he notes, while the systems have matured greatly, they are not yet at a level where large-scale operations can be safely undertaken. As he puts it, the US Federal Aviation Administration is telling the UAV industry that it could change regulations to accommodate them and, rightly, asks: “But can you comply?” The answer today, says Rea, is “no”. So, now is the time to show that it can be done.\nBut operating in safety is just one element in an array of issues facing drone operators and companies such as Thales. When trying to introduce UAV operations, it is a mistake to think of air traffic control as one system, operated with central oversight by national air navigation service providers (ANSPs) such as the FAA or Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates the various national providers in Europe. It is also missing a key element to think of UTM as having to deal with large, co-ordinated airspace zones.\nTo understand that distinction, note that the traditional market for Thales, says Rea, is ordinary air traffic control (ATC). But the company has been investing in adjacent markets, and one of those, naturally, is UTM. This is still aviation, it is still air traffic control and it is still dealing with flying objects. But, he says, the big challenge is that in practice, for the foreseeable future, any UTM system will be dealing with very small segments of air space – the tight corridor of a parcel delivery operation, for example.\nSo, it will be necessary to have a very high degree of automation if large numbers of drones are going to safely share that space; Thales describes its UTM effort as directed towards the development of a “digital platform” able to connect operational, safety and security needs of UAS operators.\nAnd, he says, because drones are disruptive technologically and commercially, UTM systems will need to be paid for by a services-based business model which will vary by country. Rea cites the example of highway tolls, which are common in some countries and rare or nonexistent in others.\nFor ANSPs, he stresses, capital expenditure budgets are limited and, today, are being largely consumed by preparations for the US NextGen and European SESAR transformations of ATC. Without that centralised investment capability, any UTM system can move forward only if it is supported by a pay-for-service funding model. Thus, Rea envisions UTM being – for now – separate from ATC, and also divided into a low-altitude zone, for operations below 500ft, and soon a high-altitude zone, above 60,000ft. In between is the domain of ordinary civil air traffic, managed by normal ATC.\nHowever, he hopes that in 10 or 15 years’ time there will be only one, seamless notion of “ATC”; segregation, he says, “is a first step, it should not be seen as the final step.”\nThere is, though, another important aspect to this problem of creating a UTM system that eventually converges with ATC. What we do in developing UTM, says Rea, will influence the broader system of air traffic management. ATC evolves slowly, he says, because airlines’ operations cannot be changed quickly. Also, ATC as it exists today is a robust system with long-established standards of redundancy, safety and resilience. But UTM is a clean-sheet project in support of novel operations based on new technology, and so is fast-evolving with much “learning by working”. Rea sees an opportunity to “build the environment we expect”, in terms of technology, regulations and business models. Beyond that, he says, comes the question of convergence with ATC.\nThat convergence, he stresses, will be “a long journey”. But Rea sees attitudes changing. Where UAVs were once a safety and capacity worry, they are now seen as an opportunity. If ANSP fees are capped, unmanned services represent new revenue. At the highest level, he notes, just three years ago in Europe, SESAR was thought of as ATC, with the military looking after drones. But now, UTM is regarded as falling under the SESAR umbrella – which makes sense if the longer-term goal is integration.\nNEW YORK TRIALS\nA Thales concept for unmanned aerial system traffic management (UTM) is playing a role in NASA and US Federal Aviation Administration efforts to develop an unmanned air vehicle traffic management (UTM) system that can be handed over to the FAA next year.\nIntroduced last year and selected by the FAA in October to support its Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC), Thales’s ECOsystem UTM concept is described as a flexible, cyber-secure digital platform that “bridges the gap between safety and security requirements of authorities and operational needs of civil users of unmanned systems”. LAANC aims to simplify the process for small UAV operators to comply with US regulations, and eventually integrate their operations into US national airspace.\nLast month, NASA has formally brought Thales on board through a Space Act Agreement to evaluate low-altitude UAV airspace control for flights below 400ft. Thales is working with other NASA partners at the FAA's test site, at Griffiss International airport in Rome, New York.\nNASA's UTM development scheme assumes a high degree of automation to monitor individual vehicles, leaving human operators to make strategic decisions related to initiation, continuation, and termination of operations. Field testing at FAA sites has been ongoing since 2015, including work on beyond-line-of-sight operations in sparsely populated areas. In spring 2018, evaluations will focus on technologies that maintain safe spacing between co-operative (responsive) and non-co-operative (non-responsive) UAVs over moderately populated areas.\nSubsequent testing will focus on operations in higher-density urban areas for tasks such as news-gathering and package delivery, along with management of \"large-scale contingencies\".\nOlivier Rea, head of UTM solutions at Thales, says the NASA agreement gives the company access to the US market as a \"full provider\". Since Space Act Agreements are typically signed with US companies, he adds: \"It’s a big step for us.\"","Impacts on biodiversity of exploitation of renewable energy sources: the example of birds and bats – facts, gaps in knowledge, demands for further research, and ornithological guidelines for the development of renewable energy exploitation.\nThe purpose of this report is to collect and to evaluate the available information on the impacts of exploitation of renewable energy sources on birds and bats. The focus is on wind energy as there is only little information on the impact on birds and bats of other sources of renewable energy. The report aims at better understanding the size of the impact, the potential effects of re-powering (exchanging small old wind turbines by new big turbines), and possible measures to reduce the negative impact on birds by wind turbines. In addition the need for further research is highlighted.\nThe evaluation is based on 127 separate studies (wind farms) in ten countries, most of them in Germany. Most studies were brief (not more than two years) and did not include the preconstruction period. Before-After Control Impact studies that combine data collection before and after, in this case construction of a wind farm, on both the proposed development site and at least one reference site were rare. In only a few cases, would the design of the study and the length of the study period theoretically allow statistically significant effects of wind farms on birds and bats to be found at all. Assessments of impacts, therefore, are usually based on few studies only. This report includes all studies readily available to the authors, irrespective of the length of the study period and the quality of the study design. In order to base the assessments on as many independent samples as possible even rather unsystematic observations were included. The information of the data was reduced to a level that justified the application of sign tests. The compilation of many different individual studies gave the following results:\nThe main potential hazards to birds and bats from wind farms are disturbance leading to displacement or exclusion and collision mortality. Although there is a high degree of agreement among experts that wind farms may have negative impacts on bird populations no statistically significant evidence of negative impacts on populations of breeding birds could be found. There was a tendency waders nesting on open grounds to be displaced by wind farms. Some passerines obviously profited from wind farms. They were probably affected by secondary impacts, e.g. changes in land management or abandonment from agricultural use next to the wind plants.\nThe impact of wind farms on non-breeding birds was stronger. Wind farms had significantly negative effects on local populations of geese, Wigeons, Golden Plovers and Lapwings.\nWith the exceptions of Lapwings, Black-tailed Godwits and Redshanks most bird species used the space close to wind turbines during the breeding season. The minimal distances observed between birds and pylons rarely exceeded 100 m during the breeding season. Some passerines showed a tendency to settle closer to bigger than to smaller wind turbines.\nDuring the non-breeding season many bird species of open landscapes avoided approaching wind parks closer than a few hundred metres. This particularly held true for geese and waders. In accordance with published information disturbance of geese may occur at least up to 500 m from wind turbines. For most species during the non-breeding season, the distances at which disturbance could be noted increased with the size of the wind turbines. For Lapwings this relationship was statistically significant. There was no evidence that birds generally became „habituated“ to wind farms in the years after their construction. The results of the few studies lasting longer than one season revealed about as many cases of birds occurring closer to wind farms (indications for the existence of habituation) over the years as those of birds occurring further away from wind farms (indications for the lack of habituation).\nThe question whether wind farms act as barriers to movement of birds has so far received relatively little systematic scientific attention. Wind farms are thought to be barriers if birds approaching them change their flight direction, both on migration or during other regular flights.\nThere is evidence for the occurrence of a barrier effect in 81 bird species. Geese, Common Cranes, waders and small passerines were affected in particular. However, the extent to which the disturbances due to wind farms of migrating or flying birds influences energy budgets or the timing of migration of birds remains unknown.\nCollision rates (annual number of killed individuals per turbine) have only rarely been studied with appropriate methods (e. g. with controls of scarvenger activities). In particular, such studies are missing for Germany. Collision rates varied between 0 and more than 50 collisions per turbine per year for both birds and bats. Obviously the habitat influenced the number of collisions. Birds were at high risks at wind farms close to wetlands where gulls were the most common victims and at wind farms on mountain ridges (USA, Spain), where many raptors were killed. Wind farms in or close to forests posed high collision risks for bats. For both birds and bats, the collision risk increased with increasing size of the wind turbine. The relationship, however, was not statistically significant.\nGulls and raptors accounted for most of the victims. In Germany the relatively high numbers of White-tailed Eagles (13) and Red Kites (41) killed give cause for concern. Germany hosts about half of the world population of breeding Red Kites and has a particular responsibility for this species. Bird species that were easily disturbed by wind farms (geese, waders) were only rarely found among the victims. Bats were struck by wind turbines mostly in late summer or autumn during the period of migration and dispersal.\nPopulation models created by the software VORTEX revealed that significant decreases in size of bird and bat populations may be caused by relatively small (0,1 %) additive increases in annual mortality rates, provided they are not counter acted by density dependent increases in reproduction rates. Short-lived species with high reproductive rates are more affected than long-lived species with low reproductive rates. The latter, however, are less able to substitute additional mortality by increasing reproductive rates.\nThe effects of „repowering“ (substitution of old, small turbines by new turbines with higher capacity) on birds and bats is assessed by the available data and by simple models. There is no information, however, on the effects of the newest generation of very large wind turbines. According to current knowledge, repowering will reduce negative impacts on birds and bats (disturbance and mortality) if the total capacity of a wind farm is not changed (many small turbines are replaced by few big turbines). In a scenario in which the capacity of a wind farm is increased 1.5 fold, negative impacts start to dominate. In case of a doubling of wind farm capacity, repowering increases the negative impacts of the wind farm. Repowering offers the chance to remove wind farms from sites that are associated with high impacts or risks for birds and bats. New turbines could be constructed on sites that are likely to be less problematic with respect to birds and bats.\nEffective methods of reducing the negative impacts of wind energy use on birds and bats include:\n- choice of the right site for wind farms (avoidance of wetands, woodlands, important sites for sensitive non-breeding birds and mountain ridges with high numbers of raptors and vultures),\n- measures to reduce the attractivness of wind farm sites for potential collision victims,\n- configuration of turbines within wind farms (placement of turbines parallel to and not accross the main migration or flight directions of birds),\n- construction of wind turbines: replacement of lattice towers, wire-cables and overhead power lines.\nMeasures to increase the visibility of wind turbines and to reduce the effects of illumination remain to be studied.\nIn spite of many publications on windfarms and birds there still is a great demand for further research. First of all there is an urgent need for reliable data on collision rates at wind turbines of birds and bats in Germany. This holds true particularly for the new and big turbines which will replace the present generation of wind turbines.\nIt is still unclear whether these big and necessarily illuminated turbines pose a high collision risk to nocturnal migrants which have not yet been greatly affected by smaller turbines. The high collision rates of Red Kites in Germany also merit urgently study. The aim of the research has to be a quick reduction of the collision rates. The sensitivity to wind farms of many other bird species that are of particular nature conservation interest (storks, raptors, Cranes) has not yet been sufficiently studied.\nThere is hardly any information on the impacts of arrays of solar panels on birds and bats. Studies should be initiated as soon as possible."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dae88bf3-a821-4f2a-9ae5-356da142fc3a>","<urn:uuid:94aae7dd-018c-48dc-b84c-619735491aee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare how researchers study and identify risk factors for Parkinson's Disease versus Alzheimer's Disease - what are the main differences in research approaches and data sources?","answer":"The research approaches for these diseases differ significantly in methodology and scale. Parkinson's Disease research is moving toward big data analysis, requiring massive computing power (two terabyte servers) to process Medicare records combined with EPA environmental data. This approach allows researchers to identify new environmental toxins and geographic patterns, such as clustering in specific U.S. regions. In contrast, Alzheimer's Disease research focuses more on clinical factors and specific risk indicators, including genetic predisposition, age, gender (being female), heart and blood vessel problems, and family history. The identification of Alzheimer's risk factors relies more on traditional clinical studies and post-mortem brain tissue examination, while Parkinson's research is expanding into machine learning and large-scale data analysis to discover previously unknown environmental risk factors.","context":["Studies that analyze huge, complex data sets, known as big data, may provide a new way to identify environmental factors that increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and thus inform prevention efforts, according to Brad Racette, M.D., during an Oct. 18 lecture at NIEHS.\n“Big data is often characterized by the three Vs — the extreme volume of the data, the velocity at which the data [is generated and] must be processed, and the variety of data that can be incorporated,” said Racette, from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. These studies require such massive computing power that two terabyte servers are barely adequate for Racette’s data analysis.\nBy comparison, most PD studies are small enough to analyze on a single personal computer. Typically based in neurology clinics, these studies may underrepresent certain populations. Moreover, as Racette pointed out, such efforts have limited ability to examine environmental factors.\nRacette wants to combine years of Medicare records with detailed environmental data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He would then use an analytical technique called machine learning to look for patterns between environmental exposures and PD. “Let it spit out 25 new environmental toxins that we don’t know about,” said Racette. “I think that actually would change the field more than picking at the same environmental exposures for the next decade.”\nBig data reveals important patterns\nUsing the Medicare data, Racette’s lab has already found patterns missed by clinic-based studies. His team reported a geographic clustering of PD cases in the Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.\nSuspecting environmental influences, Racette and his colleagues used data from the EPA Toxics Release Inventory to study PD and local releases of manganese, copper, and lead — pollutants associated with the region’s industries. The team found 1.78 times more PD cases in urban counties with high manganese releases compared with urban counties with low manganese releases. They also observed a relationship, although it was weaker, between copper releases and PD.\nRacette is also looking for symptoms of prodromal PD, or the period before motor control is impaired. Referring to this as the holy grail of PD, he and his colleagues launched a study of 90,000 cases and 120,000 control subjects. Earlier diagnosis may increase opportunities for effective treatments, said Racette, which have been elusive. He underscored the need for disease prevention, which is also a priority for NIEHS.\nCindy Lawler, Ph.D., head of the NIEHS Genes, Environment, and Health branch, agreed. “Prevention may be where you have the biggest impact,” she said. “If we can remove key exposures, we may be able to prevent the process of Parkinson’s from starting.”\nSpecial funding mechanism enabled innovation\nRacette’s funding includes a grant, called a K24, tailored to clinician-researchers who want to develop new projects and mentor junior scientists. “You have to understand this disease in order to study it,” said Racette, who has spent 20 years caring for Parkinson’s patients.\n“The K24 grant has really supported innovation and the ability to mentor trainees on [the] high risk projects that have led to the work I’m presenting here,” he added. High risk is a term researchers use for studies that go in a new direction, without a base of previous findings to point the way.\n“We don’t have many cases where clinicians were looking at patients and making this kind of connection,” said Carol Shreffler, Ph.D., program officer in the NIEHS Exposure, Response, and Technology branch. “This grant really helped him focus in on the environmental exposures.”\nWright Willis A, Evanoff BA, Lian M, Criswell SR, Racette BA. 2010.

Research shows that certain changes in the brain lead to Alzheimer disease.\nYou are more likely to develop Alzheimer disease if you:\n- Are older -- Developing Alzheimer disease is not a part of normal aging.\n- Have a close relative, such as a brother, sister, or parent with Alzheimer disease.\n- Have certain genes linked to Alzheimer disease.\nThe following may also increase the risk:\n- Being female\n- Having heart and blood vessel problems due to high cholesterol\n- History of head trauma\nThere are two types of Alzheimer disease:\n- Early onset Alzheimer disease -- Symptoms appear before age 60. This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified.\n- Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear.\nAlzheimer disease symptoms include difficulty with many areas of mental function, including:\n- Emotional behavior or personality\n- Thinking and judgment (cognitive skills)\nAlzheimer disease usually first appears as forgetfulness.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging, and the development of Alzheimer disease. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease.\nSymptoms of MCI include:\n- Difficulty performing more than one task at a time\n- Difficulty solving problems\n- Forgetting recent events or conversations\n- Taking longer to perform more difficult activities\nEarly symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include:\n- Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines\n- Getting lost on familiar routes\n- Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects\n- Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood\n- Misplacing items\n- Personality changes and loss of social skills\nAs Alzheimer disease becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include:\n- Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night\n- Delusions, depression, and agitation\n- Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving\n- Difficulty reading or writing\n- Forgetting details about current events\n- Forgetting events in one's life history and losing self-awareness\n- Hallucinations, arguments, striking out, and violent behavior\n- Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger\n- Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences\n- Withdrawing from social contact\nPeople with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer:\n- Recognize family members\n- Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing\n- Understand language\nOther symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease:\n- Problems controlling bowel movements or urine\n- Swallowing problems\nExams and Tests\nA skilled health care provider can often diagnose Alzheimer disease with the following steps:\n- Performing a complete physical exam, including a nervous system exam\n- Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms\n- Mental function tests (mental status examination)\nA diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made when certain symptoms are present, and by making sure other causes of dementia are not present.\nTests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including:\n- Brain tumor\n- Long-term (chronic) infection\n- Intoxication from medicines\n- Severe depression\n- Increased fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus)\n- Thyroid disease\n- Vitamin deficiency\nThe only way to know for certain that someone has Alzheimer disease is to examine a sample of their brain tissue after death.\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer disease. The goals of treatment are:\n- Slow the progression of the disease (although this is difficult to do)\n- Manage symptoms, such as behavior problems, confusion, and sleep problems\n- Change the home environment to make daily activities easier\n- Support family members and other caregivers\nMedicines are used to:\n- Slow the rate at which symptoms worsen, though the benefit from using these drugs may be small\n- Control problems with behavior, such as loss of judgment or confusion\nBefore using these medicines, ask the provider:\n- What are the side effects? Is the medicine worth the risk?\n- When is the best time, if any, to use these medicines?\n- Do medicines for other health problems need to be changed or stopped?\nSomeone with Alzheimer disease will need support in the home as the disease gets worse. Family members or other caregivers can help by helping the person cope with memory loss and behavior and sleep problems. It is important to make sure the home of a person who has Alzheimer disease is safe for them.\nHaving Alzheimer disease or caring for a person with the condition may be a challenge. You can ease the stress of illness by seeking support through Alzheimer disease resources. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nHow quickly Alzheimer disease gets worse is different for each person. If Alzheimer disease develops quickly, it is more likely to worsen quickly.\nPeople with Alzheimer disease often die earlier than normal, although a person may live anywhere from 3 to 20 years after diagnosis.\nFamilies will likely need to plan for their loved one's future care.\nThe final phase of the disease may last from a few months to several years. During that time, the person becomes totally disabled. Death usually occurs from an infection or organ failure.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall the provider if:\n- Alzheimer disease symptoms develop or a person has a sudden change in mental status\n- The condition of a person with Alzheimer disease gets worse\n- You are unable to care for a person with Alzheimer disease at home\nAlthough there is no proven way to prevent Alzheimer disease, there are some measures that may help prevent or slow the onset of Alzheimer disease:\n- Stay on a low-fat diet and eat foods high in omega-3 fatty acids.\n- Get plenty of exercise.\n- Stay mentally and socially active.\n- Wear a helmet during risky activities to prevent brain injury.\nKnopman DS.

{"question":"Can you compare the pest management approaches recommended for corn in both the Department of Agriculture's IPM program and Ontario's corn protection guidelines?","answer":"The Department of Agriculture's IPM approach for corn emphasizes cultural and chemical control methods, including proper disposal of infected plants, seed treatment with thiram or captan (120 grams per 50 kg seeds), and selecting resistant varieties like Philippine DMR Composite 2. In contrast, Ontario's guidelines focus specifically on earworm control through monitoring with Heliothis traps and pheromone lures, followed by targeted insecticide sprays every 3-7 days while fresh silks are present. The spray intervals are adjusted based on trap counts and temperature. Both approaches aim to reduce chemical usage - IPM promotes using pesticides as a last resort, while Ontario's system uses precise monitoring to optimize spray timing.","context":["SORSOGON CITY, SORSOGON – The Department of Agriculture Regulatory Division will reactivate the Integrated Pest Management (IPM). This time, with focus on multi-commodity crops.\nThis was announced by DA-Bicol Regulatory Division Chief Rosita M. Imperial during the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Consultative Meeting Cum Planning Workshop held on August 23, 2018, this city. The said activity was attended by IPM Coordinators from nine municipalities in the province, the Provincial Agriculturist Dr. Ma. Teresa V. Destura, and agriculturists from the Provincial Agriculture Office.\nThe consultative meeting cum planning workshop aims to strengthen the DA’s partnerships with LGUs on IPM Management. With the DA’s institutional restructuring and paradigm resetting, the Regulatory Division was designated to conduct plant pests and diseases surveillance and monitoring which used to be one of the Regional Crop Protection Center’s (RCPC) functions.\nIPM is intended to reduce the levels of crop pests and diseases and limit the inappropriate use of chemicals, provide alternatives for pest and disease management and boost product yield and quality, thereby increasing farmers’ income. It also contributes to a healthy, safe and resilient ecosystem through sustainable pest management.\nDA-Bicol Agriculturist Cyndie Pardo shared insights on common insect pests of rice and their management. Among the insect pests on rice are whorl maggot, leaffolder, armyworm, grasshoppers, planthoppers, leafhoppers, black bug, mole cricket, stem borer and rice bug. Pardo highlights that cultural practices such as good land preparation, fertilizer management and planting of resistant varieties; habitat manipulation or ecological engineering and use of pesticide as the last resort are effective IPM for rice.\nMeanwhile, Science Research Specialist Norman Concepcion discussed the pests and diseases on corn. Some of the common insect pests on corn are the corn borer, corn earworm, corn seedling maggot, white grub, armyworm, corn semilooper, corn aphids, and oriental migratory locust. Concepcion also noted the cultural and chemical control methods in pest management such as proper disposal of infected plants at harvest, treating seeds with slurry with thiram or captan at 120 grams per 50 kilogram seeds, selecting resistant varieties like the Philippine DMR Composite 2.\nMoreover, Senior Agriculturist Edith Pelin lectured on the pests and diseases of cacao. These include the symptoms and control measures for cacao pod borer, mealy bug, mired bugs, twig borer or coffee carpenter, cacao podrot, stem canker and vascular streak dieback (VSD).\nPelin underscored that prevention, identification of plant disease, diagnosing severity and application of appropriate treatments are the key steps of integrated disease management.\nJustine Guerrero, IPM Focal Person of Gubat and Nikka Angelu H. Torres, IPM Focal Person of Magallanes said that the consultation meeting and planning workshop was very beneficial to them because it refreshed their knowledge on crop pests and diseases and IPM.\nSince frontline service provider ako sa LGU, it will help especially sa mga farmers who depend greatly, if not solely, sa paggamit ng chemicals to control yung pest and diseases sa crops. Bukod sa mababawasan ang gastos nila, somehow magiging sustainable po yung way of farming nila (Since I am a frontline service provider at the LGU, it will help especially to farmers who depend greatly, if not solely, in using chemicals to control crop pests and diseases. It will reduce their production costs and will somehow, make farming more sustainable),” Guerrero said.\nGuerrero and Torres plan to disseminate the information on IPM to farmers in their respective municipalities during Farmers’ Meeting. They will also train and orient local farmer technicians and Barangay Agricultural and Fishery Council (BAFC) on IPM.\nLGU and PLGU-IPM Coordinators are required to submit monthly reports on plant pest and diseases surveillance to the Regulatory Division. (Annielyn L. Baleza, DA-RAFIS 5)","Table of Contents\nThe corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea, formerly known as Heliothis zea) is a major pest of late-season sweet corn in Ontario and is responsible for a large percentage of grade-out corn. Earworms feed almost exclusively on the tips of the ears, leaving no visible damage on the husks or leaves. Fall armyworms - another late-season pest - feed extensively on the leaves, and often enter the ears through the side. European corn borers, which are present throughout the season, feed on all parts of the corn plant. Most farmers consider an intensive spray program necessary to control these pests.\nThe earworm has a wide host range, feeding on many cultivated crops and weeds. Elsewhere in its range, it is also known as the cotton bollworm, tomato fruitworm or tobacco budworm. In Ontario, however, it is a major problem only on sweet corn. Most seed corn fields are harvested before the worst of the earworm damage, and the damage to field corn is not considered economic.\nThe corn earworm is one of several pests that does not overwinter in Ontario. The entire population is killed by low winter temperatures. Each spring, the moths must reestablish themselves in Ontario, from the overwintering populations in the southern United States and Mexico. They begin their northward migration around May and usually reach Ontario sometime in August. Since moths are not strong enough to fly that distance on their own, they are carried by high-level winds. The warm southerly winds that blow into Ontario in the summer carry the moths long distances. These winds often bring rain, which commonly brings the moths back to earth.\nSince their migration is so weather-dependent, the moths arrive in Ontario at different times each summer. Although they may arrive in late July some years, at other times they may not arrive until September.\nEarworm distribution in Ontario also differs each year. While generally found in higher numbers in the counties that border Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, they may not infest parts of the province some years. For example, in 1994 there were no reports of earworms from any sites east of Toronto. Even when earworms are present in large numbers in one area, other corn fields that are only a few kilometres away may not be infested.\nThere are four stages in the corn earworm's life cycle. Earworms arrive in Ontario as moths. The moths lay eggs, which then hatch into larvae (caterpillars). After feeding for two to four weeks, the larvae become pupae. In Ontario, larvae are typically killed by frost before pupation. In warmer climates, adult moths emerge from the pupae to repeat the cycle.\nThe corn earworm adult is a buff- or tan-colored moth with a wingspread of 3.5 to 4 cm (1.25 to 1.5 inches) (Figure 1). The forewing may have several darker markings and always has a central brown dot, clearly visible on the underside of the wing and faintly visible from the top. The hindwings are very pale in color, with a darker brown border. Eyes of living moths are bright green, which fade to dull olive green or brown a few days after death. There is no easy way to differentiate male from female moths.\nFigure 1. Corn earworm moth.\nAlthough earworms may lay their eggs anywhere on the corn plant, almost all will be laid on fresh silks if these are available. Although eggs are laid individually, one female can lay over 100 each night, and over 1000 during her lifetime. Each egg is nearly spherical, and about the same color and diameter as a corn silk (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Most eggs are laid on the outer third of the silks and hatch in 2 to 10 days, depending on the temperature.\nFigure 2. Corn earworm egg on fresh silk (actual size).\nFigure 3. Egg magnified 10 times.\nUpon hatching, young earworms (Figure 4) crawl down the silks toward the ear. After feeding on the silks inside the husk for a few days, they begin feeding on the kernels at the ear tip. The worms will grow up to 3.7 cm long (1.5 inches), with prominent stripes running the length of their bodies (Figure 5). The size and the presence of stripes differentiate earworms from European corn borers, while their head color (tan) differentiates them from fall armyworms. See Table 1 for more complete descriptions of these three pests.\nFigure 4. Corn earworm larva, recently hatched. Note the stripes running longitudinally.\nFigure 5. Fully grown larva, up to 3.7 cm (1.5 inches) long. Note the stripes and the tan-colored head.\nWhen corn earworms are present, all sweet corn with exposed fresh silk is susceptible to damage. Corn in the tassel stage does not need to be protected from earworms but may be attacked by other pests. Where sequential plantings are located close together, the field with the most fresh silk will likely receive the bulk of the egg-laying; other fields, however, are not immune.\nEarworms normally feed only on the kernels of sweet corn, beginning by feeding at the tip of the ear and moving down the ear as they grow. Feeding is almost always confined to the top third of the ear. Fecal matter is found as large moist pellets in the silk channel and at the ear tip. Earworms do not bore into the cob, as European corn borers and fall armyworms sometimes do.\nAlthough earworms damage only a small percentage of the kernels, their presence and droppings are very distasteful to most consumers. Where control has been less than perfect in the field, growers are forced to check ears at harvest and cull the damaged ones. Earworm-infested ears can sometimes still be marketed if the tips are cut off, although this practice significantly reduces the shelf life of the corn. Sweet corn destined for the processing plant may be able to sustain some earworm damage at the ear tips, as the tips are not used in the finished product.\n* A hand lens is the most reliable means of separating corn borers from the other two species.\nIn addition to direct damage, earworms can also predispose the crop to attack by other pests. Sap beetles will be attracted to the smell of fermenting sugars after earworms begin feeding on sweet corn kernels. In field corn, ear molds developing in the damaged kernels can cause toxicity problems for livestock.\nThe biology of the corn earworm makes it a very good candidate for an on-farm insect-monitoring program. The pest is present only at certain times of the year, its distribution is sporadic, and a cheap, effective monitoring method gives growers adequate time to implement a control program once the pest has been detected.\nOMAFRA monitors corn earworms and other sweet corn pests at several sites across the province. Information about pest activity in your local area can be obtained by calling a regional vegetable agriphone. While regional information is helpful, it is not as reliable as insect counts from traps located on your own farm.\nCorn earworms are monitored using a Heliothis trap, manufactured by Scentry Inc. (Figure 6) A pheromone lure (corn earworm Luretape manufactured by Hercon), which imitates the female earworm's sex attractant, is placed in the trap. Male earworm moths are attracted to the lure and are caught inside the trap. Since pheromone traps only catch males, they cannot be used to control an infestation. Their value lies in detecting the presence of the pest and in estimating the size of the infestation. (For information about ordering traps, call your local Pest Management Advisor.)\nFigure 6. A Heliothis trap, baited with a pheromone lure, is a simple way to monitor for corn earworms\nSweet corn growers should use at least two Heliothis traps to monitor for earworms. Place one trap per field in the two corn fields that are farthest apart. If two traps are used in a single field, place them at opposite ends. Move traps as often as necessary to ensure that each trap is always next to a field with fresh silk. Establish traps in early July, then check them twice a week. Replace the pheromone lure every two weeks. (Store extra lures in the refrigerator or freezer.)\nMost years, the first earworms will not be trapped until sometime in August. When moths are caught in the traps, compare them with Figure 1 to see if they are earworms and not a similar species. After the first earworms arrive, begin checking the traps three times a week. Continue monitoring until the last planting no longer has any fresh silk showing.\nBefore modern insecticides became available, corn growers applied mineral oil to the silk of each ear to prevent invasion by corn earworms. This method is still used occasionally by some organic farmers and home gardeners. It effectively controls the pest, but is time-consuming and the oil left at the ear tip may be distasteful to consumers.\nSeveral predators and parasites, including ladybird beetles, lacewings, predatory bugs, and parasitic flies and wasps, attack earworm eggs and larvae. These beneficial insects, present naturally in the field, exert an ongoing influence in keeping the pest population in check. They are not, however, adequate for economic control. To date, no commercially available biological control agents will effectively control the earworm.\nThose who want to avoid earworm damage without the use of insecticides must plant early. Sweet corn harvested before the middle of August is usually free of earworms. After that time, insecticides are necessary to protect the crop.\nCorn earworms can be controlled with insecticide sprays applied every three to seven days while fresh silks are present. For best results, sprays should be based on trap counts and temperature. (See Table 2 for spray intervals.) Since there is more risk of damage, spray intervals are shortened as the earworm population increases. Intervals are also shortened as the temperature increases, because unexposed silks are growing faster and because the insecticides break down more rapidly.\nThe choice of insecticide is very important in controlling earworms, which have developed resistance to some insecticides in the carbamate family (such as Sevin and Furadan) and are no longer controlled by these chemicals. They can be controlled by synthetic pyrethroids; currently available products are listed in OMAFRA Publication 363, Vegetable Production Recommendations.\nSince egg-laying occurs at dusk and since pyrethroids are more effective in cool temperatures, it is best to spray in the evening. Aim the nozzles at the ear zone and ensure that the silks are well covered.\nFor more information:\nToll Free: 1-877-424-1300"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b5532d41-a56c-4054-9ff4-a5926432a5b4>","<urn:uuid:14173ac3-a740-42cf-b1ab-72feaa5590ed>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why did Mexico City remove the Columbus statue, and how does this relate to broader heritage issues?","answer":"Mexico City removed the Columbus statue in October 2020, officially citing conservation work but likely to prevent damage during planned protests. The city later decided to replace it with a reproduction of the Young Lady of Amajac sculpture. This decision reflects broader efforts to decolonize the country's history and settle 'historical debts' with Indigenous populations. This connects to Mexico's larger cultural heritage initiatives, as the country has been actively working to reclaim lost heritage since 1911 and currently campaigns internationally against the sale of pre-Hispanic artifacts, considering them national patrimony that 'is not for sale.'","context":["Debate about Public Monuments The Misuse of Archaeological Heritage in Mexico\nStatue of Aztec ruler Cuauhtémoc, Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City, Mexico | Photo (Detail): Crossland, D. © picture alliance / imageBROKER\nIn September 2021 the authorities in Mexico City decided to replace the Christopher Columbus monument by a statue of an Indigenous woman aiming to decolonise the country's past. Archaeologist Daniel Salinas explains why the use of archaeological artefacts of pre-colonial times is not enough to decolonise the Mexican state.After a year of controversy, in October 2021 Mexico City’s government announced that a reproduction of a recently discovered archaeological sculpture of a Huastec female leader would replace the famous Christopher Columbus monument in Paseo de la Reforma, one of the capital’s main avenues.\nOn 10th October 2020 the 1877 erected statue of the Genovese sailor was hastily removed. City officials declared that it was due to conservation works, but the timing and manner point towards it being to avoid the statue being toppled or damaged in a demonstration announced for two days later on Día de la Raza, the “day of the race”, a holiday celebrating the Iberoamerican race on the date when Columbus landed in the Americas.\nMonths later, in September 2021, the authorities unilaterally decided and announced that the Columbus statue would be replaced by a monument to Indigenous women made by artist Pedro Reyes. The fact that Reyes is neither Indigenous nor a woman, among other issues, caused a great deal of criticism, which led authorities to backtrack, removing him from the project.\n“The Mexican nation-state has extensively used precolonial Indigenous material culture and aesthetics in its nation-building efforts. Archaeology and heritage have been one of the pillars to construct and strengthen the imagined community which is Mexico.”\nArchaeology, monuments and national identityThe Mexican nation-state has extensively used precolonial Indigenous material culture and aesthetics in its nation-building efforts. Archaeology and heritage have been one of the pillars to construct and strengthen the imagined community which is Mexico. Since very early on after gaining Independence from Spain, cultural and political elites worked on establishing direct links between the ancient Mesoamerican cultures, particularly the Mexica, and the modern Mexican nation as a way of distinguishing it from its former colonial metropole.\nThis can be seen in the establishment of a National Museum by presidential decree in 1825, an institution with a strong pedagogical nature which started to collect precolonial antiquities and other cultural artefacts in an effort to build, define and give meaning to the Mexican nation.\nA Mexica monument which quickly became an iconic element of nationhood is the Sun Stone or “Aztec Calendar”. Discovered in 1790, for many decades it was displayed next to the Cathedral in the Zócalo, Mexico City’s main plaza and political epicentre. In 1885 the stone was transferred to the National Museum and in 1964 it was moved again to the new National Museum of Anthropology, occupying a central place in both of them as one of the star displays. Since the 19th century the Sun Stone has been used and reproduced innumerable times as a symbol of Mexico, prominently in official coins and bills.\nIn the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, Mexico, the “Aztec Calendar” or Sun Stone is visible, a large circular stone relief, to be found in one of the museum's galleries.\nOn 4th January 2021 Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology released the photo of the statue of a female figure unearthed in Hidalgo Amajac, in nearby Alamo Temapache, Veracruz state, Mexico. She is called “Young Lady of Amajac”. Farmers digging in a citrus grove on New Year's Day found the six-foot tall statue of a female figure who may represent an elite woman rather than a goddess, or some mixture of the two.\nMexican Indigenous take part in a tribute to Cuauhtémoc, the last ruler of Mexico- Tenochtitlan, in front of his statue in Mexico City on 28th February 2011. Several Indigenous people commemorated the 486 years of the death of Cuauhtémoc with dances and other activities.\nColumbus monument, Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City, Mexico.\nThe monuments of Cuauhtémoc and Columbus could be seen as a representation of the duality behind the concept of mestizaje, the biological and/or cultural mixing of Indigenous peoples and Europeans, which has been a key aspect in the top down definition of Mexican identity by cultural and political elites since the 19th century.\nIn the post-revolutionary period from the 1920s to the 1940s governments and intellectuals pushed for the consolidation of a national unified mestizo identity, one which acknowledged the Hispanic roots and celebrated the ancient Indigenous past of Mexico, which continued to be embodied by the use and reproduction of archaeological artefacts and motifs in monuments, architecture, art and design. Simultaneously, living Indigenous communities were denigrated and marginalised, for example by strong, state-led Hispanisation, education and development programmes which, in the pursuit of progress and national integration, and together with new mass media and rapid changing lifestyles, decimated Indigenous languages and cultures throughout the 20th century. The percentage of people who spoke an Indigenous language in the country at the beginning of the 19th century was around 65 per cent, by 1950 it had reduced to 9.5 per cent, and today it stands at only six per cent.\nThe Monolith of Coatlinchan is another notorious case of an archaeological statue turned into a public monument. Often thought of as a representation of the Mesoamerican god of rain Tláloc but most likely one of the feminine water deity Chalchihuitlicue, the massive sculpture was removed by force from the town of San Miguel Cotalinchan by the Mexican government in 1964 to be placed at the entrance of the new National Museum of Anthropology, also on Reforma Avenue, where to this day it receives visitors to one of Mexico’s most renowned and visited museums.\nReplacing Columbus for the Young Lady of AmajacThe replacement of the Columbus monument is embedded in broader discursive and commemoration drifts from the federal government which aim to decolonise the country’s history and monuments, settling “historical debts” with the Indigenous population. In August 2021, the 500th anniversary of the fall of Tenochtitlán to the Spanish led armies in 1521 was framed as the “500 years of Indigenous resistance”. The removal of the image of Columbus and the controversial decision to replace it, first by Reyes’ monument of an Indigenous woman – projected as a colossal stone head reminiscent of the ones made by the Olmec – and then by the reproduction of the Young Lady of Amajac, unleashed intense debates.\nVoices like that of anthropologist Sandra Rozental or linguist Yásnaya Aguilar have sharply pointed out how the “Indigenous woman” which the new announced monument will commemorate responds to a category imagined and constructed from an external and exoticising logic which does not refer to an actual person. The replacement is based on the assumption that the appropriation and use of pre-Hispanic objects by the state and their use as symbols of the nation's indigeneity is a neutral and politically correct act.\nIn my view, the removal of the Columbus monument did not respond to genuine decolonisation, but rather a suppression of possible protests stemming from a conservationist and patrimonialist logic. I see the decision to place a reproduction of the Young Lady of Amajac as an easy fix, an apparently neutral answer to the criticisms and controversy surrounding Columbus’ removal and the proposed monument of Reyes. Drawing on a hegemonic and unifying idea of the pre-Hispanic past, Mexican authorities are once again using ancient archaeological artefacts to represent abstract ideas of Indigenous people, women in this case, who indeed have spent five centuries resisting colonial and sexist systems which, despite discursively saying otherwise, the Mexican state is heir and still a part of to this day.","Mexico Is Ramping Up Its Efforts to Repatriate Its Lost Pre-Columbian Heritage—Spelling Trouble for the Market and Museums\nPoliticians and activists are campaigning for the repatriation of these sacred cultural objects.\nNews last month that Citibanamex, Citigroup’s Mexican retail banking arm, would sell its art collection along with the bank prompted the country’s highest official to speak out.\nWhile for some nations art and cultural objects might not be a primary concern upon the sale of a major national bank, the 2,000 artworks whose fates hang in the balance constitute a significant survey of Mexican art history, and for Mexico, preserving cultural heritage is a national priority. Since Mexico’s president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in 2018, his administration has been vocal about its desire to repatriate ancient cultural heritage and nearly 6,000 pieces have been returned to Mexico so far.\nThis policy has been making headlines in the art world as officials have intervened to attempt to block sales of ancient cultural objects from Mexico abroad. The “discovery” and “collection” of these items came after Columbus’s arrival in South America in the fifteenth century—hence the widely used term “Pre-Columbian.”\nCulture minister Alejandra Frausto Guerrero has been outspoken about her stance that the nation’s heritage “is not for sale,” and has stepped in on four auctions over the last three years in New York, Paris, Munich, and Rome. The minister last year told AFP ahead of two auctions in France of pre-Hispanic pieces that Mexican law decrees that “any piece of national heritage that is permanently outside the country, not temporarily for an exhibition or cultural cooperation, comes from an illegal act.” Her efforts finally paid off when a sale in Rome was successfully halted last September, taking 17 Mesoamerican artifacts off the market, in line with Italy’s policy on looted artifacts.\nThe roots of these moves at an international level lie in both activism and academia. Elizabeth Baquedano of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology told Artnet News that she believes the sale of these objects at auction should be stopped altogether. For archaeologists, these ancient objects break the chain of history when physically removed from their context. For those concerned with the cultural heritage of Mesoamerica, some sacred items lose their meaning when placed in certain museum contexts.\n“Some masks are considered to be part of the ancestors; you wouldn’t be selling the bones of your ancestors so why would you be selling the masks of your ancestors?” Baquedano said. “It lacks respect for the unnamed ancestors who produced them.” The academic believes that replica objects often sold as souvenirs or fakes masquerading as the real thing can be produced to such a high standard that there is no need for private individuals to own the originals as art objects.\n“Luckily, I think we’re all moving towards a more just situation,” Baquedano said. ”In the sense of respecting cultures, the heritage of a people, and the individuals themselves that produced them; people who had a very different take on the meaning of these objects than the auction houses are giving them.”\nTrouble for the Market\nAs the profile of the conversation about repatriating Mesoamerican heritage rises, the marketplace for these objects is finding difficulty. Christie’s “Pre-Columbian Art & Taíno Masterworks” auction last November was preceded by an in-person protest, noise in the press, and a petition signed by 57,691 supporters trying to halt the sale. Official representatives from several countries in Central America published a joint statement expressing “concern about the commercialization of cultural property” and a “strong rejection” of the sale due to “the devastation of the history and identity of the peoples involved in the illicit trade of cultural property.” The auction went ahead but a third of the lots went unsold.\nSome collectors have begun voluntarily surrendering objects of cultural significance. French collectors Manichak and Jean Aurance returned a Maya stone carving they had planned to sell at auction to Guatemala in October last year after they discovered it had been looted.\nWhile the attitude surrounding sacred ancient objects and their cultures of origin is changing, desire for these unique items remains strong. Auctions of these items and antiques from Africa and Oceana take place regularly at the major auction houses; Bonham’s New York recently sent out an open invitation for a two-day complimentary valuation and consignment session, advertising the high prices these items can fetch.\nAccording to Fredric Backlar, director of African, Oceanic and Pre-Columbian art at Bonhams, strong provenance is more important than ever. “The market for top quality works has grown due to the limited supply of the material, crossover collectors from other collecting categories, as well as the legal parameters associated with ownership,” he said. “Artworks which have iron-clad documentation and provenance are highly regarded and command higher prices than those lacking documentation.”\nAn Emphasis on Education\nMexico has been making efforts to reclaim lost heritage since the fall of the dictator Porfirio Díaz in 1911. Mexico embraced its Indigenous heritage post-revolution and the government celebrated the country’s pre-colonial history by commissioning art, most famously Diego Rivera’s world-famous mural Carnival of Mexican Life. Dictatorship (1936). Rivera collected Mesoamerican and Pre-Columbian artifacts himself, and Rivera’s collection is now housed in the Anahuacalli Museum in Mexico City which the artist designed and was fully realized in 2021.\nIn recent years, the conversation has grown in tandem with international awareness of Indigenous cultures thanks to activist groups putting pressure on public institutions to return heritage taken during the colonial era—with the most attention focused on African nations—and calls to increase scholarship on pre-colonial histories more generally. This includes drawing attention to the fact that while some Indigenous peoples are considered to have been wiped out this is not always the case.\n“There has been a myth that we need to rectify, the ‘disappearance narrative’ for Indigenous Caribbeans,” Laura Osorio Sunnucks, the British Museum’s head of the Santo Domingo Centre of Excellence for Latin American Research Africa, Oceania and the Americas, told Artnet News.\n“I’m talking here about Mesoamerica but all of these boundaries have been contested, because boundaries in the sense of the nation state and the way we understand it didn’t exist when these objects were made,” Osorio Sunnucks explained, adding that although the Caribbean is not considered Mesoamerica, the Taíno people have a connection to the people of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico which is both Mesoamerican and Caribbean. It’s complicated, and the conversation around the heritage of these ancient artifacts is in flux as a result.\nAs auction houses continue to actively source these artifacts for regular sales, some believe that the trade in such objects is so entrenched in Western culture that to stop it entirely seems a long way off. But the progress in conversations surrounding the restitution of African heritage in recent years has been encouraging, and as Mexico joins forces with countries across Central, South America and the Caribbean, all looking educate people about their Indigenous heritage and populations, it could be on the cusp of reversing the tide of objects that are a part of that history from leaving the country.\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:\nWant to stay ahead of the art world?

{"question":"How do care ethics and collectivism differ in their approaches to prioritizing individual versus group interests?","answer":"Care ethics and collectivism have distinct approaches to balancing individual and group interests. Care ethics emphasizes concrete relationships between specific persons within a web of relationships, focusing on nurturing particular connections and responding to individual needs, especially of those most vulnerable. It works with a 'thick conception of history' that considers complex relationships built over time. In contrast, collectivism explicitly stresses the importance of the collective over the individual, believing that individuals should be subordinate to the collective (which could be a society, state, nation, race, or social class). Collectivism specifically advocates for group ownership of resources for collective benefit, whereas care ethics focuses more on interpersonal relationships and context-specific ethical decisions.","context":["Slightly Revised: August 23, 2002\nMany of the ideas as well as the principle of care quoted on this page are derived from a recent edition of Manuel G. Velasquez, Business Ethics: Concepts and Cases (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall), chapter 2. Those who have access to Velasquez's textbook are urged to consult his fuller discussion. Velasquez's treatment in turn is derived from a large and growing literature by care theorists. See Further Reading below.--J. G.\nIt has been argued that some ethical duties cannot be justified by theories of rights, justice and utility. All of these theories are inspired by the law, which is supposed to be impartial, or science, which is objective and impersonal. It's no accident that rights theories and utilitarianism arose during the early modern era, the period when modern science and the nation-state, with its uniform body of laws, and the world market, with its laws of supply and demand, emerged.\nSome people argue that at least some of our duties are based upon the concrete relationships we have with other persons. These emerge in particular circumstances and they have a very particular history in each case.\nAn example of how care ethics might work in business is provided by the case of the Malden Mills textile factory in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Malden Mills was a highly successful producer of specialty fabrics. But the Malden Mills textile factory was destroyed in a fire. The owner, Aaron Feuerstien, could have taken the insurance money and rebuilt his factory in a third world country where the labor was much cheaper. This would have been entirely legal, and might have been the most profitable thing to do. Perhaps it could perhaps have been given a defense on the basis of rights (as understood by libertarianism) and maybe even utilitarianism. It would have been difficult to use justice arguments to criticize him if he had picked up and left. On the impartial view of justice, Latin American workers would have just as much right to Feuerstein's jobs as the workers with whom he had build a successful company in the U.S.\nBut Aaron Feuerstein decided to stand by his workers. He decided to rebuild the plant in Lawrence and paid the workers full wages with full medical benefits while the factory was being reconstructed.\nFeuerstein seems to have approached this choice along the line advocated by Care Ethics, for which the concrete relationships which we have with other persons is the most important moral fact. The task of ethics is to respond to particular individuals with whom we have valuable and close relationships. Compassion, concern, love, friendship, and kindness are owed in proportion to the closeness and value of these relationships.\nWe can express this as a principle in the following way:We should preserve and nurture the concrete relations which we have with specific persons; exercise special care for those with whom we are concretely related, attending to their own needs, values, etc. and responding positively to these needs, etc., especially of those most vulnerable.\nWarning: Care Theorists stress the importance of sensitivity to the entire context of choice. They are highly critical of attempts to reduce ethical choice to following rules that admit of no exception. Thus, it would be a mistake to think that care theorists would automatically oppose abortion because of the mother's concrete and intimate relation to the fetus. This would be one important consideration but not the only one: the woman's other concrete relationships could be equally important in the way she arrives at her decision.\nA care ethic de-emphasizes the idea of the independent individual and instead stresses that persons exist in a web of relationships. In this respect, it is the polar opposite of libertarianism as an ethical theory.\nIt is also different from utilitarianism and justice theories because it works with what I call a thick conception of history. Utilitarianism is concerned with the future, not with history, because it decides on the basis of probable consequences of action. The abstract principles of justice can take the past into account, but only clear and distinct aspects of the past. How much did A contribute to the work of the firm this year (in comparison to B's contribution)? (The answer determines how big a bonus A should receive [in relation to B]?) Care ethics tries to be sensitive to the indefinitely complex system of relationships that build up in a community over time, or even within a family over time.\nCriticisms: A one-sided care ethic can conflict with the demands of justice. Some of the concrete relationships in which we exist are oppressive or exploitative--should those be nurtured and preserved? A qualified or modified care ethic will incorporate a theory of rights or justice so as to guard against this possible problem.\nFurther Reading: Rosemary Tong's \"Feminist Ethics\" article on Feminist Ethics article in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. See in particular her sections on \"Feminine Approaches to Ethics\" and \"Maternal Approaches to Ethics.\"","Individual differences |\nMethods | Statistics | Clinical | Educational | Industrial | Professional items | World psychology |\nCollectivism is a term used to describe any doctrine that stresses the importance of a collective, rather than the importance of the individual. Collectivists believe the individual should be subordinate to the collective, which may be a group of individuals, a whole society, a state, a nation, a race, or a social class. Thus, collectivism contrasts with individualism, which emphasises the liberty of the individual.\nSome consider an early example of collectivist political philosophy to be Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “social contract”, which maintains that each individual is under implicit contract to submit his own will to the “general will” and that the state should enforce this general will. This notion of an ethical obligation to subordinate an individual’s will to the group will is in fundamental opposition to individualism which advocates that individual action should not be restricted by others.\nGenerally speaking, collectivism in the field of economics holds that things should be owned by the group and used for the benefit of all rather than being owned by individuals. Central to this view is the concept of the commons, as opposed to private property. Some collectivists apply this principle only to capital and land, while others argue that all valued commodities should be regarded as public goods and placed under public ownership.\nCollectivism in economics may or may not involve a state as a manager and steward of collective property. For instance, anarcho-communists, who argue for the immediate abolition of government, wish to place all goods under collective ownership. In 1876, at the Florence Conference of the Italian Federation of the International, where the principles of anarcho-communism were first laid out, it was stated:\nThe Italian Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity.\nCollectivist societies Edit\nThere are many examples of societies around the world which have characterized themselves or have been characterized by outsiders as “collectivist”.\nFor instance, there are the communist states, which have often collectivized most economic sectors (and agriculture in particular). On the other hand, there are Israeli kibbutzim (voluntary communes where people live and farm together without private ownership), and communities such as the Freetown Christiania in Denmark (a small anarchist political experiment centered around an abandoned military installation in Copenhagen; Christiania has laws abolishing private property).\nThe term collectivism is used more often by anti-collectivists than by anyone else. Supporters of Objectivism — Ayn Rand and many people influenced by her — claim that collectivism is fallacious in theory and immoral in practice. They further argue that many or most political ideologies (other than Objectivism itself) are forms of collectivism or at least contain significant collectivist elements. Ironically, Objectivism has been criticized by some for its emphasis on emulating Rand rather than on being a true individual with one’s own thoughts and feelings.\nOther ideologies that define themselves in opposition to collectivism include libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism, which are seen by their supporters as defending individual rights against various forms of collectivism.\nSee also Edit\n|This page uses Creative Commons Licensed content from Wikipedia (view authors).|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:58c4a620-a60f-48ce-8a82-b147e279bba8>","<urn:uuid:75b3e562-76ad-4f7a-9278-fcdad00a4ee4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Carl Jung view the relationship between dreams and the unconscious mind?","answer":"Jung viewed dreams as products of the psyche's fantasy function that don't follow the rules of 'reality thinking.' He saw them as derivatives of unconscious processes that have both complementary and compensatory relationships with the conscious mind - meaning what we fail to live consciously is expressed in our dreams. Jung believed dreams were purposive and could reveal information about both our personal past and collective future, acting as portals or gateways into the unconscious through their symbolic nature.","context":["Figure 1. Carl Jung.\nIn 1936, C.G. Jung (Figure 1) first introduced his essay “Dream Symbols of the Process of Individuation.” Jung (1944/1970) later renamed the same essay “Individual Dream Symbolism in Relation to Alchemy” and published it in Psychology and Alchemy. The essay focused on a series of highly archetypal dreams—over 400 in the series—and underscored the relationship between alchemical symbolism and the process of individuation. Images and motifs contained in the dream series directly suggested the formation of a new center of the personality or what Jung alternatively called the archetype of the self. Thus, we can infer that the dreams showed a gradual shift of the personality’s psychic center of gravity—from the limited ego to the wholeness implied in the individual’s greater personality. The dreams that Jung studied and discussed were later revealed to belong to physicist and Nobel Laureate Wolfgang Pauli\nFigure 2. Wolfgang Pauli\n(Figure 2), who would go on to work closely alongside Jung in the formulation of the theory of synchronicity. Jung suggested that Pauli’s dreams are exceptional for their mandala symbolism, which Jung (1929) discussed at length in his essay “Commentary on The Secret of the Golden Flower”: “Mandala means “circle,” more especially a magic circle. Mandalas are found not only throughout the East but also among us” (CW13, para. 31). Jung’s sampling of Pauli’s dreams occurred over a period spanning approximately ten months and included waking visions and impressions that could be viewed as active imaginations.\nIn a similar vein, I was given permission to include a dream series from a client whose identity will remain anonymous. The client’s dreams, although hardly as extensive and elaborate as Pauli’s material, contain a wealth of archetypal symbolism which can be read on multiple levels. In a three-part blog I will attempt to analyze and amplify the archetypal symbolism contained in the dream series. In the aforesaid essay, Jung employed his constructive method which seeks to associate and amplify the dream material by framing it in an appropriate psychological context. Jung (1944/1970) suggested that\nThe psychological context of dream-contents consists in the web of associations in which the dream is naturally embedded. Theoretically we can never know anything in advance about this web, but in practice it is sometimes possible, granted long enough experience. (CW13, para. 48)\nBecause we have already addressed the topics of the unconscious, symbols, and active imagination elsewhere, I will provide some introductory commentary on the depth psychology of dreams before turning to the material which consists of three dreams that took place over five months (March 2014 thru July 2014).\nNo dream should be studied in isolation but should be viewed in the context of its contiguous and associative aspects. In other words, one stands to gain most by studying dreams in a series that took place over a span of time. One should also be conservative with his or her interpretation and stick closely to the personal and objective context while exploring dream material. Jung (1944/1970) tells us that “the series is the context, and the dreamer himself supplies it” (CW13, para. 50). Jung (1916/1948) further adds:\nIf we want to interpret a dream correctly, we need a thorough knowledge of the conscious situation at that moment, because the dream contains its unconscious complement, that is, the material which the conscious situation has constellated in the unconscious. Without this knowledge it is impossible to interpret a dream correctly, except by a lucky fluke. (CW8, para. 477)\nElsewhere, Jung (1945) has stated that “every interpretation of a dream is a psychological statement about its contents” (CW8, para. 533). Jung is alluding to what he called “taking up the context,” which “consists of making sure that every shade of meaning and each salient feature of the dream is determined by the associations of the dreamer himself” (1945, CW8, para. 542)\nBecause dreams are derivatives of unconscious processes, they usually possess both a complementary and compensatory relationship with the conscious mind. Put a different way, what we fail to live consciously is expressed in our dreams. Jung (1916/1948) wrote that\nIn this dream we can discern a compensating function of the unconscious whereby those thoughts, inclinations, and tendencies which in conscious life are too little valued come spontaneously into action during the sleeping state, when the conscious process is to a large extent eliminated. (CW8, para. 466)\nAlthough I recognize that using only three dreams will substantially constrain the interpretation of the material, by limiting the study to three dreams we can dedicate more time to understanding the meaning of the dream symbolism. Furthermore, I will attempt to show how the dream images facilitate a gradual movement toward wholeness and individuation. Before proceeding, it is necessary to further explore the phenomenon of the dream itself in a depth psychological context.\nAccording to Jung (1916/1948), dreams are structured differently than other conscious contents in that they do not share the same continuity of development (CW8, para. 443). Dreams could be viewed as products of the fantasy function of the psyche because they do not follow the hard and fast rules of “realit\ny thinking” and are “in striking contrast to the logical sequence of ideas which we consider to be a special characteristic of conscious mental processes” (Jung, 1916/1948, CW8, para. 445). Jung, in contradistinction to Sigmund Freud’s (Figure 3) emphasis on a causal standpoint, thought that dreams also had a finalistic or prospective aspect that could orient the individual to his or her future development. So, one could say that dreams are purposive and can elucidate a great deal not only about our personal past, but about the collective future (Jung, 1916/1948, CW8, para. 462). Informed by a finalistic standpoint, dream symbols may be viewed as empirical psychic facts portrayed in a figurative language which seek to teach and instruct rather than hide or deceive. As Jung (1921/1971) suggested, a symbol is the best possible expression for something mostly unknown (CW6, para. 401).\nThere is no surefire way to fully grasp a dream’s meaning. It is usually best to approach it from multiple hermeneutic angles—reductive, prospective, complementary, compensatory, etc.—to fully engage its content, yet to be clear, one can never completely exhaust its meaning. Some of the dream will forever be concealed within the unconscious. Dreams, if nothing else, can help us reorient our conscious attitude to live a more whole and meaningful life. Dreams could be viewed as split off psychic fragments whose phenomenology is practically indistinguishable from the concept of a feeling-toned complex. “The dream is a fragment of involuntary psychic activity, just conscious enough to be reproducible in the waking state” (Jung, 1945/1948, CW8, para. 532). Because of its symbolic nature, the dream could be viewed as a portal or gateway into the unconscious. Through the dream, the psyche speaks when we listen or when we make the effort to understand the language of dreams, which are basically symbols.\nOur client is a middle-aged Caucasian male, married with children. Of average intelligence and widely read and learned. Although it is difficult to pin his typology, he strikes me as a thinking-intuitive introverted type. The man is seeking answers for his life by immersing himself in books. The dreamer has been unemployed for a lengthy period and understandably is uncertain about the future. Because of his financial situation, he is concerned about how he will take care of his family. We will attempt to apply Jung’s constructive method of amplification to the dream series and explore his personal associations to the material as well. What follows constitutes the first dream of our series:\nMarch 15, 2014 – Last night, I dreamed that my wife, children, and I were driving down a road that paralleled a sharp cliff which abruptly dropped off into the ocean. Below I saw a beach which was occupied by people. Suddenly, a huge wave appeared out of nowhere and engulfed our vehicle overturning it. This scared and surprised me at the same time. When the water receded, I realized that we were near the cliff’s edge but thankfully did not fall over it. The kids were okay. When I looked around at the beach below people were going about their business as though nothing had happened. I was relieved.\nThat the dreamer is accompanied by his family seems to merit further commentary. The dreamer does not view himself solely as an individual but as a family unit consisting of his wife and children—husband, wife, son, daughter. That they are on a road implies a journey that could be viewed as a process of psychic development. The scene contains a cliff and then the ocean and Jung (1988) observed that the “the ocean is always the symbol of the collective unconscious” (p. 71). All life originated from the oceans; thus, it is not surprising to see that Jung viewed it as a symbol par excellence of the collective unconscious, or viewed differently, the figurative womb of humankind. The ocean is a natural force that has an uncanny effect on the psyche. It is difficult not to look at a sunset on the ocean without being moved at a visceral level. And then the wave comes, a force of energy or libido that abruptly appears and strikes the vehicle. The wave seems to represent that latent energies contained in the collective unconscious that the dreamer is contending with.\nThe unconscious is a force of nature that knows nothing about ethics or morality. At best, it is a neutral force that can assist our conscious development or at worst, lead to psychic desolation. If nothing else, it must be met with by the light of our own consciousness. Only then can we find the means to integrate its contents within our own personality. Of course, with every rise there is a descent and the water eventually recedes. On a personal level, it seems meaningful and important that the man’s family is unhurt and still intact. The man’s attention returns to the beach below and there he again sees the people who appear to be going about their business. Like Zeus and his lightning bolt, the collective unconscious as a force of nature has sent a message to the man, which seems to read: “There are forces in the world far more powerful than you. Be careful and honor that what you do not know.” The client shared this with me. The dream seems to show the man his provisional status in the world. His ego is dwarfed compared to the immensity of the unconscious, and by extension life itself. Naturally, this analysis and amplification is hardly final nor conclusive. As previously stated, any interpretation can never exhaust the entire meaning of the dream. More dreams will follow, which I will discuss at length in parts two and three of the “Dreams” blog.\nJung, C.G. (1929). Commentary on The secret of the golden flower.

{"question":"What happened to the ship 'Duchess of Bedford' during the 1906 Arctic expedition?","answer":"The Duchess of Bedford, which was originally named Beatrice, was damaged beyond repair by ice while at Flaxman Island in May 1907. The crew then dismantled the ship and used its wood to build a comfortable base station that included several rooms, a full pantry, a library with books in multiple languages, and a roll-top desk.","context":["In late July, I travelled with my mother up to Flaxman Island, in the Beaufort Sea off the north coast of Alaska. Why did we do go all of this way to see a pretty but barren strip of land in the Arctic? Flaxman Island was the base of operations for my mother's mother's father, Ernest de Koven Leffingwell, during his Arctic explorations from 1906 to 1914. We had a unique opportunity this summer to go up there with some people who really know the area. I'll be writing about that trip soon, but first I wanted to write about Ernest de Koven Leffingwell.\n\"Leffingwell\" is my middle name, but I didn't really know much about my great grandfather - he was always just \"Grandpa Leffingwell\" who died only a few months after I was born and who had left us various random books (one of log tables, others in Danish), items of scientific paraphernalia (a brass telescope that we never quite knew where to store), show dog trophies (for 'Champion Nuthill Dignity' from the Santa Barbara Kennel Club of 1930), and various bits of furniture, including a handmade walnut bed frame that I've slept in for much of my life.\nBefore going on this trip, I wanted to find out a bit more about him. Here's some of what I found out from some books, articles, and extracts from his own scrapbook of news clippings.\nErnest de Koven Leffingwell was born in 1875 in Knoxville, Illinois, to a well-off family that ran a boarding school. After prep school in Racine, Wisconsin, he went to Trinity College in Hartford Connecticut, getting a B.A. in 1895 and an M.A. in 1898.\nDespite the immense range still separating Oregon and Cristobal Colon, Oregon's forward turret launched a pair of 13-inch (330 mm) shells which bracketed Cristobal Colon's wake just astern of the ship. Captain Emilio Diaz Moreu, humanely declining to see his crew killed to no purpose, abruptly turned the undamaged Cristobal Colon toward the mouth of the Tarquino River and ordered the scuttle valves opened and the colors struck as she grounded. His descending flag marked the end of Spain's naval power in the New World.If, as a newspaper clipping he kept suggests, he was manning a forward gun, then it is possible that my great-grandfather was responsible for firing that epoch-ending shot. He rarely mentioned his past, but my mother noted that he did receive a naval pension.\nAfter the war, Leffingwell started working on a PhD in Physics at the University of Chicago. In 1900 he attended a lecture on arctic exploration by Fridtjof Nansen. The dazzling and charismatic Nansen planted the exploring bug in Ernest Leffingwell's mind, who set about finding an expedition worth joining.\nThis was an era when the last few empty spaces on the map were being filled in, and expeditions to various far-off locations were constantly in the news. Explorers who made it back were the toast of the town, while those who didn't often became even more famous.\nThe world of funding and undertaking expeditions at the turn of the century reminds me a lot of the world of tech startups these days: the ventures would often be led by young idealists who would have to shop their plan around to various rich investors. Big egos, fad-following, name-dropping, grandstanding, and the constant struggle for cash while trying to push through into new and undiscovered territory - it could be an exotic expedition in 1900, or a tech startup in 2010.\nLeffingwell joined the Baldwin-Ziegler Expedition, a high-profile trip to the European Arctic, as the chief Scientist. He had no trouble passing the physical exam, since he was a star track athlete and on the University of Chicago football team.\nThe Baldwin-Ziegler expedition wasn't much of a success - halfway to the pole, Ziegler (a baking powder magnate) deposed Baldwin, and after some confused wandering around Franz Joseph Land, everyone returned to warmer climes. \"Baffled, not beaten\" was the crew's motto. However, it wasn't entirely useless: during the trip Leffingwell became close friends with Ejner Mikkelsen, and the two of them decided to embark on an expedition of their own.\nThere had been rumours of previously-undiscovered islands in the ocean north of Alaska, but nothing certain - and certainly not as measured by a scientist who knew what he was doing. Leffingwell and Mikkelsen decided to go up there and find out for sure. The first step, though, was to raise money. Mikkelsen traveled the world and eventually managed to get Queen Alexandra of Denmark to be the patron of the expedition, and got money from John D. Rockefeller and the Duchess of Bedford. They finally reached their funding goal when Leffingwell's father matched the funds for the expedition by giving him an advance on his inheritance.\nThe expedition finally started in Victoria B.C., where they bought a refitted 66-ton schooner. In honour of their benefactor, they changed its name from \"Beatrice\" to \"The Duchess of Bedford\". They didn't have enough money for a motor, so they did most of the trip under sail power, occasionally getting towed by friendly whalers and Coast Guard vessels.\n|Random Side Fact #4: The \"Beatrice\" was a ship with a colourful history: it had originally been made (from tropical hardwood) for the Japanese navy, but later ended up being used for smuggling opium around the Pacific, and then for poaching, until it got caught and impounded by the Canadian authorities - and then bought for cheap and refitted.|\nEventually, in September of 1906, they made it to Flaxman Island. They had originally planned to get further east to Banks Island, north of the Yukon, but the ice was already beginning to hamper travel - and they realized that Flaxman Island was in an ideal location, with good ocean access, at the mouth of a large river, and with unexplored mountains visible in the distance (now known as the Brooks Range).\nThey spent the winter travelling by dogsled across the winter ice that covered the Arctic Ocean. Their cold was incredible, the ice was treacherous, and most of their dogs got rabies. They didn't find any new land, but they did manage to sound and properly map the edge of the continental shelf for the first time ever. It turns out that there isn't any land in that part of the Beaufort Sea, but there are giant 300-square-mile icebergs that seem like islands.\nWhen they got back to Flaxman Island in May of 1907, they discovered that the ice had damaged their ship beyond repair. So they took it apart and used the wood to build a comfortable base station. The final structure had several rooms, a full pantry, a library of books in multiple languages, and even a roll-top desk.\nIn October, Mikkelsen decided to head back south, leaving Leffingwell to continue his explorations by himself.\nBut back to my great-grandfather. He decided to stay up north and used his Flaxman Island station as a base for a thorough survey of this section of the Alaskan coast. He spent 78 months travelling or working up north, 30 of these months in the field (making camp 380 times). He travelled 4500 miles, and properly surveyed 4900 square miles of what is now the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. When, several decades later, they re-mapped the coast with airplanes and satellites, his maps needed very little adjusting - his longitude (very tricky to calculate without a radio for time synch) was accurate to within 250 feet.\nLeffingwell is mostly known for being the first real scientist to make the case for oil in the North Slope area - and boy was he right.\nHe did all of his surveying by himself - needing to put tape over his metal instruments to keep his skin from freezing to them - but that doesn't mean that he was completely alone while up there. Flaxman Island is in a bit of a crossroads for that part of the arctic, and he was visited fairly frequently by local Inuit families, coast guard ships, whalers, and other explorers. Famous explorer Stefansson met him several times - the first time calling his luxurious cabin and his affection for fruit jams \"effete\", but he was impressed several years later with Leffingwell's new appreciation for oatmeal 'mush'.\nIn 1908 Leffingwell went back south to get more supplies, and, in trying to get back to Flaxman Island in 1909, had what he considered his most dangerous adventure, and the only time he felt like giving up and going back to Illinois: to get back north, he had engaged a shipwright in Seattle to build him a 50-foot yawl which, unlike the Duchess of Bedford, would have a 12-horsepower engine. Unfortunately, halfway through the project the price of wood had skyrocketed, and Leffingwell ended up not only with a not-entirely-completed ship, but also with a lot less money than he had expected.\nHis meagre remaining funds couldn't attract decent sailors, so he ended up with a crew of drunken louts. He certainly couldn't afford a real navigator, so he decided to brave the North Pacific using only his surveying skills. They had barely left Seattle on the \"Argo\" when they discovered that the shipwright had saved money by not putting in a proper heat shield behind the stove - which meant that running the stove would light the hull of the ship on fire. He couldn't trust his crew, especially since the only skill they seemed to have was drinking whisky - so he would stay awake, cold and damp, and steer the ship for days on end. Finally, he couldn't take it any more and decided that he would rather risk burning up than suffer any more - and they discovered that by constantly pouring water over the back-panel, they would be able to run the stove properly. After that, the trip went more smoothly - except for having to occasionally wrestle and tie his DT-suffering crew members to their bunks to keep them from throwing the navigation equipment overboard.\nHe eventually made it back to Flaxman Island (after leaving his drunken crew members at a small isolated out-port) and continued his survey work.\nI triangulated about 150 miles of the coast and mapped the details upon a scale of 1/125,000, and entered the positions of about 1,500 soundings. I made a sketch map of the entire coastline between Point Barrow and the Canadian boundary, ... mapped the main geographic features of an area of about 50 by 80 miles of the mainland, ... drew the known and probable distribution of 15 geological deposits‚ ... Ground ice I discussed at length and elaborated the Wedge Theory, ... My report of petroleum seepages near Point Barrow attracted more attention than all the rest of my work. It started a small oil rush.\nHe returned south in 1914, and spent several years in Washington D.C., writing up a detailed report for the U.S. Geological Survey.\nAfter my report was published, the Royal Geographical Society of London was the first to see merit in my work, and I am very grateful for their Patron's Medal. Then came the Daly Medal of the American Geographical Society of New York; then an honorary degree of Sc.D. from my Alma Mater. Stefansson lifted my morale by Leffingwell Crags on one of his new islands north of Canada, and Mikkelsen enlarged my ego with Leffingwell Nunatak, sticking like a sore thumb out of the ice of Northeastern Greenland. Also there were a few of my fossils named after me.\n|Random Side Fact #6: When I graduated from Oberlin College in 1994, there was no official dress code. Some people wore suits, others wore sweats, one painted himself blue like a Pict - I wore the black cloak that my great-grandfather wore for his honorary degree from Trinity College, Connecticut.|\nHe married around this time, and eventually settled on his father's Walnut and Lime ranch in Whittier, California.\nLeffingwell never went back to the Arctic. It's hard to say why he didn't go back. My mother says he didn't talk much about his time in the Arctic, preferring to think of the future more than the past, so it's hard to know the reasons. Perhaps he was upset that people who had done less but had self-promoted more were becoming famous. Perhaps investment had dried up, and his father had tired of funding his trips (being up there was fairly cheap, since he mostly lived off the land, but getting there and back was a different story). Perhaps he just decided that this was a chapter of his life that was now finished. Perhaps his wife insisted he stay closer to home. Perhaps he simply preferred the warm sunny climate in Los Angeles.\nOur family memory is a bit vague on how he spent his life between returning from the Arctic and when my mother was born in the 1940s. I gather that he spent his time managing the walnut and lime groves and raising Springer-Spaniels. My late grandmother (his daughter) recalled that the family was fairly well-off when she was growing up, but that they were hit hard in the crash of 1929 - she told stories of being embarrassed to go to still-rich friends' birthday parties wearing an old dress and only bringing wild-flowers. However the family seemed to be doing well enough to send her to Montreal for French lessons in the early 1930s.\n|Random Side Fact #8: While she was in Montreal, my grandmother visited one of her father's explorer colleagues in Ottawa, and ended up accompanying his daughter to a debutante ball at Rideau Hall, where she was photographed by then-just-a-society-photographer Yousuf Karsh.|\nIn the 1940s, Leffingwell moved to Carmel, California, and also built a salmon-fishing cottage along the Klamath river further north. In Carmel, Leffingwell he kept himself active: I discovered a news clipping from the 1960s describing how he built a hot rod car - inspired by how much he enjoyed building his own shallow-draft boat several years earlier.\nIn an upcoming set of posts, I'll describe one of the most extraordinary days in my entire life: July 21st 2010, when my mother and I flew up to Flaxman Island to see my great-grandfather's camp. For now, though, I'm going to give Leffingwell the last words. This is from his 1961 article in \"Explorers Journal\":\nIt is necessary for both my physical and for my psychic health, that I have plenty of exercise. I endeavor to become so tired every day, that I enjoy resting at night. Until ten years ago I spent much time hunting, fishing and camping; but I ended that kind of life with a moose hunt in Canada, where I kept my end up in spite of my 76 years. Since then I have devoted myself to gardening, and find that I can get all of the exercise I need, and at the same time enjoy the beauty of the lovely flowers that are adapted to our coastal climate.\nI still have an unfulfilled ambition to explore the undiscovered land beyond the River Styx. There are conflicting reports about what is to be found there, and I intend to go there personally and settle the matter.\nSweet, John M.

This procedure guarantees the:\n- Identification, comprehension, and documentation of requirements;\n- Selection of appropriate procedures or methods in fulfilling the customer’s requirements;\n- The laboratory’s resources and capacity to meet the requirements;\n- The laboratory compliance with the requirements of 6.6 when using external provides.\nThe laboratory must:\n– have good communication with the customer;\n– meet the customer’s needs;\n– notify the customer if their methods are outdated or inappropriate;\n– inform the customer if their request cannot be accomplished because it would compromise the laboratory’s integrity.\n7.2 Selection, Verification, and Validation of Methods\n7.2.1 Selection and verification of methods\nThe laboratory must utilize proper methods and procedures for activities. This also applies to the measurement uncertainty evaluation and statistical techniques for the analysis of data. The laboratory must update methods, procedures, and supporting documentation. These should be available to all personnel.\nISO 17025:2017 requires a laboratory to stay updated with appropriate methods when customers do not provide a method. The laboratory must select the best and latest valid version. It must also notify the customer about the chosen method.\nThe laboratory must verify that the selected method has been published either regionally, nationally, or internationally. The method may also come from another reputable technical organization such as scientific journals. The laboratory must verify that it can execute the method it chooses.\nISO 17025 Section 7.2 requires a laboratory to keep records of verification. Competent personnel must manage the method development, if necessary. Periodic reviews must take place for method developments.\n7.2.2 Validation of Methods\nISO/IEC 17025 requires laboratories to validate the methods that they use. This includes standard, non-standard, and laboratory-developed methods. Validate these methods to meet the given application’s needs. In the case of changes to a validated method, understand the influence of the changes.\nThe laboratory keeps the following records of validation:\n- The validation of the procedure used\n- Specification of the requirements\n- Determination of the performance characteristics of the method\n- Obtained results\n- A statement on the method’s validity\nISO/IEC 17025:2017 requires all laboratories to have a sampling plan and method when carrying out a sampling of products, materials, or substances, for testing or calibration. The laboratory must determine if the sampling methods address the factors to be controlled. This ensures the validity of subsequent testing and the availability of the sampling plan and method at the sampling site. Sampling must use proper statistical methods.\nSampling methods must describe:\n- The sampling plan\n- The selection of samples or sites\n- The preparation and treatment of samples\nWhen the laboratory is sampling, they must preserve the appropriate records of samples. These records must cover, when appropriate:\n- References to the sampling method\n- Personnel doing the sample\n- The sampling’s date and time\n- Data to identify and describe the sample\n- Diagrams or other equivalent means to identify the sampling location\n- Deviations, additions, or exclusions from the sampling plan and sampling method\n- Environmental or transportation conditions\n7.4 Handling of Test and Calibration Items\nThe laboratory must have a procedure for transportation, receipt, handling, storage, protection, disposal, retention, or return of test or calibration items. This covers all important provisions to protect the test or calibration item’s integrity. This protects the interest of the laboratory and the customer. The laboratory must take precautions to prevent loss, deterioration, damage, and contamination to the item during preparation, handling, transporting, and storing for testing or calibration.\nThe laboratory must:\n- Develop handling instructions\n- Have a system for the definite identification of test or calibration items\n- Keep identification while the laboratory handles the item\n- Guarantee that items do not get confused\n- Accommodate a sub-division of an item or groups of items\n- Handle the transfer of items\n- Record any deviations\nThe laboratory must consult customers if there is any doubt about an item’s suitability for a test or calibration. This also applies to any doubt if an item does not conform to the description provided. If the customer requires, the laboratory must include a disclaimer in the report stating which results may be affected by the deviation. If applicable, the laboratory must record what environment items need to be stored in.\n7.5 Technical Records\nISO 17025:2017 clause 7.5 indicates the requirements for technical records. A laboratory must ensure that technical records for all activities include results, a report, and information. This facilitates, if possible, the identification of components affecting the measurement results and its associated measurement uncertainty. This should also allow the repetition of laboratory activities under conditions close to the original. When preserving records, include the date and identify responsible personnel. Records should cover the original observations, as well as data and calculations. Record those at the time of creation. If changes are made, monitor these amendments to original observations or previous versions. Keep all the files, including the original and alterations, the date of alteration, altered aspects, and personnel responsible for any amendments.\n7.6 Evaluation of Measurement Uncertainty\nAn ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited laboratory must understand where measurement uncertainty is coming from. The laboratory must identify the contributions to the uncertainties. When you are evaluating for uncertainty, consider all significant contributions, even those coming from sampling. For calibrations, the laboratory must evaluate its equipment for uncertainty. Evaluate measurement uncertainty when performing testing. If the test method excludes rigorous evaluation of measurement uncertainty, the laboratory should make estimates of uncertainty, which is based upon practical experience or understanding of theoretical principles.\n7.7 Ensuring the Validity of Results\nThe laboratory must have a procedure for monitoring the validity of results. An ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited lab must prioritize ensuring the validity of results. Use statistical techniques to identify trends. The laboratory must develop a procedure for checking the validity of their results. Understand if the system or process may be inefficient. In this case, take preventive action. Proficiency testing is addressed in 7.7.2. If you are looking to be accredited to ISO 17025, you also need to become ISO/IEC 17043:2010 certified.\n7.8 Reporting of Results\nISO/IEC 17025:2017 clause 7.8 is divided into several subclauses:\n- 8.1 General\n- 8.2 Common Requirements for Reports\n- 8.3 Specific Requirements for Test Reports\n- 8.4 Specific Requirements for Calibration Certificates\n- 8.5 Reporting Sampling- Specific Requirements\n- 8.6 Reporting Statements of Conformity\n- 8.7 Reporting Opinions and Interpretations\n- 8.8 Amendments to Reports\n7.8.1 General. Reporting results must follow the standard’s requirements if your laboratory wants to become ISO/IEC 17025 accredited. Review and authorize the results before release. Report the results in an accurate, concise, and clear, manner. Include any agreed information with the customer. Add necessary details for interpretation of the results, as well as all information required by the methods used.\n7.8.2 Common Requirements for Reports. This identifies what needs to be provided in the results. When developing a report, identify who was responsible for testing and calibration. Carefully record dates.\n7.8.3 Specific Requirements for Test Reports\n7.8.4 Specific Requirements for Calibration Certificates\n7.8.5 Reporting Sampling- Specific Requirements.\nThese subclauses add extra requirements to 7.8.2. These are more specific requirements for the interpretation of the test results, calibration certificates, and reporting sampling.\n7.8.6 Reporting Statements of Conformity\nWhen there’s a given statement of conformity, the laboratory must document the decision rule employed. Next, the laboratory must also consider the level of risk associated with the decision rule. Finally, it must provide a statement of conformity that states which parts, standards, and specifications, are met or not, and what decision rule was applied.\n7.8.7 Reporting Opinions and Interpretations\nIf opinions and interpretations are expressed, the laboratory must guarantee that only authorized personnel will discharge the respective statement. The laboratory must document the basis upon which these statements are made. It must also clarify if any interpretations or opinions are based upon the results from tests or calibrations. Maintain both written and verbal records if opinions or interpretations are communicated to the customer.\n7.8.8. Amendments to Reports\nIdentify changes if an issued report needs amendments or re-issuing. Issue the modification in the form of a document or data transfer. Add the statement “Amendment to Report, serial number (or another identification method)”. The laboratory must make sure that amendments meet the requirements. Refer to the original report if there’s a need to issue a new report.\nFor laboratories aiming to be ISO 17025:2017 accredited, they must:\n- Know the importance of handling customer complaints;\n- Have a documented process to receive;\n- Evaluate and make decisions on how to manage complaints.\nThis process must be readily available to any interested party. If the issued complaint is significant to the laboratory’s activities, the laboratory must confirm it is responsible for the complaint. The laboratory must also be responsible for all decisions when handling a complaint.\nClause 7.10 states that a laboratory must have a procedure when results or activities do not conform to its procedures or the agreed requirements made by the customer. The laboratory must keep records of nonconforming work. It must take corrective action if the laboratory believes nonconformities may reoccur.\nFor nonconformances, the procedure must include:\n- Personnel responsible and authorized for handling nonconforming work;\n- The creation of actions based upon the risk level;\n- An evaluation of the nonconforming work’s importance, including an impact analysis;\n- The decision to be taken for the nonconformity;\n- Assurance that the customer is informed;\n- Personnel responsible for authorizing the continuation of work;\n7.11 Control of Data and Information Management\nControl of data and information is a vital aspect of executing activities. A laboratory must verify it has access to information essential in conducting its activities. It must ensure that the information management system used for collection, processing, recording, reporting, storing and/or retrieving data is validated for functionality. This includes the proper function of interfaces within the laboratory information management system. In the case of modifications to commercial software or changes to software configuration, they must be authorized and validated before usage.\nWhen a laboratory information management system is handled and preserved off-site or through external providers, the laboratory must ensure that the system operator or provider complies with all applicable requirements. Furthermore, the laboratory must ensure the availability of instructions, manuals, and reference data significant to the management system.

Additionally, they were able to access confidential customer data and administrator credentials, allowing them to move through a once-protected network with ease.\nThe AWWA says cyberattacks now pose the greatest threat for U.S. businesses and infrastructure, and the water industry is among cybercriminals' targets. With a robust and resilient security program, water and wastewater systems can prevent service disruptions, safeguard public health and safety, and protect the personal and financial information of customers.\nHere are four ways to keep hackers from wreaking havoc on your water lab.\n1. Implement Cybersecurity Best Practices\nEvery lab faces different risks and challenges depending on size, but all can stand to improve their security through precautionary steps.\nIf you operate a larger lab, you may feel it's hard to defend against hackers — especially if your infrastructure includes geographically dispersed systems run by hundreds of employees. Here, even a single point of vulnerability could be harmful.\nConsider adopting some of the security measures highlighted by the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center. These recommendations, while targeted for utility companies, also apply to testing labs. Some of the highlights include:\n- Ensuring safe remote access for system users through a virtual private network (VPN).\n- Identifying vulnerabilities and making security changes, either through software updates or new virus protection.\n- Making sure employees are updating passwords routinely, and that they're complex and unique.\nIf you run a smaller lab, you may feel like you don't have the time, knowledge, budget, or staff to properly address cybersecurity. But you don't have to spring for a heavy-duty IT team to stay safe: The Federal Communications Commission provides resources to help small business create cybersecurity plans, including 10 tips that every company should follow.\nFirst on the list is training employees. Cybersecurity awareness should go beyond just explaining to your staff what the common hacking schemes are. Consider following up with tests, such as sending a fake phishing email to your staff to see who clicks on it. Use these instances as teachable moments, because even a trained eye can still open a dangerous email.\nAnd while you're at it, it doesn't hurt to share some internet best practices with your staff, such as which sites to avoid and why sharing a password over email is never a good idea.\n2. Recognize Schemes\nAccording to research from Willis Towers Watson, two-thirds of cyberattacks are caused by employee error or deliberate malicious behavior. But the more training your employees receive on routinely used schemes, the less likely hackers will be able to infiltrate your water lab.\nThe first one your lab should be familiar with is spear-phishing. This occurs when an attacker sends fraudulent emails that appear to be from a trusted sender with the intent of getting the recipients to reveal confidential information.\nAnother tactic is watering hole domain attacks, which occur when hackers discover which websites you normally use and infect one or more of them with malware. Then, they're able to collect information and credentials from your database.\nThrough credential gathering, hackers are able to gain access to systems — including, possibly, your lab's laboratory information management system (LIMS) — and either alter or steal information from them. Increasing employee awareness about these schemes can help ensure one wrong click doesn't compromise your lab.\n3. Protect Your LIMS\nWater labs must maintain strict standards for cybersafety in order to protect customers, whether they're large municipalities or private individuals. This is particularly relevant for your LIMS, as any system connected to the internet can be the target of an attack.\nEvery LIMS — at the least — should include security features that protect the system and its data. Ensure that yours provides automatic backups at frequent intervals and that all new files are scanned for viruses, with alerts set up for potential security threats.\nWhen transferring data, check that it's encrypted so that anyone trying to illegally access it cannot easily decode it. Additionally, role-based configuration makes sure only individuals with privileges can access programs and data, which can alleviate errors, avoid data loss, and prevent tampering.\nTalk with your LIMS provider about other safety features your system offers that can help protect your business and customers.\n4. Underscore What's at Stake\nYour lab's mission is to ensure water is safe for your customers. And, in turn, customers need to feel confident in the results you deliver and the information you maintain. That means whether you're a large lab serving customers nationwide or a small lab with just one employee, cybersecurity must be taken seriously.\nIf it's not, you can face consequences in the form of malicious emails and corrupted websites, stolen customer data and financial information, the installation of ransomware or malware, or compromised test results. It's water labs' duty to preserve public health, and hackers have the ability to compromise that, too.\nBut with a cyber plan in place, the Environmental Protection Agency says water labs can:\n- Give customers the accurate, quality information they're seeking.\n- Ensure that confidential data from customers and testing stays safe.\n- Earn customer loyalty and boost brand reputation by putting privacy first.\nNo matter what size your lab is, make sure your staff knows what's at risk when cybersafety is compromised. And emphasize that when everyone makes the effort, the sensitive information of your business, customers, and employees has the best chance of staying safe."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a7821883-661e-4d4f-a8c7-d65cfc6d2d01>","<urn:uuid:5b70957d-348e-4421-b23f-17b7148e21f3>"],"error":null}

A symbolic frontier of lights, the LICHTGRENZE, a line of 8,000 illuminated helium balloons along the 15 kilometer long path once occupied by the Berlin Wall, divided the city once again.\nFrom the Oberbaumbrücke and its East Side Gallery, through Checkpoint Charlie, the Potsdamer Platz and Brandenburger Tor, up to the Bernauer Straße and Bornholmer Straße, which was, on November 9, 1989, the first checkpoint allowing people to pass through freely to West Berlin.\nOn November 9, all balloons were released into the Berlin night sky accompanied by the Staatskapelle Berlin playing “Ode An die Freude“.\nThis year on November 09, Berlin will celebrate 25 years fall of the Berlin Wall. In preparation for this big event, the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden are hosting an exhibition about the Wall, the old GDR (DDR) times and the life in a city divided by stone.\nLearn about the construction of the wall on August 13, 1961 – the life with and behind a wall, the diversity between east and west and the fall of the wall on November 09, 1989 – the Exhibition not only features a variety of photographs but also various historical objects.\nThe Bernauer Straße is a street in Berlin’s Mitte district, it was named after the City of Bernau which is located about 10 km northeast of Berlin. During the old GDR times, the Wall was erected alongside this street and it became famous for numerous escapes from windows of nearby apartments and houses in the eastern part of the city.\nNow, a part of it was turned into a memorial park, explaining the history of a divided Berlin, with a newly constructed Visitor and Information Center, a viewing platform and an exhibition about the time when the Berlin Wall was built in August 1961.\nA lot is happening in Berlin right now, the famous East Side Gallery, one of Berlin’s historical Landmarks, painted by many international artists, faces partial demolition.\nThousands of protesters have gathered during the last days, at the longest remaining stretch of the Berlin Wall, to protest against a planned construction project, to remove small parts of the wall to make way for a luxury block of flats on the former GDR death strip.\nOn Sunday, March 17-2013, David Hasselhoff came back to Berlin, to support the protest, driving alongside the wall in a yellow van mounted with speakers while singing “Looking for Freedom”, the same song he sang at the 1989 New Year’s Party in Berlin, shortly after the wall dividing East and West Germany was torn down.\nThe Checkpoint Charlie is one of Berlin’s most famous landmarks, which served as the only crossing point for diplomats, journalists and non-German visitors, between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War, from the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 till the fall on November 9, 1989.\nIn October 1961, US and Soviet tanks had a close encounter because of a dispute over whether East German guards were authorized to examine the travel documents of a U.S. diplomat passing through to East Berlin, both sides tanks faced each other in an acrimonious moment feared around the World as a possible lead up to World War III.\nToday, it is a must see sight in Berlin with huge historical and emotional resonance, even accounting for the fact that there is remarkably little left to recall the atmosphere of pre-1989 days.\nFour days of celebration with a major parade to end it all.

Tacheles is a large (9000 square meter) building on Oranienburger Straße in the district known as Mitte. The exterior of the building was damaged from shelling in World War II, and much of the damage was never repaired. Huge, colorful graffiti-style murals are painted on the exterior walls, and modern art sculptures are featured inside.\nThe Kunsthaus was formerly a department store in the Jewish quarter (Scheunenviertel) of Berlin, next to the synagogue, it was originally called Friedrichsstadtpassagen. After serving as a Nazi prison, the building was taken over by artists, who called it “Tacheles”, Yiddish for “straight talking.”\nThree pieces of the Berlin Wall were placed in front of the famous Paris Bar in Berlin’s district Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf.\nThe Paris Bar is a place where artists, writers, journalist and film stars typically congregate and where Iggy Pop once gave a Rolling Stone journalist a blitzed interview that ended with him rolling around on the sidewalk out front. The French bistro has been a local favorite since it cheered up the postwar years in dismal bombed-out Berlin.\nThe pieces, each 3,60 meters high and 1,20 meters wide, were designed by the owner himself, of course, the owner of the Paris Bar, not the Berlin Wall.\nPiano Music meets StreetArt.\nLast weekend, I took a walk through Berlin’s Mauerpark, a public park in Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg district near some remains of the Berlin Wall and I discovered a couple of fancy painted pianos standing around with street artists working on them.\nAfter I gathered some information, I now know that the whole thing was the start of a new event. During the next three weeks, these pianos are placed on different locations in Berlin and everyone is invited to play on them.\nPostdamer Platz and Leipziger Patz, both near the U- and S-Bahnhof Potsdamer Platz, are the most blatant expression of how the Wall put a stop to Berlin’s urban development. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, new densely-populated quarters rose phoenix-like from the ashes of the old border wasteland.

{"question":"How do psychotherapy and massage therapy sessions differ in their approach to treating stress?","answer":"Psychotherapy and massage therapy take different approaches to treating stress. In psychotherapy sessions, which last 45-60 minutes, the focus is on talking and exploring thoughts and emotions, with the therapist actively listening and helping to identify the sources of stress while teaching coping skills and strategies. In massage therapy sessions, the approach is physical, using various hands-on techniques like Swedish massage or aromatherapy to directly work on the body's soft tissues, muscles, and pressure points. This physical manipulation helps reduce stress by generating positive electrical activity, increasing blood circulation, and promoting relaxation through touch and sometimes the use of fragrant oils and scents.","context":["Psychotherapy is a type of treatment that helps people with their emotional and mental well-being. It’s like having conversations with a specially trained person called a psychotherapist. They’re here to support you and help you understand your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors better. The main goal is to make you feel better and help you grow as a person.\nPsychotherapists use different techniques like talking, listening, and teaching you new skills to manage your emotions and thoughts. They create a safe space where you can freely express your concerns and worries.\nPsychology, on the other hand, is a bigger field. It’s all about studying how people think, feel, and behave. Psychologists are professionals who research and understand human behavior. They use scientific methods to learn more about how our minds work.\nSo, in a nutshell, psychotherapy is a specific kind of treatment that falls under the bigger umbrella of psychology. It focuses on helping you with your mental well-being by having conversations with a trained professional. Psychology, on the other hand, is the broader field that studies human behavior as a whole.\nCommon reasons for treatment?\nPersonal Growth: You might be seeking psychotherapy to explore and develop your personal potential.

Through the therapist’s guidance, you may have gained fresh insights, gained new perspectives, and discovered alternative ways of thinking and approaching challenges. This newfound clarity can provide a sense of empowerment and motivation to make positive changes in your life.\nFurthermore, the confidential nature of the therapeutic relationship helps to ensure your privacy and discretion. Knowing that what you discuss in therapy remains confidential can provide a deep sense of security. This allows you to share your deepest thoughts and experiences without worrying about them being shared with others.\nOverall, after a positive and nurturing session with a therapist who embodies these qualities, you may feel a combination of relief, comfort, understanding, hope, and empowerment. It’s important to remember that everyone’s experience is unique, and your emotions and reactions may vary. However, a supportive therapeutic relationship with a caring and compassionate therapist can have a profoundly positive impact on your well-being and personal growth.","What is Massage Therapy?\nMassage therapy is a manual method of working on body’s soft tissues, deep muscles, various pressure points, tendons and ligaments using several techniques and applying fixed and movable pressure, to help relieve stress, promote healing and relaxation. The massage is performed by a professional who uses their hands and fingers to handle different muscles by making various movements like pressing and rubbing. All of these techniques are quite advantageous for the muscular, circulatory, lymphatic and nervous systems of the body. Owing to these great benefits, massage therapy for cancer patients is now becoming common.\nOne of the oldest method of healing, massage therapy, is a clinically oriented health care option, now used widely as a complementary treatment for cancer patients. Massage therapy helps people suffering from cancer by eliminating anxiety, boosting the immunity, and diminishing tiredness and pain. Various modalities of massage therapy are employed for cancer care. Some of them are Swedish massage, aromatherapy massage, acupressure, and reflexology.\nHow Does Massage Therapy Work?\nThere are various varieties of massage therapies available, and the therapy offered will depend upon the patient’s individual needs and conditions.\nIn Swedish massage multiple strokes and moments are used to relax the muscles of the body while lubricating the skin with massage oil. While aromatherapy focuses on the physical, and mental well-being of the person. Various fragrant oils and scents are used to complement and naturally enhance the benefits of massage. Acupressure simply thought as acupuncture without needles, involves applying pressure to acupoints on the body. This Chinese technique is used to treat many diseases. Reflexology, another modality of massage therapy, is the application of appropriate pressure, to the specific points on the hands, feet or ears that are linked to other parts of the body.\nAll these approaches and various massage methods emphasize on specific goals by restoring and calming the body and mind, muscles and soft tissues. When a massage therapist massages a particular area of the body, positive electrical activity is generated and transmitted from that region, which leads to increased blood circulation, low levels of pain, better capability to fight diseases, and an increased lymphatic drainage. Massage therapy helps in lowering stress levels and improves quality of life.\nAdvantages of Massage Therapy with Different Types of Cancer\nAs per above discussions, there are many different kinds of massage therapy and these have various effects on the body. There are different types of cancer, and their stages and treatment are also variable. All forms of cancer cause pain, it is very prevalent amongst cancer patients and often neglected by physicians. Massage therapy for cancer patients is used increasingly to relieve cancer-related pain and is considered useful and beneficial for their well-being, leading to decreased pain scores in cancer patients. It also helps in relieving other symptoms of cancer such tiredness, difficulty in sleeping, reducing stress and anxiety, decreasing lymphedema and several other side effects, providing healing and relaxation to the cancer patients. A research conducted with 230 cancer patients concluded that healing touch of massage relieves pain and anxiety levels and decreases the need to take painkillers. Massage therapy is also of great advantage in breast cancer patients. The therapeutic process elevates the level of brain chemical “dopamine “in the brain, which leads to elevated mood and feeling to goodness and wellbeing, a number of protective white blood cells also increase and help boost the immune system of these patients.\nDoes Massage Therapy Cause Metastasis?\nMetastasis is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to other parts. Although there are various debates and myths present, linking massage to metastasis of cancer, there is no real evidence present to support, that massage therapy in cancer patients leads to or promotes metastasis. Massage therapy for cancer patients is considered safe and rather helpful for the those suffering from cancer. However, any modality of massage therapy, which the patient may plan to undertake, should be properly discussed with the doctor, as there might be potential risk involved for patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer.\nHowever, it is the subject of debate that deep pressure massage therapy might be responsible for the spread of tumor and metastasis of cancer in various body organs. It is, therefore, crucial that one should not directly massage over the tumor area, and it’s surrounding soft tissues and muscles. Deep massage therapy should be avoided in people with bone cancer as deep massage and application of pressure applied over the affected area might cause a bone fracture.\nDoes Massage Therapy Decrease the Side Effects of Chemotherapy?\nChemotherapy is used to treat a wide variety of cancer. Chemotherapy, in addition to the killing of cancer cells, causes severe side effects like anxiety, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, problems with muscle and nerves, muscle pain, kidney and bladder problems. Massage therapy for cancer patients not only helps in dealing with the side effects of chemotherapy but also enhances the positive impact of chemo. The relaxation response caused by massage therapy helps relieve nausea and decreases muscle pain. In 2005, a research stated that acupressure, a type of massage therapy, reduces vomiting and nausea, induced by chemotherapy. Another research study conducted in 2007 stipulated that post- chemotherapy fatigue, physical fatigue, and anemia is reduced after massage therapy in cancer patients.\nDoes Massage Therapy Decrease the Side Effects of Radiation?\nRadiation therapy, also known as radiation or radio, is another form of cancer treatment that relies on radio waves to treat the tumor and decrease its size. However its side effects are also massive and troublesome, they can include, for instance, insomnia, fatigue, hair loss, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, swelling, urinary and bladder changes, and sexual changes. There is an established role of massage therapy in fighting the side effects of radiotherapy. It counters the damaging effects of heat and radiation by healing and soothing through touch. In 2009, a pilot study that included 14 cancer patients receiving acupuncture for four weeks, concluded that massage therapy in these patients relieved Xerostomia, a condition caused by radiation in which salivary glands don’t produce enough saliva that can in turn lead to severe dryness of mouth.\nDoes Massage Therapy Stimulate the Immune System?\nMassage therapy boosts the immune system by increasing the circulation of blood throughout the body. The enhanced circulation of blood leads to delivery of nutrients throughout the body, along with the circulation of lymph, which promotes movement of fighter cells of immune system. The extra boost in immune system through massage helps body fighting potential and speeds up recovery from infection and injury.\nDoes Massage Therapy Increase Quality of Life?\nMassage therapy for cancer patients enhances the quality of life. Massage therapy increases circulation of blood and metabolism, hence activating every cell of the body, increasing immunity, and in the rejuvenation of body and mind. It was proven in 2003 by Department of Mental health science in the UK.\nDoes Massage Therapy Increase the Survival Rate?\nPhysical symptoms of cancer are quite distressing for the patients battling cancer. These symptoms include nausea, vomiting, pain and increased fatigue levels. Proper massage therapy along with exercise and change in diet positively affects up to 75 to 95% of cancer patients. Massage therapy for cancer patients leads to improved fatigue levels. The research was conducted by cancer rehabilitation institute at the University of North Colorado.\nFeatured Photo Source: American Massage Therapy Association\n- Acupressure Points and Massage Treatment\n- The effect of massage therapy on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in pediatric cancer\n- Massage therapy for cancer patients: a reciprocal relationship between body and mind\nDr. Adem Gunes has built the world’s largest database of scientifically tested natural substances with proven effects in cancer treatments.

{"question":"As a medical professional interested in patient care collaboration, how do the roles of dental hygienists and orthotic specialists compare in terms of their impact on treatment success and patient compliance?","answer":"Both dental hygienists and orthotic specialists play crucial roles in treatment success and patient compliance, but in different ways. Dental hygienists spend the most chair-time with patients and are vital in collaborative patient care, particularly for periodontal and orthodontic treatments. When patients feel respected by hygienists, they become more compliant with preventive care recommendations. Dental hygienists serve as the first line of defense against infections and are essential in identifying patients who need specialized treatment. Similarly, orthotic specialists are vital in spinal trauma treatment, but their success depends on carefully selecting and fitting appropriate devices while considering individual patient needs. They must choose devices that provide adequate stabilization while minimizing adverse effects like skin irritation, muscular atrophy, and discomfort. Both professionals must work within established protocols and maintain ongoing communication with other healthcare providers to ensure optimal patient outcomes.","context":["The orthotic management of spinal trauma remains an essential treatment option. However, the indications for orthotic management are constantly changing because of the evolving concepts of stability, indications for surgery, and surgical techniques. The complications traditionally associated with the surgical management of certain spinal fractures have significantly decreased with the increasing prevalence of minimally invasive techniques. This influences the indications for orthotic use in some trauma scenarios. However, the principles and expectations of orthotic use remain constant and an important option in the treatment of spinal trauma. One must determine the stability of the injury and the stabilizing ability of the orthoses available when considering the appropriate orthotic. This decision-making process is, therefore, specific to the individual fractures and their respective level of injury.\nSpinal orthoses can be used by a member of the emergency medical service to provide initial immobilization, as temporary management until the surgery is performed, as the definitive management, or as an adjunct to surgery. The principle of preventing motion in the adjacent joints, as used in the extremity, also applies to the spine. However, when using spinal orthoses, the goal is not only to immobilize the motion segments adjacent to the injured level but also the functional levels adjacent to the injured spinal region (i.e., occipitocervical or thoracolumbar). As such, when stabilizing the cervical spine, the head and the thoracic spine must be included so that the occipitocervical and cervicothoracic levels are immobilized or, when stabilizing the lumbar spine, the pelvis and the thoracic spine are immobilized. Compared with surgical management of spinal disorders, the use of orthoses may seem benign; however, it is not without risks and complications. These devices may be associated with skin irritation, muscular atrophy, osteopenia, joint stiffness, severe discomfort, and even death.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to review the different types and function of spinal orthoses, commonly encountered adverse effects, and the principles in their use for the nonoperative treatment of selected spinal trauma.\nThe orthotic devices commonly used to immobilize the cervical spine after trauma are grouped into cervical collar, poster brace, cervicothoracic orthosis (CTO), and halo-vest device ( Table 39-1 ). The unique anatomy within the upper cervical spine and subaxial spine makes immobilization challenging, and the choice of device remains dependent on the location of the injury. The stabilization of the cervical spine depends on the ability to immobilize the skull proximally (usually via occiput and the mandible) and the clavicle or thorax (or both) distally. Hard contact against the mandible and occiput are associated with skin irritation and impairment of mandibular movement can interfere with mastication. Increased rigidity of the device can increase these adverse effects. Distal immobilization is challenging because the clavicle moves with shoulder motion and the soft tissues around the shoulder and the upper trunk are variable in size and shape. All of these factors, along with the degree of injury, must be taken into consideration. The clinician must choose a device that meets the patient’s specific needs while minimizing adverse effects.\n|Cervical Orthosis||Characteristics||Common Types|\n|Soft collar||Proprioceptive feedback to the patient |\nReduced cervical motion by 5% to 20%\n|Serpentine, Form fit, Universal, Ruffs|\n|Hard collar||Plastic bivalved shell, lined with removable pads, connected by Velcro straps |\nMore sagittal motion control than axial or lateral motion\n|Philadelphia, Aspen, PMT, Cervmax, Miami J|\n|Cervicothoracic||Superior restriction of lateral and axial motion than collars |\nHead controlled by padded mandibular and occiput supports; rigid uprights attach head to thoracic plates and straps\n|SOMI, Minerva, Guilford, poster brace|\n|Halo vest||Most effective method of upper cervical and occipitocervical stabilization |\nHalo ring around head secured to thoracic vest\nSubaxial snaking phenomena possible\nThe cervical collar is generally categorized into soft and hard options; both extend between the occiput and the mandible down to the clavicle. The soft collar ( Fig. 39-1 ) provides very little support or stability to the cervical spine. It has been shown to only reduce cervical motion by approximately 5% to 20%. The primary purpose of the device is to provide some proprioceptive feedback to the patient. Although the least stabilizing of all the cervical collars, it is also the least expensive and is associated with minimal patient discomfort. Generally, patients with whiplash injuries and posttraumatic neck pain may be treated with a soft collar for a short time so as to limit the associated potential for deconditioning, increased stiffness, and psychological dependence. In postoperative patients, we may use cervical ruffs, made from stockinette filled with cotton padding, loosely tied around the patient’s neck to provide proprioceptive feedback, reassurance, and a visual reminder to caregivers of the patient’s postoperative state.\nThe hard cervical collars are the most commonly used cervical orthoses. There are many commercially available variants of the collar, the most common being the Philadelphia, Aspen, PMT, Cervmax, and Miami J ( Fig. 39-2 ). Most of the collars consist of a plastic bivalved shell that is lined with removable pads (however, the Philadelphia collar consists of two plastic-reinforced Plastazote shells). The anterior shell encompasses the mandible and chin superiorly and rests on the anterior chest, sternum, and clavicles. The posterior shell lines the occiput around to below the ears and rests on the upper back and trapezium. The anterior and posterior shells are connected by Velcro straps. The hard cervical collars tend to be more effective in minimizing motion in the sagittal plane compared with lateral bend and axial rotation. Multiple biomechanical studies have compared the effectiveness of these devices. Most commercially available cervical collars appear to be effective in immobilizing the spine, but some models may be more comfortable for the patient than others. Importantly, the improper fitting of the hard collar, whether it is too small or too big, will have a significant effect on the ability of the collar to limit cervical motion in all planes (flexion-extension, axial rotation, and lateral bend). These devices are commonly used to immobilize the cervical spine as part of cervical spine precautions in trauma patients until the cervical spine is safely cleared. Some of the rigid collars initially applied by the emergency medical service are often less padded than those described earlier. In all cases, it is important that these devices be removed as soon as injury to the cervical spine is excluded to limit the potential complications of skin irritation, difficulty with ingestion and speaking, and general discomfort. Furthermore, the use of rigid collars has the potential to increase intracranial pressure, which can be perilous in patients with traumatic brain injury.\nCervicothoracic Orthosis and Poster Braces\nCompared with the hard cervical collars, CTOs and poster braces provide better restriction of motion in axial rotation and lateral bend. CTOs are designed to be more effective in immobilization of the cervical spine than cervical collars because of the more extensive chest plates. The poster brace and the CTO are similar devices with the CTO extending slightly more distal and incorporating more of the chest, usually with a circumferential strap. The poster brace is best described as a cervical collar with extension down to the chest and/or back. CTOs and poster braces control the head through padded mandibular platforms and supports at the back of the occiput. Rigid uprights then attach the head to the thorax via thoracic plates or straps. Examples of these orthoses include the Minerva brace ( Fig. 39-3 ), the SOMI (sternal-occipital-mandibular immobilizer) brace ( Fig. 39-4 ), and commercially available hard collars outfitted with extension pieces to both the skull and chest. The poster braces connect the mandibular and occipital pads to the torso by two or four metal struts.\nThe SOMI brace consists of a rigid anterior chest plate that extends over the shoulders and connects to the occipital pad. The chin piece is removable for eating and can be reinforced with a strap that spans across the forehead. Unlike the Minerva brace, the SOMI brace does not have a posterior chest plate so it is more comfortable for patients confined to bed. The SOMI brace has been extensively studied compared with a variety of hard collars. There appears to be very little difference between the braces’ ability to stabilize the cervical spine, except for flexion-extension, for which a difference has been shown favoring the SOMI brace. Johnson and colleagues demonstrated that the SOMI brace is significantly better at controlling flexion between C1 and C5 than the cervical hard collar (Philadelphia collar), CTO, and four-poster brace but was very poor at controlling extension in the same location.\nThe addition of posters to the hard collar improves the control of flexion-extension, lateral bend, and rotation. Apart from the halo-vest orthosis, the CTO, such as the Minerva and Guilford, is the best immobilizer for all planes of cervical motion. It is important to note that all cervical orthoses are not particularly effective at limiting flexion-extension at the occipitocervical spine compared with segmental motion in the upper cervical and subaxial spine. Improved immobilization comes at the expense of patient comfort and the risk of skin breakdown. Use of these more rigid orthoses in cognitively impaired patients risks occipital and mandibular skin ulceration.\nThe halo fixator is a device that connects the head to the thorax. In adults, four pins are placed that pierce the outer table of the calvarium and secure the halo ring around the head. The halo-vest device is generally accepted as the most effective method of upper cervical spine stabilization including the occipitocervical junction and is superior to all other orthotic devices discussed earlier. However, some vertebral segmental motion, on average 7 degrees of angulation and 1.7 mm of translation, can be detected at the injured level in the majority of patients. Furthermore, the halo-vest device can be associated with a snaking phenomenon, whereby neck muscle contraction causes translation of individual vertebrae in the midcervical spine producing focal kyphosis caused by immobilization of the upper and lower segments. The halo-vest device is commonly used to stabilize the cervical spine when the rigid collar and CTOs are deemed to be insufficient. When using this device, careful consideration must be given to patient selection to avoid complications. Absolute contraindications to the use of the halo ring include cranial fractures and infection or severe soft tissue injury at proposed pin sites. Relative contraindications include chest trauma, obesity, pregnancy, advanced age, and barrel-shaped chest. The elderly population is particularly at high risk of halo vest–related complications with a mortality rate reported to be as high as 40%. In this patient cohort, the mortality and major complication rates of those treated with halo-vest devices are significantly higher than compared with those treated with cervical collar.\nRecommended Orthoses for the Nonoperative Treatment of Selected Cervical Injuries\nFor all fractures, the potential for surgical intervention must be excluded before initiating conservative care. Indications for surgical intervention are discussed in detail within other chapters of this textbook.\nC1 Ring Fracture\nFor minimally displaced fractures of the C1 ring, we commonly use a hard cervical collar because this injury pattern is relatively stable. For potentially unstable Jefferson fractures (i.e., C1 ring burst fractures), a halo-vest fixator or CTO if the halo vest is contraindicated can be used with the goal of preventing either C1-C2 instability caused by transverse ligament injuries or deformity secondary to C0-C1 or C1-C2 lateral mass malalignment.\nTransverse Ligament Injuries\nWhen an avulsion fracture has disrupted the integrity of the transverse ligament, management in a cervical orthotic may be considered. In this case, flexion at the C1-C2 level should be immobilized using either a CTO (a SOMI brace best controls upper cervical spine flexion) or halo-vest device.\nType II Odontoid Fractures\nIf orthotic management of this fracture is selected, then the age of the patient will determine the type of orthotic selected. For patients younger than 65 years of age, the halo-vest device should be chosen to provide the best immobilization of this fracture. If the fracture pattern is noncomminuted and nondisplaced and in a reverse oblique fracture pattern (which predisposes the peg to anterior translation relative to the C2 body), then a SOMI brace may be considered. In the elderly population, we use the hard cervical collar if the fracture is to be treated nonoperatively. The expectation of this approach is to achieve a relatively stable fibrous nonunion, but not necessarily consolidation, of the fracture.\nType III Odontoid Fractures\nA hard collar for the elderly population is recommended for this fracture. We recommend either a hard collar or CTO for the nonelderly adult population.\nC2 Pars Fractures (Hangman’s Fractures)\nIn the case of a stable hangman’s fracture with no or minimal displacement, we recommend the use of a hard collar or CTO.\nSpinous Process Fractures, Laminar Fractures, and Compression Fractures of the Subaxial Spine\nThese fractures are stable injuries that are well treated in a hard collar.\nFacet Fractures of the Subaxial Spine\nThe CTO is most appropriate for this potentially unstable fracture.","Dental hygienists are essential partners in periodontal and orthodontic specialty treatments. The dental hygienist is vital in the collaborative patient care behind periodontal disease and misaligned teeth. The collaborative role that each dental team member and provider plays can positively or negatively influence patients’ perceptions of the practice, their trust in the providers, and their overall treatment acceptance.\nWe know that dental hygienists spend the most chair-time with patients. “Patients who reported feeling respected talked about being compliant with preventive care recommendations because they felt they were being treated as a person and not as a patient.”1 Therefore, dental hygienists play the primary role in the collaboration between a general dental practice and specialty practices.\nSince periodontists are trained to treat cases of disease in the gingival tissue and supporting bone, they are dependent on strong partnerships and relationships with hygienists who possess an expertise that provides a first line of defense against the development of infection, working with the dentists to identify which patients need specialized treatment.\nIn some cases, referrals to the periodontist can be a touchy subject for general dentistry offices. Many general practitioners (GP) are reluctant to refer due to a common concern of never getting their patients back. Others are fearful of referring patients due to the pain and financial burdens of periodontal surgery.\nAs dental professionals, we must take the emotion out of the scenario and lead with our clinical mindset, which is to properly educate and recommend necessary treatment based on its effects on the oral and systemic health concerns and needs of the patient. It is important that, when you are referring to a specialist, there has been an initial treatment and referral protocol established between the GP practice and the specialty office, and hygienists need to be a part of the conversations.\nIn my experience collaborating with specialty providers, our practice first scheduled a lunchtime meeting with the periodontist where we learned about his practicing philosophy. We discussed ours as well, which we found to be in alignment with each other. The periodontist was centered on patient care and had a positive and empathetic chairside manner. The doctor is a proponent of patient education to reinforce why particular treatment is needed and keeps abreast of new technology and treatment to provide efficient care conservatively. We agreed on the following standard of care protocol:\n- The GP hygienist would complete all the initial data gathering, including radiographs, intraoral camera images, complete periodontal charting, and refer any patients with >7mm probing depths, class III mobility, class II furcation involvement, generalized moderate-advanced radiographic bone loss, and gingival graft candidate patients to the periodontist for evaluation and treatment.\n- If a patient has been receiving regular periodontal maintenance therapy, including locally administered antibiotic regimens with no improvement to their gingival health, the patient is to be referred to the periodontist for an evaluation.\n- Once periodontal specialty treatment was completed and stabilized, the patient would return to the GP hygienist for three-month periodontal maintenance therapy, periodic exams, and radiographs as needed while still being seen by the periodontist on the alternating three-month recare cycle for the first year. If, after the first year, the periodontist deems the patient is stable, then the patient will solely have the periodontal maintenance therapy completed by the GP hygienist and will have an annual gingival evaluation with the periodontist.\nThe best strategy dental hygienists can employ to incorporate orthodontic considerations into the practice is to connect and refer to local orthodontic practices. The dental hygienist has unique opportunities to impact this specialized area of dentistry, ranging from education to assessment to supportive therapies during orthodontic treatment.\nThe American Academy of Periodontology has specified occlusal examination as part of the periodontal assessment. The 2011 Comprehensive Periodontal Therapy statement includes the following: “An occlusal examination that includes, but may not be limited to, determining the degree of mobility of teeth and dental implants, occlusal patterns and discrepancy, and determination of fremitus. Occlusal therapy that may include tooth movement, occlusal adjustment, splinting, periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics, or biteguard therapy as a means to establish and maintain occlusal health;” and “Procedures to facilitate orthodontic treatment including tooth exposure, frenulectomy, fiberotomy, temporary anchorage devices, and gingival augmentation.”2\nRegarding the collaboration with the orthodontic specialty provider, we too had a lunch meeting and discussed our practicing philosophies and developed the following action plan:\n- All pediatric patients will have a panoramic radiograph taken and be referred to an orthodontist for initial evaluation beginning at the age of seven years.\n- If a pediatric patient under the age of seven years presents to the office with a Class III occlusion or another immediate orthognathic concern, a referral to the orthodontist is needed.\n- Adult patients with malalignment will be referred to the orthodontist for evaluation and treatment needed outside the GP scope of providing clear aligner therapy.\n- All patients under orthodontic treatment will be recommended to be seen on a four-month recare cycle by the GP hygienist and receive an in-office fluoride treatment.\n- At-home standard of care product expectations are for the patient to use a power toothbrush, water flosser, and fluoride to maintain optimal oral health.\nThere were no formal contracts signed between the GP and specialty practices for referrals. The agreed-upon communication was that each provider would provide a standard-of-care written report on date-of-service treatment, additional recommendations, and next steps. This standard of care report was an important part of the care process and was saved into the patient’s chart for future reference, treatment needs, and any communication required for a medical physician if applicable.\nThese collaborations and specialty partnerships resulted in an improved patient care management process, improved patient health, improved patient satisfaction ratings, an increase in patient referrals between both the GP and specialty practices, more effective schedules, and improved patient-provider trusting relationships.\nDental hygienists are an organized and structured group. Establishing a protocol and standard of care plan of action will enhance treatment opportunities and provide clinicians with the satisfaction of delivering the quality of care that our patients deserve.\nListen to the Today’s RDH Dental Hygiene Podcast Below:\n- Dalonges, D.A., Fried, J.L.

{"question":"What are the main tools and features available in Melodyne Editor's pitch modulation menu?","answer":"The pitch modulation menu in Melodyne Editor contains three main tools: the default pitch correction tool that allows dragging notes up and down on the keyboard (with double-clicking to center notes to specific frequencies), the pitch modulation tool for adjusting the amount of vibrato in a tone, and the pitch drift tool that controls how far a note can go sharp or flat while remaining connected as a single note.","context":["Perhaps the greatest tool utilized in every studio these days is some form of pitch correction, and nobody makes a more powerful tool for pitch correction than Celemony. Melodyne Editor provides just about every imaginable adjustment, not only dealing with pitch, but also timbre, timing, modulation, and more! While there are several options on the market for corrective editing, and several DAWs with built-in options, Melodyne Editor has revolutionized the way professionals work with audio and has defined itself as a necessity for any sessions requiring even the most minimal corrections.\nMelodyne Editor has dozens of features that are easily accessible while working within the program, which is available as RTAS, AU, and VST plug-ins, as well as in a standalone version called Melodyne Singletrack. The features are the same across the board, making it equally as powerful regardless of your DAW. More importantly, the controls/key commands/functions are the same in every format, making it easy for engineers accustomed to Pro Tools use Melodyne just as fluently in say Cubase or Studio One. Melodyne’s basics are easy to learn very quickly, with advanced techniques allowing for seamless audio editing with experimentation. Looking at a few sections of Melodyne will show just how intuitive the software is.\nThe first thing users of Melodyne need to do is import their audio, which is as simple as hitting record in the top left of the standalone version, or selecting “Transfer” and playing back audio in your DAW. Melodyne scans the sound, analyzes it, then transcribes the audio to a piano style interface. During this process, other critical information is captured by the program, including an attempt at figuring out the key of the audio. I’ve found the assumed key to almost always be correct, making quick correction a breeze. In the event it’s wrong, Melodyne provides the option to edit the key/scale/tuning of the program. The transport section in the standalone software is pretty straightforward from there, including play/stop controls, tempo/time signature controls, and a metronome for reference. In the plug-in, you have the option to link/unlink the tempo instead of the traditional playback options.\nThe editing tools replace your pointer in Melodyne, and can be switched in a box next to the Transport, or by right-clicking anywhere in the program. The right-click feature allows some of the fastest switching in the program; faster switching than any DAW controls I’ve come across in the past. This feature in particular allows me to use a standard mouse or trackpad without sacrificing speed. The tools are split into five icons with drastically different purposes. Three of the icons include drop-down menus for more specific tools. This form of tool access is more reminiscent of picture editing software like Adobe Photoshop, but proves to be an easy way to remember where everything is.\nThe first icon/menu is vital for navigation and editing, giving access to most of the necessary tools to get a decent sound. At its base level, the “Main Tool” acts a lot like a smart tool in Pro Tools, detecting what it thinks you want to do based on the position of your pointer. Underneath, in the drop-down menu, you have a scroll tool (looks like a hand) for moving through your audio, and a zoom tool allowing you to zoom in on both time and the range of notes. Once you find a range for the song, zooming isn’t really necessary, but becomes extremely useful for something that jumps several octaves (Mariah Carey vocal take?) in a song.\nThe second menu is perhaps the most useful section, defaulting to Melodyne’s default function: pitch correction. Users are quickly able to drag notes up and down on the keyboard, and double-clicking centers the note to that frequency, almost like retuning a flat guitar string. The two other options in this menu, pitch modulation & pitch drift, operate in a similar manner. The modulation tool acts to increase or decrease the amount of vibrato in a given tone. Similarly, the pitch drift affects how far a note can go sharp or flat while remaining connected as a single note.\nThe next three tools I utilize less frequently, but each have a specific function that may be useful to some. The formant tool changes the sound of audio in a drastic way. The most simplified explanation of formant is variations in how different voices sound, even when singing the same pitch. The more drastic uses could be sound design to create the voice of a chipmunk by raising the formant, or a demon by lowering it. The most realistic use I could find would be using the formant to change a singer’s voice slightly if they sing their own backgrounds, just to add variation. To the left of the formant are the amplitude and timing controls, which I usually don’t use since I can utilize volume automation and elastic audio in Pro Tools.\nThe final tool in the menu is one of my most frequently used when I have a session that needs heavy pitch correction. In order to keep the interface simple, Melodyne limits itself on notes in a set amount of time, and sometimes combines two or three notes into one close one. The separation tool puts this control in the engineers hands, by allowing you to chop up a single note into as many little pieces as you want. Most of the time I don’t need to worry, but on the rare occasion I do need to split something up, this tool makes it quick and simple.\nWhere To Start?\nIn almost every case, I start using Melodyne by looking over the track to make sure there are no extreme miscalculations about what note is being played/sung. After verifying that everything looks okay, I use Melodyne’s “Correct Pitch” feature to do some automatic tuning for me, then spot check the rest myself. This tool allows to you decide how exact you want each note, as well as how much drift each note can have on a percentage of 1-100. This quick option has saved me hours of pitch correction, and works transparently on almost anything I’ve tried it on. There is also an option to automatically quantize the timing of the vocal, which works great if you have a straight-forward, grid-locked vocal. I usually prefer to pocket my vocals into a song, which is easier done in tracking or using elastic audio.\nMelodyne is an unparalleled powerhouse piece of software that no studio should be without. It’s transparency and ease-of-use allows anything to sound natural, which is key to a properly tuned vocals. For those more interested in twisting audio into something unnatural, a few adjustments will allow for “auto-tune” style effects, or you could mess around with the formant tool.

This Bass Connections project, a platform for giving students interdisciplinary experience addressing real-world problems, germinated the idea for the Energy Access Project. Vujic and the students created the initial version of the project proposal that Rogers and his wife would later fund.\nUnderstanding the Issue of Modern Energy for All\nThe Energy Access Project launched in Washington, D.C., in February 2018, bringing together leaders from government, business, civil society, and academia to discuss the biggest barriers to energy access and how to overcome them.\nOne of the seven key themes was that more research is needed to strengthen our understanding of the way in which modern energy access relates to education, health, and food security outcomes. Collaborations between researchers and policy makers could facilitate effective planning for communities’ energy futures and help to mobilize local entrepreneurs.\nWith an international research collaborative, the Sustainable Energy Transitions Initiative (SETI), the Energy Access Project staff and students helped to review nearly 80,000 academic articles to map the existing research connecting energy access, technologies, and interventions to different impacts and development outcomes.\n“The review points to a troubling pattern,” said Energy Access Project faculty director Subhrendu Pattanayak, who also leads SETI. “There’s a big gap between what is being evaluated by scholars and the types of programs, projects, and policies being implemented.”\nThis gap—between what we know and what we do—could keep the world from achieving a critical number of these Sustainable Development Goals, Pattanayak said, noting that we must make scientific evidence more practice based by training the next cadre of scholars an practitioners and encouraging impact evaluations of real-life projects, programs, and policy or risk being left in the dark.\nStaff are taking on work to help researchers and decision makers make research more accessible to target audiences. In doing so, the project will drive a global research agenda focused on filling key knowledge gaps, in the process deepening our understanding of how energy access relates to other development outcomes. The Energy Access Project is convening researchers to lead integration of diverse disciplines, such as data analytics, with real world energy access applications using tools like satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\nOvercoming Policy, Market Barriers to Access\n“Despite the increased interest in the idea of universal energy access, our policy makers and analysts have not quite caught up with the quick-moving world of the business models and financing piece,” said Profeta. “Because this is all so new, there’s a chance for great creative thought on how to get at this problem. Duke has the expertise and experience to find those unique solutions.”\nBeyond its research focus, the Energy Access Project is working directly with policy makers on the design of key institutions and policies to support electrification as well as with companies and social enterprises to understand how innovative business models can help reach last-mile customers.\nTo help the U.S. Congress navigate emerging market financing reform options, Energy Access Project staff assembled an analysis of how a new, more fully-equipped American development finance institution could help fill the global energy financing gap.\nIn their policy brief, released in June 2018 as the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act (BUILD Act) legislation continued to move closer to passage in Congress, Energy Access Project staff found that the United States is not fully harnessing the power of private sector-led development, leaving U.S. foreign policy gains—and U.S. Treasury profits—on the table and businesses without the capital to build modern energy systems and other underpinnings of development.\n“If just 7 percent of global power investments were focused on where 14 percent of the population lives, universal electrification could be achieved by 2030,” Phillips said, noting the lack of early-stage concessional capital to get projects adequately developed, de-risked, and ready for debt investment. “More risk-appetite capital is needed to mobilize the larger pools of money available through private equity funds, development finance institutions, and other investors.”\nEntirely new energy delivery platforms have the potential to power remote villages many miles from the existing grid. The Energy Access Project is collaborating with CrossBoundary Energy and the Rockefeller Foundation on a new Mini-Grid Innovation Lab to help refine one of these promising models. The partnership is testing innovative new business models for deploying off-grid mini-grids in order to improve the economics of mini-grids and better understand how rural low-income customers can best be served.\n“The ultimate goal of this effort is to equip governments, investors and developers to dramatically accelerate rural electrification in an integrated manner, unlocking new economic opportunities for millions of households,” Ashvin Dayal, Rockefeller Foundation associate vice president and managing director for Smart Power, said in an interview with Solar Magazine about the lab.\nStudents as Engines of Innovation\nThe Energy Access Project is interested in “supporting the bubbling ecosystem of ideas and collaboration that’s happening at Duke and around the world,” said Phillips, and mobilizing students is “central to this work.”\nThe project supports relevant courses, internships, and campus events that build linkages between the Duke student and faculty community and the energy access practitioner and policymaking community.\nShortly after its launch, the Energy Access Project sponsored and helped to judge the Energy in Emerging Markets Case Competition in partnership with M-KOPA Solar. The competition attracted 45 student teams from around the world to focus their business and problem-solving acumen on a real-world challenge facing one of the leading companies in the solar home system sector in Africa.\n“The competition helped M-KOPA’s leadership team think through credible options for addressing a difficult regulatory and business model issue while giving hundreds of students an opportunity to wrestle with questions of technology, policy, and community development in an important and rapidly developing sector,” Phillips said.\nThe Energy Access Project is also supporting Duke science students’ efforts to create an energy access data platform. Through the Duke Data+ Program, a team of undergraduates are working closely with Power for All, a leading energy access research and policy nonprofit, to develop machine learning and natural language processing tools to improve visualization of data and information on energy access in developing countries.\n“This project is different than other projects I’ve worked on because we are working with an outside client to come up with a solution to a problem which does not already exist,” said Brooke Erickson, a member of the three-person Duke student team. “I feel as though I am truly creating new knowledge and new algorithms instead of just understanding existing algorithms.”\nThe effort ties into Power for All’s Platform for Energy Access Knowledge (PEAK), which automatically curates, organizes, and streamlines large, growing bodies of information into sharable, data-driven stories for policy makers and researchers alike. The students consult with Power for All to creatively visualize PEAK’s library—using artificial intelligence—to create more effective science communication.\nFor these students, the research is allowing them to apply their skills in ways they never thought possible.\n“Since I am not specifically studying energy or the environment, it has been extremely eye-opening to work with Power for All and the Energy Access Project,” said Erickson, who is studying economics and computer science. “I have learned about the dire need to expand energy access globally and feel as though I am able to contribute to solving that problem despite my lack of background knowledge in the area. This experience has taught me that there are ways to use computer science and data analytics in every interdisciplinary field.”\n--by Erin McKenzie\nWork on this project is funded by Jim and M.A. Rogers and the Bass Connections Challenge.\nImages: Village in Uganda using solar to power refrigerators by Duke University student Andrew Seelaus; Energy Access Project launch event in Washington, D.C., by Laurence Genon; and a commercial area of Dehli, India, by T.

{"question":"Hey! Been struggling with depression lately. I'm curious - what changes occur in visual perception during depression, and what's the recommended treatment approach? 🤔","answer":"Studies show that during major depressive episodes, patients experience reduced visual cortical contrast suppression while retinal brightness induction remains intact. This means depressed individuals see contrast-based visual stimuli more accurately than healthy people, though their brightness perception stays normal. Regarding treatment, a multi-modal approach is most effective. This typically includes addressing physical health issues (like improving sleep and nutrition), regular exercise such as daily walks, and evidence-based psychological treatments. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be particularly effective, with a review of 325 studies confirming significant improvements in both adults and adolescents. While medications like SSRIs and SNRIs may be helpful as adjunct treatments, they should not be relied upon as the sole treatment method.","context":["Patients experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE) may experience reduced visual cortical contrast suppression while retinal brightness induction remains intact, according to a study published in the Journal of Psychiatry & Neurology.\nThe researchers assessed the visual perception of 111 patients recruited from Helsinki City psychiatric outpatient facilities with MDE (46 with unipolar MDD, 38 with bipolar disorder with a current MDE, and 27 with borderline personality disorder with a current MDE, all of whom scored at least 15 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and 29 controls (health care services personnel from Helsinki) using 2 contrast tests.\nIn each trial of a brightness induction test, subjects chose which center patch of a pair of square stimuli appeared brighter when either a test patch on a darker background remained the same and the comparison patch on the lighter background changed or a test patch on a lighter background remained the same and the comparison patch of the darker background changed.\nIn the contrast suppression test, subjects declared whether a test patch (with collinear or perpendicular background) or comparison patch (no background) appeared to be higher in contrast. Each “higher” and “lower” response decreased or increased, respectively, the contrast of the comparison patch by 3%.\nThe researchers discovered that contrast suppression was reduced in patients compared with controls (t35.2 = 2.902, P =.006, d =.663). The strength of the illusion was lower for patients than for controls, and patients saw the stimuli as more veridical than controls did. The groups differed significantly in the collinear condition (t131 = 2.80, P =.006), but not in the perpendicular condition.\nThe Bayes factor (BF) provided positive evidence for similar results in the brightness induction test (BF01=3.9) and strong evidence for difference in the contrast suppression test (BF10=35.2), further confirming that patients with MDE saw the brightness induction illusion similarly to controls but saw the contrast suppression illusion more veridically than controls.\nThere was no significant difference between diagnostic subgroups of patients.\nWhen 74 patients replicated the contrast tests in a follow-up, about half of the patients were in remission from experiencing MDE. The researchers found that the correlation between MADRS score and change in brightness induction was r67 =.073, P =.556 while the correlation between MADRS score and change in contrast suppression was r73 =–0.156, P =.189, indicating that a decrease in depression symptoms was associated with an increase in contrast suppression.\nLinear regression analysis indicated an association between the use of lamotrigine, valproate or pregabalin and increased brightness induction and decreased contrast suppression.\nSensitivity of the test was 79% and specificity was 45% when the cut-off point was the mean of the controls. Using an optimal cut-off point based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, the sensitivity was 50% and the specificity was 62%. The area under the curve was 0.66.\nLimitations of the study included the fact that the researchers could only indirectly infer retinal and cortical processing and there were differences in the sample sizes.\n“Combined with the findings of previous studies, it appears that MDEs involve changes at different levels in the visual processing hierarchy, from retina to cortex,” the study authors wrote. “From a practical point of view, visual contrast tests are a rapid, simple and noninvasive method that could be further developed to serve as biomarkers for the abnormal processing of visual information in depression.”\nSalmela V, Socada L, Söderholm J, et al.

People who are dealing with major depression often have trouble sleeping, which can also cause extreme tiredness during the day.\nChronic fatigue syndrome is another condition that can occur alongside major depressive disorder symptoms, and it makes a person experience continuous feelings of exhaustion without any easily discernible cause. This condition can be a symptom of depression, but its not to be mistaken with depression.\nHow Is Major Depressive Disorder Treated\nMDD is often treated with medication and psychotherapy. Some lifestyle adjustments can also help ease certain symptoms.\nPeople who have severe MDD or have thoughts of harming themselves may need to stay in a hospital during treatment. Some might also need to take part in an outpatient treatment program until symptoms improve.\nRead Also: How Common Is Depression In Adults\nCan Depression Be Prevented\nYou can help prevent depression by getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet and practicing regular self-care activities such as exercise, meditation and yoga.\nIf youve had depression before, you may be more likely to experience it again.

Compared with control subjects, depressed prepubertal children had lower cortisol secretion during the first 4 hours of sleep, according to De Bellis et al. Nocturnal secretion of adrenocorticotropin, growth hormone, and prolactin did not differ between the 2 groups.\nPotential biological risk factors have been identified for depression in the elderly. Neurodegenerative diseases , stroke, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders, cancer, macular degeneration, and chronic pain have been associated with higher rates of depression. Alternatively, a large, longitudinal study found that depression that starts early in life increases the risk for Alzheimer’s disease . Researchers used data from the Prospective Population Study of Women in Gothenburg Sweden, which began in 1968. The study sample included 800 women , born between 1914 and 1930, who were followed up with in 1974, 1980, 1992, 2000, 2009, and 2012.

CBT focuses on the present situation and how to solve current problems. CBT helps the client recognize and change maladaptive thinking and behaviors. Family and interpersonal therapy may also be used to help address conflicts and issues in the individuals closest relationships.\n- Medication: Brain chemistry may be a contributing factor to a persons depression, so medications that target abnormalities in a persons brain chemistry may help to bring about symptom relief. Antidepressant medications can help a person feel better within 12 weeks, though it may take up to 3 months for them to feel all of the benefits.\nFor patients with severe depression that does not respond to other treatments, brain stimulation therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be beneficial.15\nOther complementary approaches that may help alleviate symptoms of depression include:16-19\n- Regular exercise.\n- Light therapy .\n- Adequate sleep.\n- Avoiding alcohol.\nTips For Living Well With Major Depressive Disorder\nLiving with major depression can feel lonely. People may be fearful or ashamed of being labeled with a serious mental illness, causing them to suffer in silence, rather than get help. In fact, most people with major depression never seek the right treatment. But those struggling with this illness are not alone. Its one of the most common and most treatable mental health disorders.

Tholen, Ph.D., author of Focused Positivity: The Path to Success and Peace of Mind,“the internal monologue that streams endlessly through our waking consciousness, interpreting whatever we experience.\nPoor social support systems, unhealthy environments and high levels of stress can also contribute in a significant way.\nHow Is Depression Treated\nDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80% and 90% percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\nBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency . The evaluation will identify specific symptoms and explore medical and family histories as well as cultural and environmental factors with the goal of arriving at a diagnosis and planning a course of action.\nYou May Like: Icd 10 Code For Anxiety And Depression"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6679c2a7-ed64-4bba-9f95-82530b0c184d>","<urn:uuid:6b31c0ac-3f5b-4a39-a0ad-d0a559f974e1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey, can you compare the role of interference patterns in the classic Davisson-Germer experiment vs modern autoionization spectroscopy? Both seem related to wave behavior.","answer":"In both cases, interference patterns were crucial for understanding electron wave behavior, but they revealed different aspects. In the Davisson-Germer experiment, the interference came from electrons diffracting off nickel crystal, producing patterns similar to X-ray diffraction and thereby proving electrons' wave nature. In modern autoionization spectroscopy, the interference occurs between two different ionization pathways: direct ionization to the continuum and delayed ionization through an excited state. This interference results in asymmetric Fano profiles in the spectrum. The modern spectroscopy experiments could actually time-resolve this interference process, showing how the direct ionization dominates the first 3 femtoseconds before the resonant path begins contributing, ultimately creating the characteristic interference pattern.","context":["As discussed in our Atomic Theory II module, at the end of 1913 Niels Bohr facilitated the leap to a new paradigm of atomic theory – quantum mechanics. Bohr’s new idea that electrons could only be found in specified, quantized orbits was revolutionary (Bohr, 1913). As is consistent with all new scientific discoveries, a fresh way of thinking about the universe at the atomic level would only lead to more questions, the need for additional experimentation and collection of evidence, and the development of expanded theories. As such, at the beginning of the second decade of the 20th century, another rich vein of scientific work was about to be mined.\nPeriodic trends lead to the distribution of electrons\nIn the late 19th century, the father of the periodic table, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, had already determined that the elements could be grouped together in a manner that showed gradual changes in their observed properties. (This is discussed in more detail in our module The Periodic Table of Elements.) By the early 1920s, other periodic trends, such as atomic volume and ionization energy, were also well established.\nThe German physicist Wolfgang Pauli made a quantum leap by realizing that in order for there to be differences in ionization energies and atomic volumes among atoms with many electrons, there had to be a way that the electrons were not all placed in the lowest energy levels. If multi-electron atoms did have all of their electrons placed in the lowest energy levels, then very different periodic patterns would have resulted from what was actually observed. However, before we reach Pauli and his work, we need to establish a number of more fundamental ideas.\nThe development of early quantum theory leaned heavily on the concept of wave-particle duality. This simultaneously simple and complex idea is that light (as well as other particles) has properties that are consistent with both waves and particles. The idea had been first seriously hinted at in relation to light in the late 17th century. Two camps formed over the nature of light: one in favor of light as a particle and one in favor of light as a wave. (See our Light I: Particle or Wave? module for more details.) Although both groups presented effective arguments supported by data, it wasn’t until some two hundred years later that the debate was settled.\nAt the end of the 19th century the wave-particle debate continued. James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist, developed a series of equations that accurately described the behavior of light as an electromagnetic wave, seemingly tipping the debate in favor of waves. However, at the beginning of the 20th century, both Max Planck and Albert Einstein conceived of experiments which demonstrated that light exhibited behavior that was consistent with it being a particle. In fact, they developed theories that suggested that light was a wave-particle – a hybrid of the two properties. By the time of Bohr’s watershed papers, the time was right for the expansion of this new idea of wave–particle duality in the context of quantum theory, and in stepped French physicist Louis de Broglie.\nde Broglie says electrons can act like waves\nIn 1924, de Broglie published his PhD thesis (de Broglie, 1924). He proposed the extension of the wave-particle duality of light to all matter, but in particular to electrons. The starting point for de Broglie was Einstein’s equation that described the dual nature of photons, and he used an analogy, backed up by mathematics, to derive an equation that came to be known as the “de Broglie wavelength” (see Figure 1 for a visual representation of the wavelength).\nThe de Broglie wavelength equation is, in the grand scheme of things, a profoundly simple one that relates two variables and a constant: momentum, wavelength, and Planck's constant. There was support for de Broglie’s idea since it made theoretical sense, but the very nature of science demands that good ideas be tested and ultimately demonstrated by experiment. Unfortunately, de Broglie did not have any experimental data, so his idea remained unconfirmed for a number of years.\nIt wasn’t until 1927 that de Broglie’s hypothesis was demonstrated via the Davisson-Germer experiment (Davisson, 1928). In their experiment, Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer fired electrons at a piece of nickel metal and collected data on the diffraction patterns observed (Figure 2). The diffraction pattern of the electrons was entirely consistent with the pattern already measured for X-rays and, since X-rays were known to be electromagnetic radiation (i.e., waves), the experiment confirmed that electrons had a wave component. This confirmation meant that de Broglie’s hypothesis was correct.\nInterestingly, it was the (experimental) efforts of others (Davisson and Germer), that led to de Broglie winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929 for his theoretical discovery of the wave-nature of electrons. Without the proof that the Davisson-Germer experiment provided, de Broglie’s 1924 hypothesis would have remained just that – a hypothesis. This sequence of events is a quintessential example of a theory being corroborated by experimental data.\nPunto de Comprensión\nTheories must be backed up by\nSchrödinger does the math\nIn 1926, Erwin Schrödinger derived his now famous equation (Schrödinger, 1926). For approximately 200 years prior to Schrödinger’s work, the infinitely simpler F = ma (Newton’s second law) had been used to describe the motion of particles in classical mechanics. With the advent of quantum mechanics, a completely new equation was required to describe the properties of subatomic particles. Since these particles were no longer thought of as classical particles but as particle-waves, Schrödinger’s partial differential equation was the answer. In the simplest terms, just as Newton’s second law describes how the motion of physical objects changes with changing conditions, the Schrödinger equation describes how the wave function (Ψ) of a quantum system changes over time (Equation 1). The Schrödinger equation was found to be consistent with the description of the electron as a wave, and to correctly predict the parameters of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom that Bohr had proposed.\nSchrödinger’s equation is perhaps most commonly used to define a three-dimensional area of space where a given electron is most likely to be found. Each area of space is known as an atomic orbital and is characterized by a set of three quantum numbers. These numbers represent values that describe the coordinates of the atomic orbital: including its size (n, the principal quantum number), shape (l, the angular or azimuthal quantum number), and orientation in space (m, the magnetic quantum number). There is also a fourth quantum number that is exclusive to a particular electron rather than a particular orbital (s, the spin quantum number; see below for more information).\nSchrödinger’s equation allows the calculation of each of these three quantum numbers. This equation was a critical piece in the quantum mechanics puzzle, since it brought quantum theory into sharp focus via what amounted to a mathematical demonstration of Bohr’s fundamental quantum idea. The Schrödinger wave equation is important since it bridges the gap between classical Newtonian physics (which breaks down at the atomic level) and quantum mechanics.\nThe Schrödinger equation is rightfully considered to be a monumental contribution to the advancement and understanding of quantum theory, but there are three additional considerations, detailed below, that must also be understood. Without these, we would have an incomplete picture of our non-relativistic understanding of electrons in atoms.\nPunto de Comprensión\nMax Born further interprets the Schrödinger equation\nGerman mathematician and physicist Max Born made a very specific and crucially important contribution to quantum mechanics relating to the Schrödinger equation. Born took the wave functions that Schrödinger produced, and said that the solutions to the equation could be interpreted as three-dimensional probability “maps” of where an electron may most likely be found around an atom (Born, 1926). These maps have come to be known as the s, p, d, and f orbitals (Figure 3).\nPunto de Comprensión\nWerner Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle\nIn the year following the publication of Schrödinger’s work, the German physicist Werner Heisenberg published a paper that outlined his uncertainty principle (Heisenberg, 1927). He realized that there were limitations on the extent to which the momentum of an electron and its position could be described. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle places a limit on the accuracy of simultaneously knowing the position and momentum of a particle: As the certainty of one increases, then the uncertainty of other also increases.\nThe crucial thing about the uncertainty principle is that it fits with the quantum mechanical model in which electrons are not found in very specific, planetary-like orbits – the original Bohr model – and it also dovetails with Born’s probability maps. The two contributions (Born and Heisenberg’s) taken together with the solution to the Schrödinger equation, reveal that the position of the electron in an atom can only be accurately predicted in a statistical way. That is to say, we know where the electron is most likely to be found in the atom, but we can never be absolutely sure of its exact position.\nPunto de Comprensión\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle concerning the position and momentum of a particle states that as the certainty of one increases, the _____ of the other increases.\nAngular momentum, or \"Spin\"\nIn 1922 German physicists Otto Stern, an assistant of Born’s, and Walther Gerlach conducted an experiment in which they passed silver atoms through a magnetic field and observed the deflection pattern. In simple terms, the results yielded two distinct possibilities related to the single, 5s valence electron in each atom. This was an unexpected observation, and implied that a single electron could take on two, very distinct states. At the time, nobody could explain the phenomena that the experiment had demonstrated, and it took a number of scientists, working both independently and in unison with earlier experimental observations, to work it out over a period of several years.\nIn the early 1920s, Bohr’s quantum model and various spectra that had been produced could be adequately described by the use of only three quantum numbers. However, there were experimental observations that could not be explained via only three mathematical parameters. In particular, as far back as 1896, the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman noted that the single valence electron present in the sodium atom could yield two different spectral lines in the presence of a magnetic field. This same phenomenon was observed with other atoms with odd numbers of valence electrons. These observations were problematic since they failed to fit the working model.\nIn 1925, Dutch physicist George Uhlenbeck and his graduate student Samuel Goudsmit proposed that these odd observations could be explained if electrons possessed angular momentum, a concept that Wolfgang Pauli later called “spin.” As a result, the existence of a fourth quantum number was revealed, one that was independent of the orbital in which the electron resides, but unique to an individual electron.\nBy considering spin, the observations by Stern and Gerlach made sense. If an electron could be thought of as a rotating, electrically-charged body, it would create its own magnetic moment. If the electron had two different orientations (one right-handed and one left-handed), it would produce two different ‘spins,’ and these two different states would explain the anomalous behavior noted by Zeeman. This observation meant that there was a need for a fourth quantum number, ultimately known as the “spin quantum number,” to fully describe electrons. Later it was determined that the spin number was indeed needed, but for a different reason – either way, a fourth quantum number was required.\nPunto de Comprensión\nSome experimental observations could not be explained mathematically using three parameters because\nSpin and the Pauli exclusion principle\nIn 1922, Niels Bohr visited his colleague Wolfgang Pauli at Göttingen where he was working. At the time, Bohr was still wrestling with the idea that there was something important about the number of electrons that were found in ‘closed shells’ (shells that had been filled).\nIn his own later account (1946), Pauli describes how building upon Bohr’s ideas and drawing inspiration from others’ work, he proposed the idea that only two electrons (with opposite spins) should be allowed in any one quantum state. He called this ‘two-valuedness’ – a somewhat inelegant translation of the German zweideutigkeit (Pauli, 1925). The consequence was that once a pair of electrons occupies a low energy quantum state (orbitals), any subsequent electrons would have to enter higher energy quantum states, also restricted to pairs at each level.\nUsing this idea, Bohr and Pauli were able to construct models of all of the electronic structures of the atoms from hydrogen to uranium, and they found that their predicted electronic structures matched the periodic trends that were known to exist from the periodic table – theory met experimental evidence once again.\nPauli ultimately formed what came to be known as the exclusion principle (1925), which used a fourth quantum number (introduced by others) to distinguish between the two electrons that make up the maximum number of electrons that could be in any given quantum level. In its simplest form, the Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. The first three quantum numbers for any two electrons can be the same (which places them in the same orbital), but the fourth number must be either +½ or -½, i.e., they must have different ‘spins’ (Figure 4). This is what Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit’s research suggested, following Pauli’s original publication of his theories.\nThe period described here was rich in the development of the quantum theory of atomic structure. Literally dozens of individuals, some mentioned throughout this module and others not, contributed to this process by providing theoretical insights or experimental results that helped shape our understanding of the atom. Many of the individuals worked in the same laboratories, collaborated together, or communicated with one another during the period, allowing the rapid transfer of ideas and refinements that would shape modern physics. All these contributions can certainly been seen as an incremental building process, where one idea leads to the next, each adding to the refinement of thinking and understanding, and advancing the science of the field.\nThe 20th century was a period rich in advancing our knowledge of quantum mechanics, shaping modern physics. Tracing developments during this time, this module covers ideas and refinements that built on Bohr’s groundbreaking work in quantum theory. Contributions by many scientists highlight how theoretical insights and experimental results revolutionized our understanding of the atom. Concepts include the Schrödinger equation, Born’s three-dimensional probability maps, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and electron spin.\nElectrons, like light, have been shown to be wave-particles, exhibiting the behavior of both waves and particles.\nThe Schrödinger equation describes how the wave function of a wave-particle changes with time in a similar fashion to the way Newton’s second law describes the motion of a classic particle. Using quantum numbers, one can write the wave function, and find a solution to the equation that helps to define the most likely position of an electron within an atom.\nMax Born’s interpretation of the Schrödinger equation allows for the construction of three-dimensional probability maps of where electrons may be found around an atom. These ‘maps’ have come to be known as the s, p, d, and f orbitals.\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle establishes that an electron’s position and momentum cannot be precisely known together, instead we can only calculate statistical likelihood of an electron’s location.\nThe discovery of electron spin defines a fourth quantum number independent of the electron orbital but unique to an electron. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons with the same spin can occupy the same orbital.","Archive for the ‘Publications’ Category\nSpectroscopy has taught us how the very precise measurement of resonance lineshapes gives insight into the structure of matter. However, as a time-integrated measurement, the spectral lines give only indirect information on the underlying electronic dynamics. The resonance width can be related to the timescale of the electronic excitation and relaxation, but, in the general case, this is not enough for accessing the details of the full dynamics that have to be recovered from advanced modeling. A typical case is the one of autoionizing resonances, where the system (atom, molecule, nanostructure) can be ionized either directly to the continuum or be trapped in a very excited state for a very short time (femtosecond) before reaching the continuum. The interference between the two channels results in an asymmetric lineshape, called Fano profile after the Italian theoretician Ugo Fano who first modeled this process. While the Fano profile has been extremely successful in analyzing the absorption lines measured in a wide variety of systems, the details on how the process unwraps in time have remained elusive, the ultrashort timescale at stake precluding direct time-domain investigations.\nIn the November 11 issue of Science magazine, two articles tackle the problem of watching the buildup of the helium 2s2p Fano resonance from two different perspectives: from the ‘inside’ and from the ‘outside’.\nIn the article entitled “Observing the ultrafast buildup of a Fano resonance in the time domain” (DOI: 10.1126/science.aah6972), experimental physicists from the MPI for Nuclear Physics (MPIK, Heidelberg), together with theoretical physicists at the Vienna University of Technology and the Kansas State University look at the autoionizing process from ‘inside’ the atom by measuring the time-dependent dipole response in transient absorption spectroscopy. The dipole response being determined by the electron dynamics close to the nucleus, it provides a detailed picture of what takes place ‘inside’ the atom undergoing autoionization. In this work, short bursts of XUV light around 60.15 eV trigger the dynamic buildup of the Fano resonance by inducing an oscillating dipole moment, which in turn gives rise to the optical dipole response of the transition. A time-delayed ultrashort infrared pulse is then used to strong-field ionize the system, interrupting the autoionization process. The measured time-gated dipole response shows how the absorption lineshape evolves from an initially broad distribution to the characteristically ‘narrow’ converged Fano profile.\nIn the article “Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron” (DOI: 10.1126/science.aah5188), another team composed of experimental physicists from the CEA-CNRS-Université Paris-Saclay (CEA-Saclay) and theoretical chemists and physicists at the Université Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC-Paris) and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid look at the autoionizing process from ‘outside’ the atom by measuring the time-dependent outgoing wavepacket, i.e. by probing the photoelectron itself. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, they could measure the spectral amplitude and phase of the resonant wave packet. In this scheme, replicas obtained by perturbative two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this allows resolving the ultrafast buildup of the autoionizing resonance, revealing the decomposition of the process in two nearly consecutive steps governed by fairly different time scales: during the first 3 fs, the direct ionization channel dominates; then, the resonant path starts contributing as the doubly excited state decays in the continuum, resulting in interferences between the two channels that ultimately shape the celebrated Fano profile.\nThese two complementary studies illustrate the large potential of the diverse techniques developed in attosecond spectroscopy: detection of photons or electrons, time-domain versus frequency-domain measurements, strong-field vs. perturbative regime. They open multiple opportunities for studying ultrafast strongly correlated dynamics in a variety of systems, from molecules and nanostructures to surfaces, and controlling matter changes at a most fundamental level.\n(left) Absorption spectra measured for a series of XUV-IR delays from 6 to 32 fs (from DOI: 10.1126/science.aah6972).\n(right) Experimentally-retrieved photoelectron spectrum for accumulation times from -10 to 20 fs (step=1fs) (from DOI: 10.1126/science.aah5188)\nRichard Taieb, UPMC (email@example.com)\nThomas Pfeifer (firstname.lastname@example.org)\nIonizing radiation can bring an atom to a super-excited state that survives for an infinitesimal time before emitting one electron. Using advanced attosecond interferometric techniques, XLIC researchers from Lund, Madrid, Paris, and Stockholm have now resolved the collapse of such state in time, finally confirming a theoretical prediction formalized more than 50 years ago that has its roots at the very beginning of the quantum revolution.\nWhen irradiated with light with sufficiently high frequency, such as extreme ultraviolet rays or x rays, matter emits electrons; this is the celebrated photoelectric effect. To explain this effect, in 1905 Einstein suggested that light was composed of photons, small packets of energy that provide individual electrons with enough momentum to escape the Coulomb attraction of atomic nuclei. Some twenty years later, quantum theory finally provided the theoretical framework necessary to formalize Einstein’s intuition: matter does exchange energy by quanta, and, in the simplest scenario, the absorption of an ionizing photon is accompanied by the instantaneous emission of an electron wave packet.\nIn 1933, H. Beutler [Z. Physik 86, 495], an experimental physicist, showed that things were not as simple after all. He found that the absorption spectra of rare-gas atoms above the ionization threshold exhibit wide peaks with anomalously asymmetric profiles. These peaks indicated that the atom, instead of being instantaneously ionized, could be temporarily excited to some unstable state, hence the finite width. The meaning of the peak asymmetry, however, remained obscure. The following year, Enrico Fermi, then a professor in Rome, assigned this puzzle to Ugo Fano, a 22 years old post-doctoral collaborator, who published the provisional results of his investigations in 1935 in an Italian journal. According to Fano, the asymmetry of photoelectron absorption peaks arise from the interplay between the direct-ionization wave front, predicted since the beginning, and the trailing emission from the collapsing excited atom. Due to the dispersive character of electron waves (more energetic electrons move faster than less energetic ones), the latter component catches up with the direct wave front, carving a trough where the two waves interfere destructively. It is this interference that skews the spectrum of the electrons from the decaying atom, which would otherwise be a perfectly symmetric Lorentzian peak.\nFano had to interrupt his studies of atomic photoionization due to the precipitating historical conditions that eventually lead to the outbreak of WWII. For more than 25 years, his 1935 paper, which was written in Italian, was all but forgotten. In 1961, Fano managed to resume his studies, publishing a second more refined English version of his work which soon became one of the most cited physics papers of all times. Since then, the characteristic asymmetric photoelectron energy distribution predicted by Fano’s theory has been confirmed for countless systems. One inherent aspect of the phenomenology modeled by Fano, however, that is how the direct and resonant wave packets come together in time to give rise to the final spectral asymmetry, had eluded any direct experimental confirmation for all this time.\nIn a paper published on February 18th in Nature Communication, researches from Lund University, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM), Université Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, and Stockholm University have announced that they have finally closed this long-standing gap. Using a novel attosecond interferometric laser technique developed in Lund by the experimental group of Professor Anne L’Huillier, the authors were able to compare in detail the structured wave front generated by the resonant ionization of the argon atom with the simpler direct-ionization wave obtained at energies where no metastable state is excited. Their finding closely matches the prediction of the Fano model, which researchers from UAM have extended to the multiphoton regime entailed in the experiment. This finding, which is the first “observation” of the collapse of an autoionizing atomic state, opens the way to the detailed study of the ultrafast photoelectron dynamics, which plays a fundamental role in many processes triggered by energetic light in matter, from radiation damage of biological tissues to charge emission in photoelectric cells.\nSpectral phase measurement of a Fano resonance using tunable attosecond pulses\nM.

Tunable ultrashort laser pulses like those available at the CLUR (Centre for Ultrafast Lasers, at the Complutense University of Madrid) in combination with velocity map imaging techniques are necessary to follow this type of photoinduced reactions in real time.\nA team of Spanish researchers involved in the XLIC Action has demonstrated a powerful scheme that goes beyond the description of the reaction, and is capable of controlling its course. The mechanism involves employing an additional “control” laser pulse that modifies (“dresses”) the potential energy surfaces, producing changes in the outcome of the reaction and the speed of the fragments. Theoretical simulations have shown how the essential new tool for the maximum degree of control is to provoke rapid changes between the field-free regime and the “dressed states” regime.\nThis work demonstrates that fine control of the properties of this “control” laser pulse turns it into a true “photonic scalpel” capable of manipulating chemical reactions, as well as shedding new light into the dynamics of complex molecular dynamical processes.\nTheir work has been published in the journal Nature Chemistry on July 20, 2014.\nM.

{"question":"Soy estudiante de astronomía y me interesa saber: ¿cuáles son los satélites naturales más grandes del sistema solar? Por favor, liste los principales.","answer":"The largest natural satellites in the solar system (those larger than about 3,000 kilometers across) are: Earth's Moon, Jupiter's Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), Saturn's moon Titan, and Neptune's captured moon Triton.","context":["A natural satellite is an object that orbits a planet or other body larger than itself and which is not man-made. Such objects are often called moons. The term is normally used to identify non-artificial satellites of planets, dwarf planets, or minor planets. There are 240 known moons within the solar system, including 163 orbiting the planets, four orbiting dwarf planets, and dozens more orbiting small solar system bodies.\nThe large gas giants have extensive systems of natural satellites, including half a dozen comparable in size to the Earth's moon. Of the inner planets, Mercury and Venus have no moon at all; Earth has one large moon (the Moon); and Mars has two tiny moons: Phobos and Deimos. Among the dwarf planets, Ceres has no moons (though many objects in the asteroid belt do), Eris has one: Dysnomia, and Pluto has three known satellites: Nix, Hydra, and a large companion called Charon. The Pluto-Charon system is unusual in that the center of mass lies in open space between the two, a characteristic of a double planet system.\nThe orbital properties and compositions of natural satellites provides us with important information on the origin and evolution of the satellite system. Especially a system of natural satellites orbiting around a gas giant can be regarded as a miniature solar system that contains precious clues for studying the formation of solar systems.\nNatural satellites orbiting relatively close to the planet on prograde orbits (regular satellites) are generally believed to have been formed out of the same collapsing region of the protoplanetary disk that gave rise to its primary. In contrast, irregular satellites (generally orbiting on distant, inclined, eccentric and/or retrograde orbits) are thought to be captured asteroids possibly further fragmented by collisions. The Earth-Moon and possibly Pluto-Charon systems are exceptions among large bodies in that they are believed to have originated by the collision of two large proto-planetary objects (see the giant impact hypothesis). The material that would have been placed in orbit around the central body is predicted to have reaccreted to form one or more orbiting moons. As opposed to planetary-sized bodies, asteroid moons are thought to commonly form by this process.\nMost regular natural satellites in the solar system are tidally locked to their primaries, meaning that one side of the moon is always turned toward the planet. Exceptions include Saturn's moon Hyperion, which rotates chaotically because of a variety of external influences.\nIn contrast, the outer moons of the gas giants (irregular satellites) are too far away to become 'locked'. For example, Jupiter's moon Himalia, Saturn's moon Phoebe and Neptune's Nereid have rotation period in the range of ten hours compared with their orbital periods of hundreds of days.\nSatellites of satellites\nNo \"moons of moons\" (natural satellites that orbit the natural satellite of another body) are known. It is uncertain whether such objects can be stable in the long term. In most cases, the tidal effects of their primaries make such a system unstable; the gravity from other nearby objects (most notably the primary) would perturb the orbit of the moon's moon until it broke away or impacted its primary. In theory, a secondary satellite could exist in a primary satellite's Hill sphere, outside of which it would be lost because of the greater gravitational pull of the planet (or other object) that the primary satellite orbits. For example, the Moon orbits the Earth because the Moon is 370,000 km from Earth, well within Earth's Hill sphere, which has a radius of 1.5 million km (0.01 AU or 235 Earth radii). If a Moon-sized object were to orbit the Earth outside its Hill sphere, it would soon be captured by the Sun and become a dwarf planet in a near-Earth orbit.\nTwo moons are known to have small companions at their L4 and L5 Lagrangian points, which are about sixty degrees ahead of and behind the body in its orbit. These companions are called Trojan moons, because their positions are comparable to the positions of the Trojan asteroids relative to Jupiter. Such objects are Telesto and Calypso, which are the leading and following companions respectively of Tethys; and Helene and Polydeuces, which are the leading and following companions of Dione.\nThe discovery of 243 Ida's moon Dactyl in the early 1990s confirms that some asteroids also have moons. Some, like 90 Antiope, are double asteroids with two equal-sized components. The asteroid 87 Sylvia has two moons.\nNatural satellites of the solar system\nThe largest natural satellites in the solar system (those bigger than about 3,000 kilometers across) are Earth's moon, Jupiter's Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), Saturn's moon Titan, and Neptune's captured moon Triton. For smaller moons see the articles on the appropriate planet. In addition to the moons of the various planets there are also over 80 known moons of the dwarf planets, asteroids and other small solar system bodies. Some studies estimate that up to 15 percent of all trans-Neptunian objects could have satellites.\nThe following is a comparative table classifying the moons of the solar system by diameter. The column on the right includes some notable planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and trans-Neptunian objects for comparison.\n|Satellites of planets||Dwarf planet satellites||Satellites of\n|(136472) 2005 FY9\n|Charon||(136108) 2003 EL61\n2 Pallas, 4 Vesta\nmany more TNOs\n|Dysnomia||S/2005 (2003 EL61) 1\nS/2005 (79360) 1\nand many others\n|S/2005 (2003 EL61) 2\nmany more TNOs\nS/2000 (90) 1\nmany more TNOs\nS/2000 (762) 1\nS/2002 (121) 1\nS/2003 (283) 1\nS/2004 (1313) 1\nand many TNOs\n|less than 10||at least 47||at least 21||many||many|\nThe first known natural satellite was the Moon (Luna in Latin). Until the discovery of the Galilean satellites in 1610, however, there was no opportunity for referring to such objects as a class. Galileo chose to refer to his discoveries as Planetæ (\"planets\"), but later discoverers chose other terms to distinguish them from the objects they orbited.\nChristiaan Huygens, the discoverer of Titan, was the first to use the term moon for such objects, calling Titan Luna Saturni or Luna Saturnia—\"Saturn's moon\" or \"The Saturnian moon,\" because it stood in the same relation to Saturn as the Moon did to the Earth.\nAs additional moons of Saturn were discovered, however, this term was abandoned. Giovanni Domenico Cassini sometimes referred to his discoveries as planètes in French, but more often as satellites, using a term derived from the Latin satelles, meaning \"guard,\" \"attendant,\" or \"companion,\" because the satellites accompanied their primary planet in their journey through the heavens.\nThe term satellite thus became the normal one for referring to an object orbiting a planet, as it avoided the ambiguity of \"moon.\" In 1957, however, the launching of the artificial object Sputnik created a need for new terminology. The terms man-made satellite or artificial moon were very quickly abandoned in favor of the simpler satellite, and as a consequence, the term has come to be linked primarily with artificial objects flown in space – including, sometimes, even those which are not in orbit around a planet.\nAs a consequence of this shift in meaning, the term moon, which continued to be used in a generic sense in works of popular science and in fiction, has regained respectability and is now used interchangeably with satellite, even in scientific articles. When it is necessary to avoid both the ambiguity of confusion with the Earth's moon on the one hand, and artificial satellites on the other, the term natural satellite (using \"natural\" in a sense opposed to \"artificial\") is used.\nThe definition of a moon\nThere has been some debate about the precise definition of a moon. This debate has been caused by the presence of orbital systems where the difference in mass between the larger body and its satellite are not as pronounced as in more typical systems. Two examples are the Pluto-Charon system and the Earth-Moon System. The presence of these systems has caused a debate about where to precisely draw the line between a double body system, and a main body-satellite system. The most common definition rests upon whether the barycentre is below the surface of the larger body, though this is unofficial and somewhat arbitrary. At the other end of the spectrum there are many ice/rock clumps that form ring systems around the solar system's gas giants, and there is no set point to define when one of these clumps is large enough to be classified as a moon. The term \"moonlet\" is sometimes used to refer to extremely small objects in orbit around a larger body, but again there is no official definition.\n- ↑ Canup, R. and E. Asphaug (2001).
