{"question":"How do the space tourism approaches of Virgin Galactic and SpaceX's Inspiration4 mission differ in terms of flight duration and altitude?","answer":"Virgin Galactic and SpaceX take very different approaches to space tourism. Virgin Galactic's VSS Unity provides a brief suborbital flight lasting about an hour total, reaching over 50 miles above Earth and offering passengers a few minutes of weightlessness. In contrast, SpaceX's Inspiration4 mission is much more ambitious, taking passengers to an altitude of 357 miles (deeper than the International Space Station) for a three-day orbital mission before splashing down off the Florida coast. SpaceX's mission provides a much longer duration space experience at significantly higher altitudes compared to Virgin Galactic's brief suborbital flights.","context":["In first, SpaceX to send all-civilian crew into Earth orbit\nSpaceX is preparing to send the first all-civilian crew into Earth orbit Wednesday evening, capping a summer of private spaceflight with one of the most ambitious tourism missions to date.\nA five-hour launch window for \"Inspiration4\" opens from 8:02 pm (0002 GMT Thursday), and weather conditions remain good with an 80 percent chance of launch, according to official forecasters.\nA Falcon 9 rocket, with a Dragon capsule at its top, will blast off from the legendary launch complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Center in Florida, from where the Apollo 11 mission took off for the Moon.\nThe spaceship's trajectory will take it to an altitude of 357 miles (575 kilometers), deeper into space than the International Space Station (ISS), and the furthest any humans have gone since the 2009 Hubble telescope maintenance mission.\nAfter spending three days orbiting the globe, the four-person crew, all Americans, will splash down off the Florida coast.\nThe mission was paid for by Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old high school dropout, founder of Shift4 Payments, and aviator.\nSpaceX hasn't disclosed what it cost him, but the price tag runs into tens of millions of dollars.\n\"We understand how lucky and fortunate we are,\" Isaacman told a press briefing Tuesday.\nFor the trip, Isaacman is bringing along three others selected through a competition.\nHayley Arceneaux, a pediatric cancer survivor, is a 29-year-old physician assistant. She will be the youngest American to go into orbit and the first person with a prosthesis, on a part of her femur.\nChris Sembroski, 42, is a US Air Force veteran who now works as an aerospace data engineer.\nSian Proctor, a 51-year-old geoscientist and educator, was almost selected to become an astronaut for NASA in 2009.\nShe will be only the fourth African-American woman to go to space.\nThe mission's stated goal is to represent a turning point in the democratization of space, by proving that the cosmos is accessible to people who have not been handpicked and trained for many years as astronauts.\nFor SpaceX, this is nothing less than a first step towards a multi-planetary humanity—founder and CEO Elon Musk's ultimate vision.\nOn board, their biological data including heart rate and sleep, as well as their cognitive capacities, will be analyzed.\nThey will also undergo tests before and after the trip, to measure its effect on their bodies. Their training only lasted about six months.\nThe flight should remain fully automated, but the crew has been trained by SpaceX to be able to take control in the event of an emergency.\nThe Dragon will be equipped, for the first time, with a cupola observation dome—the largest ever space window—to take in the view. The dome replaces the usual mechanism used on Dragons to dock with the ISS.\nThe crew undertook strenuous physical training, including climbing Mount Rainier, which stands 14,411-foot-tall (4,392 meters) in the US northwest.\nThey also completed high G-force training on a centrifuge—a long spinning arm—and jet flights.\nAs well as serving as a vehicle for SpaceX's ambitions, the mission aims to raise $200 million for St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, a leading facility in Memphis.\nArceneaux was treated there as a child, and now works there.\nThe crew will take with them various objects—a ukulele, 66 pounds (30 kilograms) of hops intended to brew space beer, several digital assets known as non-fungible tokens—that will be auctioned off for the cause.\nThe space adventure bookends a summer marked by the battle of the billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos to reach the final frontier.\nBranson, the Virgin Galactic founder, achieved the feat first, on July 11, and was followed by the Blue Origin boss nine days later.\nBut these flights only offered a few minutes of weightlessness. SpaceX's mission is far more ambitious.\nThis will be the fourth crewed mission for SpaceX, which has now sent 10 astronauts to the ISS for US space agency NASA.\nThe company is already working on future tourism missions, including one next January to the ISS.\n© 2021 AFP","Branson’s brief joy ride is more than two decades in the making. He founded Virgin Galactic in 2004 with the goal of creating a winged spacecraft capable of taking up to eight people, including two pilots and six passengers, on rocket-powered flights that reach more than 50 miles above Earth, which the US government considers the boundary marking outer space.\nCNN Business will also be sharing the livestream and running a live blog with updates.\nHere’s everything you need to know before the big event.\n- Beth Moses, who holds the title of Chief Astronaut Instructor at Virgin Galactic and will handle the training for all of the company’s future customers. She’s flown to space on VSS Unity once before, during a 2019 test flight. Moses, an aerospace engineer, won’t just be along for the ride. She’ll be ensuring her fellow passengers stay safe and ensure that Virgin Galactic collects all the data it needs because this flight will be, at the end of the day, still a test flight.\n- Colin Bennett, who is the company’s lead operations engineer. Bennett will help evaluate the overall experience and ensure the cabin equipment is in good shape.\n- Sirisha Bandla, Virgin Galactic’s vice president of government affairs and research. Bandla will be on board for the science. Virgin Galactic frequently flies experiments to makes use of the microgravity environment, and on this flight Bandla will be handling a University of Florida research project that involves handling “handheld fixation tubes,” according to the company.\nVirgin Galactic says that Branson’s job will be to use his “observations from his flight training and spaceflight experience to enhance the journey for all future astronaut customers,” according to the company.\nWhat will happen?\nWhen most people think about spaceflight, they think about an astronaut circling the Earth, floating in space, for at least a few days.\nThat is not what Branson will be doing on VSS Unity, which is the only operational SpaceShipTwo spaceplane that Virgin Galactic has in its arsenal, though the company is building others.\nVSS Unity will be affixed to a massive mothership, called WhiteKnightTwo, that looks like two sleek jets attached at the tip of their wings. The mothership takes about 45 minutes to cruise along and slowly climb with VSS Unity to about 50,000 feet. Then, when the pilots give the go-ahead, SpaceShipTwo drops from between WhiteKnightTwo’s two fuselages and fires up its rocket engine, swooping directly upward and roaring past the speed of sound.\nVSS Unity is a suborbital space plane, meaning it won’t drum up enough speed to escape the pull of Earth’s gravity. Instead, it’ll rocket at more than three times the speed of sound — about 2,300 miles per hour — to more than 50 miles above ground. At the top of the flight path, Branson and his fellow passengers will briefly experience weightlessness. It’s like an extended version of the weightlessness you experience when you reach the peak of a roller coaster hill, just before gravity brings your cart — or, in Branson’s case, your space plane -— gliding back down toward the ground.\nAfter about a minute the engine shuts off, leaving the spacecraft and the passengers suspended in microgravity as SpaceShipTwo rolls onto its belly and offers the passengers sweeping views of the Earth below and the inky black void above.\nTo conclude the trip, SpaceShipTwo uses what’s called a feathering system to raise its wings, mimicking the shape of a badminton shuttlecock to reorient the vehicle as it begins to fall back to Earth. It then lowers its wings as it glides back down to a runway landing.\nA group of reporters will be allowed in to watch the launch. CNN Business will post live updates here as well as carrying live TV coverage.\nHow is this different from what SpaceX and Blue Origin do?\nBezos’ Blue Origin took a far different approach for its suborbital space tourism rocket. The company’s New Shepard vehicle is a capsule and rocket system that fires off vertically from a launch pad, sending passengers on a screaming 11-minute flight to more than 60 miles high before the capsule deploys parachutes to bring them gently back down.\nBut when the companies begin commercial operations, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic will be direct competitors. They’re both after the demographic of ultra-wealthy thrill seekers willing to fork over hundreds of thousands of dollars to experience a supersonic gut punch and a few minutes of weightlessness.\nElon Musk — the other, other space billionaire — is running a far different operation than what Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic will put on display this month.\nThough Branson’s other company — Virgin Orbit — has put a rocket in orbit, and Bezos’ Blue Origin plans to get there eventually with a rocket called New Glenn, neither company has made quite the headlines or the waves in the space sector as SpaceX has.\nHow risky is this?\nSpace travel is, historically, fraught with danger. Though the risks are not necessarily astronomical for Branson’s jaunt to suborbital space, as Virgin Galactic has spent the better part of the last two decade running its space planes through test flights.\nStill, any time a human straps themselves onto a rocket, there are risks involved — and Branson has apparently decided that, for him, it’s worth it."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ff6180d4-f8a0-4810-841a-3b840d53f036>","<urn:uuid:9ac985d9-6337-49a9-8913-6a788d0283c9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What different approaches do the Pro-ject Debut PRO and McIntosh MTI100 take to audio signal processing in their designs?","answer":"The Pro-ject Debut PRO focuses on mechanical signal processing through its Pick it PRO cartridge, which transforms mechanical energy into electrical signals and provides the 'colour and life' of the music. In contrast, the McIntosh MTI100 employs a more comprehensive signal processing approach, featuring a vacuum tube preamplifier section with two 12AX7 tubes, a shielded phono preamplifier, and a Class D amplifier rated at 80 Watts per channel into 4 Ohms. The McIntosh also includes digital processing capabilities with digital audio inputs and Bluetooth connectivity, while the Pro-ject maintains a purely analog design philosophy.","context":["Pro-ject have always designed around the best price/performance ratio, with European-made manufacturing quality. For this reason, they decided to work with Ortofon to develop a unique range of cartridges. Thanks to the excellent manufacturing skills of Ortofon they were able to produce a very special cartridge: The Pick it PRO.\nCartridges are electromechanical transducers, where mechanical energy is transformed into an electrical signal. The real difference in sound happens here. The turntable itself should be as neutral as possible. The colour and life of the music come from the cartridge.\nPro-ject, therefore, designed their new Pick it PRO to deliver a more lively and robust sound that convinces with its big dynamic range.\nThe actual sound of the cartridge depends on how you combine its different components: stylus, cantilever, cantilever suspension, coil material, number of coil windings, generator, and more. You cannot judge the cartridge by looking at just one specific part. Experience and the art of fine-tuning make a cartridge unique and special.\nThe perfect combination of components is the key to achieve the great, charismatic sound of the Pick it PRO. Intensive research, development, and listening tests have been necessary to gain the sound they were looking for.\n8.6\" Carbon-Aluminium Tonearm\nThe Debut PRO features a one-piece carbon-aluminium sandwich tonearm. The carbon layer gives the tonearm a high degree of rigidity, while the inner aluminium tube takes over the damping of the tonearm. This super stiff and uniquely dampened tonearm construction ensures perfect tracking of the record groove.\nAdjustable VTA & Azimuth\nWith the new tonearm of the Debut PRO, both the azimuth and the vertical tracking angle (VTA) can be set. The tonearm height can be continuously adjusted by loosening the two grub screws.\nThese settings of the Debut PRO give you the option of adapting the tonearm to height changes, allowing the use of different turntable mats or other cartridges to always achieve the best sound quality.\nNickel-plated metal parts\nThe nickel finish of the aluminum components results in a hard, resistant surface. This process enables us to produce very high-quality and sustainable components and avoid plastics and similar materials that continue to weaken over time. The precision CNC milled parts are optically perfectly coordinated and lead the Debut PRO to its modern simple, elegant and unprecedented design.\nAlways the perfect speed\nThe speed, electronically controlled with precision, guarantees the most accurate and stable speeds. Change between speeds easily with the toggle switch. With the supplied round belt for 78 rpm, you can also listen to your shellac records. So that no motor vibrations reach the pickup, the Debut PRO has a new motor suspension, which is responsible for the perfect decoupling of the motor.\nThe new Debut PRO platter is a first on any Pro-Ject turntable. It features a notch for the record label and together with our Record Puck PRO (available separately) the puck's weight will press your record tightly against the platter. The die-cast aluminum platter is reworked and precision balanced in an extra step to obtain an evenly spinning platter. It is anti-magnetic, allowing MC cartridges to work properly.

Just add music and speakers.\nAt first glance, the new McIntosh MTI100 Integrated Turntable may look like it’s just a turntable, but a closer look will reveal that it is in fact so much more. Truly a one-of-a-kind product, it is designed for those who want maximum flexibility in their home audio system but don’t want – or don’t have the space for – a large audio system. With all the built-in connectivity the MTI100 offers, it can become the center piece of a modern home audio system for modern lifestyles. Simply add a pair of speakers to create a complete and comprehensive audio system.\nBesides the turntable that plays both 33-1/3 and 45 rpm vinyl records, the MTI100 also includes a power amplifier, a vacuum tube preamplifier section, a shielded phono preamplifier, an unbalanced auxiliary input, digital audio coaxial and optical inputs, a Bluetooth receiver, a subwoofer output, stereo speaker outputs, and a headphone jack for personal listening.\nThe 7 pound (3.18 kg) machined aluminum platter and the matching machined aluminum tonearm with anti-skate sit atop a 3/8” (9.5mm) thick piece of glass – the same glass found in the front panels of our larger amplifiers; this in turn sits atop a custom 1/4” (6.35mm) thick metal plate that adds stability. The combined heftiness of both the platter and metal plate helps resist and absorb noise that could be caused by external vibrations.\nThe belt drive platter with manual speed change is driven by an industrial grade permanent magnet AC synchronous motor with a 2-speed pulley. With this motor, the platter speed is precisely synced to the AC power line’s frequency to deliver precise rotational speeds for playback accuracy. The MTI100 comes with a Sumiko Olympia Moving Magnet cartridge, whose upgraded stylus and cantilever assembly allow for more dynamic punch and improved frequency response.\nA Class D amplifier that’s rated for 80 Watts per channel into 4 Ohms or 50 Watts per channel into 8 Ohms is used to drive a pair of speakers. Two 12AX7 vacuum tubes power the main preamplifier section, while a separate dedicated phono preamplifier is housed in a custom shielding box that prevents interference or noise from seeping into the vinyl signal. Together, the vacuum tube preamplifier and shielded phono preamplifier help make vinyl albums sound their best.\nTo combine playing vintage vinyl records with modern playback methods, music can also be streamed to the MTI100 via its High Definition Bluetooth 4.2 input that ensures the MTI100 receives the best sound quality possible from the Bluetooth device. An external Bluetooth antenna helps achieve optimal reception and signal quality. The analog and digital audio inputs allow external sources, such as a TV, tuner or CD Player, to be connected. Not to overlook the impact that low sound frequencies can add, a subwoofer output is also included. Finally, for personal listening, the front panel includes a headphone jack that is powered by our High Drive headphone amplifier, which features increased gain and output power and is optimized for virtually all headphone types.\nPower, volume and input selection can be controlled by either the included remote or via two knobs on the unit. An illuminated McIntosh logo is located in the top glass panel, while a classic McIntosh-styled die cast aluminum name badge adorns the front of the chassis.\nPara mais informações: AJASOM"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fb883588-018d-4ea0-a65e-ae2eeba14f67>","<urn:uuid:485ccdde-bef2-4488-bdba-e8f2f726f7b8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can wood burning tips be changed safely, and what unique decorative items can be crafted using pyrography?","answer":"Wood burning tips can be changed using two methods: cold and hot. The cold method involves waiting 4-5 minutes for the pen to cool, then unscrewing the tip counterclockwise. The hot method requires needle-nose pliers to carefully remove and install tips while avoiding contact with the hot pen. As for decorative items, pyrography can be used to create various crafts such as decorated boxes (like an athame box with Celtic patterns), chalices (such as one made from coconut shell with carved runes), and staffs (featuring carved runes colored with acrylic paint).","context":["To create a wood covered book:\n• 2 pieces ½” pine cut at 12” tall by 10” wide\n• 2 pieces ½” pine cut at 12” tall by 1.5” - 2” wide\n• 4 miniature hinges\n• 3 screw posts (hardware store, hollow post with threading inside and a screw that fits inside - both pieces have a flat end)\n• Sheet protectors\n• Piece of leather for binding cover if desired\n• Measure location for holes by placing a sheet protector over the narrow pieces of wood, centered top to bottom and the edge of the “pocket” should be at the edge of the narrow wood strip so the pages turn and you can see all the way to the edge.\n• Sand all of the wood (round the edges).\n• Lay a narrow piece of wood next to one of the larger pieces and fit two hinges in place; do the same for the other two pieces of wood. Make sure to do the second set backwards so the hinges are on the outside of the book.\n• Decorate the cover of the book (I used a wood burning tool and then painted the symbols and runes.)\n• If using the leather, cut a strip to fit the thickness of your book plus enough to secure the piece of leather to the posts. (It needs to overlap the post position by ¼” or more.) Punch 3 holes in each side of the leather strip in line with the post positions.\n• Place the cover of the book upside down, insert the post from underneath (so it’s sticking up out of the cover binding strip), insert leather strip if desired, place sheet protectors on posts, place the other side of the leather strip over the posts again if desired, place back cover on posts and secure with screws.\n• Fill your book with whatever you desire.\nAlso, the Besom I made was started from a small piece of a White Ash branch which I carved a face into. I attached a piece of leather strapping to the top in a loop secured with a screw to have somewhere to hang the Besom from. I used long pine needles (the kind you use for coiling baskets) and rosemary branches for the Besom itself. After securing the bundle of pine needles and rosemary branches to the end of the branch piece with hot glue, I wrapped leather strapping tightly around it. I wrapped another color of leather strapping in a decorative pattern over the tight wrap and left some pieces dangling down over the pine needles. I then attached a few beads and bells to the dangling leather straps.\nHope the class takes off, I'd love to learn other ways to make tools! Please keep me updated.\nFor a scrying mirror, I use a Black Absolute granite tile, cut to 6\" X 6\". I used a grinding tip for my rotary tool and carefully carved symbols at the corners.\nA tarot bag is a simple sewing project...\nAs for the prayer beads, I use a knotting technique that creates barrel knots of two different sizes. I am attaching a picture of the ones I make and sell (along with appropriate prayers). I am adding a 1/2\" pentacle to the ends and will upload photos of those in a few weeks (after my supplies arrive).\nhmmm, I added some ideas too, yours are in there too. It would be great for several craftspeople to collaborate in teaching a class. Especially if the class have several lessons and projects to work through. And a class group to join where people can talk about and show their creations! I would certainly take that class. I would start the course with a review of what each lesson will basically cover and a list of supplies needed for each lesson as well as a estimated cost for supplies and a few online stores to purchase them. Lesson one could review altar tools in general and their purpose and uses, and then each following lesson could move on to more in depth information about each tool, the historical origins, and one or several projects you can do to create the tools yourself.

Modern-day wood burning kits for adults have been honed by centuries of experience and knowledge. This is of great benefit to us today.\nA pyrography machine or burning wood kit is used to burn designs, not just onto wood. Leather, canvas, gourds, and other natural materials like bone are popular alternatives.\nThere are unlimited wood burning projects for beginners to experiment with. Just choose one and start being creative.\nYour imagination is your only stumbling block.\nArtists and tradesmen alike find these kits very versatile. They are used by pyrographers, woodworkers, woodcarvers, gourd artists, and other crafters all over the world.\nA pyrography tool, known as a pyrography pen or wood burner pen, is essential equipment for this art form – you are “pyro-less” without it!\nThere are a myriad of wood burning pens available, either singlely or otherwise, in a professional wood burning kit, by various popular brand names on the market.\nBe sure to find a burner tool or a burning wood kit that will meet your budget and skill level.\nWalnut Hollow Creative Versa Tool\nA popular pen on Amazon is the Walnut Hollow Creative Versa Tool.\nWith over 7,600 global ratings, a 4.4 star rating, and a reasonable price tag – this professional pyrography machine is a very good option.\nTypes of Professional Pyrography Kit\nWhen looking to buy the best wood burner kit for your needs, check which type of pyrography wood burner pen is included in the set. Choose the one that suits you best.\nThere are 2 categories of pyrography pen.\n- Solid-Point Burners\n- Wire-Nib Burners\nSolid-point burners look and operate much the same as a soldering iron. They are a heavy-duty burning tool, just right for someone just starting in this art form. Each professional wood burning kit will have a selection of these nibs.\nThey consist of a solid brass tip that is heated by an electrical element. These burning tools operate at a fixed temperature.\nThe basic tool kit for a beginner is a one-piece tool or pen with the burning tip set permanently into the shaft. The tip consists of a cylinder or tube that has been honed at a precise angle on two sides to create a sharp, slanted edge.\nThere are many wood burner sets available for the beginner pyrographer who is just starting out. They supply the basic equipment required to get you burning.\nAs you gain more experience, you will naturally progress to more professional wood burning sets in order to achieve better results.\nThere are pyrography tools available with the option of interchangeable tips. These will give you a wider selection of burning strokes, angles, and detail in your design.\nThis means that in addition to the basic burning tip you started with, you can now add shading tips and other specialty tips for cross-hatching and other effects to your wood burn kit arsenal.\nAnother category of the burning tool is wire-nib burners.\nThese wood burner pens have variable temperature controls. The “writing nib” is heated by an electrical current passing directly through it. Some models have interchangeable wire nibs to allow for various different burning effects.\nThese wire points can be shaped for various tasks giving you the diversity that you need. Look for tips that create fine line work, diversify your shading, make calligraphy easy, increase your texturing options, and pierce wood-turned projects.\nThe advanced wire nib burner will come with built-in thermostats to give you greater control over the temperature of the tip.\nThe wire tip kit may be classed as a professional wood burning kit as it offers a wide range of interchangeable tips, including fish scales, feather tips, and specialty textures.\nHow Hot Does A Wood Burning Tool Get\nBurners for pyrography have a temperature range of 750 to 1050 degrees Fahrenheit (400 to 565 Celsius).\nWood burners with solid points and screw-style tips are frequently made of soft brass metal. It may take this metal five minutes or longer to reach a temperature.\nThe basic guideline for wire gages is that the thicker the wire, the smaller the gage number. You should observe that pyrography equipment requires more time to heat a thicker wire.\nA 16-gauge tip, for instance, would require more time to heat up than a 20-gauge tip.\nPro Pyrography Kit Options\nIn wood burning pyrography kits – you will usually find a burning pen and a selection of nibs. Some advanced pyrography sets give you more options. The best wood burning kit for beginners may include letters and number stamps, a stencil, a stand, a case, and finger guards.\nDecide what your needs are and buy accordingly.\nWhat To Look For In A Professional Wood Burning Kit\nYou will discover there is a very large selection of wood burning tooltips or nibs with assorted shapes to choose from. Each of these nibs performs differing functions and create their own effects.\nYou will, with experience, learn which nibs suit your style and subject matter.\nSome people also prefer to work with heavier pyrography pens, others with lighter ones. With experience and practice, you will learn which type of pen and nibs suit your style and which tools you are most comfortable working with.\nWhen buying a wood burning tool, bear in mind that you will probably be holding it for long periods of time, perhaps a couple of hours at a time.\nThe best pyrography machine will be comfortable in the hand and easy to manipulate and control.\nBesides the pen and the selection of nibs provided, other tools in the burning wood kit for adults may include a variety of other useful accessories.\nWhy Is A Stand Important?\nA pyrography pen stand is a very useful addition to your wood burning pen kit. By using the stand, you keep your hot wood burning tools off your worktable or bench and out of harm’s way.\nBy keeping the hot end of your pyrography pen elevated, you limit the chance of burning or marking your work area.\nThe stand also makes it easier to pick up your tool and prevents the pen from rolling around on the table.\nFinger Guard Protection\nSome wood burning machine kits also provide a finger guard for your protection. A finger guard protects your finger from the heat coming off the tool while in use.\nThese wonderful accessories are durable, heat-resistant and one size fits all.\nPyrography Letters and Stamps\nA wood-burning kit with letters is a good general kit, with the alphabet being a great addition. Sooner or later you will be wanting some sort of lettering done, be it someone’s name, address, or a couple of words.\nA professional wood burning kit with stencils that includes lettering is time-saving and makes for neat work. Bear in mind though that the variety of different fonts is virtually limitless. So don’t limit yourself.\nDo some research and use a font that best compliments your artwork or design – even if you have to trace the lettering yourself off a printout or photocopy rather than a stencil.\nLetter stamps come in capital and lower case. To use them you need to heat up each letter, stamp it, remove it and move on to the next letter you need. This is where a stencil may be a better option.\nWood Burning Kit With Stencils\nThe best pyrography kits for beginners can come with generic stencils with numbers, letters, and a few icons included.\nBe aware though, that there are some beautifully designed metal and plastic stencils for wood burning that can be bought separately. These cover almost any design, pattern, or wording imaginable.\nHow To Change Wood Burner Tips\nThere are 2 methods to change your wood burning tool tips.\nChanging a Cold Tool Tip\nThe safest method is to remove the tool tip and replace it when the pyrography pen is cool. It usually takes 4 to 5 minutes for a hot pen to cool off enough to not scald you.\n- Simply remove the pen tip by turning it in an anti-clockwise direction. If it is a little tight, use needle-nosed pliers to loosen it gently.\n- To install your new desired tool tip, turn the tip in a clockwise direction.\nWhen doing this, ensure that the tip is in an upright position and in line with the threads. If you screw it in and it is not straight, you could damage the threads on both the tool and the tip.\nAdditionally, if you force it in, you may not be able to get the tip out again. Or you may not be able to thread any other tip into the tool as the threads are damaged permanently.\nCare and patience are advised.\nRemoving A Hot Tool Tip\nYou will definitely need needle-nose pliers close at hand for this exercise.\n- Use the pliers to gently remove the hot tip.\n- Unscrew the tip from the pen in an anti-clockwise direction. Be careful not to squeeze or pull too hard, the tips are made of brass and can be damaged.\n- Place the hot tip in cold water to cool it off. This also prevents the burning or scalding of your work area.\n- Use needle-nosed pliers to install the new tip. Be careful not to touch the hot pen while doing this.\nIt is good advice to practice installing and removing tips on your new pyrography pen before you start using it. This will ensure you get a feel for how the tips go on and off.\nIt’s a good thing to know when changing the tips when the pen is hot.\nTo avoid too many changes while you are working, purchase a second tool. In this way, you can have 2 hot tools at your fingertips with different nibs. This will save you time and not break your workflow.\nHow To Clean Your Tool Tip\nThere will always be a build-up of carbon on your tips eventually. Carbon is burned wood that starts to accumulate on the hot tip.\nThe easiest and simplest method is to use fine sandpaper to scrape off the unwanted residue. Do not use a rougher grade as it may damage the tip.\nAnd safety first – do not hold the sandpaper in your hand when cleaning a hot tool. You may scald yourself.\nIt is also advisable to only do this occasionally, and when necessary. Too much use of sandpaper will slowly wear away the brass tip.\nClick here for a full tutorial: How to clean wood burning tool tips\nA pyrography pen kit is a very personal thing to buy.\nYou need to determine what type of artwork you will be creating. Will it be fine art, just lettering, or are you interested in geometric designs?\nThese factors predetermine the type of nibs and related accessories you will be needing in order to burn efficiently.\nAnother factor to consider is your experience and skill level when buying a new pyrography burner.\nThe professional wood burning kit or tool needs a little more expertise and experience in order to be used to its full potential.\nThe best beginner wood burning kit of good quality will last more than adequately for a few years as you increase your skills. It is always a good idea to read wood burning kit reviews wherever you are purchasing from to get peoples opinions on what you are interested in buying.\nAnd of course, just have fun and experiment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0e28b880-9f0f-4f60-8807-7ef249272b44>","<urn:uuid:40e073b5-0f76-4f07-85d8-c31d4ce8a0f3>"],"error":null}

These tools are put to good use by over 10,000 litter pickers and community groups all across the UK, however the missing link until now, was a durable and reusable alternative to single-use bin bags.\nWaterhaul has teamed up with Falmouth based maker Rory McKellar from Ocean Republic, and Clean Sailors’ ReSail initiative, to give old sails a second life.\nWaste sails are collected through Clean Sailors Resail scheme and are then hand-made into the beach cleaning bags by Rory and his team from Ocean Republic in their Penryn-based sail-loft. Rory’s specialism has so-far been in creating surfboard covers made from upcycled sails and wetsuits, but the new partnership will enable him to expand his operations.\nRory said: “I’d admired the work Waterhaul does, transforming this problem of plastic pollution into part of the solution with their recycled litter pickers. It’s a fantastic opportunity to be able to use my expertise around upcycling and Clean Sailors collection program, to be part of this impact. The ocean for me is something I’ve always been in love with. I live in it, swim in it, surf in it, and I think we should all protect it.”\nThe upcycled sail bags are designed to be a perfect fit for Waterhaul’s recycled bag holding hoops – which hold the bag open for easy litter picking. Each of these hoops are made from 330 grams of recycled fishing nets and ropes.\nHarry Dennis from Waterhaul said “We’re really excited to be tackling a new waste stream, whilst finding a solution for beach cleaners – and to be doing so by working together with other Cornish businesses.”\n“We are super excited to deepen our partnerships with Waterhaul and Ocean Republic! Aside from being super teams, we firmly stand alongside their missions for transforming perceived waste materials into new, useful products. Being able to join forces in our home county makes it all the more special.” says Holly Manvell, founder of Clean Sailors.\nCornish boat owners are being urged to participate in the Clean Sailors Resail initiative. End of life sails can be dropped off at multiple locations in the South West to support input of sail material into the project.\nThe upcycled sailcloth bags will be available online at https://www.waterhaul.co and retail at £8.50.\nWaterhaul is a Newquay based social-enterprise that transforms the ocean’s harmful and abundant form of plastic (ghost gear – waste fishing gear lost or discarded at sea) into products to inspire people to connect with and protect the ocean.\nFor further details about Waterhaul, or to get involved with litter picking, please visit https://waterhaul.co or follow on Instagram @waterhaul_co\nOcean Republic is a environmentally conscious business that promotes and implements sustainable practices whilst developing awareness and an appreciation for the ocean.

{"question":"What are the differences in how denim manufacturers and sustainable fashion brands approach material selection and production processes to minimize environmental impact?","answer":"Denim manufacturers are moving away from traditional production methods and seeking alternatives like avoiding polyester usage and focusing on laundry innovations with simpler, digital, and automatic processes. They emphasize collaboration across the supply chain and measuring environmental impacts like waste, carbon emissions, and water usage to verify improvements. Meanwhile, sustainable fashion brands specifically focus on using natural and renewable materials like organic cotton, bamboo, hemp, and linen that are either biodegradable or renewable. They prioritize production processes that reduce energy consumption, decrease water usage, minimize chemical use, and maintain ethical labor standards. Both sectors are working toward transparency, but sustainable fashion has more established certification systems through third-party organizations like Global Organic Textile Standard and Fairtrade Certified to validate their practices.","context":["There are many ways to define innovation.\nAt Bluezone in Munich this week, individuals nominated and voted into the 2019 Rivet 50, an index of the most influential people in denim, shared their forecast for the next decade of denim. The executives, supply chain leaders, designers and creatives offered a myriad of views that underscored the need for more education, transparency and reflection.\nHere, they share their outlook on innovation and what it means for denim in the near future.\nDenim has evolved from being a utility fabric to a fashion fabric, but Monsieur-T founder and creative director Tilmann Wröbel said if denim doesn’t serve a greater purpose, and once again offer the wear functional benefits, it will just remain one of a large variety of fabrics fashion designer choose from. “Denim has to find function once again,” he said.\nInnovation doesn’t have to be high-tech. “What is missing is a way to provide the right information to the final consumer,” said Andrea Venier, managing director of Officina+39, an Italian textile chemical company. As sustainability gains importance to brands and consumers, the next wave of denim needs to be communicated in a way that easily digestible to understand, Venier said. They need to understand what it really means to be sustainable in a way that is not just part of a marketing agenda, he added.\n“I think today is very difficult to detach the word innovation from sustainability,” Alberto Candiani, owner of Candiani Denim Mill, said. “As a matter of fact, I believe we all do sustainable innovation nowadays and if I look at the near future, I believe we should be looking for balance.”\nThe denim industry, he said, is over-producing and should “do less and do it better.” While his idea is contrary to an industry that aims for continuous expansion, Candiani pointed out that there isn’t enough room in the market for everyone to grow. “There’s too much denim and it is having a high impact on the environment,” he said.\n“When I think about innovation, I think about the technology from the laundry side,” said Alice Tonello, marketing and R&D manager for the Italian garment finishing technologies company Tonello. “For me the laundry of the present and the future will be simple, digital and automatic.”\nStop, collaborate and listen\nNo matter the innovation in denim, collaboration will likely be the driving force behind it, said Tricia Carey, Lenzing’s director of global business development for denim. “Being at the very beginning of the supply chain and manufacturing fiber, we’re really nothing without our mill partners, garment finishers and people who innovatively tell the story, and certainly without the brands,” she said.\nFor Lenzing, innovation relies on bringing the market together through collaborations. Next, Carey said the consumer will become a supplier as the denim industry looks for recycled fabrics. Collaboration, she added, will have to “exist beyond just [the supply chain] talking to each other, but really engage with the consumer too.”\nBrands are asking for technology rather than product, said Ebru Ozaydin, senior vice president of sales and marketing of Artistic Milliners. “Now is not the time for a new 3×1 fabric or fantastic shade of blue,” she said. “Customers don’t want to hear that.”\nAs Gen Z enters the design workforce, the conversation is shifting from fashion to technology. “That’s why when we go to customers we need to do a presentation on our innovations,” Ozaydin said. “We have to talk about technology and the value proposition behind it.”\nJust say no to poly\nIn the next 10 years, Mohsin Sajid, Endrime designer and educator, said he would like to see governments get involved and help change how the industry is producing garments and educating consumers. “And I’d like to see us try our hardest to not use any polyester at all,” he added.\nProof of concept\nThe denim industry is innovating processes to reduce its impact on the planet, but Boyish Jeans creative director Jordan Nodarse said there needs to be steps in place for companies to accurately measure their waste, carbon emission and water usage. And more importantly, they need to measure these factors each year to know whether or not they are actually making improvements. “Are you doing better?” he asked. “That’s the real question. Otherwise, we’re just blindly making decisions that we think are better.”\n“We need to be transparent to our consumers, let them know what we’re doing, how we’re doing it and not be afraid to share information to each other so we can all succeed, as we all have the same goal here,” Nodarse said. “Half the world’s population is wearing jeans, so there’s plenty of room for all of us to succeed if we’re all doing it right.”\nOut of the box\nEducation leads to innovation, said Ian Berry, the British artist who creates artwork solely from denim. “Being outside denim, the only advantage I have is looking in from the outside,” he said. But outsiders can spark innovation. Berry said there’s an untapped opportunity to educate the engineering students and graduates from other technical industries about the challenges that face the denim industry.\nNo machine or study can innovate what Bluezone curator Panos Sofianos would like to see in the next decade. Sofianos hopes there will be a paradigm shift in what society values. “I’m optimistic, but on one side I’m pessimistic because I see a society that is selfish, a society that consumes because it wants to be happy,” he said.\nConsumption, Sofianos added, is not the answer. “Innovation is sharing, living and appreciating one another,” he said.","What is Sustainable Fashion?\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in consumer awareness and demand for more sustainable fashion. Sustainable fashion emphasizes not only ecological benefits, but also social justice. It’s so much more than just using eco-friendly materials; it’s about creating a fairer and more ethical production system.\nSo, what is sustainable fashion and why should you care? In this article, we will explore the topics of what sustainable fashion is, the benefits, challenges and how to shop sustainably. We will also discuss the future of sustainable fashion and, finally, draw a conclusion.\nThe Benefits of Sustainable Fashion\nThe term “sustainable fashion” has become an increasingly important one in the fashion industry. It is a phrase that encompasses a wide range of topics, from the materials used to create clothing to the supply chain practices used to get that clothing to you. Sustainable fashion is all about promoting a healthier environment and creating a better future for all.\nOne of the biggest benefits of sustainable fashion is its environmental friendliness. Instead of using synthetic materials and generating waste, sustainable fashion is focused on using materials that are natural and renewable, such as organic cotton and bamboo.\nNot only are these materials better for the environment, but they also help to create clothes that are more breathable and softer on the skin. Sustainable fashion is also committed to reducing the carbon footprint of fashion. This can be accomplished by reducing energy consumption, decreasing water usage, and reducing the use of chemicals.\nSustainable fashion is also an ethical way to shop for clothing. Sustainable fashion companies often use fair trade practices, meaning that the people making the clothing are paid a living wage and work in safe and humane conditions.\nSustainable fashion companies are also often more transparent, allowing customers to see where their clothes are sourced from and the production processes used.\nFinally, sustainable fashion is a great way to shop for trendy and stylish clothing. It is no longer necessary to choose between looking great and being kind to the environment. Sustainable fashion companies are dedicated to creating high-quality pieces that are fashionable and stylish.\nIn summary, sustainable fashion is an incredibly important movement in the fashion industry. It provides environmental protection and ethical practices in the production of clothing. It also gives customers the opportunity to purchase stylish and trendy clothing without sacrificing quality or ethics.\nSustainable fashion is the future of eco-friendly clothing, and it has the potential to make a huge impact on the fashion industry.\nThe Challenges of Sustainable Fashion\nOne of the toughest challenges of Sustainable Fashion is the cost. Sustainable fashion typically relies on more natural materials and processes, which can be significantly more expensive than traditional fashion materials.\nSimilarly, sustainable fashion products also take much longer to produce, as they require more complex and labor intensive manufacturing processes. This can lead to higher price tags, which can be difficult for consumers to purchase.\nAnother of the challenges of Sustainable Fashion is the conflicting desires of consumers. Many consumers want to purchase clothing that is eco-friendly and sustainable, but they also want fashion that is trendy and fashionable. It can be difficult for companies to balance both of these desires and to create pieces that are both fashionable and sustainable.\nFinally, a lack of knowledge and awareness is a major challenge for Sustainable Fashion. Consumers often don’t understand the meaning and implications of eco-friendly and sustainable fashion, which can make it difficult for companies to promote and spread the message.\nSimilarly, many fashion designers are still unfamiliar with the materials and techniques used in sustainable fashion, meaning that there is not yet a large body of experts who are able to design sustainable fashion pieces.\nThese challenges demonstrate the difficulty of Sustainable Fashion, particularly from a consumer perspective. Companies need to work to increase awareness, reduce costs, and create trendy designs that will appeal to consumers who are looking for eco-friendly ways to dress. If successful, Sustainable Fashion can become a mainstream and widely accepted form of fashion.\nHow to Shop Sustainably\nAs the fashion industry looks towards the future, they are increasingly turning to sustainable practices and eco-friendly clothing. Shopping sustainably means reducing your ecological footprint by buying clothes that are made with sustainable materials and/or produced in an ethical way. Here are some tips on how to do just that.\n- Do Your Research\nIt’s important to take the time to do your research on a company before you make a purchase. Read company websites, find out about their production processes and materials used in their clothes, and even contact them directly with questions. Read up on their sustainability credentials and make sure you are happy with what you’re buying.\n- Look for Sustainable Materials\nSustainable materials are those that are either renewable or biodegradable, and don’t damage the environment. Popular sustainable fabrics include bamboo, hemp, linen, and organic cotton. Look for clothes that are made from sustainable materials and be sure to check the label.\n- Shop Local\nShopping local is an excellent way to ensure the clothes you buy are produced in an ethical way, as it is easier to monitor how the clothes are made and who is making them. Shopping at local independent stores can also help to support your local community.\n- Choose Quality Over Quantity\nRather than buying a lot of cheap, fast fashion clothes, opt for quality over quantity and invest in clothes that will last longer. Buying higher quality clothing means you can wear it for longer, so you’re not buying new clothes as often.\n- Choose Secondhand\nShopping secondhand is a great way to reduce the impact of your wardrobe on the environment. As well as being a more affordable and sustainable option, secondhand clothes can be fun to shop for and have their own story.\nBy following these tips, you can make sure you’re shopping sustainably and responsibly for fashion and clothing. Sustainability is an important partof the future of the fashion industry and it’s up to us to make sure we are taking the steps to ensure it is a responsible one.\nLook For Sustainable Materials\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly clothing, it’s important to consider the materials that make up the item. It’s better to choose items from companies that use materials that are either sustainably sourced or eco-friendly.\nSustainable materials include materials made from renewable sources, such as bamboo or organic cotton. These materials are produced in ways that reduce waste and conserve natural resources.\nAdditionally, many of these materials are produced in an ethical manner, providing better working conditions and wages for workers.\nSynthetic materials are often used in fashion, but many of these materials are not sustainable. Therefore, it is better to select items made from natural fibers, like wool, hemp, and silk, as these materials are more environmentally friendly and biodegradable.\nAdditionally, choosing organic materials like cotton and bamboo is a great way to support sustainable fashion.\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly clothing, it is important to look at the labels. Clothes that are labeled as “eco-friendly” or “all natural” may be made with sustainable materials and are therefore better for the environment.\nHowever, it is important to read labels carefully to ensure that the materials used meet the standards of sustainability. Additionally, looking for certifications such as Fair Trade or Oeko-Tex can also be a good indication of an item’s sustainability.\nFinally, attempting to purchase items made close to home can help to reduce energy costs associated with manufacturing and transportation. By taking the time to look for sustainable materials in clothing, individuals can be part of the shift towards more sustainable fashion.\nBuy from Sustainable Brands\nThe best way to ensure that your fashion choices are eco-friendly is to buy from sustainable brands. Sustainable fashion brands are those that use eco-friendly materials and production techniques, focus on ethical labor practices, and promote sustainability as a core part of their mission.\nShopping from these brands allows you to support eco-friendly brands while also reducing your environmental impact.\nWhen shopping for sustainable fashion clothing, look for labels with organic cotton, bamboo, hemp, or other natural materials. These natural fabrics are easier on the environment than synthetic materials like polyester and nylon.\nMany sustainable brands also use eco-friendly dyes and other production techniques that have a low environmental impact.\nSustainable fashion brands also focus on ethical labor practices. Many sustainable fashion brands prioritize fair wages, safe working conditions, and the use of locally sourced materials and labor. This ensures that workers in the fashion industry are paid fairly for their work and have safe working conditions.\nFinally, many sustainable fashion brands focus on giving back to their communities and supporting projects that help to protect the environment. For example, many sustainable fashion brands donate a portion of their profits to environmental charities. This allows consumers to feel good about their purchases, knowing that they are supporting an eco-friendly brand that is also helping to make the world a better place.\nOverall, shopping from sustainable fashion brands is the best way to ensure that your fashion choices are eco-friendly. By buying from these brands, you can feel good about your purchase and know that you are helping to protect the environment.\nLook for Disclosure Information\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly clothing, look for disclosure information from the company and preferably an independent third-party certifier to ensure the clothing’s validity as a sustainable product.\nEvery company has a different set of sustainable standards they must meet, such as water and energy conservation, material sourcing, chemical and waste management, and corporate social responsibility.\nMany companies include these standards on their website, and some even have them printed on their clothing and packaging for customer reference.\nHaving a third-party certifier adds additional assurance of the sustainability of the fashion brand’s products. Organizations such as the Global Organic Textile Standard, Fairtrade Certified, and Cotton LEADS certification programs all certify various eco-friendly clothing and fashion items and can provide customers with a guarantee of the product’s sustainability.\nThe certification process varies by organization, but generally requires that companies undergo a comprehensive assessment of their product’s materials and production processes in order to qualify for the certification. This assessment process is also necessary for a company to be able to legally advertise their products as eco-friendly and sustainable.\nTo further support sustainable fashion, it is important to remember to research and read labels when shopping for eco-friendly clothing. This will help to ensure that the clothing you buy is of the highest quality and is produced ethically and in an environmentally responsible way. Learning to recognize quality and sustainability practices when shopping can help to create a brighter future for the fashion industry.\nBe Mindful of Trends\nAs fashion trends come and go, it is important to be mindful of what is considered “in-vogue” at any given time. This is particularly true when it comes to sustainable fashion. While it is important to remain up to date on the latest fashion trends, there are ways to do so while still remaining conscious of the environment.\nTo start, it is wise to look for eco-friendly fashion trends made from natural materials. Natural materials, such as organic cotton, do not require the use of harsh chemicals or toxins and is a much more sustainable option.\nAdditionally, when shopping for fashion trends, it can be helpful to look for pieces that are locally made. This reduces the emissions generated from shipping, as well as supports the local economy.\nFurthermore, investing in quality pieces that can be worn for years to come is a great way to stay on trend without having to replace items as often.\nFinally, as a way to further embrace sustainable fashion, one can look towards second-hand pieces. Buying pre-owned clothing that is still in good condition is a great way to add variety to one’s wardrobe in a sustainable way. Not only does this reduce the need for new clothes, but it also leaves a much smaller environmental footprint.\nIn sum, fashion trends are constantly changing and it is important to remain up-to-date on the latest styles. While doing so, it is important to remain mindful of the environment by opting for sustainable fashion trends, such as organic cotton and locally made pieces. Furthermore, second-hand items can be a great way to add variety and to help minimize one’s environmental impact.\nThe Future of Sustainable Fashion\nWhen it comes to fashion and clothing, sustainability is the way of the future. In the era of global warming and increasing awareness of environmentally conscious practices, eco-friendly clothing is the best way to reduce our ecological footprint.\nAs the global population continues to grow, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue, and sustainable fashion is an important part of this.\nThe fashion industry is among the world’s largest polluters, so finding ways of creating sustainable clothing is one of the most effective methods of reducing environmental impact. Sustainable fashion can take many forms, and there are a few key ways of making clothing more sustainable.\nOne way to make clothing more sustainable is to use eco-friendly materials. Natural materials, like organic cotton and bamboo, are renewable sources and can be grown without damaging the environment.\nThere are also many recycled materials that can be used in clothing, such as recycled plastic bottles, which are a great way to reduce waste and emissions.\nAnother way to make clothing more sustainable is to make sure that the clothing is made in a responsible way. It is important to make sure that the clothing is produced in a way that is safe for workers and is not damaging to the environment.\nMany fashion companies are now taking steps to ensure that their production processes are sustainable, from using ethical labor practices to using renewable energy sources.\nFinally, sustainable fashion also focuses on the quality of clothing. Companies are now using methods like slow fashion and upcycling, which help to reduce waste and extend the life span of clothing.\nBy creating durable and well-made clothing that can be worn for years, fashion companies can help reduce the impact of the fashion industry on the environment.\nSustainable fashion is the way of the future, and there are many ways to make sure that our clothing is eco-friendly and responsibly made. By focusing on eco-friendly materials, production processes, and high-quality clothing, the fashion industry can make apositive impact on the environment and help create a more sustainable future.\nThe sustainable fashion revolution has made incredible progress in recent years due to increasing consumer awareness and demand. It is a movement that recognizes the importance of creating clothing while minimizing the negative impacts on the environment.\nAlthough the challenges are great, the potential benefits of sustainable fashion are even greater. With a greater focus on materials that are sourced sustainably and clothing that is made to last, sustainable fashion can play an important role in reducing our impact on the environment and promoting a more equitable and sustainable lifestyle.\nAs individuals, we can be more conscious of the materials we use and the clothes we buy, and we can also actively seek out sustainable fashion brands that promote a healthy, sustainable fashion industry. By committing to sustainable fashion, we can help ensure a brighter and more sustainable future for fashion and the planet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8c7e662a-8949-4e16-a29a-e52e8cb05b84>","<urn:uuid:dd06e4f4-ae32-4ab6-ab0b-35a963876905>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which requires more detailed documentation: a follow-up visit for a rash or an IME (Independent Medical Examination) report?","answer":"An IME report requires more detailed documentation, as the documents indicate that IME reports have more diverse formatting and organization requirements than other report types and contain many technical terms, shorthand, and abbreviations. In contrast, a follow-up visit for a rash only needs basic documentation of the complaint ('F/U rash'), relevant history, and examination findings.","context":["Accurate Documentation of the Complaint: Focus on the “Why”\nWhen stating the complaint, many medical charts improperly describe what the physician is expected to do rather than explain what prompted the service.\nThe documentation in the medical record for any E/M service must include a clear statement of the complaint, which is the reason that the physician provides the service. The complaint is the first thing that should be documented for a patient visit. Yet, many times medical records fail to indicate a true complaint. Instead, the record offers as a complaint a summary of what the physician is expected to do. For example, “✓ left leg” or “skin ✓” or “TBSE.” While it may be necessary for the dermatologist to perform those services, those comments are not appropriate documentation of complaints.\nThe reason that the left leg or the skin must be checked is the complaint:\n- Suppose the patient has a personal history of a skin cancer. This is the reason for a total skin check at appropriate intervals.\n- If the patient has been treated for a rash on the left leg and is returning for follow up, then the complaint is “rash” or “F/U rash.”\nThe complaint should direct the documentation of the history of present illness (HPI), the review of systems (ROS), and the past, family, and social history (PFSH).\nThe complaint along with the HPI, ROS, and PFSH, generally indicates the areas to be examined. The location of the rash is part of the HPI. Documentation of the exam should relate the findings to the areas examined.\nBefore signing off on any patient record, the provider should review it with an eye toward comprehensiveness and cohesiveness. ASk these questions: Does the record make sense? Is there a logical flow from the complaint through the medical decision making?\nDocument All Complaints\nDocumentation of all complaints and findings is important to ensure proper reimbursement. When an E/M service and a procedure are provided on the same day, the E/M service is considered to be included in the procedure (by Medicare and some other payers) if the lesion treated by the procedure is the only complaint evaluated. Therefore, it is vital that all complaints or findings are documented.\nIf a patient is being examined due to personal history of skin cancer, the E/M is for that reason and not part of any procedure that might result from that exam. The documentation of the E/M should include evidence that the provider examined all appropriate areas for recurrences or new skin cancers. The fact that lesions needing treatment are found does not make the E/M part of the treatment of said lesions.\nThe diagnosis code for the E/M is V10.83 for BCC or SCC and V10.82 for MM. If a patient has several lesions examined, but some are not treated, the E/M should be allowed and the diagnosis related to the E/M should reflect one of the lesions not treated.\nIt is important also to adequately document the procedures done on the same day. Can you pull the documentation for each code apart from the rest and have each part stand on its own?

{"question":"How do the safety features compare between diving with the PRISM 2 rebreather and sailing the Catalina 545?","answer":"The PRISM 2 rebreather incorporates safety features such as triple oxygen sensors with voting logic, automatic PPO2 monitoring, and a bail-out valve option for emergencies. The Catalina 545 features safety elements including a steel railing around the cockpit extending forward, secure handrails to the bow, a high toerail/bulwark for crew security, a fully isolated anchor locker serving as a crash compartment, and a separate dinghy garage for additional safety.","context":["The PRISM 2 is an electronically or manually controlled, constant PO2, modular, closed circuit diving system.\nAs open circuit (SCUBA) divers we rely upon filling our lungs with air from a pressurized gas tank with every inhalation and then exhausting that volume of air into the surrounding water with every exhalation. As we descend deeper the water pressure around us increases and the volume required to fill our lungs increases; in other words, our air supply depletes more quickly the deeper we dive.\nA rebreather recycles rather than vents the exhaled breath. The exhaled breath passes into a closed loop, where it is pushed through a chemical absorbent (scrubber) to remove the carbon dioxide, and returns through the other side of the loop for the diver to re-breathe, hence the name \"closed circuit rebreather\" or CCR.\nIt’s breathing loop which is a keyed one way assembly consists of a closable mouthpiece assembly with mushroom/check valves either side, which ensure uni-directional flow.\nIndependent 3rd party testing has also rated the Prism 2 the lowest work of breathing of any mixed gas rebreather available today at 0.94J/L. Click here for actual test reports: ANSTI_Prism2WOB_review.pdf\nWith the electronics switched on, the secondary also provides a status check for the battery and displays the set point selected for the dive along with other critical information. The electronics vote between the three proprietary galvanic sensors and control the operation of a low wattage solenoid valve on the oxygen supply.\nA radial flow scrubber canister is mounted vertically on a backplate attached to the integrated BC, between twin supply cylinders (one each, oxygen and diluent).\nThe electronics, sensors and batteries are mounted in the electronics head assembly at the top of the scrubber, with supply hoses feeding over the diver’s shoulders into the top of the counterlungs. An analog LED primary display offers a quick reference of unit performance with status and alarm indicators while an independent digital OLED secondary display verifies the unit’s performance.\nCounter lungs (front or back mounted)\nDual, front or back mounted counterlungs provide the diver with a flexible reservoir equivalent to the maximum displacement of the diver’s own lung volume and ensures the lowest possible hydrostatic loading.\nThese counterlungs are fitted with both automatic and manual gas addition systems and a variable volume control valve (used upon ascent to vent excess expanding gas volume or to purge the loop). Diluent addition is automatically achieved as hydrostatic pressure increases and the counter lung collapses against the valve actuator.\nSecondary Display (COMPUTER)\nThe Shearwater Petrel 3 is the computer display on the Prism 2 and was chosen for this application as it is one of the most advanced mixed gas CCR computers available today. The Petrel 3 is designed to control the Prism 2 setpoint and uses a basic decompression algorithm known as Buhlmann ZHL-16C which has been modified by the use of gradient factors.\n- Depth, time and oxygen sensor display\n- Bühlmann decompression model with gradient factors conservatism\n- Optional VPM-B decompression model\n- Imperial and metric displays\n- DiveCAN communications for robust connections to rebreathers\n- A menu system that adapts to diving status\n- Automatic turn off after 15 minutes on the surface\n- Depth sensor rated to 450 feet/140 meters of seawater\n- Dive Planner\n- Any combination of oxygen, nitrogen, and helium (Air, Nitrox, Trimix)\n- Open and closed circuit, switchable during a dive\n- 5 CC and 5 OC gases\n- Gases can be changed and added during a dive\n- CNS tracking\n- No lockout from violating deco stops\n- Automatic PPO2 set-point switching (configurable)\n- Two PPO2 set-points, each of which can be set between .5 and 1.5\n- Flexible user replaceable battery.

The typical full course training time is 3-7 days consisting of a classroom lecture, confined water session and at least four OW dives. Our recommendation to divers seeking rebreather training is to select an instructor having several hundred hours of rebreather dives and for whom rebreathers are their primary mode of diving.\nIf you are not already certified for the rebreather, per manufacturer requirements you will receive a disabled unit that can only be enabled by your instructor.

Moving up from the popular 30ft to 45ft sizes puts the company into “yacht” territory, and the new Catalina 545, winner of the SAIL magazine 2020 Best Boats award for “Best Monohull Flagship,” adds some real innovations to its traditional features.\nDESIGN & CONSTRUCTION\nThe obvious new feature of the Catalina 545 is found at the sheer, where designer/builder Gerry Douglas incorporates a molded box-beam collar to replace the conventional hull/deck joint, toerail, stanchion bases, scuppers and anchor platform, all at once. It’s one of those ideas that makes you slap your forehead and ask, “Of course. Why didn’t I think of that?”\nBesides providing great strength and rigidity, the collar adds a smooth integrated sheerline to the hull and conceals a set of scupper drains, which carry any water that collects on deck to below the waterline, thereby eliminating topside stains. The bowsprit also no longer has an added-on appearance but extends cleanly forward as a kind of extension of the overall hull structure. Perhaps we will see future Catalinas built with sheer-line collars as well.\nThe forestay extends nearly to the masthead, and a large light-air headsail can be easily attached to the tip of the anchor platform. The tall mast is stepped on the keel, not the deck, and those more technically minded might be tempted to install a clear plastic door in the forward cabin to display the gorgeous turnbuckles and chainplates. The high air draft and moderately deep keel mean this is will not be an Intracoastal Waterway boat.\nThe electrical system is simple, neat and conventional, with individually wired circuits leading to breakers on a regular panel. Douglas values easy maintenance and cited reports of troublesome distributed systems on other builders’ boats as his reason for doing wiring the “old fashioned” way.\nThe big house battery bank is easy to reach through a large hatch in the saloon sole. There is also excellent access to all filters and through-hulls for the engine.\nThe detailing aboard the Catalina 545’s deck is a testament to the builder’s experience and attention to customer feedback. The cockpit seats and deck, for example, are all at the same level and backrests are low, making movement in and out of the cockpit that much safer and easier. A steel railing, not a wire lifeline, wraps around the cockpit and extends well forward. Secure handrails provide grab points the rest of the way to the bow, and that same sheerline collar creates a high toerail/bulwark to help keep crew aboard as they make their way along the expansive side decks.\nThe cockpit is designed for shorthanded sailing, with control lines leading to powered winches near the twin wheels. It will also be easy to thread new lines for various headsails through the oversize covers. The controls, sightlines, seating and helm position all seem right for an average-size sailor.\nThe thoughtful layout works at anchor, too. The big teak cockpit table, for example, includes a fridge and is easily removable for varnishing/maintenance over the winter. Similarly, the starboard-side seat flips up to create a berth for sleeping under the stars.\nThe huge anchor locker includes carbon-fiber partitions to reduce weight while retaining maximum strength. It also serves as a crash compartment, being fully isolated from the rest of the hull.\nAstern, the dinghy garage is also kept completely separate from the hull for safety. There’s excellent access to the rudder post and steering cables inside. With the hydraulic transom platform in the raised position, a set of handy steps molded into its slightly reverse outward face ensures it's still easy to climb aboard.\nThe overall impression of the Catalina 545 interior is of a simple, light, pretty apartment with quality teak and maple furnishings. The plentiful portlights, clear hatches and big square hull windows all have light-darkening shades. It’s all distinctly American, although I cannot explain how the designer achieved that effect.\nThe saloon includes plenty of room for eight people in two areas, with movable hassocks for added seating and a starboard settee that pulls out to form a double berth. A pretty dropleaf table and a large motorized combination TV/nav display rises from a low bulkhead complete the setting.\nAn efficient galley to port has stowage and fridge/freezer capacity for extended cruising. There are two small step-downs to the galley and the aft cabins, bothersome tripping points until you get used to them, but also necessary for headroom.\nThe owner’s cabin forward features a queen-size berth on a center island with clear access to the sides, a reading nook and an abundance of stowage. The port aft cabin of our test boat had a double berth, while the starboard aft cabin sported a pair of motorized twin berths that could whir together to form a double.\nDouglas designs boats for sail reduction at around 15 knots, but we would not have that on the bright, clear autumn day of our test sail off Annapolis, Maryland. Instead, it was a pleasant, easy sail with 8 to 10-knot winds, gradually dropping to around 5 knots. I would be the first reviewer to sail this boat, which was untuned and still in its final assembly stage having just made its debut at the Annapolis boat show.\nI measured 5.8 knots of boatspeed close-hauled before the wind dropped. The boat handled well, but the fluky wind precluded being able to accurately gauge our tacking angles. Our test boat had a roller-furling 135 percent genoa and an in-mast furling mainsail. The double-ended German mainsheet system worked well. I liked having all the controls to hand at the helm and completely clear of the guest area farther forward in the cockpit. The uncluttered space stretching between the transom and companionway will make daysailing with friends delightful.\nMany thanks to Catalina for putting the tachometer up on the steering pedestal within easy view! All too many builders overlook this important detail. A 2,800 rpm setting produced 8 knots of boatspeed, while a wide-open throttle added another knot. There was a bit of prop vibration, and the noise level was higher than normal for a boat this size. Douglas said he plans to add more soundproofing to the engine compartment.\nThe turning circle was just one boatlength, and the boat stopped accurately, although it tended to kick markedly to port in reverse. This was easily solved aboard our test boat, however, thanks to a massive double jet-drive thruster system that moved both bow and stern, slipping the vessel in any direction, including sideways.\nThe Catalina 545 is an attractive, competent, comfortable coastal cruiser that can go offshore with ease—a straightforward, well-planned vessel that should take a couple or a family many miles with only simple maintenance.\nLOA 56ft 2in LWL 50ft 6in\nBEAM 15ft 6in DRAFT 6ft 3in\nSAIL AREA 1,350ft2 (100% FT)\nFUEL/WATER (GAL) 130/225\nENGINE 115hp Yanmar\nBallast Ratio 39\nSA/D Ratio 20\nWhat do these ratios mean?

{"question":"What types of CCNA certifications are available?","answer":"There are several types of CCNA certifications available: CCNA Cyber Ops, CCNA Routing and Switching, CCNA Wireless, CCNA Cloud, CCNA Data Center, CCNA Security, CCNA Collaboration, CCNA Industrial, and CCNA Service Provider.","context":["All you need to know about Cisco CCNA Certification\nWhat is CCNA?\nThe Cisco Certified Network Associate certification is simply an information technology certification organized by Cisco. Having a CCNA certification tells the general public that you are able to install as well as configure, operate and troubleshoot everything that has to do with routing and switching networks. If you are CCNA certified, you are basically telling us that you are able to make connections to remote sites through a wide area network (WAN). This certification is the most popular amongst the other Cisco certifications and it is in high demand. As a CCNA certified professional you are well on your way to having for yourself a career in the network administrative field or the network engineering field.\nSome of the things you would need to do or have knowledge of regarding the Cisco CCNA exam are;\nUnderstanding the reaction between different network topologies in a bid to create a secure network.\nBeing able to explain the workings of the computer network system and its interaction with other networking devices.\nBeing able to configure, trouble shoot and verify a switch that has VLAN and being able to interswitch communications.\nImplementing of an IP address scheme and IP services that will allow you meet some specific network requirements.\nConfiguration, verification and troubleshooting of routing and the router operators on Cisco devices should not be new to you.\nIdentification in network security threats.\nThese few and so many more inclusive are part of the things that you need to take note of if you are on your way to receiving a CCNA certification.\nThe associate-level certification can be achieved by first earning a CCENT certification. The associate-level certification program itself has been redesigned to properly bring itself together with the forever growing job opportunities and to also provide skills for networking professionals. To successfully get your hand on the certificate, there are two exams that you need to pass. Below I will give a list of the other associate level examinations and they are;\n- CCNA Cyber Ops\n- CCNA Routing and Switching\n- CCNA Wireless\n- CCNA Cloud\n- CCNA Data Center\n- CCNA Security\n- CCNA Collaboration\n- CCNA Industrial\n- CCNA Service Provider\nPeople always wonder what they can use a Cisco CCNA Certification for, and they also wonder what the benefits attached to having this certificate are – there are several job opportunities waiting for you if you are walking about with the certificate because as said earlier, the people who are CCNA certified are mostly sought after by several companies around the globe. The opportunities are endless and the opportunities are golden. The CCNA jobs or rather the areas that you can work in include; network engineering, network administrating, Information Technology management, systems engineering and so many more and the CCNA salary is equally mouthwatering.\nThe average salary that is received by certified female goes from about $55,166 -$90,642 and that of a certified male range from about $53,514 – $89,797,\nGetting the certification happens to be just icing on the cake, working to get the certification is where the real work shows up and this certification is not something that will just be handed over to you. You have to put in a whole lot of effort to get the certificate and the effort includes studying the right materials and practicing with the several practice questions on the internet. There is the CCNA study guide and CCNA boot camp that allows your insight on how to study, what to study and how many hours per day or days per week to spend studying. The exam is easy when you prepare for it, and getting the certification does not end at passing the examination – if you want to be employed and retain your employment you need to let your employer see that you are a hard worker and you won’t be slacking off every time their back is turned on you.\nFor ease of understanding I will outline a couple of steps that you can take to ensure a successful CCNA course.\nTo pass the examination with no hassle, you will need practical knowledge as much as you will need theoretical examination. You should know how to apply and be practical about the theoretical knowledge that you acquire.\nGET THE PROPER STUDY MATERIALS:\nThe materials you study go a long way in determining the success rate of your exam. This means that if you study materials that do not have the right content you need, it will mean that when some questions come up you might have some difficulty answering them.\nCCNA CERTIFICATION COST:\nRequired exams: Each CCNA specialization has a diverse exam requirement, as listed below. Exam costs: All CCNA exam cost listed above are $300 except for 200-125, which is $325, and the ICND1 and ICND2 exams at $165 each.\nPearson VUE is the authorized Cisco test delivery partner.\nCCNA PRACTICE TEST:\nThis will give you an idea of how the examination will be, you will get used to the questioning system and you will be able to practice with the timing of the exam.\nYou might have heard it before that writing this exam is hard and getting the CCNA test is almost impossible, but what you need to understand is that it is just like an examination and it requires what any examination would require, maybe with a little more consistency and preparation.

{"question":"What role do GBF1 and Myosin Va play in protein trafficking through secretory pathways?","answer":"GBF1 and Myosin Va have distinct roles in protein trafficking. GBF1 acts as a limiting factor that modulates both TGN and ER exit of proteins like VWF, affecting the size of storage organelles and thereby influencing hemostatic capacity. Meanwhile, Myosin Va is specifically involved in vesicle halting and reversing in the axon initial segment, facilitating the proper targeting of proteins. The interaction with Myosin Va is necessary for vesicle halting and reversing, while GBF1's function affects the overall trafficking speed through secretory pathways.","context":["Instead, lowering the quantity of VWF provides much less influence on WPB size in GBF1-ablated cells (Statistics 6G and 6H), recommending that GBF1 impacts the speed of both TGN and ER leave of VWF. of prohaemostatic von gamma-secretase modulator 2 Willebrand aspect (VWF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in individual endothelial cells and in mouse fibroblasts. The partnership between degrees of GBF1 as well as the trafficking of VWF into developing secretory granules verified GBF1 is certainly a limiting element in this technique. Further, GBF1 activation by AMPK lovers its control of anterograde trafficking to physiological cues; degrees of blood sugar control GBF1 activation subsequently modulating VWF trafficking into secretory granules. GBF1 modulates both TGN and ER leave, the last mentioned impacting how big is the VWF storage space organelles significantly, influencing the hemostatic capacity from the endothelium thereby. The function of AMPK being a central integrating component of mobile pathways with intra- and extra-cellular cues is now able to be expanded to modulation from the anterograde secretory pathway. because the smaller sized WPBs produced as the Golgi is certainly unlinked using nocodazole treatment (Ferraro et?al., 2014) of GBF1-ablated cells may also be agonist unresponsive after nocodazole washout and recovery (Statistics 6DC6F). Reducing VWF protein amounts by siRNA Rabbit Polyclonal to ARHGAP11A concentrating on of VWF creates smaller sized WPBs (Ferraro et?al., 2014) because restricting the amount of VWF quanta achieving the TGN at any moment lowers the likelihood of co-packaging multiple quanta in to the same WPB (Body?S5). If GBF1 depletion does not have any effect on the speed of trafficking through the TGN, siRNAs against VWF should lower WPB size in GBF1-lacking HUVECs towards the same level as in charge cells. Instead, reducing the quantity of VWF provides much less influence on WPB size in GBF1-ablated cells (Statistics 6G and 6H), recommending that GBF1 impacts the speed of both ER and TGN leave of VWF. Slower TGN leave should allow elevated co-association of VWF quanta, raising their potential for co-packaging into developing WPB, leading to extra-large WPBs in GBF1-depleted cells (Body?S5). GBF1 Proteins Amounts and Phosphorylation Control Its Function in Golgi Trafficking If GBF1 make a difference the speed of anterograde trafficking, after that do endothelial cells use this to regulate the function and amount of secretory cargo? Since GBF1 serves as a GEF for multiple ARFs, chances are a limiting aspect for downstream GEF features.

{"question":"How do the egg-laying habits of Blue Nawab butterflies compare to those of birdwing butterflies in terms of quantity and size?","answer":"The Blue Nawab lays eggs singly on the upperside of host plant leaves, with each egg being relatively large at about 1.9mm in diameter. In contrast, birdwing butterflies of the genus Ornithoptera lay no more than 30 eggs per brood, but their eggs are even larger, reaching up to 4mm in diameter, which are the largest butterfly eggs of all.","context":["Genus: Polyura Billberg, 1820\nSpecies: schreibers Linnaeus, 1758\nSubspecies: tisamenus Fruhstorfer, 1911\nWingspan of Adult Butterfly: 60-80mm\nCaterpillar Local Host Plants: Adenanthera pavonina (Fabaceae, common name: Red Saga), Nephelium lappaceum (Sapindaceae, common name: Rambutan), Acacia auriculiformis (Fabaceae, common name: Earleaf acacia), Ceiba pentandra (Malvaceae, common name: Silk-cotton Tree), Bruguiera cylindrica (Rhizophoraceae, common name: Bakau Putih).\nA female Blue Nawab giving us a view of its upperside.\nPhysical Description of Adult Butterfly:\nThe forewing has a strongly arched costa, a pointed apex and a concave termen. The hindwing has a pair of short stubby tails, longer and more pointed in the female. On the upperside, the Blue Nawab is brownish black with a whitish median band, broadly edged in blue, stretching across both wings. The white band is broader in the female. On the underside, the Blue Nawab is silvery white and is marked with bluish and brownish bands and spots.\nA male Blue Nawab giving us a view of its upperside.\nField Observations of Butterfly Behaviour:\nBlue Nawab is moderately rare in Singapore. They can be found in urban parks, gardens, forested areas and mangrove wetlands. The adults are large-sized, heavy-bodies butterflies with rapid and strong flights. They have a habit of perching high at tree-top level and have also been observed to puddle on wet grounds, carrion and faeces.\nThe early stages of the Blue Nawab have been locally observed to feed on leaves of five plants across different plant families. Of these, the Red Saga is most popularly utilized with regular sightings of caterpillars on young plants. The caterpillars feed on leaves of the host plants, and rest on the leaf upperside. The early instars rests on the midrib near the leaf tip where a silk bed has been spun. Larger caterpillars in later instars spin a silk mat across several leaves/leaflets (if the leaf or a leaflet is not large enough to accommodate the caterpillar) to create their \"base camps\" for rests between feeds.\nLocal host plant #1: Adenanthera pavonina (Red Saga).\nLocal host plant #2: Acacia auriculiformis.\nThe egg is laid singly on the upperside of a leaf/leaflet of the host plants. Each egg is yellow and spherical in shape, and its surface marked with barely distinguishable longitudinal ridges. The egg is rather large with a diameter of about 1.9mm.\nTwo views of an egg of the Blue Nawab.\nTwo views of a mature egg of the Blue Nawab. Note the head capsule being distinguishable through the egg shell.\nThe egg takes about 4 days to hatch, and the newly hatched has a body length of about 5.5-6mm. The young caterpillar eats the entire egg shell as its first meal. Its body is initially golden brown but turning green a day or two later. It has a black/brownish head with 2 pairs of curved horns, the lower of which being shorter and more straight. There is also pair of pointed process at the posterior segment.\nA sequence of three pics showing a newly caterpillar of the Blue Nawab eating its egg shell while its cephalic horns being unfurled concurrently.\nTwo views of a newly hatched Blue Nawab caterpillar, length: 5.5mm.\nTwo views of a 1st instar caterpillar, length: 8.5mm.\nAn early 1st instar caterpillar observed in the field.\nAfter 5-7 days of feeding, the 1st instar caterpillar grows to a length of about 10mm. The caterpillar stays dormant in its base camp with the new head capsule growing progressively larger behind the current one. The caterpillar moults to the next instar about half a day later.\nTwo views of a late 1st instar caterpillar, dormant prior to its moult, length: 10mm.\nThe 2nd instar has green body. Its head capsule is now reddish brown and has proportionately longer horns than those in the 1st instar, reddish brown in colour). At the other end, the posterior segment is yellowish brown and squarish, with the two anal process proportionately shorter and positioned at the two corners of this segment. After 4.5-5 days in this instar, and having the body length increased to about 15mm, the caterpillar moults again.\nTwo views of a newly moulted 2nd instar caterpillar, length: 9mm.\nTwo views of a 2nd instar caterpillar, length: 13mm.\nTwo views of a late 2nd instar caterpillar, dormant prior to its moult, length: 15mm.\nA 2nd instar Blue Nawab caterpillar resting on the upper surface of a Red Saga leaf in a western wasteland.\nThe head capsule of the 3rd instar caterpillar is pale beige brown initially; however all but the horns turn greenish (the horns) after a day or two. wide vertical streaks in dark brown. Some specimens might at this stage feature a small yellowish spot on the dorsum of the 3rd abdominal segment. This instar takes about 5 to 6 days to complete with body grown to about 23-26mm in length.\nTwo views of a 3rd instar caterpillar, early in this stage, length: 14mm.\nTwo views of a 3rd instar caterpillar, late in this stage, featuring the dorsal spot, length: 26mm.\nTwo views of another 3rd instar caterpillar, late in this stage, with the dorsal spot absent, length: 23mm.\nA 3rd instar caterpillar found in the field, resting in its base camp on a Red Saga plant.\nThe head capsule of the 4th instar caterpillar is yellowish green with the horns red-tipped in most specimens. In this instar, the dorsal spot on the 3rd abdominal segment could be absent, occur as a tiny speck, a larger oval spot, and bright yellowish crescent mark (edged in black). The two anal processes are now minuscule in size and hardly distinguishable. This penultimate instar lasts a further 6-7 days with body length reaching about 34-37mm. In the last few days of the instar, pale green crescent marks start to appear on each body segment, giving us a hint of what the next instar will bring.\nTwo views of a 4th instar caterpillar, with the dorsal spot in the form of a tiny speck, length: 38mm.\nTwo views of a 4th instar caterpillar, with the dorsal spot being a prominent crescent mark, length: 38.5mm.\nA 4th instar caterpillar found in the field, with the dorsal spot being oval in shape, resting in its base camp on a Red Saga plant.\nThe 5th instar caterpillar closely resembles the 4th instar caterpillar. The horns on the head capsule are observed to be broader than those in the 4th instar, and the amount of red shading they carry varies from specimen to specimen. The same variation in the dorsal spot on the 3rd abdominal segment can be seen in this instar. Some caterpillars without the dorsal spot in the 4th instar have been observed to possess the spot in the final instar. Another noticeable change is in the posterior segment where the golden brown shading seen in in earlier instars is now absent.\nThree 5th instar caterpillars, showing variations in the dorsal spot on the 3rd abdominal segment.\nHead capsules of 6 final instar Blue Nawab caterpillars, showing variations in coloration.\nTwo views of a 5th instar caterpillar, with crescentic mark late in this stage, length: 60mm.\nA 5th instar caterpillar found in the field, resting in its base camp on a Red Saga plant.\nThe 5th instar lasts for 12-13 days typically, but might reach 16 days for some specimens. The body length could reach up to 60-65mm. Toward the end of this instar, the body gradually shortens in length. The fully grown caterpillar soon abandons its \"base camp\" and goes in hunt for a pupation site. Eventually the caterpillar comes to rest on a spot on the under surface of a stem. There it spins a silk pad to which it attaches its claspers (anal prolegs). The pre-pupatory larva then hangs vertically, typically with its body curled up.\nA pre-pupa of the Blue Nawab in its curled up posture\nPupation takes place a day later. The pupa suspends itself from the same silk pad but now with its cremaster. The pupa has a berry like appearance with its thick and cylindrically oval shape. It is green but streaked with abundant white, especially on the leading edge of the wing pads. The tip of the pupa, where the head is sited, is colored reddish/pinky brown. Length of pupa: 24-25mm.\nThree views of a berry like pupa of the Blue Nawab.\nThe pupal period lasts for about 10.5 to 11 days, and the pupa turns dark to reddish brown the night before eclosion. The white median band on the forewings also become visible through the pupal skin at this stage.\nThree views of a mature pupa of the Blue Nawab.\nEclosion takes place the next day. The pupal case first cracks open with the adult butterfly making its way out. It quickly turns around and perches on the underside of the pupal case to \"dry\" and expand its wings. A few hours later, the adult butterfly makes the first flight of its life.\nA newly eclosed Blue Nawab clinging on to its pupal case.\nA newly eclosed Blue Nawab.\n- [C&P4] The Butterflies of The Malay Peninsula, A.S.

The early stages comprise the egg, larva or caterpillar, and chrysalis or pupa. The process of development, or metamorphosis, takes several weeks unless the species over-winters in an immature phase. For example, Papilio machaon eggs hatch after about two weeks, the caterpillars feed for 30 days and may then pupate for as little as 14 days before emerging, or may remain as a pupa through the winter.\nAdult Papilionidae may survive for up to four months, but 20-30 days is more usual. Predation and parasitism of butterflies are high at all stages of development and only a small proportion will survive to adulthood. The eggs of many species, from the primitive Baronia brevicornis of Mexico to the Troides and Ornithoptera of New Guinea, are heavily attacked by minute parasitic (or, more correctly, parasitoid, as they kill their host) chalcid wasps (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea). Studies on a range of butterflies, including the British race of Papilio machaon in the Norfolk Broads, have indicated high predation of the first two larval instars by arthropods, particularly spiders. Later instars may be too big to be taken by arthropods but suffer heavy mortality by birds. Pupae are severely predated by small mammals.\nThe eggs of swallowtails are spherical, lack any sculpturing and in the birdwings may be up to 4mm in diameter, the largest butterfly eggs of all. Most species can lay several hundred eggs, but predators usually prevent such a potential from being realized. The genus Ornithoptera is again unusual in generally laying no more than 30 eggs per brood. Eggs are usually laid on the caterpillar’s foodplant, often on the underside of leaves where they are inconspicuous and shaded. After hatching, caterpillars immediately begin feeding and growing, passing through five moults before the quiescent pupal stage.\nThe caterpillars of Papilionidae may have fleshy spines or tubercles but they are never hairy and always have a curious structure called an osmeterium. This is a forked scent gland which the larva can extrude through a slit in the thorax when it is disturbed or attacked. The gland secretes a powerful-smelling liquid which consists, in the species studied so far, of two aliphatic acids (isobutyric and 2-methyl butyric acids). When attacked, the larva tries to wipe the gland against its attacker, a procedure that is certainly successful against ants and may deter not only other predators, but also parasites. Mature caterpillars are green in Baronia and the Leptocircini, black spotted with red or yellow in the Parnassiinae and Troidini, and variable in the Papilionini. Some caterpillars, like those of Papilio polymnestor, present a curious ‘eyed’ appearance and may adopt a threat posture as a deterrent to would-be predators. Others, such as Papilio clytia, mimic the appearance of distasteful species in the caterpillar as well as the adult. Species that feed on Aristolochiaceae and other poisonous plants are all believed to store the poison and themselves become poisonous. This fact may be advertised in a gaudy range of patterns and hues that acts as a reminder to predators, particularly birds.\nMany swallowtail larvae change their patterns between instars. Papilio machaon, for example, resembles a black bird dropping in its first two instars (see immediately above), but thereafter becomes conspicuous in a bright pattern of black, orange and green (top of the page). It is fairly commonplace for the final instar larva to leave the foodplant before pupating. For example, the caterpillar of Ornithoptera paradisea leaves its foodplant, Aristolochia, the Dutchman’s pipe vine, and pupates about 1 metre above the ground on shrubs and trees.\nThe pupae of Papilionidae are generally brown, sometimes green, with prominent keels or tubercles in the Troidini and a single dorsal protuberance in the Leptocircini. A characteristic of the Papilionidae is that the fully grown larva spins a silk tail pad and girdle prior to pupation. The chrysalis is thus suspended at an angle from its substrate, often resembling a broken twig. An exception is the genus Parnassius, whose caterpillar spins a fine silken web and pupates among leaves near the ground.\nAdult swallowtails have a number of distinctive characteristics, apart from the tails already described. In the mouthparts the palps are small, the proboscis well- developed. Adults frequently take nectar from flowers whilst still in flight, the fluttering stance being quite distinctive. All six legs are fully developed and fit for walking (unlike the Nymphalidae), and have a spur-like projection on the tibia of each foreleg. The cell is closed on both the fore- and hindwings and only a single anal vein is present on the hindwing (except in Baronia). In the males of some genera (e.g. Parides, Atrophaneura) the anal margin of the hindwing is folded over and contains scent brushes used in courtship and mating.\nIn the majority of swallowtails, the sexes are broadly similar in appearance. Nevertheless, there are many species that are sexually dimorphic, often, but not invariably, as a result of mimicry. The males and females of birdwings are very different but are not known to be mimetic except in the case of the female Ornithoptera croesus lydius. Females of other swallowtails are often slightly larger and less colourful than males, as in the birdwings, but again this is not always so. For example, the female Papilio antimachus is smaller than the male. Females are generally more retiring in their habits and in forests females often keep to the tree-tops while males congregate at drinking spots or fly rapidly along rides and streams. Males may be highly aggressive, jostling and fighting each other for a spot on a hilltop or defending their territory along a stretch of river.\nIn some species, such as Graphium idaeoides, Papilio agestor and P. slateri, both sexes are mimics. In others, such as Papilio jordani and P. phorbanta, only the female is a mimic and extreme sexual dimorphism is apparent. A further variation is seen in Eurytides euryleon, a dimorphic species in which each sex appears to mimic the same sex of the dimorphic model, Parides iphidamas phalias.\nMimicry is a form of protection against predators and is a widespread phenomenon amongst butterflies. In classical definitions, it consists either of a palatable mimic species gaining protection from predators by resembling a distasteful and unpalatable model (Batesian mimicry), or of a number of distasteful models joining a mimetic ring in which each gains protection from the other (Mullerian mimicry). Recent research has shown this to be an over-simplification and many new variations and interactions are now recognized.\nModels are generally unpalatable species from the Danainae, Heliconiinae, Acraeinae or Aristolochia– feeding Papilionidae, but other groups may also be used. Papilio laglaizei is unusual in being a mimic of a day-flying moth, Alcidis agarthyrsus (Uraniidae).\nIn numerous species the females (and less often the males, Papilio paradoxa is an example) are polymorphic, i.e. they occur in a number of different forms. The African Mocker swallowtail, Papilio dardanus, is yellow and tailed in the male but the female is extremely variable and may appear mainly white, yellow or orange, often tail-less. The females mimic a variety of distasteful model species.\nAdapted, with permission, from Threatened Swallowtail Butterflies of the World: the IUCN Red Data Book by N.M. Collins & M.G. Morris.

{"question":"What are the key focus areas of C&E's environmental work in Vietnam, and how does this relate to global challenges facing forest-dependent communities?","answer":"C&E focuses on four main areas: research on socio-environmental impacts, local intervention projects for sustainable resource management, capacity building for communities through training and workshops, and policy advocacy for environmental protection. They emphasize local participation, believing that local stakeholders are best positioned to solve local problems. This work addresses broader global challenges faced by forest-dependent communities, as unsustainable activities like logging, mining, cattle ranching, and industrial plantations, coupled with deforestation and land grabbing, threaten forest peoples' access to and use of forests worldwide. Poor governance of land and natural resources, especially since the 2007/2008 food/finance/fuel crisis, has intensified pressure on forests and their inhabitants. The World Bank estimates that 90% of the 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty depend substantially on forests for their livelihoods.","context":["Center for Development of Community Initiative and Environment (C&E) is a Vietnamese not-for-profit and non-governmental organisation established in 2008. C&E works to promote participation and improve capacity of local community groups and organisations for better solutions to environmental issues that are related to their life, contributing to the development of civil society and sustainable environment in Vietnam. C&E has a network of community groups all around Vietnam including young volunteers and civil society groups who work on sustainable development field.\nAt the moment, C&E is working on many projects related to Sustainable Development such as: “Education for Sustainable Development” , “Youth Action on Sustainable Lifestyles” and “Capacity Building for Community”.\nC&E envisages the future of Vietnam in which grassroots communities and organizations actively participate in solutions to environmental problems, sustainable use of natural resources, and maintenance of sustainable life of themselves.\nLocal participation – of local communities and government – is highlighted in C&E works. We believe that no one know and solves local problems as good as the local stakeholders do.\nC&E embraces the mission to support local communities, community-based organizations, and civil society organizations in formulation and implementation of locally sustainable initiatives to protect the environment, natural resources management, and promote sustainable development.\nTarget beneficiaries: local communities, community-based organisations, and civil society organisations\nYoung people are the most important target beneficiary of C&E. Young people today constitute an important group within our consumer societies, and the habit they develop now will play a decisive role in future consumption patterns. Their decisions as consumers exercise a growing influence on markets and lifestyles. Therefore, they deserve special attention in efforts to change wasteful consumption patterns into ones that are more attuned to sustainable development.\nEthnic minority groups are the main target beneficiary of C&E. In Vietnam ethnic minority groups account for 13 percentage of the country population, however making 60 percentage of the country poor population (UNDP, WB). Natural resources play a vital role in most of the ethnic groups’ livelihood and culture (shifting cultivation, collecting forestry products… However, most of the current state policies / programs relating to forestry management ignore or exclude the traditional characteristics, hindering the development of the ethnic group. C&E promote a participatory & culturally appropriate management of natural resources balancing environmental interests and indigenous groups’ traditional livelihood, then culture.\nDisadvantaged women is the another group that C&E include in its works. For that reason, gender is mainstreamed in most of C&E projects.\n- C&E AREAS OF FOCUS\nResearch: conducting quality research on socio-environmental impacts on local communities such as impact of climate change, sustainable consumption and production, socio-environmental impact of land acquisition for industrial zone construction and public purposes, community participation in management and effective use of natural resources….\nIntervention: C&E design and translate local initiatives into intervention projects for sustainable management of natural resources. We promote local communities in initiating and implementing intervention activities. That is because we trust that no one know and solve best the local problems as directly related local communities do\nCapacity building for the community and civil society organizations in the form of training, workshop, dialogue, and forum on emerging issues which are related to environmental protection and effective use of natural resources. This is to enable the community and civil society organizations to participate effectively in development activities and decision-making process at localities.\nPolicy advocacy to strengthen public voice on specific issues which are related to environmental monitoring and detecting violations of environmental legislation, to comment on policy and plan of environment issues and sustainable development, and to advocate policy and decision-making process.\nNetworking and partnership to enhance linkage which serves to maintain and connect environmental initiatives of community and civil society organisations (CSO) nationwide.\n- C&E HUMAN RESOURCE\nOur team includes members as follow\n|No.||Name||Qualification & Experience||Position||Employment status|\n|1||MSc.

With the support of RLS, C&E held a successful workshop on “People right-based natural forest management” in Thua Thien Hue on 20-21 August, 2010. The conference attracted 67 participants who come from diverse organisations, local communities and authority throughout the country. Since the beginning of 2011 C&E has become the official partner of RLS. As a result, RLS assisted C&E in conducting a project titled “Community-Based Forest Management Capacity Building In Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam: The Right-Based Approach” in 2011. With supported from RLS, currently C&E is conducting a project titled “Sustainable management of natural forest through raising awareness and building capacity to improve the rights and legal status of ethnic minority communities to natural forest in central Vietnam” phase 1 (2012-2014) and phase 2 (2015-2017). Simultaneously, other Project with supported from RLS on “Partnership to support and promote informal and non-formal education for Advocating an eco-lifestyle and climate change adaptation and mitigation in Vietnamese Universities” 2015-2017.\n- Sida – Swedish Embassy in Hanoi: As mentioned in the introduction, C&E was founded by members of the Vietnamese Advisory Group of the Sida Environmental Fund which was established by the Swedish Embassy in Hanoi. The members of Advisory Group helped Sida to manage about 300 small projects nationwide between 1997-2008 in order to promoting and supporting community initiatives in environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources. In the phasing out of Sida in Vietnam 2009-2013, three non-governmental organizations including two NGOs of Vietnam – C&E and the Action Centre for City Development (ACCD) and the Global Action Plan Sweden are joining in a partnership cooperation to introduce EcoTeam in schools and to promote environmental sustainable way of living for households in Vietnam. To facilitate this cooperation, the Embassy of Sweden in Hanoi supported these NGOs the Project on Community Action for Climate Change through partner-driven cooperation for the period of 2010 – 2015.\n- SGS – Group Management Ltd, Switzerland and Vietnam – A company with extensive inspection, verification, testing and certification experience globally:\nAt the end of 2008 C&E started working on Global survey on sustainable lifestyle (GSSL) – a joint initiative of the UNEP and Task force on sustainable lifestyle led by Sweden as an NGO partner. The survey was carried out in Vietnam successfully with more than 500 feedback questionnaires from Vietnamese young adults to share their ways of living and their vision for the future with friends from all over the world and different cultures. GSSL-Vietnam has pointed to the fact that Vietnamese youth are eager for sustainable change and are taking initiatives for that purpose. It is essential that proper and timely support be provided to them to facilitate their actions. For next step, C&E has developed a strategy plan (2010-2012) to use the YouthXchange (YXC) toolkit on Sustainable Lifestyles of UNEP and UNESCO by translating YXC toolkit into Vietnamese and delivering capacity-building trainings and communication campaigns in Vietnam in order to promotion of a responsible consumption and sustainable lifestyles movement in Vietnam. In 2010, C&E engaged in the project “Capacity Building Workshops on Sustainable Lifestyles” which was coordinated by UNEP and supported by SGS – Group Management Ltd in Geneva, Switzerland. The project intends to focus on capacity-building for sustainable lifestyles among youth in higher education institutions, students, networks, educators, teachers and professor in Vietnam and the Philippines. With the generous support from SGS-Geneva and SGS-Vietnam and other partners, C&E facilitated and networked young people, youth groups and students across Vietnam for sustainable lifestyle, behavior change and climate awareness and action. With great energy and creativity, C&E staff built and shared a number of learning and action products and processes engaging government organizations, business and NGOs in initial steps to introduce sustainable lifestyles to people in Vietnam. Based on the results, SGS – Geneva continued support for C&E project titled “YOUTH EXCHANGE IN VIETNAM: advocating and promoting sustainable consumption and lifestyles among Vietnamese youth” for the year 2011-2012.\n- Department of Science, Education, Natural Resources and Environment under Ministry of Planning and Investment/UNDP Vietnam co-supported with SGS (Switzerland) for the project “Capacity Building Workshops on Sustainable Lifestyles” 2010 and “YOUTH EXCHANGE IN VIETNAM: advocating and promoting sustainable consumption and lifestyles among Vietnamese youth” for the year 2011-2015.\nBesides, we provide our consultancy services to many other International NGOs / development projects in Vietnam.\n- SUMMARY OF “C&E” PROJECTS/ ACTIVITIES\n- Project on “Sustainable management of natural forest through raising awareness and building capacity to improve the rights and legal status of ethnic minority communities to natural forest in central Vietnam”.

Abundant in biodiversity, crucial in the ecological services they provide to the planet and its living inhabitants, forests are also attractive in terms of economic potential and natural resources. However, the persistent and widespread degradation of these vital areas poses a direct threat to the rural communities and indigenous peoples who have inhabited and depended on them directly and primarily for centuries.\nForest peoples have, over the centuries, elaborated and practised livelihood systems derived from their natural environment and anchored in traditional knowledge, practices and beliefs. Forest peoples depend primarily and directly on the forest both for subsistence and trade in the form of fishing, hunting, shifting agriculture, the gathering of wild forest products and other activities.\nA large number of forest peoples (but by no means all) self-identify as indigenous peoples. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2007, articulates the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of indigenous peoples, who have the right to participate in decision-making and to give or withhold their consent to any project that may affect the lands, territories and resources they customarily own, occupy or otherwise use.\nUnsustainable activities — such as logging, mining, cattle ranching and industrial plantations (notably of oil palm and soya) — coupled with rampant deforestation and ill-regulated land acquisition (‘land grabbing’) threaten the access to and use of the forest by its customary users. Poor governance of land and natural resources coupled with a dramatic rush since the food/finance/fuel crisis of 2007/2008 to control and invest in land for the production of food and bio-fuel crops are further exacerbating these existing pressures on forests and their inhabitants.\nForest peoples in numbers\nThe question remains: how many people around the globe can be considered forest peoples and what is their geographical distribution? Despite a considerable amount of material produced on forest-dependent communities and sustained international advocacy for the protection and recognition of their legal and human rights there is a significant gap in the literature on this important aspect. Statistics available on forest people numbers are more or less educated ‘guesstimates’ and there are no reliable regional or international sources of data on forest dependent people.\nIn seeking to address this critical gap, Forest Peoples Programme — a UK-based NGO that works directly with forest peoples in South America, Africa, and Asia to help them secure their rights — has published a landmark report “Forest Peoples: Numbers Across the World” that, for the first time, provides estimated figures for indigenous and forest peoples’ populations across continents and in around 100 countries across the globe. Whilst the figures cited are by no means conclusive or authoritative, they serve to raise awareness about the peoples who primarily depend on forests for their livelihoods and to enhance their visibility as key actors and rights-holders in the management and use of forests and forest resources.\nGlobal estimates of forest peoples range from 250 million to over 1 billion, depending on how they are defined. The World Bank estimates that 1.6 billion rural people are dependent upon forests to some extent. World Bank sources also state that around 90% of the 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty depend substantially on forests for their livelihoods.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organisation maintains that around 300 to 350 million people are highly dependent on forests and live within or adjacent to dense forests. Estimates for the global population of indigenous peoples range from 300 to 500 million across some ninety countries worldwide, representing around 5% of the world’s population.\nThe report by Forest Peoples Programme concludes that there are approximately 500 to 560 million indigenous people in the world, while forest peoples make up some 1.3 to 1.4 billion. The lack of available up-to-date data on both these populations suggests that both these figures remain conservative and may in fact be much higher.\nIndigenous peoples are estimated to number around 6 million in North America and the Arctic, while forest peoples are estimated to number around 260,000. In Central and South America, the figures for indigenous peoples and forest peoples are around 45 million and 24 million respectively. In Africa and the Middle East, indigenous peoples are estimated to number around 98 million and forest people around 213 million. Asia and the Pacific represent the largest populations of both indigenous and forest peoples, with estimates of 358 million and 1.1 billion respectively.\nA major finding of the report is that there is a serious lack of accurate and up-to-date data, and that identifying and quantifying on indigenous peoples and forest peoples is a highly complex and politically sensitive issue. Identifying what land counts as forest in the first place is far from straightforward. There exist over 1,500 documented definitions of forests across the world and these derive from the international community, national definitions, and state, provincial or local definitions.\nFor customary forest dwellers, forests also have a customary and spiritual meaning as a source of livelihood, cultural significance and individual and collective identification. This means that rights and claims to forestland by customary forest dwellers can be subject to interpretation depending on how forests are defined. Forestry laws and jurisdiction often deny local people any rights of residence, ownership and even use of forests or subject them to complicated regulations that impede their access and make them vulnerable to manipulation.\nFurthermore, available estimates for populations of indigenous peoples tend to vary widely. There is a universal definition for ‘indigenous peoples’, although important factors identified include priority in time in the use and occupation of a specific territory; voluntary perpetuation of cultural distinctiveness; self-identification as a distinct collectivity and an experience of subjugation, exclusion or discrimination, whether or not these conditions persist.\nIn some cases, states do not recognise the category of ‘indigenous peoples’ in their national constitutions or legislation. In others, ‘indigenous peoples’ may be applied restrictively to certain groups and not others, who may also have reason to self-identify according to the elements above. Government statistics do not always differentiate peoples by ethnicity, and where indigenous peoples lack citizenship or inhabit remote and inaccessible regions, they may not be represented in censuses at all. At the same time, certain indigenous peoples (choose to) remain uncontacted, such as certain communities in the Amazon Basin.\nEstimates for forest people numbers reflect an even greater variability, depending on the perceived nature and degree of dependency on forests and the proximity of different communities to forests. Some figures represent forest-dwelling populations, which may include non-indigenous populations who have settled on forest land for several generations, and on this basis, also lay claim to forest lands. Estimates may also include employees of the forestry, conservation or agro-industry sectors who have moved into forested areas for paid work. Traditionally, forest-dwelling communities may have been forcefully displaced or evicted from their customary lands.\nForest peoples may refer to people who depend in one way or another on specific forest resources, such as fuel wood, for example. In many cases, these important distinctions are not made clear in available estimates. In light of these definitional challenges, the report draws from a wide variety of sources, including publications from various UN bodies (FAO, ILO, UNEP, ECOSOC), national governments, national and local non-governmental organisations/indigenous peoples’ organisations, human rights and environmental institutions, and regional human rights bodies. In order to demonstrate how widely figures can vary from source to source, the overall numbers of indigenous and forest people provided in the report are presented as means, with reference to upper-bound and lower-bound totals as well.\nThe protection of forest peoples’ rightsForest-dependent people in many countries of the global South do not enjoy secure tenure over their customary forests. Their rights to these forests and the natural resources therein are frequently inadequately addressed or protected under existing national legislation. As a result, their forests are vulnerable to private investors and government-led development initiatives, and their capacity to defend and sustain their forests and customary livelihoods in the face of corporate and State interests is seriously compromised. Even seemingly positive land use changes, such as the conversion of forests to national parks or designated conservation areas, can lead to local communities being forcibly evicted or severely restricted in their traditional forest activities.To make up for the failure of governance in applying international human rights norms and respecting indigenous and forest peoples’ rights, there has been a proliferation of standard-setting in the private sector suggesting how these norms should be respected by investors through voluntary certification schemes requiring third-party verification. Such standards have now been developed for forestry (Forest Stewardship Council), palm oil ( Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil), soy ( Roundtable on Responsible Soy), bio-fuels ( Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels) and carbon sequestration ( Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance).However, the main shortcoming of these voluntary schemes is that, being voluntary and business-led, they have not sought to build the capacity of national government agencies to protect the livelihoods of vulnerable communities with weakly recognised rights in land.A recent encouraging development at the international level is the creation of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security, approved by UN Member States on 9 March 2012 and endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security on 11 May 2012.The Voluntary Guidelines, as a form of ‘soft law’ (i.e., non binding), promote secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests as a means of eradicating hunger and poverty, supporting sustainable development and enhancing the environment.To conclude, the findings of “Forest Peoples: Numbers Across the World” confirm that “the lack of existing reliable information about forest-dependent peoples, their numbers, livelihoods and circumstances is itself a symptom of their marginalisation in forest policy making”. The report seeks to remedy this gap.Having a better idea of who forest peoples are and where they live raises awareness of the social dimension of forests and their intrinsic value to communities who have traditionally depended on them, and continue to do so to this day, and whose rights to the forest are being challenged by developments and land use changes carried out without their Free, Prior and Informed Consent.\nThis story has been published under a Creative Commons license.

{"question":"How do the principles of innovation diffusion theory relate to the algorithmic decision-making processes in modern technology, and what are the ethical concerns associated with both?","answer":"The diffusion of innovations theory and algorithmic decision-making are both concerned with adoption and social impact. According to diffusion theory, innovations are more likely to be adopted when they have lower social/economic costs, align with existing values, and are less complex. Similarly, algorithms have been widely adopted in various domains like retail, education, and law enforcement. However, both face ethical challenges. In diffusion theory, late adopters are often disadvantaged or marginalized individuals who lack resources and access to communication channels. Similarly, algorithmic systems can systematically disadvantage certain groups, as seen in cases where algorithms have led to discriminatory outcomes in employment, policing, and financial decisions. The key concern in both cases is the impact on social equity and the potential reinforcement of existing societal biases.","context":["Diffusion of innovations, model that attempts to describe how novel products, practices, or ideas are adopted by members of a social system. The theory of diffusion of innovations originated in the first half of the 20th century and was later popularized by American sociologist Everett M. Rogers in his book Diffusion of Innovations, first published in 1962.\nKey elements of the theory include the innovation, the communication processes and channels of communication, the passage of time, the potential adopters, and the social system, all of which influence whether or not an innovation with be taken up by a given group. The innovation (the product, practice, or idea) need not be a new invention but must be perceived as new by individuals or other units of adoption. Its characteristics, such as relative advantage, compatibility, malleability, and complexity, influence the likelihood that it will be adopted. Communication is essential for the diffusion and subsequent acceptance or rejection of an innovation, which can alter the structure and function of a social system. Change is measured by the numbers of people, groups, or institutions adopting the innovation over time. Consequently, the key variables of interest are time (earliness of knowing about innovation), rate (adoption of different innovations in a social system or within and among different social groups), and innovativeness (the degree to which groups or organizations adopt new ideas). Analyses can establish the flow of influence, offer charts of the diffusion curve, develop mathematical models of the diffusion process, and test out contributions of key elements and characteristics.\nDevelopment of the theory\nThe diffusion model developed through an interest in social transformation and explorations of the consequences of the development, spread, and adoption or rejection of new products, activities, and ideas. For example, anthropologists studied the introduction of the horse within and among indigenous populations of North America, the spread and modification of dance ceremonies among Native American groups, and the spread of corn (maize) cultivation from America to Europe. Early sociological studies included the examination of social and legal trends, such as the influence of a city on surrounding areas, the diffusion of governing practices, and the use and consequences of technology. Rural sociologists focused on the spread of new ideas among farmers and subsequent changes in agricultural practices.\nLessons learned from diffusion studies in anthropology, sociology, education, folklore, communication, marketing, economics, and public health have helped contemporary scholars and practitioners transform the diffusion of innovation model from a descriptive model into a proscriptive one. Today, diffusion theory commonly is used as an analytic framework for understanding and measuring social change and, in practical application, to guide the design and evaluation of products, programs, and communication strategies.\nCharacteristics of innovations\nInnovations that are perceived to be of lower social or economic costs, that provide a good fit with values and current practices, and that are of low complexity are more likely to be adopted than those carrying high costs, representing a variance with common values, and appearing to be difficult to understand, to communicate, or to use. Those innovations flexible enough to withstand some change to provide a better fit with prevailing practices and cultures hold more appeal. This flexibility, sometimes labeled a reinvention, involves change in some of the characteristics of the innovation to increase compatibility of the innovation with the existing social system. It is also of importance whether or not potential users can observe as well as try the innovation without undue sacrifice or commitment.\nThe role of communication and time\nCommunication channels and the agents of change affect the diffusion process as well. Communication channels include face-to-face communication and mass communication, while agents of change are those individuals who bring innovations to members of a social system. Agents of change may be members of the community or individuals outside the social structure of the community. Diffusion analysis must consider who talks to whom, who is considered influential and trustworthy, and who has easy access to or is barred from various communication channels. Characteristics of the potential adopters are of critical concern. Overall, factors such as socioeconomic status, culture, gender, race, age, cultural norms, religion, education, social support, and family ties all influence access to and perceptions of the innovation.\nA vital aspect of the diffusion model, and one closely linked to an analysis of adopters, is the consideration of time. The population is often divided into groups based on the time it takes for people to adopt the innovation. The groups are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and late adopters. Innovators, for example, are often viewed as creative but marginal individuals. Early adopters, close to sources of communication, are often highly integrated into the social system. They often carry a high degree of opinion leadership, are respected by their peers, and serve as role models for others. It is only when these respected members of a community consider, discuss, and adopt the innovation that wide diffusion takes place. Those in the early majority generally interact frequently with peers and are exposed to various sources of information. Those in the late majority are people who are further removed from key communication channels or who remain skeptical and adopt only after pressure from their peers or out of economic necessity.\nIn older articulations of the model, those who are introduced to the innovation late and who adopt late were called laggards. Often, people who fall into this category are distant, disadvantaged, or marginalized. These members of the population are often further removed from key channels of communication than are those who are able to learn about and adopt the innovation early. They are also more likely to lack resources, including time and money, to take chances. Often, they are socially isolated.\nSocial systems and consequences of adoption\nDiffusion occurs within a social system. The analysis of the diffusion process considers the members or units of a social system, including individuals, groups, organizations, or subsystems. The social system includes structural, political, economic, as well as geographic characteristics. The structure may be considered the patterned arrangements of the various units, such as the formal hierarchical structure of a bureaucratic organization with formal laws and rules. Norms may be just as powerful in other, less formal groups. Social factors also consider how decisions are made and whether or not people have an array of options or, at minimum, the freedom to adopt or reject the proposed innovation. Decisions may be individually based, be communal (arrived at through consensus), or be mandated (made through the imposition of authority). Those designing public health safety programs, for example, see initial strong adoption of practices such as seat belt use with the passage of laws (an authority-based decision) but diminished use when consensus is not considered and if enforcement is lacking. In general, the structure of a social system can facilitate or impede diffusion of innovations and thereby influence the rate of adoption of the innovation over time.\nIn the last stage of diffusion studies, consequences of innovations are documented and analyzed. Three classifications of consequences are often considered: direct or indirect consequences, anticipated versus unanticipated consequences, and desirable or undesirable consequences.","When you browse online for a new pair of shoes, pick a movie to stream on Netflix or apply for a car loan, an algorithm likely has its word to say on the outcome.\nThe complex mathematical formulas are playing a growing role in all walks of life: from detecting skin cancers to suggesting new Facebook friends, deciding who gets a job, how police resources are deployed, who gets insurance at what cost, or who is on a “no fly” list.\nAlgorithms are being used—experimentally—to write news articles from raw data, while Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was helped by behavioral marketers who used an algorithm to locate the highest concentrations of “persuadable voters.” But while such automated tools can inject a measure of objectivity into erstwhile subjective decisions, fears are rising over the lack of transparency algorithms can entail, with pressure growing to apply standards of ethics or “accountability.”\nData scientist Cathy O’Neil cautions about “blindly trusting” formulas to determine a fair outcome. “Algorithms are not inherently fair, because the person who builds the model defines success,” she said.\nO’Neil argues that while some algorithms may be helpful, others can be nefarious. In her 2016 book, Weapons of Math Destruction, she cites some troubling examples in the United States:\nPublic schools in Washington, D.C. in 2010 fired more than 200 teachers—including several well-respected instructors—based on scores in an algorithmic formula which evaluated performance.\nA man diagnosed with bipolar disorder was rejected for employment at seven major retailers after a third-party “personality” test deemed him a high risk based on its algorithmic classification.\nMany jurisdictions are using “predictive policing” to shift resources to likely “hot spots.” O’Neill says that depending on how data is fed into the system, this could lead to discovery of more minor crimes and a “feedback loop” which stigmatizes poor communities.\nSome courts rely on computer-ranked formulas to determine jail sentences and parole, which may discriminate against minorities by taking into account “risk” factors such as their neighborhoods and friend or family links to crime.\nIn the world of finance, brokers “scrape” data from online and other sources in new ways to make decisions on credit or insurance. This too often amplifies prejudice against the disadvantaged, O’Neil argues.\nHer findings were echoed in a White House report last year warning that algorithmic systems “are not infallible—they rely on the imperfect inputs, logic, probability, and people who design them.”\nThe report noted that data systems can ideally help weed out human bias but warned against algorithms “systematically disadvantaging certain groups.”\nZeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies technology and society, said automated decisions are often based on data collected about people, sometimes without their knowledge. “These computational systems can infer all sorts of things about you from your digital crumbs,” Tufekci said in a recent TED lecture. “They can infer your sexual orientation, your personality traits, your political leanings. They have predictive power with high levels of accuracy.”\nSuch insights may be useful in certain contexts—such as helping medical professionals diagnose postpartum depression—but unfair in others, she said. Part of the problem, she said, stems from asking computers to answer questions that have no single right answer. “They are subjective, open-ended and value-laden questions, asking who should the company hire, which update from which friend should you be shown, which convict is more likely to reoffend.”\nFrank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor and author of The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, shares the same concerns. He suggests one way to remedy unfair effects may be to enforce existing laws on consumer protection or deceptive practices.\nPasquale points at the European Union’s data protection law, set from next year to create a “right of explanation” when consumers are impacted by an algorithmic decision, as a model that could be expanded. This would “either force transparency or it will stop algorithms from being used in certain contexts,” he said.\nAlethea Lange, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said the E.U. plan “sounds good” but “is really burdensome” and risked proving unworkable in practice. She believes education and discussion may be more important than enforcement in developing fairer algorithms.\nLange said her organization worked with Facebook, for example, to modify a much-criticized formula that allowed advertisers to use “ethnic affinity” in their targeting.\nOthers meanwhile caution that algorithms should not be made a scapegoat for societal ills. “People get angry and they are looking for something to blame,” said Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We are concerned about bias, accountability and ethical decisions but those exist whether you are using algorithms or not.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f613ea5f-9590-4de2-959b-a671f4d5da92>","<urn:uuid:6ac4c8f9-4485-43b7-b764-b48a249516fb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the difference between mixed metaphors and regular metaphors in writing?","answer":"Regular metaphors create an implied comparison between things that share traits, without using 'like' or 'as'. For example, saying 'life is the fallen branch moved along by the river' creates a figurative association. Mixed metaphors, on the other hand, combine two or more incompatible images that become nonsensical, like using both subterranean peril and hanging danger in the same sentence. Writers should avoid mixed metaphors as they interfere with reading comprehension and weaken the clarity of comparisons. Instead, metaphors should be consistent in imagery or one should be sacrificed for another.","context":["3 Cases of Mixed Metaphors\nEfforts to describe something idiomatically with the use of metaphor—a word or phrase that figuratively provides an analogy—more than once in a sentence will likely distractingly interfere with reading comprehension, so avoid using more than one metaphor in a sentence, or at least ensure that they are complementary. Discussions after each example in this post explain the difficulty of using two metaphors, and revisions suggest a solution.\n1. What you hear symbolizes something ominous—impending danger lurking just beneath the surface, which has been hanging over our heads in recent years.\nThe metaphors in this sentence come at the reader from both directions, with an allusion to subterranean peril and an indirect reference to the anecdote of the sword of Damocles, in which a king suspends a sword over a courtier’s head by a single hair to teach the man a lesson about the peril of being in a position of power. To avoid this discordance, the metaphors should be consistent in imagery: “What you hear symbolizes something ominous—impending danger lurking just beneath the surface, which has percolating in recent years.” (Percolating is also a metaphor, but such one-word analogies embedded in our language do not distract as easily as more vivid imagery, and the verb is concordant with the preceding metaphor.)\n2. These actions resulted in a significant redirection of market focus and gave the firms a ringside seat when the proverbial music stopped.\n“A ringside seat” refers to achieving a privileged position (literally, a front-row seat at a boxing match), and the phrase about music alludes to surviving a round of the game of musical chairs, in which competitors circle a group of chairs that numbers one less than the number of participants and vie to obtain a seat when music that is briefly played suddenly ceases, causing one person to be disqualified in each round. Although both metaphors deal, in a sense, with attainment of privilege, the contexts are different, and one is best abandoned in favor of the other: “These actions resulted in a significant redirection of market focus and gave the firms a ringside seat when that shift occurred.”\n3. The same division within the party that derailed healthcare reform could also rear its head with respect to tax reform.\nThe reference to figurative derailment is at odds with the clichéd metaphor of a threatening creature preparing to strike. Again, sacrifice one metaphor for another (preferably, replacing the cliché with a straightforward verb): “The same division within the party that derailed healthcare reform could also occur with respect to tax reform.” (An attempt to match the derailment reference with another train-related metaphor will only call attention to the symmetry at the expense of the point of the sentence.)\nWant to improve your English in five minutes a day?

Sometimes their functions are confused or mistaken. In this discussion we’ll further explore what a metaphor means and how it can enhance our writing when properly used.\nWhat Does Metaphor Mean?\nBefore we focus on the meaning and function of a metaphor, let’s first establish its difference from a simile. Both similes and metaphors help to further understanding and expand imagination concerning thoughts and ideas. They achieve this by creating figurative rather than literal associations.\nA simile directly compares one thing and another, mostly commonly by linking them with the word like or as. For example, a popular line in the movie Forrest Gump was “My momma always said life was like a box of chocolates; you never know what you’re going to get.” The comparison between life and a box of chocolates is direct and immediate.\nBy definition, a metaphor is an expression of nonliteral resemblance in a way that is implied rather than stated, as it is in a simile. In making its comparative relation, the metaphor will have a primary, concrete term or concept and a secondary one to provide figurative depth and clarity. Unlike a simile, a metaphor will not compare things by using the words like or as.\nBecause of the looser comparison it makes, a metaphor allows more room to evoke feeling and imagery. By creating a more-abstract association between things, it prompts the reader to think further about the logic and truth of the relation, which can heighten emotion or intellectual awareness concerning it.\nA metaphor states that one thing is another thing not because they are the same, but because they share traits. Returning to our Forrest Gump example, if a simile directly compares life to a box of chocolates, a metaphor might express life more suggestively in the following way:\nLife is the fallen branch moved along by the rush of the river, always pushed and turned and spun, sometimes gently, sometimes furiously, unsure of where it will land but certain to get there.\nThe same example could be stated as simply as life is the fallen branch moved along by the river. Clearly, the comparison in this model is neither direct nor exact.\nLet’s look at a few more examples of metaphorical expressions:\n|black sheep||angel in disguise||My desk is an industrial spill of paper.|\n|heart of stone||the elephant in the room||Her smile gives us light.|\n|music to my ears||They left us high and dry.||You are the peace in my storm.|\nAvoid Mixed Metaphor\nAs a good writer, you will want to avoid mixed metaphors, which combine two or more incompatible images that become nonsensical.\nIn other words, we don’t want to start by comparing life to a fallen branch and end the comparison with an aluminum can.\nLife is the fallen branch moved along by the river, pushed and turned and spun, a soda can on its wandering way to the recycling plant.\nWe have now created two unrelated metaphors to illustrate the primary concept, thereby sapping the strength and clarity of the comparison.\nSimilarly, we would refrain from mixed-metaphor mash-ups such as:\nA pillar of courage, he will blaze a trail of glory through fields of gold where diamonds might be found among the coal.\nBy understanding what a metaphor means, how it functions, and what it can achieve when used with taste and restraint, we can make our writing even richer with eloquence.\nSimiles and Metaphors\nNow that you’re more familiar with what a metaphor means, identify if each expression includes a metaphor or not.\n1. I think Robby is turning into a couch potato.\n2. That bodybuilder might as well be made of steel.\n3. That shirt is as American as apple pie and baseball.\n4.

{"question":"How do the three systems of Hebrew vocalization differ in their notation methods?","answer":"The three systems use different notation methods: The Babylonian system primarily uses small Hebrew letters (like a small ו for the vowel /u/). The Palestinian system employs dots and strokes positioned mostly above the line, with vowel signs consisting of two or three dots or strokes. The Tiberian system, which achieved the greatest uniformity and perfection, features both supra-linear signs for most disjunctive accents and an innovative infra-linear system for vowel signs and conjunctive accent signs.","context":["There are three known systems of Hebrew vocalization: the Tiberian, Babylonian, and Palestinian. Interestingly, while we have manuscripts which reflect stages of development in the Babylonian and Palestinian systems, there is no such history for the Tiberian system. At the same time, the Tiberian system achieves a level of uniformity and perfection that far surpasses the other two. In this article, Dotan addresses the question of whether the Tiberian system was invented as a complete system, or whether it was the result of a process of evolution.\nSince Wickes’ study, the standard view has been that the vowels and accents were introduced in the 6th or 7th century CE. The points do not seem to have existed before the sealing of the Babylonian Talmud c500 CE, and Jerome mentions that the Jews of his day had no notation for vowels. At the other end, we know of two Masoretes who deal with reading the points from the end of the 8th and early 9th centuries, Pinḥas Rosh HaYeshiva and Asher ben Neḥemiah. Also, Moses ben Asher, from the second half of the 9th century, does not seem to be aware of the origin of the points which implies that they were already rather old.\nDotan suggests that the systems of accentuation and vocalization were originally different systems and that the accent signs preceded the vowel signs. In the Babylonian system, most of the signs are based on small Hebrew letters. For instance, a little ז corresponds to the accent זקף, while a small ו represents the vowel /u/. However, the sign corresponding to דגש, in the Babylonian system דיגשא, is not a small ד, but a small ז. The ד is instead used for the accent דחי, suggesting that the accents were established before the vowel points. There is similar evidence in the Palestinian system which uses dots and strokes, mostly above the line. The vowel signs all consist of two or three dots or strokes, while most of the accent signs are a single dot in various positions around the word again suggesting that the accents were developed first. Further, the earliest Palestinian Bible manuscripts contain mostly accents, with only an occasional vowel sign.\nIt seems clear then that the accents preceded the vowels in the Babylonian and Palestinian systems. There may also be hints of the same in the Tiberian system. Most of the Tiberian disjunctive accents are supra-linear signs which seem to be a continuation of the Palestinian and Babylonian systems. The Tiberian innovation is the infra-linear system which was introduced with the vowel signs and the conjunctive accent signs (with the exception of קדמא). It stands to reason that in the oral transmission of the text, accents and pauses were harder to preserve than vowels; and therefore, accent signs would have been introduced before vowel signs.\nHowever, if accent signs were introduced before vowel signs, could it be that the it was the vowels which were introduced in the 6th or 7th century CE, but the accents were introduced earlier? Because it has been assumed that the vowels and accents were introduced at the same time, it seems that no one has investigated this question. In fact, both Jerome’s statements and the silence of the Talmuds are related to the נקודות, the vowel points. In fact, the Talmud refers several times to טעמים, the accents, but this was never taken to be written accents.\nIf indeed the accents are earlier, then Dotan suggests that the relationship between Hebrew and Syriac Masorah should be re-examined. It may not be the case that the Syriac signs are the earlier. Regardless, it is very likely that the Tiberian system was constructed gradually. Not only did the accents precede the vowels, but it seems that the accentuation system itself was developed in several phases."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5b7e56c0-b8a1-4968-a5af-54cd82f81b39>"],"error":null}

Taylor School of Architecture and Construction Science\nThe School, through its Department of Architecture and Department of Construction Science, follows the founding policy of Tuskegee University - \"Learning to do by doing.\" Although both departments originated in trade and vocational training, the present mission is to develop competent professionals capable of solving the complex problems of today and tomorrow. The mission of the School is to sustain the legacy of Booker T. Washington and the strategy of \"educating the hand and the mind together.\" The School offers two programs of study: a five-year Bachelor of Architecture program, and a four-year Bachelor of Science in Construction Science and Management.\nOne of the key features of the program at Tuskegee University is its relatively small size, which fosters a very personal and professional approach to professional training. The Department of Architecture has 10 full-time faculty members and an average enrollment of 150 students per year. The students hail from all geographical areas of the country, with the majority coming from the southeast. Alabama residents constitute approximately 25 percent of the total enrollment. Approximately 10 percent of the student body is foreign students and 32 is women. Tuskegee University is located in Tuskegee in east central Alabama. Interstate 85 provides convenient access. Tuskegee is a two-hour drive from both Atlanta and Birmingham and a 40-minute drive from the capital of the state, Montgomery. Architectural and environmental design in the region ranges from complex urban architecture to stately antebellum structures. Tuskegee University's campus is designated as a national historic park site, with three buildings that are historic landmarks. Tuskegee is a technical, scientific, and professional institution with an average enrollment of 3,500 students per year. Instruction is organized under five major units: College of Engineering, Architecture & Physical Sciences; College of Agricultural, Environmental & Natural Sciences; College of Business, Organization & Management; College of Liberal Arts/Education; and College of Veterinary Medicine, Nursing & Allied Health. The Department of Architecture is one of the seven departments in the College of Engineering, Architecture & Physical Sciences. The other departments are: aerospace science engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, physics and computer science. The Department of Architecture offers degrees in two disciplines: architecture and construction science and management (CSMT). The department's faculty possess expertise in a variety of disciplines, including architectural design, architectural practice, urban design, city and regional planning, civil engineering, construction management, and graphic design.\nThe five-year B.Arch. program offered at Tuskegee provides a broad architectural training focused on the practice of architecture. The program is a well-rounded liberal education integrated with professional studies. Students are also exposed to other areas of expertise that are related to the environmental design profession. This serves to provide an awareness of the influence that other disciplines have on the physical environment and of career options that may be pursued following receipt of the professional degree. Program Description The curriculum is organized as a five-year Bachelor of Architecture program, based on a 2+3 format. The first two years constitute pre-architecture, and the last three, professional program. Admission to the professional program is granted by the departmental admissions committee based on the successful completion of the pre-architecture program with minimum CGPAs (2.25 overall and 2.5 in architecture courses) and a portfolio review. Pre-Architecture Program (1st/2nd Years) The first year covers a study of visual design elements, color, texture, light, scale, etc., as well as a general examination of architecture and the built environment.Also included are the development of visual, graphic, and verbal communication skills, and mathematical understanding. The second year brings an introduction to problem-solving and decision-making techniques, procedures and factors, and a study of physical environmental (qualitative and quantitative) phenomena and their impact upon design. Visual, graphic, and verbal communication skill development are continued. Professional Program (3rd/4th/5th Years) In the third year, development of programming and design skills are stressed, together with an increased understanding of the interface between spatial-movement, structural/ mechanical, and site/landscape considerations in building design.Emphasis is given to a resolution of social, economic, and physical user needs. Influence(s) of architectural theory, history, and site/urban context in the building design process is introduced. In addition, quantitative structures and mechanical studies are included. The fourth year provides a more in-depth study of programming and the relating of the user social, economic, and physical needs with the other considerations in the architectural design process that include construction,materials, structures, HVAC, etc. There is a continuation of the examination of architectural theory, history, site/urban context etc. and their impact on architectural design and urban development. Elective study in general subjects is also provided. In the final fifth year, the students examine complex architectural problems in a semi-independent design studio. This studio allows the student to apply all knowledge gained from the preceding four years. In addition,each student completes a terminal project involving the research, programming, and design of an architectural project chosen by the student. The students also take courses in building economics, professional practice, construction, and management.\n- Art & Design\n- Building Technologies\n- Community Design\n- Cross-Cultural Contexts\n- Historic Preservation\n- Materials And Construction"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3b9a7fbb-7214-47df-b2c8-bd2077a6e67b>","<urn:uuid:f034cc88-54fb-430f-a165-305c5caac8ed>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does proper time physics compare to the standard model's explanation of the universe's origin?","answer":"The standard Big Bang model (SBB) proposes that the universe, including time, space and matter, originated from a single point about 13 billion years ago, with space expanding and carrying matter with it over time. In contrast, proper time physics (Euclidean relativity) provides an alternative geometric framework where proper time is treated as the fourth spatial dimension, using a circular geometry instead of the traditional hyperbolic framework. While the SBB model places the universe's center at t = 0 in time, proper time physics offers a different mathematical approach to understanding space-time relationships, though it doesn't directly contradict the basic expansion model. This alternative framework makes relativity more intuitive while maintaining consistency with traditional relativistic observations.","context":["The two well-known predictions about black holes today are two. Prima, from inside a black hole you cannot escape because the way out has gone back in time. Second, you can see the whole future of the universe because the time in the universe you left is now like space. Too bad you can't tell anyone.\nThe idea that we live inside a black hole is not as crazy as it seems. Black holes deform space and time until their roles are reversed. For anyone who falls into a black hole, the radial dimension, towards the singularity, becomes time and the temporal dimension becomes like space. The basic idea of the theory that the Big Bang is a black hole (Black Hole Big Bang Theory, or BHBBT) is that the matter of a mother universe collapses into a black hole. The singularity of this black hole is in a single point in space relative to anyone in the parent universe. But, due to the reversal of time and space for anyone within the child universe, that point in space r = 0 becomes their starting point in time, t = 0. So what was a singularity in space is now a singularity in time, just like the Big Bang.\nThis means that any matter that falls from the \"mother\" universe into a black hole will disappear from that universe and emerge at a completely confused starting point of the \"daughter\" universe.\nHow much matter from the \"mother\" universe would have ended up in the \"daughter\" universe? And how much can it finish? All too? Can one universe end up inside another? The reason an entire universe can be contained within another has to do with the strange way in which time and space can be warped, stretched, compressed and twisted. What appeared to be a dead center at the center of a black hole may instead be a step in the birth of a new universe.\nYou can have many universes interconnected in this way, where mothers give birth to daughters who give birth to other daughters, and so on to infinity. So far from being \"old\" only 13 billion years, the entire interconnected cosmos can be infinitely old.\nThe standard Big Bang model\nThe standard model of the universe's Big Bang (SBB) is that the universe, including time, space and matter, it was born in a single point about 13 billion years ago. From the standpoint of general relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity, space itself has been compressed at that point. As time went by, space began to expand taking matter with it as it went. This process would continue today and we know it because when we observe distant galaxies, they are moving away from us. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it moves away from us. This is consistent with a theory of the universe in which space is expanding. The greater the space between two points, the faster they can move apart. The standard example of this is a set of dots on a balloon. Blow up the balloon and all the dots move away.\nWhere is the center of the universe?\nThe center of the universe, where the Big Bang happened, is not for us in space, but at a point in time, t = 0, in the Big Bang. The balloon analogy is useful here because the center of the balloon is obviously not on the balloon. Space, therefore, is like the surface of the balloon with an additional dimension, so it is 3 dimensions instead of 2. The past is like the inside of the balloon.\nBlack holes, however, have their centers at a point in space, r = 0 in coordinates centered on the singularity of the black hole. Therefore, they are fundamentally different from the Big Bang singularity.\nSo how can we be inside a black hole? Time becomes space\nOne of the strange characteristics of general relativity is its ability to bend space and time to the point where time and space can swap roles. Intense concentrations of matter can warp space and time so that it changes the meaning of space and time for different observers. For an observer outside a black hole, called a distant observer, the singularity is at a point in space. For the observer within the event horizon, however, the singularity is at some point in the time, some time in the future.\nThe theory that the Big Bang is a black hole, BHBBT, suggests that at least for some types of singularities, once it reaches matter, it enters a new universe where time at singularity is the starting point of that universe.\nImagine you are an ant crawling on a table. As you crawl, go down a slope. The slope gets steeper and steeper until it becomes completely vertical. Suddenly, it ends at a point. This is typical of how black holes are depicted. But now, instead of ending up at that point, beyond this point the space expands again. Passing through that single point you re-emerge in an expanding cone: a new universe perpendicular to the one you left behind.\nA black hole as the origin of the universe\nBHBBT is a compelling theory that can be rigorously formulated within the limits of Einstein's theory of general relativity. It does not require new physics. It also explains why the Big Bang happened. And on a philosophical and anthropic principle level, he reassuringly explains that we were not born \"from nothing\", but were generated by something else, and perhaps we are in a certain sense infinite.\nSmolin, Lee. \"Did the universe evolve ?.\" Classical and Quantum Gravity 9.1 (1992): 173.\nStuckey, WM \"The observable universe inside a black hole.\" American Journal of Physics 62.9 (1994): 788-795.\nEasson, Damien A., and Robert H.

'proper time physics' or 'proper time geometry')\nRelativity theory traditionally uses the Minkowski hyperbolic framework. Euclidean relativity proposes a circular geometry as alternative that uses proper time\nas the fourth spatial dimension. Other common elements in Euclidean relativity are the Euclidean (++++) metric as opposed to the traditional Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric, and the\nuniversal velocity c for all objects in 4D space-time.\nThe Euclidean metric is derived from the Minkowski metric by rewriting\ninto the equivalent\nThe roles of time t and proper time have switched so that proper time becomes\nthe coordinate for the 4th spatial dimension. The universal velocity c appears from the regular time derivative\nThe switch impacts all relativistic formulas for displacement, velocity, acceleration and so on in a similar way; invariants are based on t while vector components representing the\n4th dimension are based on . Many Euclidean\ninterpretations introduce time t as a parameter for tracking velocity and change,\nwhile in some articles it is treated as a fifth dimension.\nThe approach differs from \"Wick rotation\"\nor complex Euclidean relativity. Wick rotation replaces time t by it, which\nalso yields a positive definite metric but it maintains proper time t as the invariant value whereas in Euclidean relativity\nbecomes a coordinate.\nThe Euclidean geometry is consistent with Minkowski based relativity. The hyperbolic\nMinkowski geometry turns into a rotation in 4D circular geometry where length contraction and time\ndilation result from the geometric projection of 4D properties to our 3D space.\nThe justification for the Euclidean approach is twofold: it makes relativity\naccessible in an intuitive way and it opens new opportunities to further develop\nBelow are a number of references to articles on Euclidean relativity published\nby various authors.

{"question":"I'm a theology student researching hierarchical structures in Catholic thought. How does the divine ordering of angels compare to the Church's teaching on differences between married couples in family planning decisions?","answer":"There is a clear parallel in how Catholic teaching addresses hierarchy and individual differences in both realms. Among angels, there is a divine hierarchy with nine categories (ranging from seraphim to regular angels) where some are more gifted than others, yet there is never any envy between them. Similarly in marriage, while God loves all couples equally, the Church recognizes that not all couples are equally situated regarding family planning - some may have serious reasons (medical, economic, social) to space births while others may be called to greater generosity in having children. In both cases, Catholic teaching emphasizes accepting these divinely-ordained differences without envy or domination, while maintaining that all are loved by God regardless of their station or circumstances.","context":["Father John A. Hardon, S.J. Archives\n|Return to: Home > Archives Index > Angelology Index|\nThe Angels in Sacred Scripture\nby Fr. John A. Hardon, S.J.\nBefore we continue on our meditations on the angels, I think we should pause on this one mediation to see that angels are not merely Christian piety, or Christian poetry, or Christian devotion. The angels are not a luxury to Christianity. Angels belong to the heart of our Catholic faith. In other words the existence, the nature, the purpose, the role of the angels, is an essential part of our faith. Only those who believe in angels are Christians.\nThe angels therefore belong to the mystery of Christianity. Deny their existence, function, or our devotion to the angels and it would be heresy. This is why it is so important to see what Divine Revelation in Sacred Scripture tells us about the angels. As the meditation goes on we will look more closely and more extensively on these numerous revelations on the angelic creatures.\nFor the present we will take a panoramic view of what Sacred Scripture, inspired by the Holy Spirit, tells us about these creatures and the angelic world.\nNeedless to say, we will be covering in this meditation will be exhaustive. We will cover the Old and the New testaments and will see how in the first and the last books of Sacred Scriptures, the angels are a part of Gods providence. Our purpose therefore is to see how far, then how they are made, and how a country like the United States, is strictly occupied with matter. Our very language says that if something is important it is material. Dear God! The Divine Trinity, the angels are immaterial. They are pure spirits, immaterial. We are living in a dream world if we are to believe that reality is only material reality.\nWhat we will concentrate on is the voice of the Holy Spirit. In the Old Testament an angel is called a moloch. In the New Testament, originally in Greek, it is angelos. Both words mean messenger. The word angel therefore, does not identify who an angel is. An individual intelligent being, a person with a mind and will. The word angel identifies what the angels do. They are messengers from God to us.\nAs we read the Old Testament we are told in one book after another, that the angels are messengers of Yahweh, messengers in numerous ways. An angel prevents Abraham from sacrificing his son Isaac. Angels appear to Moses in the burning bush. Angels appear to Elijah the Prophet. Angels lead the Israelites, miraculously to the red sea. Angels slay the enemies of the chosen people. In almost the whole book of Tobit or Tobias, it is described in great detail how an angel helps Tobit and his son.\nThe Old Testament especially features the angels as adorers of Yahweh. They are in another words, the host, the heavenly army of the adorers of the Almighty. It is the angelic world of adoring God which is the principal theme of the Psalms. The angels, we are told surround Yahweh, they form nothing less than a heavenly army. They are the Divine Retinue which serve and praise God, and their numbers are beyond counting.\nThe New Testament might almost be called the angelic part of Sacred Scriptures. From the beginning of the gospel of St. Matthew to the closing of the book of Revelation, the angels are featured as a part of Gods mysterious providence over the New Israel. Our Lord Jesus Christ often speaks of the angels. Referring to the children whom the disciples wanted to drive away. Now says our Lord. The angels in heaven are continually in the presence of my Father.\nAs we have seen in more detail during the retreat, the principal role of the angelic hosts is to honor, praise and adore God. They, in Marks gospel, our Lord foretelling the state of human beings in heavenly glory. No more marrying in heaven, no more begetting of children. The number of the predestined will be completed, says Jesus. In heaven they do not marry. They are like the angels. Each angel is an individual person, and individual species, according to our Catholic theology. There are no angel fathers or mothers for the obvious reasons, they have no bodies.\nThe angels appear at the beginning and at the end of Christs visible stay on earth. An angel announces the conception of the Savior. Angels appear to the Shepherds to tell them the Messiah is born. And when the disciples on Ascension day, kept looking up and staring, Where did Jesus go. The angels of the disciples told them that was enough looking and to stop. They told them that Christ will come, but, in His majesty.\nSaints Peter, John, and Paul, are three principal New Testament spokesmen for the angel. They wrote extensively on the angels not only during Christs visible stay on earth not only during apostolic times, not only until the end of the first century of Christian history, but they foretell how the angels just as they had been with Christ on His physical stay on earth, so they will stay with His Church until the end of Time.\nAmong the Jews as we know, all the Sadducees denied the existence of angels. Over the years in both teaching Judaism and knowing Jewish people, the same distinction can be made today. The truly believing Jews believe in angels. The Sadducees, as in first century Palestine, deny the existence of Angels.\nWhat do Sacred Scriptures tell us about the nature of the angels? A great deal. In Pauls letter to the Hebrews, he describes the angels as spirits. St. Luke said that the angels have no bodies. St. Paul, in his letter to the Colossians, identified the angels as creatures. Time began when the angels were created. St. Matthew made sure that believers in Christ believed that the angels had no gender. There is no male or female among the angels, again for the obvious reason, the angels do not have bodies. St. Luke again tells us that the angels are immortal. Once God creates a spirit, whether the angelic spirit of an angel or our immortal spirit, neither the angel nor our soul will die.\nLike the angels we are immortal. We were created for eternity. St. Paul again, this time to the Ephesians, speaks at great length about the wisdom of the angels. Wisdom as we know is that knowledge in the mind that provides great joy and happiness to the will. One reason again as we shall see in greater detail we should ask for the angels intercession with God. Angels intercession with God has to do with a profound reason.\nAgain St. Luke in the letters to the Evangelists about the angelic world stated that the angels have a free will. They had a free will when they were first created and those now in heaven still have a free will. Of course the only choice they make now in the beatific vision is to choose to love God. The angels, we are told by St. Matthew, see God. How we better make this clear. We not only believe in God, we accept on faith His existence. But the angels see Him face to face. There is no intermediary. There are not even ideas standing between the angelic mind and the Holy Trinity. They see Him directly, intuitively, immediately.\nFinally, as the whole Bible but especially the closing book of the New Testament tells us, the angels are holy. Holiness means God-likeness. The angels are most like God. Angels are spiritual beings like God. And they are like God because their will are united to the will of the Holy Trinity.\nDoes Sacred Scripture tell us something about the number of the angels? There is no specific enumeration. The Bible tells us there are legions, and legion in sacred scripture means a countless number. The New Testament tells us the angels form a multitude. St. Paul tells us there are many thousands. And in the closing book of the bible, which talks about the angels in the first closing chapter of the Apocalypse, angels are part of the life of the mystical body and will be an essential part of the eternal destiny to which we are looking forward.\nSays St. John, There are thousands upon thousands of angels adoring God. Just a word of explanation. Can we really talk about the number of angels if they have no bodies? For example, I can say there are three pieces of paper in front of me. Or I can say there is a glass of water. Can we speak of the number of the angels if they have no bodies? Yes. Yes. Numbers have nothing to do with bodies. There are three persons in the Holy Trinity and the Holy Trinity is surely infinite, uncreated, divine, spiritual being.\nWhy can we speak about the number of the angels? Because each angel is an individual. Each angel is a person. Each angel is distinct from another angel separate from another angel.\nThe Sacred Scriptures tell us something about the hierarchy of the angels. Hierarchy means holy. Angels are holy. Hierarchy also means classification.\nAre all the angels equal? No. Are there some angels higher than others? Yes. In Sacred Scripture we find in the Old Testament seven categories or classes of angels. They are identified as: angels, powers, and virtues. In the New Testament they are identified as principalities and dominations, as thrones and archangels. In the Old Testament they are identified as two main classes, the cherubim and seraphim.\nOver the centuries the Catholic teaching on the angels, called angelology, theologians divide these three time three categories, make it nine, on the angels. The highest category are the cherubim, seraphim and the thrones. The next category are the dominations, power, and the virtues. And the last, shall we say the lowest category are the principalities, archangels, and angels.\nA lesson for us, I think, is crucial. Does God love all of us? An emphatic yes. Has God gifted all human beings equally? No two people are equal. The hierarchy among the angels, the differences, and not just differences in function, but differences in the gifts which they received from God, teach us that among human beings, there are some who are gifted naturally and supernaturally.\nAlthough the angels differ so widely in function and in the gifts they receive, there is never any envy among the angels. The angels know there is a hierarchy among human beings, not just in Church, there is a hierarchy in the whole human race. No two human beings are equally gifted by God. And all the while we believe that God wants us to love those who may be more gifted than we and not envy them, or less gifted than we and not dominating them.\nIn Sacred Scriptures, we are told at great length that the angels have a very special function in their relationship to God. Two words recur in Old and New Testament. Angels worshipped God. Angels obeyed God. Those who deserved Heaven obeyed God and are now in heavenly Glory. And the angels praise God. We are told by St. Paul that this is the language of the angels, to praise God. One more area of angelic revelation in Sacred Scripture.\nThe angelic relationship to Jesus Christ. They announced His conception, His birth. The angels have been worshipping Christ since He was conceived in His mothers womb. The angels minister to Jesus. Let us not forget, especially in the desert. The angels, what mysterious words, the angels strengthened Jesus Christ during His Agony in the Garden in His humanity. The angels were heralds of His Resurrection. They were witnesses of His Ascension. And the angels, we are told by Sacred Scripture, will announce His final coming. When Christ, who was crucified for our salvation, will come in majesty, and then no longer submitting to the humiliation of the Crucifixion, escorted by the angels, will come to judge the living and the dead.\nLord Jesus, Master of the angels, help us. Help us to recover what we had lost and strengthen where we are weakened in our realization of the vast angelic world. Deepen our appreciation of the angels who pronounced your birth to the shepherds and through the shepherds to us, the Good News of our Salvation.\nDallas Carmelites, Conference #3, Saturday 2/24/96, 4:30 PM\nCopyright © 1996 Inter Mirifica\nWhat's New Site Index\nHome | Directory | Eucharist | Divine Training | Testimonials | Visit Chapel | Hardon Archives\nAdorers Society | PEA Manual | Essentials of Faith | Dictionary | Thesaurus | Catalog | Newsletters","Following the article posted regarding how many children to have in marriage, I am interested to know if you could guide me to investigate what is a serious cause for not having children. I thank you for your service and God bless you.\nAmong the circumstances that justify recourse to natural methods to regulate births, I would point to the various marital or family situations that sometimes make it necessary, sometimes convenient, and in other cases at least justifiable to have recourse to periodic abstinence. Pope Paul VI wrote in Humanae Vitae: “If there are serious reasons for spacing births, whether arising from the physical or psychological conditions of the spouses or from external circumstances, the Church teaches that it is then licit to take into account the natural rhythms immanent in the generative functions in order to use conjugal intercourse only in infertile periods and thus regulate the birth rate without offending moral principles…”.\nPope John Paul II said: “Sometimes, even when they are clearly open to life, couples are obliged to space births, not for selfish reasons, but precisely out of a sense of objective responsibility. Situations of poverty, or serious health problems, can make the couple unprepared to receive the gift of new life. The fact that in some cases women are forced to work outside the home changes the conception of the role of women in society, and the time and attention they devote to family life. In particular, some family policies established by legislators do not facilitate the procreative and educational duties of parents. The Church, therefore, recognizes that there may be objective reasons for limiting or distancing births, but recalls, in harmony with Humanae Vitae, that couples must have ‘serious reasons’ why it is licit to renounce the use of sex during fertile periods and to make use of it during infertile periods to express their love and safeguard their reciprocal fidelity.”\nWe therefore speak of “objective” and “serious” motives. What are they? Pope Pius XII spoke of “medical, eugenic, economic and social indications”. There are, then, four fundamental reasons:\n– Medical: for example, poor health, chronic illnesses, difficult childbirths, pregnancies with serious difficulties. Some psychological indications could be added here, such as serious misunderstandings between the spouses, manifest psychological disturbances, etc.\n– Eugenic: the possibility or certainty of engendering children affected by defects (schizophrenia, hereditary blindness or deafness, etc.).\n– Economic: a very uncertain future, severe poverty.\n– Social: problems of work, housing, educational incapacity of the parents, vices affecting the responsibility for the children (alcoholism, drug addiction, etc.). One could also indicate here the desire to distance births prudently in order to better meet the educational needs of the children already born.\nWhat is the basis on which such circumstances of family or social life can justify the regulation of births? The reason is that the task of engendering new lives is a positive duty. In this regard, A. Peinador explains: “Positive duties, whether of divine or human origin, are not urgent when a notable difficulty makes them exceptionally hard; because God, who is Legislator and Father, and men who have received from Him the power to command, take into account, when promulgating their precepts, the inherent weakness of fallen nature, which in most men translates into the impossibility of facing extraordinary hardships for the attainment of a noble and honest ideal, as is the end of all just ordination. Just and most noble is the end of procreation, contained in the precept given to married people to grow and multiply. However, from the duty to put into practice the only good means to achieve it, serious reasons can be excused.” “In this case,” says Pope Pius XII, “the general principle can be applied that a positive performance can be omitted if grave reasons, independent of the good will of those who are obliged to it, show that such performance is inopportune or prove that it cannot be equitably claimed by the creditor of such performance (in this case the human race).”\nThis does not mean that the aforementioned circumstances “require” the spouses to regulate the birth rate. The “extraordinary” character of the aforementioned situations justifies the decision in conscience not to carry out the good of fertility as long as these situations persist; but this does not mean that they “oblige” the spouses to renounce it. The spouses remain free to act with generosity, trusting in Divine Providence, in the vocation of new children to life even at the cost of hardship and suffering.

These reasons can include medical conditions, eugenic concerns, economic challenges, and social difficulties. Couples should only make this decision with “serious reasons” and are still free to act with generosity. The Catholic Church recognizes the positive duty of procreation, but acknowledges that couples may be excused from this duty in the face of exceptional difficulties. In these cases, the decision to regulate birth rate should be made in conscience and with trust in Divine Providence.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:60ca8de6-b177-445d-8407-b94ec32f39d4>","<urn:uuid:51345536-963e-4b89-bfc9-5829d4f6435f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between carbohydrate and fat metabolism in terms of ATP production and energy storage?","answer":"Carbohydrates are primarily metabolized through cellular respiration, which involves glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain to produce ATP, with glucose being the main fuel. During glycolysis in the cytosol, glucose is split into pyruvic acid molecules yielding ATP, followed by further ATP production in the mitochondria through the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. In contrast, fats serve as reserve energy and are only oxidized to produce ATP when carbohydrates are in limited supply. However, excessive fat oxidation can be dangerous as it can cause the blood to become acidic. Both nutrients can be stored - carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in the liver, while fats provide long-term energy reserves and also serve other functions like insulating the body and protecting organs.","context":["Ch. 14 Digestive System Exam\nTerms in this set (117)\ntaking in food\nbreaking food into nutrient molecules\nmovement of nutrients into bloodstream\nelimination of feces from the digestive tract through the anus (rid of waste)\nalimentary canal (GI tract)\nextends from mouth to anus\nAccessory digestive organs\nteeth, tongue, digestive organs (assist digestion)\nFunction of mouth\nmastication, tongue initiates swallowing, and taste buds allow for taste\nfunction of pharynx\npassageway for foods, fluids, and air\nFood passes posteriorly from the pharynx into the....\noropharynx and laryngopharynx\nFunction of esophagus\nconducts food by peristalsis, passageway for food only\nalternating contractions of the muscle layers\nFunction of the stomach\ntemporary storage of food, site of food breakdown, chemical breakdown of protein begins, delivers chyme to the small intestine\nfunction of small intestine\nnutrient absorption and chemical digestion\nlarge intestine function\ndries out the indigestible food residue by absorbing water and eliminating these residues as feces\nopening for elimination of feces\nWhat does the tongue do?\nmixes food with saliva and initiates swallowing\nanchors tongue to floor of mouth\nWhat are the four layers of the alimentary canal?\nmucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, serosa\ninnermost moist membrane that is mostly simple columnar epithelium and has a scanty smooth muscle layer;

Bile is a mixture of water, bile salts, cholesterol, and the pigment bilirubin. Hepatocytes in the liver produce bile, which then passes through the bile ducts to be stored in the gallbladder. When food containing fats reaches the duodenum, the cells of the duodenum release the hormone cholecystokinin to stimulate the gallbladder to release bile. Bile travels through the bile ducts and is released into the duodenum where it emulsifies large masses of fat. The emulsification of fats by bile turns the large clumps of fat into smaller pieces that have more surface area and are therefore easier for the body to digest.\nBilirubin present in bile is a product of the liver’s digestion of worn out red blood cells. Kupffer cells in the liver catch and destroy old, worn out red blood cells and pass their components on to hepatocytes. Hepatocytes metabolize hemoglobin, the red oxygen-carrying pigment of red blood cells, into the components heme and globin. Globin protein is further broken down and used as an energy source for the body. The iron-containing heme group cannot be recycled by the body and is converted into the pigment bilirubin and added to bile to be excreted from the body. Bilirubin gives bile its distinctive greenish color. Intestinal bacteria further convert bilirubin into the brown pigment stercobilin, which gives feces their brown color.\nThe hepatocytes of the liver are tasked with many of the important metabolic jobs that support the cells of the body. Because all of the blood leaving the digestive system passes through the hepatic portal vein, the liver is responsible for metabolizing carbohydrate, lipids, and proteins into biologically useful materials.\nOur digestive system breaks down carbohydrates into the monosaccharide glucose, which cells use as a primary energy source. Blood entering the liver through the hepatic portal vein is extremely rich in glucose from digested food. Hepatocytes absorb much of this glucose and store it as the macromolecule glycogen, a branched polysaccharide that allows the hepatocytes to pack away large amounts of glucose and quickly release glucose between meals. The absorption and release of glucose by the hepatocytes helps to maintain homeostasis and protects the rest of the body from dangerous spikes and drops in the blood glucose level. (See more about glucose in the body.)\nFatty acids in the blood passing through the liver are absorbed by hepatocytes and metabolized to produce energy in the form of ATP. Glycerol, another lipid component, is converted into glucose by hepatocytes through the process of gluconeogenesis. Hepatocytes can also produce lipids like cholesterol, phospholipids, and lipoproteins that are used by other cells throughout the body. Much of the cholesterol produced by hepatocytes gets excreted from the body as a component of bile.\nDietary proteins are broken down into their component amino acids by the digestive system before being passed on to the hepatic portal vein. Amino acids entering the liver require metabolic processing before they can be used as an energy source. Hepatocytes first remove the amine groups of the amino acids and convert them into ammonia and eventually urea. Urea is less toxic than ammonia and can be excreted in urine as a waste product of digestion. The remaining parts of the amino acids can be broken down into ATP or converted into new glucose molecules through the process of gluconeogenesis.\nAs blood from the digestive organs passes through the hepatic portal circulation, the hepatocytes of the liver monitor the contents of the blood and remove many potentially toxic substances before they can reach the rest of the body. Enzymes in hepatocytes metabolize many of these toxins such as alcohol and drugs into their inactive metabolites. And in order to keep hormone levels within homeostatic limits, the liver also metabolizes and removes from circulation hormones produced by the body’s own glands.\nThe liver provides storage of many essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals obtained from blood passing through the hepatic portal system. Glucose is transported into hepatocytes under the influence of the hormone insulin and stored as the polysaccharide glycogen. Hepatocytes also absorb and store fatty acids from digested triglycerides. The storage of these nutrients allows the liver to maintain the homeostasis of blood glucose. Our liver also stores vitamins and minerals - such as vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12, and the minerals iron and copper - in order to provide a constant supply of these essential substances to the tissues of the body.\nThe liver is responsible for the production of several vital protein components of blood plasma: prothrombin, fibrinogen, and albumins. Prothrombin and fibrinogen proteins are coagulation factors involved in the formation of blood clots. Albumins are proteins that maintain the isotonic environment of the blood so that cells of the body do not gain or lose water in the presence of body fluids.\nThe liver functions as an organ of the immune system through the function of the Kupffer cells that line the sinusoids. Kupffer cells are a type of fixed macrophage that form part of the mononuclear phagocyte system along with macrophages in the spleen and lymph nodes. Kupffer cells play an important role by capturing and digesting bacteria, fungi, parasites, worn-out blood cells, and cellular debris. The large volume of blood passing through the hepatic portal system and the liver allows Kupffer cells to clean large volumes of blood very quickly."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:13643b97-4b7c-426a-a9e4-2d27416c464c>","<urn:uuid:9e04bc7d-a82c-44c6-9358-a9532f8b7ec3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key similarities between waste management planning and wildfire management planning in terms of their environmental documentation requirements?","answer":"Both waste management and wildfire management planning require comprehensive documentation and advance approval from regulatory bodies. For waste management, developers must demonstrate responsible disposal through a Materials Management Plan that includes remediation strategies, risk assessments, and site investigation reports. Similarly, wildfire management requires detailed planning documents that include Environmental Assessments or Environmental Impact Statements, along with documentation of consultations with various stakeholders. Both systems mandate ongoing documentation during implementation - waste management requires tracking material movements and submitting verification reports, while wildfire management needs documentation of consultations and implementation actions. Additionally, both types of planning must demonstrate compliance with environmental regulations and require approval before work can commence.","context":["New legislation on landfill taxes introduced this year places the onus on contractors and developers to demonstrate the responsible disposal and re-use of materials for construction projects. Equally important, the Environment Agency requires advance proof that a management plan is in place ahead of the start of work on site, with retrospective submissions no longer an option. Failure to provide timely proof of compliance can be costly and may delay projection completion, as outlined in our previous article Site Reuse of materials: Be Clear on the Rules\nEnsuring compliance on waste\nDemonstrating where materials will be used and in what measure requires that clients and developers achieve a sufficiently robust cut and fill mass balance. In addition, any surplus, other than naturally occurring ground materials, will need to be disposed of off-site in accordance with the latest waste legislation, including manufactured ground materials.\nThe sustainable remediation of contaminated land and groundwater is regulated through the Definition of Waste Code of Practice (DoWCoP) developed by independent body, Contaminated Land: Applications in Real Environments (CL:AIRE). To comply, works must be carried out under a Materials Management Plan (MMP).\nWhat is an MMP?\nThe Materials Management Plan (MMP) offers a mechanism to site developers to demonstrate excavated materials satisfy the ‘end of waste’ process and that where materials are re-used the necessary treatment and testing procedures are in place. Embodied within the MMP is the remediation strategy, which sets out the criteria for re-use for approval by the regulator, also containing information about the project as well as supporting evidence such as risk assessments and site investigation reports.\nNo work can commence until the document has been submitted to and approved by the Environment Agency, with assessment by an independent qualified person required prior to submission. During on-site works, contractors are required to keep track of material movements and ensure all recovered materials are suitable for reuse in accordance with the sampling and verification regime set out in the remediation strategy. Any changes made during construction must be recorded and reconciled and a final verification report submitted on project completion, with the potential for retrospective auditing extending to two years after conclusion of the project.\nComprehensive in its reach, the MMP does not however remove the need for an environmental permit, which must also be applied for and approved prior to excavation.\nKeeping costs down\nThe reuse of materials offers significant environmental benefits, optimising the use of resources, as well as potential savings for developers by reducing disposal costs and the need for additional materials purchase. Additionally, the MMP covers the transfer of virgin materials to other sites with a similar MMP in place.\nSubmitting permit applications can be a complex process however. Added to this, the documentation and recording required at every stage of the MMP, may appear a daunting and time-consuming prospect.\nWith extensive site remediation expertise, Ecologia can help developers and clients navigate through the legislative minefield to ensure compliance requirements are fully met and reduce the risk of unexpected tax bills.\nLet us help you with your next project – see for more information on our SERVICES.","Wildland Fire Planning and Cultural Resources\nWildfire is one of the most prevalent, rapid and dramatic forces that affect park cultural resources. Because of the nature of fire, it is also a high risk activity, with potentially serious consequences for firefighters, communities, and park visitors. Careful, methodical planning—far in advance of any fire event—is therefore required of all wildland fire management programs. Planning mitigates potential adverse effects of wildland fire and management of wildland fire on cultural resources and, as a result, requires strong involvement by cultural resource specialists. Deferring involvement until fire is on the ground increases the chance of unacceptable outcomes for cultural resources.\nNPS Management Policies (2006) directs that each park containing burnable vegetation will have an approved wildland fire management plan. Wildland fire encompasses planned ignitions (prescribed burns), unplanned ignitions (wildfires), and mechanical fuel reductions not involving fire. The wildland fire management plan is a strategic document that defines and documents a program to manage wildland fire within a specific park and is the cornerstone of a park’s wildland fire management program. Wildland fire management plans and associated compliance documents provide flexible programmatic multi-year coverage for wildland fire management activities and can accelerate compliance with Federal laws, policies, and Executive Order 13175 when planning or implementing individual fire events or projects.\nThis section of the Cultural Resource and Fire module of RM #28A: Archeology (The NPS Archeology Guide) provides guidance for wildland fire managers; cultural resource managers in parks, regions, and centers; Section 106 coordinators; and park superintendents for integrating cultural resource information into wildland fire planning for compliance with Federal laws, policies, and Executive Order 13175.\nEmployee and public safety is the first priority in every management activity. All planning and implementation activities must reflect this commitment. A job hazard analysis should be prepared for each incident activity.\nFor a downloadable checklist of activities to include cultural resources in wildland fire planning, go to the Wildland Fire Planning and Cultural Resources Checklist (.docx).\nWildland Fire Management Planning and Cultural Resource Law Compliance\nNPS DO #18: Wildland Fire Management and RM #18: Wildland Fire require that wildland fire management plans be compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106, other Federal cultural resource laws, Executive Order 13175, and Department of the Interior (DOI) and NPS policies. Key elements of cultural resource legal compliance include compilation of information in order to consider the effects of fire planning and project implementation on cultural resources, and to allow individuals, associated groups, and federally-recognized Indian tribes to comment on the planning documents.\nConsultation with groups associated with the park, Indian tribes, State and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers, and the public is an important component of compliance with Federal cultural resource laws, policies, and Executive Order 13175. Consultation occurs when planning documents are developed (fire management plans, burn plans, etc.) and when the plans are implemented. Consultations at planning and implementation stages and appropriate documentation of the consultations are essential for compliance with Federal laws, policies and Executive Order 13175.\nIn addition to consultation for NEPA and NHPA compliance, Executive Order 13175 and DOI Policy on Consultation with Indian Tribes require that the NPS conduct government-to-government consultations with federally-recognized Indian tribes when undertaking any Federal action that may have a direct impact on tribes or tribal lands. Tribes may have concerns about cultural resources that may not necessarily be addressed during the Section 106 process.\nCultural Resource Implications\nCultural resource managers participate in the wildland fire management plan NEPA Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement planning process to ensure that fire program alternatives adequately consider and assess effects on cultural resources. Cultural resource managers should coordinate NEPA and NHPA public involvement for the purpose of developing Environmental Impact Statements and Environmental Assessments. Cultural resource managers can anticipate cultural resource assessment needs for compliance with NHPA Section 106 by initiation of cultural resource inventory under NHPA 110. An active park NHPA Section 110 program to identify and assess cultural resources aids in their protection during fires.\nThe cultural resource manager coordinates with the park or regional Section 106 coordinator. Appropriate tribal officials are contacted at the earliest possible point in the wildland fire planning process so that tribal input can be incorporated into wildland fire planning documents in compliance with Executive Order 13175 and DOI policy.\nFire Management and Cultural Resource Laws contains more information about Federal cultural resource laws, policies, and Executive Order 13175.\nWildland fire management plans and associated compliance documents are structured to provide flexible programmatic multi-year coverage for a range of wildland fire management activities while minimizing the amount of additional compliance efforts required for each individual fire event or project. Fire management planning activities have three distinct levels:\n- Strategic planning;\n- Annual planning; and\n- Project/event planning.\nEach will be described in the following sections. Cultural resource managers in parks, regions, and centers view their involvement in all three levels of planning as critical to their stewardship responsibilities.\nStrategic Wildland Fire Management Planning\nStrategic wildland fire planning considers short and long term benefits and damage from wildland fire to the landscape. Planned activities may include fuel reduction projects (prescribed burns and mechanical fuel reductions), and protocols for responding to unplanned fires (wildfires) that range from full suppression to monitoring from a distance. Land, resources, and incident objectives guide the incident manager in choosing the appropriate responses and tactics for each wildland fire. The overall objective for strategic planning is to reduce damage to natural and cultural resources and to increase beneficial effects of fire for those same resources.\nStrategic planning for wildland fire begins with the park’s general management plan (GMP) and/or foundation statement (FS). The GMP/FS establishes the overall direction for the role of wildland fire within the park. The park’s cultural resource management plans (or resource stewardship strategy) further describes how wildland fire is managed to fulfill park objectives, as well as to establish resource-related objectives for wildland fire management activities.\nThe wildland fire management plan implements the guidance and objectives described in higher-level park planning efforts (the GMP/FS and resource plans), and ensures that wildland fire management activities are integrated into other activities and furthers park stewardship goals. It provides specific operational guidance to the wildland fire management staff, including:\n- Demonstrating that wildland fire management in the park is derived from and consistent with park-wide goals and objectives put forth in other management plans;\n- Describing where, how and why wildland fire will be managed in the park;\n- Defining roles and responsibilities of park staff and cooperators in wildland fire management;\n- Describing how wildland fire will be safely employed to best meet park objectives;\n- Describing how detrimental effects of fire will be managed;\n- Describing the consultation schedule to ensure compliance with Federal cultural resource laws, policies, and Executive Order 13175.\nCultural resource information may include analysis of the positive and negative effects of the proposed actions on specified resources or classes of resources, as well as a preferred alternative. It may also contain descriptions of mitigation actions that become requirements for wildland fire managers when implementing the preferred alternative.\nCultural Resource Implications\nCultural resource managers must become familiar with the contents of their park’s wildland fire management plan and be proactively involved in its development and periodic updates, ensuring that relevant cultural resource information is included in planning documents. Close collaboration between the cultural resource program and the wildland fire program is the most important aspect of planning for cultural resource protection in the event of a wildland fire. The collaboration ensures that information about cultural resources at risk is incorporated into the wildland fire management plan.\nCultural resource managers work with the wildland fire program managers to plan fuels treatment projects that improve conditions of cultural resources. The goal is outlined in strategic plans and recognized as mutually beneficial for both cultural resources and wildland fire programs.\nFor more information about wildland fire management plans, see Chapter 4—Fire Management Plans of RM 18—Wildland Fire Management (.pdf).\nParks conduct an annual review of their wildland fire management program and assess the adequacy of the wildland fire management plan and related compliance documents. The annual planning cycle also may incorporate updates to the multi-year fuels project plan, including projects that may have been deferred, altered, added, or deleted since the last update. The multi-year fuels project plan give fire and cultural resource managers an opportunity to anticipate planning, funding, and survey needs well in advance of project implementation.\nThe annual review process is intended to be interdisciplinary in nature and incorporate affected disciplines across the park. Many parks have a standing wildland fire management committee that helps to review wildland fire management planning and implementation documents.\nCultural resource managers and wildland fire managers work closely to ensure that annual planning is in compliance with Federal cultural resource laws, Executive Order 13175, and NPS and DOI policies. Annual burn plans and the updated wildland fire management plan demonstrate that appropriate opportunities have been provided to comment and that concurrence has been sought from all concerned parties. The park Section 106 coordinator works to ensure that NHPA requirements are met and coordinates consultations for compliance with NHPA and NEPA.\nCultural resource managers maintain accurate and up-to-date levels of information about known resources. This ensures that cultural resource protection protocols are available and implemented for any known cultural resources or category of resources potentially affected by wildland fire. Wildland fire management program funding for emergency stabilization and recovery (ESR) efforts are limited to previously identified cultural resources. Therefore, the more comprehensive and organized the inventory of known cultural resources, the more effective the post-fire stabilization may be. Cultural resource managers ensure that private and sensitive information about the locations of cultural resources are protected but accessible to wildland fire program managers and incident managers.\nFor more information about developing relevant cultural resource information for wildland fire management planning, go to Cultural Resource Data for Fire Management.\nCultural resource managers should consider developing and updating the park cultural READ manuals to ensure that cultural resources will be considered when responding to fires and implementing fuel reduction projects.\nCultural Resource Implications\nCultural resource managers in parks, regions, and centers are involved in the annual review process, both to evaluate how well the wildland fire management program has performed in the past year, to keep abreast of plans for the coming wild fire season, and to update information and concerns about cultural resources potentially affected by the activities being planned. As soon as fuel reduction projects are identified, cultural resource managers should formulate cultural resource data compilation and collection needs into PMIS to begin the funding process.\nMany national parks have not identified all cultural resources within park boundaries. Developing good response protocols in the event of a wildland fire is essential for protecting cultural resources that have not been identified and documented prior to the fire. Protocols are included in wildland fire management documents and communicated to incident managers. More information about mitigating measures for cultural resources may be found in the Toolbox: Fire Treatment Measures for Archeological Resource Protection (.pdf).\nEach fuels reduction project and unplanned ignition has a distinct planning and decision process that guides its implementation. For each process described below, there are opportunities for involvement by cultural resource managers in parks, regions, and centers. Consultation about cultural resources for compliance with Federal cultural resource laws, DOI policies, and Executive Order 13175 is an important component of the project planning and implementation process. Consultation takes place when finalizing the planning documents, when implementing the planned activities, when responding to wildfires, and when planning and implementing post-fire recovery activities.\nPlanning for Wildfires (unplanned ignitions)\nThough this seems contradictory, wildland fire managers do in fact ‘plan for the unexpected.’ Initial response to an unplanned ignition is normally guided by requirements stated in the park’s wildland fire management plan and is influenced by the origin and location of the ignition and the weather and fuel conditions at the time of the response. Responses may be immediate and aggressive, or delayed and reserved, depending on the individual situation and requirements contained in the management plan. For ignitions whose wildland fire management is expected to extend beyond a single day, the interagency Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) is engaged. Decision criteria and factors important to the park (identified during the park’s wildland fire management preplanning efforts) are often preloaded into WFDSS, and information about the unfolding event, including decisions on management strategies and tactics, are recorded.\nCultural Resource Implications\nIt is critical that issues and concerns regarding cultural resources be incorporated into the wildland fire management plan and WFDSS decision criteria. Including cultural resources information in the plan increases the probability that the incident manager will take cultural resources into account when implementing wildfire management activities.\nCultural resources at risk for adverse effects of wildland fire are identified and mitigation measures are described in the wildland fire management plan and/or EA/EIS. Cultural resources rehabilitation and restoration should be identified as a specific objective in wildland fire planning documents.\nFor more information about identifying cultural resources at risk from adverse effects of wildland fire, go to Cultural Resource Data for Fire Management.\nFuels Treatment Planning (planned ignitions and mechanical fuel reductions)\nFuels treatments are proactively implemented to meet a variety of wildland fire management and cultural resource management objectives, including reducing the probability of damaging fires through removal of biomass; increasing defensible space around structures and other resources subject to fire damage; restoring and maintaining fire-dependent ecosystems; and maintaining vistas or cultural landscapes.\nFuels management treatments are planned several years in advance in order to secure funding for implementation and allow time for detailed planning and preparation of the site for treatment. Planning includes survey of cultural resources and evaluation for eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. Since the actual implementation of a given fuels project depends on a large number of variables including weather, funding, and staff availability, the exact fuels treatments planned at the beginning of a season may vary considerably from the those that are implemented as conditions change.\nEach fuels treatment—whether using fire, chemical or mechanical methods—requires a separate plan. Individual treatment plans include a detailed description of objectives, operational details (including the type of tactics and equipment to be used), description of constraints and mitigations, evaluation criteria, other information required for safe implementation, and documentation of cultural resource consultation.\nCultural Resource Implications\nCultural resource managers are closely involved in fuels treatment planning to insure that requirements, mitigation, and protection contained in the park’s wildland fire management plan and compliance documents are included and implemented. They stay current with fuels treatment project planning within individual fire seasons to keep abreast of potential changes and project substitutions. Cultural resource managers also ensure that post-project monitoring is identified in fuels planning documents to ensure that mitigation measures to protect cultural resources were effective.\nImplementation of Planning Documents\nCultural resource managers continue cooperation and coordination with wildland fire management program managers to ensure that cultural resources are considered during the implementation of wildland fire management plans, and that both plans and projects comply with Federal cultural resource laws, DOI policies, and Executive Order 13175.\nGuidance about cultural resource management and protection during wildfires may be found in Managing Cultural Resources during Wildfires. Guidance for ensuring that cultural resources will be considered when implementing fuel reduction projects may be found at Fuel Reduction and Cultural Resources."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7186502c-7718-4cbb-a1a7-2035eccaf9cc>","<urn:uuid:840f5f80-4606-4fd8-9e41-f89c0eb688fc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm learning knife sharpening - what's the main difference between the Naniwa Chosera 1K and Sigma Select II 240 in terms of their primary use?","answer":"The Naniwa Chosera 1K and Sigma Select II 240 serve different primary purposes in knife sharpening. The Chosera 1K is a versatile stone used for initial maintenance and light repairs, leaving a functional work sharp edge suitable for most knives. In contrast, the Sigma Select II 240 is an aggressive, extra coarse stone specifically designed for serious profiling, major repairs, and initial sharpening. While both stones can clean up diamond plate scratches, the Sigma 240 is more aggressive and is typically used before progressing to finer grits like the 1K.","context":["The 1x6\" Naniwa Chosera 1K Grit stone is one of the most versatile and essential stones on the market. It is a keystone grit used for initial maintenance and light repairs on your edges, as well as for lighter profiling. It leaves a standard and functional work sharp edge that is acceptable for almost any knife or tool. This stone also cleans up deeper factory scratches, makes transitioning from diamond plates and stones easier and cleaner, and is a good foundation stone before progressing to finer grits.\n1\" x 6\" x 5mm in size and mounted to a steel blank, the 1K Chosera is used with water only and works best when soaked in water for a minute or two before use.

The abrasive release of the stone while in use add to its aggression and can be used to “save” your diamond plates from unnecessary wear, especially on the abrasion resistant steels. It also leaves the surface of the blade prepped for further refinement.\nHacks and Tips:\n- This stone makes its own slurry as it is used and is a little thirsty. Keeping the stone viscous with water will keep it more aggressive.\n- To clean up the scratches before moving to another grit, let the paste on the stone dry out slightly. This will leave a slightly less scratchy finish in preparation for the next grit.\n- This stone will dish with use. Lap this stone with an extra coarse diamond plate, silicon carbide (SiC) powder, or very low grit wet dry sandpaper to keep it consistently flat and clean.\nComparable Stones: Shapton 220\nAlternative Economical Level Stones: Suehiro 180 GC"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b17804b2-d516-47d2-b8fa-0a89a9e730b1>","<urn:uuid:992e3145-58c2-4cde-9cf4-bc520c9aa19f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I run small business - what difference between gross profit and gross profit margin?","answer":"Gross profit is the absolute dollar amount that remains after subtracting cost of goods sold (COGS) from total sales revenue. Gross profit margin, on the other hand, is this profit expressed as a percentage. For example, if you have a profit of $3 on a sales price of $15, your gross profit margin would be 20% (calculated by dividing the profit by the sales price).","context":["In contrast, calculating gross profit requires subtracting COGS from sales revenue. Markup refers to the amount added to the cost price of a product or service in order to arrive at its selling price. It is typically expressed as a percentage and serves as a way for businesses to cover their expenses and generate profits. For example, if an item has a cost price of $100 and the business applies a 50% markup, the selling price would be $150. Markup shows how much more a company’s selling price is than the amount the item costs the company.\nMarkup can also signal potential issues and allow you to reexamine the current markup to determine if pricing levels need to be addressed. This means that you sold the journals for 100% more than what it cost to purchase them. Markup is also a useful metric for determining how much you should sell a product for. All three of these terms come into play with both margin and markup—just in different ways. Net sales, or net revenue, is used in the equation because Total Revenue would not be accurate.\nGross profit is the total profit a company makes after deducting the cost of doing business. Put simply, gross profit is a company’s total sales or revenue minus its COGS. Gross profit margin, on the other hand, is the profit a company makes expressed as a percentage using the formula above.\nBoth of these indicators have useful applications, but neither serves as the best indicator of small business profitability. Markup is typically expressed as a percentage above the cost price. For example, if an item costs $50 and you apply a 40% markup, then your selling price would be $70 (cost price + (cost price x markup percentage)).\nHe has been a manager and an auditor with Deloitte, a big 4 accountancy firm, and holds a degree from Loughborough University.

In order to stay afloat, you need to sell this good for a higher price than the one you spent in the production process. For calculating GP margin, we divided the profit of $3 with the sales price of $15 and then we reach a gross profit margin of 20%. 215+ amazing fundraising ideas for your organization This means that for every dollar Apple generated in sales, the company generated 43 cents in gross profit before other business expenses were paid. A higher ratio is usually preferred, as this would indicate that the company is selling inventory for a higher profit. Gross profit margin provides a general indication of a company’s profitability, but it is not a precise measurement.\nIt expresses the relationship of profit to revenue as a percentage. Net profit margin is the profit that remains after subtracting both the COGS and operating expenses from revenue. Markup is the amount that you increase the price of a product to determine the selling price. Though this sounds similar to the margin, it actually shows you how much above cost you’re selling a product for. Margin is also referred to as gross margin, and it’s the difference between the price a product is sold for and the cost of goods sold COGS. Essentially, it’s the amount of money that is earned from the sale.\nIt is determined by subtracting the cost it takes to produce a good from the total revenue that is made. Net profit margin measures the profitability of a company by taking the amount from the gross profit margin and subtracting other operating expenses. Similarly, gross profit can be calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from total sales revenue. This gives you an idea of how much money is left after accounting for production or service-related expenses. The gross profit is the absolute dollar amount of revenue that a company generates beyond its direct production costs. Thus, an alternate rendering of the gross margin equation becomes gross profit divided by total revenues.\nIn summary,Gross profit plays a crucial role in assessing a company’s financial performance by revealing how effectively they generate revenue after accounting for direct production costs. Understanding gross profit can help businesses make informed decisions about pricing strategies, product development initiatives, and overall financial health. By analyzing this metric over time or comparing it with industry benchmarks, organizations can identify areas for improvement or potential opportunities for growth. Profit margin is the percentage of profit that a company retains after deducting costs from sales revenue.\nIf you know how much profit you want to make, you can set your prices accordingly using the margin vs. markup formulas. To calculate markup, start with your gross profit (Revenue – COGS). Then, find the percentage of the COGS that is gross profit by dividing your gross profit by COGS—not revenue. Let’s give you an example; you know you want a profit margin of anything between 35% and 40% on your sales. Start by inserting these data in our calculator, in the two margin variables.\nThis allows these firms to get much higher earnings per flight than other airlines. A company that sustains higher gross profit margins than its peers almost always has better processes and more sound operations. Those efficiencies could signal that the firm is a safer investment over the long term, as long as its valuation multiple isn’t too high. Net profit is the dollar figure that shows the profit that remains after subtracting the cost of goods sold, operating expenses, taxes, and interest on debt.

{"question":"How does the sun's position affect the length of days during the winter solstice across different hemispheres?","answer":"During the winter solstice, the sun reaches its southernmost position in the sky, creating opposite effects in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, this results in the shortest day of the year. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, this same moment marks the longest day of the year with more hours of sunshine and warmer weather. The sun's height above the horizon varies by latitude - in southern Canada, it appears very low in the southern sky at about 22 degrees above the horizon, while in the southernmost continental United States, it reaches about 42 degrees above the horizon. For locations north of the Arctic Circle, the sun doesn't rise at all during this time.","context":["Next week marks a major turning point in the annual cycle of the seasons: the winter solstice. It takes place at 11:48 p.m. EST on Dec. 21 (0448 GMT Dec. 22). At that moment, the sun reaches its southernmost position in the sky, resulting in the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and the longest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe solstice gets its name from the apparent stop (\"stice\") in the motion of the sun (\"sol\"). The earliest astronomers recorded this phenomenon carefully: Monuments like Stonehenge are thought to have been used to mark the extreme positions of the sun in the sky. The December solstice has long marked the beginning of the new year, and it's mainly because of slippage in our calendar that it now occurs 11 days before the \"official\" start to the new year, Jan. 1.\nThe solstice is a day of celebration in many cultures. The Romans knew it as \"Saturnalia,\" and the early Christians adopted the date of the solstice to mark the birth of Christ, so that they could celebrate without drawing the attention of their Roman masters.\nThe solstice will fall on Tuesday or Wednesday, because, although the time of the solstice is exactly the same everywhere in the world, because of local time zones, it falls on different days in different places. The exact time of the solstice this year is 0448 UTC on Dec. 22. (UTC, or coordinated universal time, is the basis for all time zones and is used by astronomers and pilots everywhere.)\nIn England, where the Earth's prime meridian lies, the solstice will occur at 4:48 a.m. GMT on Wednesday, Dec. 22. Similarly, in other parts of Europe and in Africa, the solstice will occur in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\nIn North America, we subtract a number of hours from UTC to get our local times. In most of eastern North America, we are on Eastern Standard Time, and subtract 5 hours, so the solstice falls at 11:48 p.m. on the previous day, Tuesday, Dec. 21. The farther west we go in North America, the earlier the solstice occurs in the evening, so that on the Pacific coast, it occurs at 8:48 p.m. PST.\nRemember, these are all exactly the same time in the broader scheme of things; local times are just vagaries of the way we handle time around the world.\nThe graphic above shows the sky as it would appear at the time of solstice from a location where the solstice occurs at noon, which, this year, would be Vietnam. Through the Starry Night software, we have turned the blue sky transparent and have added the two coordinate systems we use to mark positions in the sky.\nThe red line across the sky marks the celestial equator, halfway between the celestial North and South poles. It shows 18h on the meridian because right ascension, the celestial equivalent of longitude, is measured from the vernal equinox, exactly 9 months ago.\nThe green line marks the ecliptic, the path that the sun appears to follow across the sky. When the solstice occurs, the sun is at its southernmost position, at a declination (celestial equivalent of latitude) of exactly 23 degrees and 26 minutes, which just happens to be the exact angle at which the Earth's poles are tilted from the ecliptic.\nThe height of the sun above the horizon on solstice day depends on your latitude on the surface of the Earth. Where I live in southern Canada, it hangs very low in the southern sky, barely 22 degrees above the horizon. For anyone north of the Arctic Circle, it never rises at all. Even in the southernmost continental United States, it's barely 42 degrees above the horizon, less than halfway up in the sky.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed. The December solstice marks the longest day in the year, combined with the shortest night. Longer days mean more hours of sunshine and warmer weather.\nI tend to avoid using the words \"winter\" and \"summer\" when talking about the solstices because, even though the sun's position in the sky is responsible for our seasons, it does not match exactly with the seasons as we experience them. Sometimes, the astronomical solstices and equinoxes are referred to as \"the first day of\" a new season, but these days don't actually indicate when snow will start falling in December or when flowers will start blooming in March. Depending on location conditions, seasons arrive and depart in different ways, and vary in severity. Hence the old joke about the Canadian seasons: 11 months of winter and one month of bad sledding.\nThis article was provided to Space.com byS imulation Curriculum, the leader in space science curriculum solutions and the makers of Starry Night and SkySafari.

{"question":"As an environmental researcher studying water resources, I'm curious about how both natural resource extraction and aggregate mining affect water quality and ecosystems. What are the impacts?","answer":"Both natural resource extraction and aggregate mining have severe impacts on water quality and ecosystems. In the Northwest Territories, mining operations have left behind devastated lands and polluted water. As stated by Indigenous leaders, historical mining activities proceeded without proper consideration of environmental impacts. Similarly, aggregate extraction severely disrupts surface water and groundwater movement, leading to reduced quantity and quality of drinking water for residents and wildlife. Quarries can impair water quality in aquifers, harm residential wells, and affect wetlands. In both cases, the damage can be irreparable - while the Northwest Territories' boreal region faces water pollution from resource extraction, aggregate quarries permanently disrupt natural water recharge and can detrimentally impact cold water fish habitats through increased water temperatures.","context":["Indigenous Leader Bridges Environmental Divides in ‘Spectacular’ Canadian Wilderness\nIn the Northwest Territories, Stephen Kakfwi pursues solutions that respect the Earth and its original stewards\nYELLOWKNIFE, Northwest Territories—Stephen Kakfwi was born to the land, in a wilderness region so grand in scale that the adjective most frequently used to describe it, spectacular, can seem insufficient.\nConsider just a few of the natural wonders within Canada’s rugged Northwest Territories: the deepest lake in North America, the continent’s second-longest river, the largest unpolluted lake on the planet, a jagged-edge mountain range with 9,000-foot peaks and 3,000-foot-deep river canyons, a hidden waterfall twice the height of Niagara, a boreal forest three times the size of Britain.\n“There is incredible land everywhere you go,” says Kakfwi.\nA former territorial premier, past president of the Dene Nation, and lifelong Indigenous rights activist, Kakfwi has spent decades working to balance protection of the mostly pristine areas of this landscape with sustainable economic development for First Nations communities.\nAsk Kakfwi what he holds special and he says it’s not just iconic sites such as Great Bear Lake or Nahanni National Park Reserve, a World Heritage site in the Mackenzie Mountains. It’s the intimate places that live in his memory, places infused with personal importance.\n“What is closest to me is the land where I was born,” Kakfwi says. “Everywhere I look, there are stories. There are spiritual, sacred sites. And those are beautiful to me—in my heart and my mind, not just visually.”\nKakfwi was born in 1950 on the northern edge of the Territories’ vast boreal forest region near the Arctic Circle, at a hunting camp on the shores of Lake Yelta. He spent his early childhood in tiny Fort Good Hope, a Dene village along the 1,080-mile-long, north-flowing Mackenzie River, known in the Slavey language as the Deh Cho.\n“There was literally nothing there. There was a little grocery store, a church, and that was it,” he says.\n“For the first five years of my life, I lived off of moose and caribou, rabbits, ducks, and the berries that we find in the woods, in the bush. … We depended 100 percent on the bounties of the land, on the wildlife, the birds, the fish.”\nUnder a government assimilation policy, Kakfwi was removed from his home at the age of 9 and placed in Canada’s residential school system. “I was, like many others, sexually abused. I was physically beaten. I went through some horrible suffering,” Kakfwi says. When he returned to Fort Good Hope, he relearned the Slavey language and reconnected with a Dene culture that drew its sustenance and spiritual health from the land.\nDene leaders in his community taught him the traditional methods of hunting and trapping. He learned how to skin a moose in the frigid cold of deep winter, and the importance of using every part of the animal for food and clothing. Kakfwi says the land became his place of solace and recovery.\n“On days when I was heartbroken and lonely, and feeling sad and sorry for myself, I used to go to this hill. And on the hill, there was a stand of birch trees. Not very big birch trees, just small, little birch trees. I used to go there and lay underneath those trees, looking up at” the sky, Kakfwi says.\n“There’s a way to get comfort from the earth and from the land, just by laying on it, by connecting.”\nKakfwi’s connection to the land has shaped a career spent fighting for recognition of the rights of Indigenous people, including the right to make decisions about development and conservation on traditional territories where they have lived for thousands of years.\nAs a young man who came of age when the civil rights movement was at its height in the United States, Kakfwi thought protest could secure greater rights for his people and protection for the land from unchecked development. Over time, and following the guidance of Dene elders, Kakfwi came to understand that change could come through collaboration with governments and industry.\nKakfwi was elected in 1983 to lead the Dene Nation, an organization representing five Dene tribal groups, and worked to build a framework for Indigenous land claims. The Dene Nation’s traditional territories are known as Denedeh—Land of the People.\nKakfwi became a member of the territorial legislature in 1987 and held several cabinet portfolios, including minister of resources, wildlife, and economic development. He was premier from 2000 to 2003.\n“I worked in the legislature for 16 years because the job was so meaningful to me. I never took a holiday,” he says.\nWorking for change from within governments has paid dividends, Kakfwi says.\nThe Dene Nation represents five Indigenous tribal groups in the Northwest Territories: Gwich’In, Deh Cho, Sahtu, Tlicho, and Akaitcho.\nIt has taken decades, but there is a growing understanding of the value that First Nations bring to land use planning in the boreal region, and the historical knowledge they have about striking a balance between industrial activities and protection of the Earth, he says.\nAs Indigenous people, “we believe inherently that we are part of the Earth. We’re not separate. We don’t have dominion over it,” Kakfwi says.\n“Keeping our culture alive is all about being part of the land, being part of the wildlife, the fish, and the birds.”\nJust as Indigenous people, like all people, have rights that must be respected, those who seek to extract the region’s resources should acknowledge that the Earth also has rights, he says.\n“The Earth is a living being. It’s a living creature. And you have to respect the Earth,” he says.\n“Elders say the Earth loves us … because it’s been taking care of us for thousands and thousands and thousands of years,” he adds. “It takes care of us, no matter how much we misbehave.”\nEverywhere I look, there are stories. There are spiritual, sacred sites. And those are beautiful to me—in my heart and my mind, not just visually.Stephen Kakfwi\nBut people have not always taken care of the Earth in return. The boreal forest region in the Northwest Territories is a place rich with natural resources, including diamonds, gold, rare earth, silver, uranium, and oil and gas reserves. The capital city, Yellowknife, markets itself as the Diamond Capital of North America.\nNatural resources fuel the northern economy, but Kakfwi says development has proceeded without full and proper consideration of its impact on the land or on the well-being of its original inhabitants.\n“Our history is marked with people that have come, opened up mines, and then left behind a land that has been devastated. Water has been polluted. And for what? Just for very specific interests,” Kakfwi says.\n“We have to get to the day when every one of us—every government in this country, every government in the world—will respect the rights of the Earth. To keep the water clean, to protect the wildlife, to protect the land, and make sure things are done in balance, and all things are sustainable.”\nCanada's boreal forest\nYellowknife is the capital of Canada’s Northwest Territories, which has 235 million acres of boreal forest.\nThose beliefs formed the underpinning of Kakfwi’s work in the territorial legislature and during his professional life since leaving public office.\nKakfwi played central roles in developing and implementing a protected areas strategy for the Northwest Territories. He helped settle long-standing land claims by several Indigenous communities, including his own tribal group, the Sahtu Dene, and backed First Nations-led land protection measures that include Indigenous co-management of conservation areas.\nKakfwi was a strong supporter of a transfer of powers, called devolution, which in 2014 resulted in the government of the Northwest Territories assuming control over land use and resources from Canada’s federal government. The role of Indigenous governments is formally recognized within the process, laying a foundation for more locally accountable and responsible decision-making on lands and resources.\nGovernments are learning to “accept that we have to do business with the First Nations people … because they have rights,” he says.\nIn addition to his political and conservation leadership, Kakfwi is a musician whose recordings include a CD of traditional Dene songs.\nKakfwi stresses that traditional Indigenous knowledge, which is sensitive to the needs of people and the environment, is essential. No one knows the land better than those who have lived on it for millenniums, he says.\n“The Dene have always had a plan for our land. Every year, for thousands of years, we have decided who’s going to go to the fish lakes, which families are going to go to the mountains, which ones are going to go on the river, which ones are going to go to the [river] delta areas. We decide that amongst ourselves,” he says.\n“Where are the places where the moose are plentiful? Where is the best fish? Which areas should we leave [alone] for a few years until they become plentiful again? That’s land use planning, and that’s what we’ve done.”\nGood land use planning is about striking a balance, he adds, and about recognizing that the land is worth something more than just the minerals or resources that lie within it.\n“When you come into my country, I expect you to live as a good citizen, to respect the rights of everybody else, to take care of the land and the water and the wildlife, and leave it the way you find it,” he says.\n“I’ve always carried that with me. And I think all our people carry that with us. And it’s no different from a person that lives in a city that has a yard. Nobody is going to go into that yard and contaminate it. I mean, it’s just totally unacceptable. So why should we be any different from that?”\nWhen you come into my country, I expect you to live as a good citizen, to respect the rights of everybody else, to take care of the land and the water and the wildlife, and leave it the way you find it.Stephen Kakfwi\nAs global demand for natural resources increases, Kakfwi worries that neglect of the environment’s health could push the Earth out of balance. Dene prophecies have foreseen a future, he says, where the great Deh Cho River becomes just a little creek on its way to the Arctic Ocean.\n“The Earth maintains the balance. The air is good to us. The wildlife is good to us. The water’s bountiful. The temperatures and the climate are all made in order to sustain humans,” Kakfwi says, but it “can only handle so much.”\nWithin a few hundred years of the Industrial Revolution, “we are literally pushing the Earth to a point where it cannot rebound and take care of itself anymore. We have caused it perhaps irreparable damage,” he says.\n“The weather is changing. And our people have known that for many, many years. They see the changes. The permafrost is melting. The grounds are shifting. The Arctic ice is starting to melt. The people can read the signs. It’s caused us concern for many years, because we know, inherently, you have to keep a balance.”\nStill, Kakfwi is an optimist. In recent years, the Northwest Territories has protected millions of acres of the boreal that have ecological and cultural significance to indigenous people. These include the Horn Plateau National Wildlife Area (Edéhzhíe), Ramparts River National Wildlife Area (Ts’ude niline Tu’eyeta), and the proposed Thaidene Nene National Park Reserve. Nahanni National Park Reserve, created in 1972, was recently expanded and is now six times its original size.\nKakfwi believes that ongoing collaboration among governments, First Nations people, and industry in the boreal region is creating a path to economic prosperity without compromising the health of the environment.\n“We have more and more people now that come to the North, make it their home, want to keep the land and water [healthy], but also have some responsible, sustainable development occur,” he says.\nIndigenous people “have slowly won the battle, where now we are—by law and by policy and practice—now in the room when mines are being planned, oil and gas projects are being developed. We have a say. We are consulted. Our consent has to be often sought. … Now, in the Northwest Territories, they talk to us.”\nKakfwi has never forgotten what he learned as a boy, when he sought out a small stand of birch for healing. The way to connect with the land, to learn to respect and use it sustainably, is to pay attention to the details, the small things and quiet places that make up the greater whole.\nWhenever Kakfwi travels, he likes to take a walk to get oriented and to understand the new environment he is in. He studies the trees, the landscape, the birds overhead, and even the ants.\n“Anywhere you go, if you haven’t been there before, you will feel a little bit lost, because you cannot see past the next tree. And so we encourage people to go for walks, to pay attention,” he says.\n“And once you have that, your comfort zone is very, very different. You establish a relationship with yourself, with everything around you. And then you become a part of it.”\nPhotos by The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n235 million acresThe boreal forest region in the Northwest Territories covers 235 million acres, three times the size of Britain.

The Environmental Impacts of Aggregate Extraction\nWith the exception of those who work in the building trades, the closest most of us ever come to “virgin” aggregate (that is, aggregate that comes straight from an aggregate mine and has not been reclaimed from rubble or other debris) is at home building stores. While a bag of stones or gravel may look fairly benign, the process of getting it to us is anything but benign. Aggregate is mined from the earth, either dug out of pits or blasted out of quarries. This process has many significant environmental impacts.\nCreating the pits or quarries requires the removal of virtually all natural vegetation, top soil and subsoil to reach the aggregate underneath. Not only does this lead to a loss of existing animal wildlife, it also leads to a huge loss of biodiversity as plants and aquatic habitats are destroyed. Moreover, adjacent eco-systems are affected by noise, dust, pollution and contaminated water.\nPits and quarries disrupt the existing movement of surface water and groundwater; they interrupt natural water recharge and can lead to reduced quantity and quality of drinking water for residents and wildlife near or downstream from a quarry site.\nMost old pits and quarries are not being properly rehabilitated. As noted in one study “less than half of the land disturbed for aggregate production between 1992 and 2001 has actually been rehabilitated.” The province classifies pits and quarries as “interim uses of the land” and requires 100% rehabilitation of pits and quarries. Clearly this requirement is not being met. Destroyed ecosystems and source water aquifers are irreplaceable. This is not an interim land use. The landscape is blotted with destructive pits and quarries, and species of all kinds endure permanent negative impacts.\nA more detailed picture of the environmental impact of aggregate mining is outlined in a 2005 legal challenge to the expansion of an existing quarry in the Niagara Escarpment. The report focuses on the following potential environmental impacts:\n- Potential impairment of water quality on the site, including harm to the aquifer\n- The water quality of residential wells close by could be harmed\n- The water level of on-site lakes could be reduced, detrimentally affecting provincially specific wetlands\n- Heightened summer water temperature in an on-site lake could have a detrimental impact on the\nviability of cold water fish in an adjacent stream\nPotential harm to on-site and off-site wetlands\n- Loss of habitat for the Jefferson Salamander, which is designated as threatened under the federal Species at Risk Act\n- Potential loss and fragmentation of continuous natural environment\nOf course, each pit or quarry has unique characteristics and impacts, but every pit or quarry will degrade the natural environment. For pits or quarries situated on lands designated as ecologically significant, this degradation has an even greater adverse impact.\nFor communities, the displacement of water resources is one of the biggest concerns pits and quarries pose. However, there are many other concerns. Beyond the physical changes to the landscape, the daily barrage of noise, dust and exhaust produced by hundreds of dump trucks hauling aggregate can have serious effects on the health of people living nearby.\nWinfield, M and A.

{"question":"How can identity theft affect businesses and individuals? I need to understand the risks.","answer":"Identity theft affects both individuals and businesses globally through the fraudulent use of personal information to access loans, credit and commit fraud. In this digital age, data breaches are common, with thieves targeting personal information like social security details, names, addresses, and birth dates to create counterfeit accounts. The consequences can be severe - businesses and individuals can face massive private lawsuits and legal fines, and consumer trust is often lost when information isn't properly safeguarded.","context":["Information technology has made the world more accessible than ever in history. Different people from different parts of the world have the ability to access the internet and simultaneously make use of online resources. Do not be deceived that whatever you do alone behind the screen does not affect anyone else. Your actions on the internet affect more people than you can imagine.\nInternet ethics is the acceptable behavioral code when using the internet. In simple terms, it is a manual of what is acceptable online. Internet ethics affects everything we do on the web. With better technology comes more decisions to make. Unlike in the past, our actions are no longer constrained by our weaknesses but by our ethical judgment. Unfortunately, some people choose to ignore this moral guide in pursuit of self-interest.\nWhen using the internet, it is important to embrace honesty, respect privacy, property, and rights. However, as many organizations embrace and explore the internet with specific goals, these goals are not in the best interest of everyone. The ethical practices encouraged by computer users include:\nEthical debates surrounding the internet focus on accessibility, property rights, information integrity, and proper information use. The following are some of the ethical questions surrounding information technology:\nOnline privacy has one of the most sought-after questions in regards to internet ethics. Every day, there are growing concerns among people about the nature of data collection and storage. Internet users want more awareness about how their data is knowingly and unknowingly being used. Some are concerned that their data may be used in ways they do not anticipate, while others are afraid that their data can be used against them.\nThis issue presents a big problem in this medium of communication. In addition, an ethical concern arises: is the internet still a safe space that invites expressive freedom, creative outlets, and information sharing even as it transforms into a weapon of mass surveillance?\nNet neutrality has been a major ethical backbone behind the internet’s development. It runs around the principle that people who control the internet pipeline will have no control over what information is available online. Information is supposed to flow freely.\nHowever, the companies behind the running of these pipelines are developing ways to reap from or encourage specific content consumption. This creates an internet ethics issue. There is a divide on whether the internet remains a neutral entity for information transfer and communication or a tool used to favor specific content.\nThe rise of the internet has led to an eyebrow-raising phenomenon that involves the accumulation and inspection of big data. Several ethical concerns have popped up as a result:-\nWith such data being widely used as an objective source of truth on a societal level, there are concerns about whether its reliability is solid. This is because big data affect major decisions like the best job candidate, who can access insurance, who will get bail, and who gets a prison sentence. Big data has eventually matured to create responsibilities that big data analysts and proponents had not anticipated.\nLack of internet is not only limited to underdeveloped countries. Some people living in countries that boast high broadband speeds have limited to no internet access. This raises concerns as to whether internet access in our current society is an ignored human right.\nThe presence of vast numbers of US citizens struggling with internet access creates an ethical imperative that schools, corporations, and governments should consider. The assumption that everybody has access to the internet is not true. It is a question of ethics regarding how equality can be created in a country dependent on the internet, while others have no access to it.\nIdentity theft is the fraudulent use of someone else’s personal information to get access to loans, credit and commit fraud. Identity theft affects both individuals and businesses of all sizes on a global scale. Therefore, businesses and individuals need to take proper measures to protect their information.\nIn this digital age, data breaches are common, and personal information is a major target. For example, social security information, names, addresses, and birth dates are subject to theft to create counterfeit accounts. If this information is not safeguarded, massive private lawsuits and legal fines will follow suit. Moreover, consumer trust is lost.\nThe illegal distribution of movies, intellectual property, books, and music is called piracy. Media piracy is one of the most prominent ethical issues that plague the internet. However, given the vast nature of the internet, getting a hold of the perpetrators is a challenging task.\nIf your business is caught using information obtained through media piracy, it will result in legal recourse and fines. At the very least, the media owner may obtain a cease-and-desist letter for the organization using their information.\nNot all hackers are interested in information theft; some are only interested in penetrating organizations and diverting financial input to steal money. Professional hackers have the ability to redirect an organization’s donation information to other accounts owned by them. As a website user, you can easily be tricked into believing that your transaction was successful and complete, while in reality, the business involved was never notified of your transaction. Moreover, you will lose all your money.\nCybercriminals are known for penetrating a company’s main server to hold it hostage—the anonymity provided by the internet aids these thieves to attack businesses. Using complex encryption methods, these hackers freeze the website of a business, eventually shutting it down. This is referred to as a denial-of-service attack. The business is then asked to pay a fee by the cybercriminals to regain access to their site. Organizations that are more susceptible to these attacks are those that ignore server security updates.\nPiracy is not the only type of unethical distribution of intellectual property. For example, the digital age has given companies an avenue to create proprietary information that may cost millions of dollars. On the other hand, the competitors will try and use any underhand methods to get a hold of this information. Often, patent-pending or already patented information is the main target.\nThis type of theft is often carried out by contract workers or moles with uninhibited access to the target company’s server. Unlike external theft that can easily be mitigated using tough security protocols, internal infractions are difficult to prevent.\nAs technology and the internet progress, the questions about internet ethics issues will take more root. More attention needs to be put around the importance of online ethics if a better technological future is realized. By following the moral codes surrounding the internet, we play a role in shaping the kind of future we want.\nInternet ethics provides a manual guide of actions that are acceptable on the web. Information technology has made it possible for different people to access online resources through the internet. Not everybody with access to the internet has the best interests of everyone- this is why it is important to respect the privacy of others and their rights. Advancements in technology will only raise more questions about internet ethics. Our conduct when using the internet will be directly responsible for the technological future we want.\npalmer, d. e.

{"question":"How do oral history interviews and Verdi's Requiem deal with sensitive content?","answer":"Both oral history interviews and Verdi's Requiem address sensitive content through formal procedures and artistic interpretation. In oral history, interviews containing sensitive personal information require careful handling through release forms, where narrators can indicate portions that need to be sealed or kept confidential for a specified time period. Interviewers must also be vigilant about potential libelous statements, which can be erased or deleted. In contrast, Verdi's Requiem tackles sensitive themes of death and judgment through musical interpretation, particularly in its dramatic Dies irae movement, which powerfully expresses themes of wrath and fear, demonstrating how artistic works can address profound and sensitive subjects through creative expression.","context":["Working Definition of Oral History\nAccording to the Oral History Association's website, \"Oral history is a field of study and a method of gathering, preserving and interpreting the voices and memories of people, communities, and participants in past events.\" Oral history is both the oldest type of historical documentation and one of the most modern, initiated with reel-to-reel recorders at Columbia University in the 1940s and now taking advantage of 21st-century digital technologies.\nIn Doing Oral History, Donald Ritchie explains, “Oral History collects memories and personal commentaries of historical significance through recorded interviews. An oral history interview generally consists of a well-prepared interviewer questioning an interviewee and recording their exchange in audio or video format. Recordings of the interview are transcribed, summarized, or indexed and then placed in a library or archives. These interviews may be used for research or excerpted in a publication, radio or video documentary, museum exhibition, dramatization or other form of public presentation. Recordings, transcripts, catalogs, photographs and related documentary materials can also be posted on the Internet.\"\nProducing oral histories is a systematic attempt to enlist people with first-hand knowledge of special historical developments and experiences into recording their memories. Oral history is spoken history, subject to all the biases and vagaries inherent in human recall; yet it is not substantially different from other historical sources (diaries, correspondence, official documents, newspapers, photographs, etc.) which are partial and viewed through the subjective screen of contemporary experience. Oral history interviews must be studied along with other contemporary sources for corroboration and authentication.\nThe Oral History Association (OHA) offers several resources covering many facets of oral history. OHA offers a series of publications on community oral history, family oral history, oral history and the law, and other subjects, as well as an annual meeting with introductory, instructive workshops on interviewing, oral history and the law, audio and video preservation, and other subjects.\nThe following sections of this Oral History Primer focus on the interviewing methods and procedures necessary for producing excellent oral history interviews. Adhering to these guidelines will assure the beginning interviewer at least some measure of success and a sense of confidence in carrying out what is a complicated collaboration, what oral historian Michael Frisch has called \"shared authority.\" Technique provides a kind of scaffolding; as one gains experience in the art of listening and in trusting one's judgment during an interview, improvisation and spontaneity can emerge, and the mechanical details will more and more take care of themselves if they are once mastered. You will develop your own style of interviewing, of being of service to your narrator in this endeavor.\nWe also recommend referring to the Oral History Association's Principles and Best Practices for Oral History.\nH-Oralhist is a network for scholars and professionals active in studies related to oral history and is affiliated with the Oral History Association. It is a great place for oral historians to network with others who share their interests and to find the latest news, events, research, and resources.\nA high-quality digital audio recorder with an external microphone is recommended;. Technology in this area is changing rapidly. Oral History in the Digital Age connects you to the latest information on digital technologies pertaining to all phases of the oral history process. This resource is a product of an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) National Leadership project and a collaboration among the Michigan State University Digital Humanities Center, Matrix; the American Folklife Center (AFC/LOC), the Library of Congress; the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage (CFCH); the American Folklore Society (AFS); the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History, University of Kentucky Libraries; and the Oral History Association.\nPractice with your equipment before the interview and test out your equipment again just prior to the interview session. Take along extension cords and fresh batteries. Your own confidence in the equipment and the ease with which you go about setting it up in the presence of the narrator all convey a sense of comfortableness and matter-of-factness which diminish stage-fright and allay anxiety.\nGuidelines for Conducting Oral History Interviews\nIn making the initial contact with a prospective narrator be certain to make a clear presentation of the purpose and nature of the interview. One need not give lengthy explanations but should inform the narrator of the time investment involved, of the general areas to be covered, how the interview will be conducted and what will be done with the recording/transcript, how it will be used and for what purposes. Being explicit and direct with the prospective narrator inspires confidence in the oral history endeavor. This can be outlined in a letter or email inviting the narrator to participate and further discussed in a pre-meeting before the actual interviewing sessions.\nThe interviewer should have a sound general background in the subject or topics to be explored. If the interview is to focus, for example, on the career of a retired attorney, fireman, teacher, or physician, during the 1930's, and the changes in those fields since that period, the interviewer should do enough background reading and research both in libraries and on the Internet (as appropriate) to have some notion of the major trends and highlights in each field. Without any background, the interviewer cannot ask the types of questions that will elicit the most pertinent recollections. Sufficient preparation spells the difference between a valuable and a poor interview. Consult written histories, journal articles, autobiographies, diaries, scrapbooks, newspapers, trade journals, family histories, relatives, friends, and colleagues during this preparatory phase of the work.\nThe Topic Outline\nOnce you have determined the focus of your interview (whether it is autobiographical recollections of family history, or confined to a specific topic (university history, the history of an organic farm, the artistic career of a photographer, etc.) you can begin to sketch out a topic outline, comprised of the biographical and subject information you wish to formulate into topics. Under each broad topical area you will begin to think up more and more detailed subjects. This working outline will give you confidence during the interview and will keep the interview moving in the direction you want to go. The outline is not, however, an inflexible blueprint or a questionnaire; new topics introduced by the narrator should be incorporated in depth if they are of significance. You can use the outline to discuss with the narrator at the pre-meeting what general areas you want to cover. This pre-meeting is also a way of breaking the ice and of empowering the narrator. The narrator may indicate other related topics which they can think of will be useful for the interview, and so constructing the question outline becomes a collaborative endeavor.\nSet-up arrangements should include a location in a quiet place where there won't be interruptions. The narrator's home-- familiar territory--usually enhances the session. Arrange a date and time and telephone or email the day before to remind the person of the session.\nThe Interview Session\nAllow two hours for each session and no more than ninety minutes for the actual recorded portion of the session.\nRemember to take along: paper and pens; recorder, batteries; an extension cord; extra memory cards, the topic outline and necessary research materials. It's sometimes a good idea to offer a cup of water because ninety minutes of talking can put strain on their voice.\nBreaking the Ice\nWhen you arrive and are setting up recording equipment, chat informally to establish rapport, but move as quickly as possible to the interview itself without beginning abruptly. Breaking the ice is an essential phase of an interview. Make sure to turn off your cell phone and ask the narrator to turn off theirs, if possible.\nBasic Interviewing Techniques\n- Ask open-ended questions which can be developed at length by the narrator. Remember the ideal oral history interview is a guided monologue and not a conversation. The interviewer's unobtrusiveness and attention are essential.\n- Start the session with easy and enjoyable kinds of topics and let the narrator run with them. In this way you will establish a pattern of in-depth responses and recollections. The narrator is then able to structure his/her narration of an experience in ways that indicate those factors that they feel are most significant or important. The person also overcomes the natural, initial anxiety once s/he has spoken at length about something s/he knows well. Often the narrator provides highly significant information on subjects you might never have thought of pursuing. By permitting the person to introduce a topic, you are less vulnerable to charges of having asked a \"leading question,\" or of trapping a narrator into talking about sensitive matters. Sample question. Could you tell me something about your adolescent years? About how you started in this business? Instead of interrupting in the beginning of a general question of this kind, jot down questions on your note pad and listen attentively to the interviewee. When a natural pause is reached you may then say, \"Your recollections have brought a great number of subjects/topics to my mind that I would like to know more about . . .\" Never overwhelm with multiple questions. Take your time and never convey hurry or impatience.\n- Learn to listen very carefully. You want the person to develop in as much detail as possible the area of inquiry. Convey your interest by establishing eye contact when appropriate. Don't appear to know everything but do be very well-informed. Indicate that you have read seriously and informed yourself about the subject but that the narrator obviously has specialized, first-hand information which you value. Don't be afraid of silence. Sometimes the narrator needs a few moments to think and collect their thoughts.\nMiscellaneous Interviewing Suggestions. Ask clear, brief open-ended questions requiring detailed answers, particularly at the beginning of the interview so that the narrator will be encouraged to relax and talk freely. Ask provocative questions which further your inquiry, but do not assume an adversarial role. The tone of voice and the way in which a question is phrased convey your intentions. If asking about mistakes or failures in a person's life or career (if pertinent to the inquiry) broach triumphs and successes first. When narrator goes off on a tangent steer him/her back on course gently and firmly. Refrain from making value judgments either implicitly within questions or explicitly. Deal with contradictions in testimony itself or in reference to other sources in a matter-of-fact way, such as: \"I have read in such-and-such or someone else told me just the opposite of what you have just told me. Could you help me to resolve this contradiction, to explain this discrepancy?\" Ask so-called naive questions; they convey to the narrator a sort of subtext, that you are ignorant, but not stupid, and want to know details. Remember: people love to tell about what they know and what they do; given a comfortable, relaxed interpersonal environment you can be of service in helping them to recapture their own memories, their original perceptions of events and experiences. The interaction which is the interview is a unique opportunity not to rehash old memories but to call up the past in fresh, actual recollections of and reflections on the events themselves. Note-taking during the interview session can be helpful if it is not distracting. One can jot down names and places where the spelling is uncertain and ask for correct spellings at the conclusion of the session. Jotting down questions which come up unexpectedly, can contribute to accuracy and thoroughness.\nEthical and Legal Considerations\nAnother important consideration before the actual interview, is obtaining permission to publish the interview. By means of a release form, the interviewer insures both the integrity and continuity of an oral history project and safeguards each narrator's rights. Where a transcript is available, it is usual practice for the narrator to read through the entire manuscript and indicate whether any portions need to be sealed (kept confidential) for a stated length of time. When an indexed recording will be made available to students, library patrons, or scholars, or put on the Internet, it is best to have the narrator sign a release form at the conclusion of the interview session(s). In this latter situation--where a written manuscript is not available for perusal--it is the responsibility of the interviewer to pay heed to possible libelous statements or difficult statements and bring them to the narrator's attention; portions of the interview recording and the transcript can be erased or deleted if libelous, or the entire tape sealed if information is sensitive.\nMost interviews do not contain sensitive personal information and in most cases the signing of a release form is a simple task. See John A. Neuenschwander's Oral History and the Law for model release agreements and much more in-depth information on the legal and ethical issues affecting oral history.\nIt is common practice to give the narrator a copy of his/her recording or a copy of the transcript as a gesture in exchange for their significant investment of time and work in the oral history collaboration. Inquire about diaries, letters, photographs or other historical materials which the narrator might wish to share with you and/or donate to your archive. One must exercise discrimination in collecting such materials, but often photographs can be scanned, or if the materials have real value for archives or institutional collections, one can go to librarians for advice on acquiring them. Often they can considerably illuminate an oral history memoir.\nTranscribing and/or Indexing Oral History Recordings\nDue to the costly and time-consuming process of verbatim transcription of recording, in which one hour of recorded interview equals approximately fifty pages of transcript, and four to six hours of labor, some volunteer projects have chosen to provide detailed indexes for each recording. A topical index for each recording, and an ongoing general index for a collection of recorded oral histories, is an acceptable alternative for making oral history collections usable for researchers. By using the digital counter found on transcription software the indexer can time stamp with accuracy the location on the recording of a certain portion of discussion on each topic covered in the interview. So, if a narrator discusses her childhood, career as a photographer, family history, service in World War II, and work for the U.S. government, each period and topic in the session can be noted and retrieved easily with such an indexing system.\nEstablishing an Oral History Archives/Depository\nA procedure should be established for placing oral histories in local public libraries or some other permanent place where they will be safe, retrievable for use by students and researchers, and correctly stored, (temperature control, etc.) minimizing deterioration of the recording, digital preservation, etc.\nNot only are oral histories useful for scholarly researchers, but they also serve as a unique local resource for educational purposes in our public schools; the study of important developments and events--the Great Depression, World War II, the environmental movement, the women's movement etc. --can be illuminated by the use of oral histories which ground these large scale events in the historical reality at a local level. Textbook history is too often a pre-digested, synthetic version of the past, devoid of humanity and flesh-and-blood reality. Students of history could be significantly enriched if they had a high-quality collection of oral histories from which to learn about both local history and the influence of national trends on their community.\nUpdated August 2013 by Irene Reti, Director, Regional History","Classical music has such a long, storied history, that it can be difficult to know where to start. Each week, we’ll be exploring an important event that left its mark.\nThis week? Gioachino Rossini’s death inspired Verdi to launch an ambitious project involving twelve Italian composers to create a requiem in his honor. The project was eventually aborted, but Verdi’s musical tribute to Rossini survives in the Libera Me of his Messa da Requiem, a grandiose work composed in honor of another idol…\nLike most requiems, Verdi’s Messa da Requiem began with an ending.\n“A great name has disappeared from the world!”\nThe great opera composer Gioachino Rossini died in November 1868, and Giuseppe Verdi—the great opera composer of his own generation—was deeply moved. But, when Verdi wrote the above in a letter, he was also thinking about another Italian artistic titan.\n“When the other one who still lives is no more, what will we have left?”\n“The other one?” He was referring to Alessandro Manzoni, a poet and novelist of about Rossini’s age, best known for The Betrothed. But for now, Verdi’s attention was mainly focused on his dear, departed fellow composer.\nVerdi hit upon an original idea with which to mark Rossini’s life. On the first anniversary of his death, he proposed, a requiem mass would be performed. It would be written jointly by Italy’s leading composers, with Verdi contributing one movement himself—as it transpired, the final movement, Libera me (above).\nAs if that project weren’t unusual enough already, Verdi had some rather specific stipulations. For a start, rather than getting paid, the composers and performers would be expected to contribute financially to the project. After the performance, the score “should be sealed and placed in the archives… from which it should never be taken,” except perhaps for anniversaries. Oh, and Verdi would quit the project immediately if anyone foreign or unartistic became involved.\nCasting an eye over Verdi’s demands, it’s perhaps surprising that the Messa per Rossini project got off the ground at all. But a fairly promising start was not enough to make it happen. The project gave up the ghost fairly slowly, but seems to have been consigned to an unmarked grave by August 1871.\nBy then, however, Verdi had written his own Libera me. “Deliver me, O Lord” says the text… and yet Verdi’s music lingered unperformed.\nThen, on May 22, 1873, Alessandro Manzoni died.\nAnd this time, Verdi decided to write the whole thing himself. He had already written the ending.\nThings went far more smoothly this time. He met his own deadlines, and the first performance did indeed take place on the first anniversary of Manzoni’s death—May 22, 1874—at the church of San Marco in Milan. Unlike the plan for the Rossini requiem, further performances were permitted: three more immediately took place at La Scala. The reaction was positive from almost everyone, with Hans von Bülow one of few exceptions. An “opera in ecclesiastical costume,” he called it. Referring to a sacred work by a leading opera composer, this is surely one of music history’s least imaginative insults.\nThe troubled genesis of Verdi’s Requiem is now a matter for the history books. The ends of Rossini and Manzoni, and the conclusion of the Messa per Rossini project, proved to be the beginning of a work which remains very much alive—above all, thanks to its spectacular Dies irae, that unforgettable whirlwind of wrath and fear that still reverberates today.\nIt’s so thrilling, in fact, that it even seems to have terrified Herbert von Karajan, albeit only briefly.

{"question":"As a linguistics student studying Chinese varieties, I'm curious - how does the mutual intelligibility between Hokkien and Mandarin compare to that between Wenzhou and other Wu languages?","answer":"Hokkien and Mandarin have a level of difference similar to that between English and Icelandic or French and Romanian. Meanwhile, Wenzhou languages show very low mutual intelligibility even among their own varieties - speakers from different areas like Ruian or Longyan struggle to understand each other, despite all being classified under 'Wenzhouese'. This shows that both comparisons demonstrate significant linguistic distance, though Wenzhouese appears to have remarkable internal variation for varieties traditionally grouped together.","context":["Listen to the world's languages! 2: Sinitic and other languages on Phonemica\nFollowing on from the preceding post on listening to the languages of the world by navigating audio samples on maps, here I will introduce Phonemica 乡音苑/ 鄉音苑, a website with user-contributed audio files of Sinitic (and some other nearby) languages, mapped by pins that are (supposedly) colour coded by linguistic affiliations. Even if you are not into Sinitic languages, it is fun to listen to, and familiarise yourself with, the various Sinitic languages. (You know, just in case, e.g., the next pub quiz asks you to distinguish the Cantonese vs. Mandarin vs. Taiwanese Mandarin versions of 'Let It Go'.)\n(And just for fun, unofficial versions of 'Let It Go' in Taiwanese, Shanghainese, and 26 Sinitic lects.)\nThe level of diversity amongst the Sinitic languages is similar to that amongst the Romance languages. At around the same time that Vulgar Latin was spread around by Roman soldiers, Late Archaic/ Early Medieval Chinese was spread around by soldiers of the expanding Qín 秦 (221 – 206 BCE) and Hàn 漢 (206 BCE – 9 CE; 25 – 200 CE) Empires. The Sinitic languages are also commonly known as 'Chinese dialects'. This 'dialect' is a (mis)translation of the Chinese term 方言 (fāngyán in Mandarin). In terms of the dialect vs. language distinction, Chinese linguistics take an approach that is considerably more 'lumpist' than Western linguistics. Mutually unintelligible, but demonstrably related speech varieties are often called 方言 fāngyán of each other in Chinese linguistics. The difference between 'further apart' Sinitic languages like Hokkien and Mandarin is perhaps similar to that between English and Icelandic, French and Romanian, or Russian and Bulgarian. (I like the term 'topolect' as a translation of 方言 fāngyán; see, e.g., Language Log.)\nComing back to Phonemica. The first item that you might find useful is the language selection drop-down list in the top right of the page. Currently there is a selection of English, 中文正體 'Chinese Traditional', 中文简体 'Chinese Simplified', and 한국어 'Korean'. (Ultimately, most things are in Chinese.) After that, you might want to click on the map and click on a pin. Last year when I checked out this website, the pins were nicely colour coded according to the classification of the Sinitic languages in the Language Atlas of China (1987). However, the colour coding is now (Dec 2014) somewhat all over the place, especially for Hakka. (Someone needs to fix this.)\nWhen you click on a pin, a pop-up box appears, giving you brief information about the speaker and the language variety. For instance, the pop-up box of the pin located at Seoul gives you a photo, the speaker ID of 华侨先生 [huáqiáo xiānshēng 'Mister Overseas Chinese'], age, gender, first order dialect group of 官话 'Mandarin', and subdivision of 胶辽官话 'Jiaoliao Mandarin'.\nThe following are the labels of the first order Sinitic dialect groups used in Phonemica (largely identical to the classification used in the Language Atlas of China):\n吴语 Wu (including, e.g., Shanghainese)\n闽语 Min (including, e.g., Hokkien)\n粤语 Yue (including, e.g., Cantonese)\n平话和土话 Pinghua and Tuhua\n(This map and this article from Wikipedia might be useful. See also (*teehee*) de Sousa 2015.)\nThere are also recordings labeled as 多种方言 'multiple dialects', and recordings of non-Sinitic languages like Atayal, 壮语 Zhuang and 诺苏 Nuosu. (There is also Ong Be mislabled as Danzhou Yue in Hainan Island.)\nWhen you click further, it leads you to a more-detailed page about the speaker, with links to the recordings. When you click further and get to the page of the recording, you can play the recording, you see waveforms, and underneath you get (maximally) vernacular in Chinese characters, romanisation, IPA, translation in Mandarin (i.e. Standard Written Chinese), and translation in English.\nThe following are samples of some better known Sinitic languages: Cantonese, Hakka, Hakka, Teochew, Taiwanese, Hokchew, Wenzhou, Shanghainese, Shanghainese, Beijing Mandarin.\nAt the bottom of the homepage are links to various media reports in English and Chinese on the Phonemica project.\nde Sousa, Hilário. 2015. “The Far Southern Sinitic Languages as part of Mainland Southeast Asia”.

Berlin; New York: De Gruyter Mouton.","For May 21, China Real Time Report, the China blog of the Wall Street Journal, featured an article entitled \"Do You Dare Try the Devil-Language? China’s 10 Hardest Dialects\" by Isabella Steger.\nHere's the full list of \"hardest dialects\", with many obvious omissions, such as Fuzhou and Chaozhou / Teochew:\n1. Wenzhou dialect\n3. Suzhou and Minnan dialects\n5. Shaanxi dialect\n6. Changsha dialect\n7. Sichuan dialect\n8. Shandong dialect\n9. Tianjin dialect\n10. Northeast dialect\nThis is quite a motley collection of branches, languages, and topolects, most of which are erroneously called such-and-such a dialect, and two of which are referred to as \"-ese\". Suzhouese and Minnan (no. 3) belong to completely different branches of Sinitic, while Wenzhou, Tianjin, Changsha, and Shanghai are cities, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Sichuan are provinces, and the Northeast is a region (used to be called Manchuria). Half of the items (5, 7, 8, 9, and 10) are considered to be types of Mandarin, though the degree of intelligibility among them varies greatly; the amount of intelligibility among the remaining five, and between those five and the five supposedly Mandarin types is zero or close to it. The five non-Mandarin types belong to or constitute separate, non-Mandarin branches of Sinitic.\nOne of the commenters (Zhang) astutely notes that, if you are referring only to mutually unintelligible spoken varieties, \"then there will be thousands of languages in China.\"\nThe Chinese term for \"devil-language\" is guǐhuà 鬼话. Here it refers to the kind of language spoken by the devil, but in Mandarin it commonly has the extended meaning of \"lie; nonsense; bullshit; deception; humbug\".\nWe have previously come across the notion that one of the non-standard varieties of Sinitic is associated with the devil. See \"Is Cantonese a language, or a personification of the devil?\"\nTwo days later, on May 23, China Real Time Report followed up a special report on the number one allegedly \"hardest dialect\" in China, \"What It’s Like to Live in China and Speak the 'Devil-Language'\", by Lillian Lin.\nThe author states that, when she was living in a college dorm in Beijing, none of her roommates, \"who were from five cities across China, could understand a single word of [her] conversations.\"\nIf you want to hear what Wenzhou language sounds like, there's a half-hour video with ample samples at the end of this article.\nWenzhouese is generally thought of as a highly divergent member of the Wu branch of Sinitic (includes the languages of Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, etc.). In actuality, Wenzhouese should be considered as a group of languages, since several of its constituent varieties have a very low degree of intelligibility among them, as observed by commenter Harland:\nWenzhou dialect isn’t just one monolithic thing, as this article suggests. It’s a whole family of languages in itself. Try speaking Wenzhou language in Ruian or Longyan and see how far you get. It’s a Tower of Babel out here.\nIf all of this talk about \"devil language\" and mutually unintelligible varieties of Sinitic teaches us anything, it is that \"Chinese\" is not a single, monolithic tongue and thousands of dialects that are all the same when written down (one of the grossest myths that is accepted by gospel truth by most people who know nothing about the real situation), but that it consists of innumerable languages and many branches that remain to be classified in a systematic fashion comparable to what we have for Indic, Romance, Germanic, Slavic, and so forth.\nHere follows a sampling of the many Language Log posts dealing with the questions of intelligibility, dialect, and language raised above:\nBased on the materials presented and referred to in the above and other Language Log posts, we need to keep the following caveats in mind when discussing questions of dialect and language in the Chinese context:\n1. There is a huge gulf between spoken and written language in China.\n2. There are countless varieties of spoken Sinitic, many of which are mutually unintelligible.\n3. An adequate taxonomy and classification of the Sinitic family have yet to be adumbrated.\n4. \"Dialect\" is at best a misleading English translation of fāngyán 方言; \"topolect\" is far more accurate.\n5. A precise Chinese translation of \"dialect\" would be something like xiāngyán 相言.\n6. Throughout history, there have basically been two different types of written Chinese: Literary Sinitic and Vernacular Sinitic (a koine or lingua franca). Since around 1920, China has had a written national language that we may refer to as Modern Standard Mandarin (MSM).\n7. The non-standard vernaculars (i.e., all of the non-MSM vernaculars) are almost never written down, and when on rare occasions they do appear in written form, it is usually only as bits and pieces embedded in a fundamentally Mandarin matrix or as a sort of tour de force requiring numerous special characters or in romanized or other phonetic transcription.\n8. Reading aloud a written Chinese text in the pronunciations of the various topolects is a very different matter from the unadulterated forms of the topolects as spoken in daily life.\nPlease, no talk of armies and navies.\n[Hat tip to June Teufel Dreyer.]"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9fc0cefc-46a6-4c0c-afd6-c7168e21d6b5>","<urn:uuid:72c7b720-619c-487e-afa5-c1cddbd868c5>"],"error":null}

His reign was marked by the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the collapse of the South Sea Company in 1720. His poor English and absences in Germany aided the development of Cabinet government and the office of prime minister.\nGeorge II came close to losing his throne in 1745, at the time of the second Jacobite rising. He was King during the War of the Austrian Succession and at the start of the Seven Years’ War. Largely inactive politically, he had a passion for the military and was the last British monarch to lead his troops into battle.\nThroughout his reign, George III tried to maintain the influence of the Crown in politics. He was widely blamed for the loss of America but regained his popularity. He was King during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, but his deteriorating health led to the appointment of his son as Regent in 1811.\nUnlike the frugal and respectable George III, George IV was a lavish spender who was involved in many scandals, notably his divorce from Queen Caroline. But he also had excellent taste and was the patron of numerous artists and architects. He was the founder of many of today’s great collections.\nBrother of George IV, William IV had not expected to be King and had spent much of his life in the Navy. Though he had little political experience, he handled the crisis surrounding the reform of Parliament with skill. His relatively simple lifestyle brought the monarchy more in tune with middle-class values.\nVictoria’s reign was the longest in British history and saw the transformation of all aspects of life. Her happy marriage and many children embodied the ideal of ‘Victorian respectability’. In her last years, she was especially popular and closely associated with pride in the empire – the real theme of her Jubilees.\nRobert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford (1676 – 1745) is generally regarded as having been the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. Although the position of \"Prime Minister\" had no recognition in law or official use at the time, Walpole is nevertheless acknowledged as having held the office de facto because of his influence within the Cabinet. First elected in 1701, Walpole served during the reigns of George I and George II. His tenure is normally dated from 1721 when he obtained the post of First Lord of the Treasury. Walpole continued to govern until his resignation in 1742 prompted by the Battle of Cartagena disaster, making his administration the longest in British history. Because of his homely ways and strong Norfolk roots, he was often known to both friends and detractors as the \"fat old Squire of Norfolk.\"\nRobert Adam (1728 – 1792) was a Scottish neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. In 1754 he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return he established a practice in London, where he developed the \"Adam Style\" and his theory of \"movement\" in architecture based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country.\nThe Penny Black was the world’s first adhesive postage stamp. It was introduced in Britain in 1840 as a part of a wide-ranging postal reform, and it marked a turning point in British social history. In his 1838 proposal to Parliament, Rowland Hill, the Victorian social reformer, suggested that: \"the postage on all letters received in a post-town, and delivered in the same, or any other post-town in the British Isles, shall be at the uniform rate of one penny per half ounce.” The concept of a uniform postal rate revolutionised the way people sent mail; where a set fee guaranteed carriage and delivery to anywhere in the country, replacing a complex system of prices and distances.\nOn 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed George III as the longest-reigning monarch in English, Scottish, and British history. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, to coincide with her Diamond Jubilee which was made a festival of the British Empire at the suggestion of Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. The prime ministers of all the self-governing dominions were invited, and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession through London included troops from all over the empire. The parade paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside St Paul's Cathedral, throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage. The celebration was marked by great outpourings of affection for the septuagenarian Queen.

{"question":"As an educator concerned with standardized testing, I'm curious about the relationship between arts education and academic performance. What evidence exists for its impact on test scores, and what are the social-emotional benefits for students?","answer":"Research shows strong evidence for both academic and social-emotional benefits of arts education. Academically, students who took four years of performing arts courses scored 100 points higher on SATs than those who took fewer or no courses. Studies also show that integrating arts into schools led to an 11% increase in English Language Arts proficiency scores. Rather than cutting arts education to focus on test preparation, evidence suggests this may actually lower test scores. On the social-emotional side, arts education helps students develop self-awareness, stronger sense of individualism, and higher self-esteem. Dance and music instruction have been shown to decrease depression scores and improve executive functioning skills like time-management, focus, and decision-making. Arts programs also foster collaboration, create strong relationships between students and teachers, and help students build tolerance and understanding for others.","context":["Dance, music and theater programs may make frequent appearances on school budget-cut lists, but eliminating the performing arts from education could have costly effects for students. A 2012 report by the U.S. Department of Education revealed a significant drop in the availability of performing arts programs compared to a decade ago, reports the National Education Association. The performing arts not only provide opportunities for students to develop creative passions but also teach communication, language and leadership in unique ways that inspire individualism.\nMaking Students Self-Aware\nParticipating in performing-arts programs helps students develop a stronger sense of individualism, self-reflection and self-esteem. Participating in these activities helps them learn to commit to a task; prepare themselves emotionally, physically and mentally; and work toward the goals of mastering and sharing their skills. For example, musicians must commit to an individual practice schedule to aim for a successful concert, while actors must tap into the particular experiences of their characters to achieve a realistic performance onstage. As they engage with these skills, students learn to critique their abilities, recognize their strengths and weaknesses and make plans to acquire new skills.\nImproving Academic Performance\nStudents who work individually to hone their performance skills ultimately reap the benefits of better grades and test scores. Students who participate in arts programs are more likely to take advanced math courses, graduate from high school and go on to college than those who don't, summarizes a 2012 report by the National Endowment for the Arts. Similarly, the organization Americans for the Arts reports that in 2012 students who took four years of performing arts courses in high school scored 100 points better than students who took less or no courses.\nStrengthening School Community\nThe strong sense of individuality and high level of achievement associated with performing-arts education ultimately affects students' relationships to the school as a whole. Involvement with theater, music and dance creates strong relationships between students, teachers and advisers, reinforcing their identity within their educational community. Collaborating with other students in artistic settings can also provide opportunities to encounter different cultures by working with different types of music or plays of different subject matters. This can help students build higher levels of tolerance and understanding for others and become more willing to work with people who are different from them.\nPreparing for Future Careers\nWhile not all students involved with the performing arts may plan to pursue them professionally, the Arts Education Partnership states that participating in dramatic and musical programs can help them develop skills that are a growing necessity in the 21st-century workplace. Participation in the arts inspires greater creativity -- an increasingly valued skill in work environments; working with others as part of a music ensemble or cast of a play can create stronger communication and teamwork skills. In addition, the strong sense of individualism the performing arts inspires can help students grow up to be stronger career leaders.\n- North Carolina Public Schools: Arts Education and 21st Century Skills in North Carolina\n- California County Superintendents Educational Services Association: The Visual and Performing Arts Core Principles\n- National Endowment for the Arts: The Arts and Achievement in At-Risk Youth\n- Americans for the Arts: Arts Students Outperform Non-Arts Students on SAT\n- Arts Eduation Partnership: Preparing Students for the Next America\n- Glendale Unified School District California: Visual and Performing Arts\n- NEA Today: The Good and Bad News About Arts Education in US Schools\n- Thos Robinson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images","Making the Case for Arts Education in Urban Schools\nShould all students receive art education? Does art education correlate with achievement in other academic areas? What are the social outcomes of art programs in public schools? Is there research to support evidence-based practice in art instruction? Arts education in public schools is an area rich in policy questions, and because it affects public funding distribution, it is an ideal subject for a by-the-numbers assessment.\nLearning through the arts reinforces critical academic skills in reading, language arts and math and provides students with the skills to creatively solve problems.\nA simple way to assess the importance and impact of arts education programs on students is to look at the academic, psychological and social effects of arts education on urban schools. It is important to note that urban public schools often serve greater numbers of students of low socioeconomic standing (SES) and English Language Learners (ELL), in addition to special needs students1. The Institute of Education Sciences Condition of Education Report found that in 2012-2013, higher concentrations of students from low SES backgrounds (those who qualified for free lunch programs) and minority students were enrolled in urban public schools than in suburban or rural schools.2\nUrban Schools Have Unequal Access to Arts Education\nUnfortunately, in many districts arts education has borne the brunt of funding cuts as school districts made changes to accommodate No Child Left Behind policies, and then in the wake of cutbacks during the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The difficulty in maintaining arts education continues in an environment of severe teacher shortages. Cuts to the arts come at a time when the creativity and mode of thinking that arts education fosters is perhaps most needed by students. They must navigate a competitive higher education landscape and job market that place value on individuals savvy in art applications, especially digital art.\nArts education aids students in skills needed in the workplace: flexibility, the ability to solve problems and communicate, the ability to learn new skills, to be creative and innovative, and to strive for excellence.\nUrban schools especially have struggled to maintain arts programming. A new analysis, “Equity, the Arts, and Urban Education: A Review” published by The Urban Review, found that student access to arts education declined from 65 percent in 1982 to a low of 50 percent in 2008, and that access fell more sharply for black and Hispanic students than for their white counterparts.3 Urban schools, the schools that most often fail to meet state standards across multiple years, also tend to have a much higher population of disadvantaged students. Under No Child Left Behind legislation, underperforming schools were forced to reduce their arts programming in order to devote more time to math and language arts teaching and test preparation, according to The Urban Review report. However, research demonstrates that this policy lacks effectiveness and creates a dearth of arts education in urban schools.\nA 2012 study, “The Effects of High-Stakes Testing Policy on Arts Education,” noted that withholding arts education in order to designate more time for standardized testing subjects did not improve test scores.4 It actually correlated with lower scores at some schools. As explained below, access to arts education improves students’ psychological, social and academic outcomes.\nKey Takeaway: Arts education is often among the first areas to receive cuts due to funding or state standardized test score requirements. However, studies show that cutting arts education may in fact lead to lower student test scores.\nMore Art Equals More Achievement\nMore than two decades of research is available on the academic outcomes of arts education programming. A pivotal 2000 study, “SAT Scores of Students Who Study the Arts,” demonstrates that strong support for arts education has a positive effect on academic outcomes. The study found that the more years of art classes a student engaged in, the higher his or her SAT score was, especially when four or more years of art classes had been taken.5\nThose findings were strengthened by a 2009 study, “Doing Well and Doing Good by Doing Art,” by James Catterall. The study followed 12,000 students, tracking their academic development from age 18 to 26. Catterall found that SES students who engaged in the arts showed significantly higher rates of college attendance, favorable college grades, and better job opportunities. Additionally, this study noted that ELL students showed improved academic performance in schools that offered more arts education.6\nA 2014 study, “Positive Impact of Arts Integration on Student Academic Achievement in English Language Arts,” likewise noted that arts education has a broad impact, improving academic outcomes in other subjects.7 With a focus on the importance of standardized test scores, this study found that schools that introduced art concepts into lessons on other topics saw an 11 percent increase in the number of students that scored proficient on ELA standardized testing.\nThe arts significantly boost student achievement, reduce discipline problems, and increase the odds students will go on to graduate from college.\nArts education research is also available on subject-specific achievement:\n- Strengthening Verbal Skills Through the Use of Classroom Drama: A Clear Link,” by Ann Podlozny: This study found a statistically significant relationship between drama integration and story recall, reading achievement on standardized tests, language development, and writing ability.8\n- “Music and Mathematics: Modest Support for the Oft-Claimed Relationship,” by Kathryn Vaughn: This meta-analysis found a significant relationship between music instruction and math achievement.9\n- “Arts Integration and the Success of Disadvantaged Students: A Research Evaluation,” by A. Helene Robinson: This study found that drama integration might be regarded as an evidence-based practice for increasing disadvantaged students’ grades in reading and math, social skills, expressive and receptive language, and creative thinking.10\nBut why does art education boost student’s achievement in other subjects? Some researchers point to social cognitive theory as an explanation. The theory proposes that we learn through association, through forming connections between things. The more mediums involved in learning, the more opportunities there are for connections to be made and strengthened. For example, if you could choose between watching an all-text presentation on a topic or a presentation that included diagrams and pictures, you’d probably chose the latter — not only is it more engaging, the material would be easier to understand.\nArts Education Leads to Pro-Social Outcomes\nResearch has demonstrated that students who receive arts education are more likely to participate in pro-social activities. In “No Child Left With Crayons,” Sharon Verner Chappell and Melisa Cahnmann-Taylor explain, “When students engage in arts processes, they develop distinct and complementary social practices: developing craft, engaging and persisting, envisioning, expressing, observing, reflecting, stretching and exploring, and understanding art worlds.” This study suggests that arts education is an outlet for students to recognize how the world views them and how they wish to be seen. It proposes that arts programming in schools and in the community that draws inspiration from the language and culture of disadvantaged populations promotes positive social critique and advocacy for justice.11\nAdditionally, the study by Robinson found that arts education promoted schools environments that were “collaborative, caring, and inclusive of students with special needs.”12 Arts education was also seen as fostering greater volunteerism and political participation.13\nArts Education Fosters Positive Psychological Development\nA recent study found that students who received 15 weeks of dance or music instruction showed decreases in their depression scores on the Children’s Depression Inventory. Additionally, the students who received music instruction showed an increase in their self-esteem scores after the 15 weeks, as measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Additionally, both dance and music groups showed an increase in executive functioning skills, including time-management, focus, decision-making, and planning.\nThe arts are not a frill. The arts are a response to our individuality and our nature, and help to shape our identity. What is there that can transcend deep difference and stubborn divisions? The arts. They have a wonderful universality. Art has the potential to unify. It can speak in many languages without a translator. The arts do not discriminate. The arts can lift us up.\nAccess to arts education has many benefits both inside and outside of the classroom. Research suggests that arts programming may lead to greater academic achievement in terms of test scores, may enhance prosocial skills such as community involvement and volunteerism, and likewise may play a role in the development of important cognitive skills including planning and decision-making. Thus, arts education could serve as an important tool for disadvantaged and urban schools in meeting both academic and social goals.\n1 Barnett, B. G., & Stevenson, H.

{"question":"How do federal investments in surface water quality compare to air pollution control in terms of their cost-effectiveness and measurable benefits?","answer":"According to cost-benefit analyses, surface water regulations are less cost-effective than air pollution controls. Surface water is the only category where total estimated costs exceed benefits, with benefits only reaching 80% of costs and 67% of surface-water regulations failing cost-benefit tests. In contrast, only 8% of air pollution regulations fail such tests. Meanwhile, air quality improvements have been remarkable - by 2016, combined emissions of six criteria air pollutants were down 73% since 1970, with at least 30% reductions in carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide levels since 1980. Additionally, AAPCA Member States achieved significant air quality improvements while supporting economic growth, reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by nearly 60% between 1997-2017.","context":["The Cuyahoga has not burned since 1969 and is now home to 40 species of fish. But water pollution issues are not just a part of history. Today, more than half of U.S. rivers and lakes violate environmental standards, and 4–28 percent of Americans in a typical year receive drinking water from systems that violate health‐based standards. Flint, Michigan, recently exposed 100,000 residents to dangerous levels of lead in drinking water. Contaminated drinking water leads an estimated 16 million Americans to suffer from gastrointestinal illnesses annually.\nPolls also suggest that water pollution has been Americans’ top environmental concern for at least 30 years. Sixty percent of Americans today list drinking‐water pollution and also river and lake pollution as great concerns. In every survey since 1989, the share concerned about these issues has substantially exceeded the share expressing concern about air pollution, climate change, or other environmental problems.\nThe federal government sought to address these concerns by creating the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, the Clean Water Act in 1972, and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974. The Clean Water Act regulates “surface waters” — rivers, lakes, and some ocean areas. Whether the Clean Water Act regulates groundwater, which includes subsurface aquifers, is legally disputed. The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates drinking water, which includes groundwater or surface water that is purified by a drinking‐water treatment plant and then transported by pipe to households and businesses.\nA half century later, these laws still manage U.S. surface and drinking water. Since 1970, the United States has spent approximately $4.8 trillion (in 2017 dollars) to clean up surface‐water pollution and provide clean drinking water, or more than $400 annually for every American. In the average year, this accounts for 0.8 percent of the gross domestic product, making clean water arguably the most expensive environmental investment in U.S. history. By comparison, the average American spends $60 annually on bottled water.\nWe ask four main questions: What forces led to these laws? How do they regulate pollution? How effective and efficient have they been? Why has recent economic research focused relatively little on water pollution, and what can remedy this lack of research? We illustrate that water pollution provides an excellent setting to learn about externalities, cost‐benefit analysis, local public goods, fiscal federalism, regulatory design, nonmarket valuation, and other classic economic issues. Indeed, water pollution is a textbook example of an externality — introductory texts have long used the example of a plant dumping waste into a river and causing people downstream to suffer to illustrate the concept of externalities.\nWe emphasize several main conclusions. Many measures of drinking‐ and surface‐water pollution have fallen since the EPA’s founding, due at least in part to the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The progress, however, is incomplete. William Ruckelshaus, first head of the EPA, noted, “Even if all of our waters are not swimmable or fishable, at least they are not flammable.”\nBut while these large investments in drinking water do appear to create substantial health benefits, existing evidence suggests that estimated costs of most investments in cleaning up rivers, lakes, and oceans exceed their measured benefits. A summary of cost‐benefit analyses of 240 regulations implemented by the federal government between 1992 and 2017 finds that out of five categories of regulations (surface water, drinking water, air pollution, greenhouse gases, and all other regulations, including nonenvironmental ones), surface‐water regulations are the only category where total estimated costs exceed total estimated benefits. Estimated total benefits are only 80 percent of estimated total costs, and the mean regulation has benefits that are only 57 percent of its costs. Sixty‐seven percent of surface‐water regulations fail a cost‐benefit test, compared to 20 percent of drinking‐water regulations and 8 percent of air pollution regulations.\nIt is noted that many of these estimates have difficulty quantifying several important channels of benefits and may be understating true benefits. But even if costs are underestimated, there are several reasons regulation of surface‐water quality could produce smaller net benefits than other types of environmental investments. For example, surface‐water policy does not typically use market‐based instruments, such as cap‐and‐trade markets or pollution taxes, which are generally cost effective. Beyond specific policy choices, surface waters may be more substitutable than other environmental goods — changing the river where a person goes fishing or boating may be less costly than changing the air a person breathes or the water a person drinks.\nUnfortunately, economic research on water pollution and its regulation has been limited. An important task for research is to assess which investments in surface‐water pollution create net benefits and ways to make these investments more effective.\nThis research brief is based on David A. Keiser and Joseph S. Shapiro, “U.S. Water Pollution Regulation over the Last Half Century: Burning Waters to Crystal Springs?,” Journal of Economic Perspectives 33, no. 4 (2019): 51–75, https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.51.","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nAAPCA Releases 2018 Edition of The Greatest Story Seldom Told\nAnnual air quality report highlights key metrics and success stories from state and local air quality agencies\nJuly 2, 2018\nToday, the Association of Air Pollution Control Agencies (AAPCA) released the 2018 edition of The Greatest Story Seldom Told: Profiles and Success Stories in Air Pollution Control. State and local air agencies have been at the forefront of the significant progress in air quality that has been achieved over the past several decades.\nFirst published in April 2017, AAPCA’s report catalogues air quality metrics and trends using publicly available data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies. These trends range from concentrations of criteria air pollutants and visibility progress in national parks to permitting and compliance and enforcement statistics. Where applicable, this report also presents the trend lines of economic and social indicators that provide important context for air quality.\nIn cases where data sets allow state-to-state comparisons, the report highlights areas where the twenty states that serve on the AAPCA Board of Directors have provided leadership in improving air quality.\n“The remarkable progress that has been made in air quality is a great story that underscores the work of state and local air agencies,” said AAPCA President Stuart Spencer, Associate Director for the Arkansas Division for Air Quality. “The 2018 edition of The Greatest Story Seldom Told continues to provide vital context for this improvement, and demonstrates that AAPCA members are dedicated to engaging with U.S. EPA and stakeholders to realize the best outcomes for air quality.”\nAAPCA Vice President Nancy Vehr, Air Quality Administrator for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality added that “AAPCA members are proud to highlight the successes that have been achieved in controlling for air pollution. As this report shows, state members of the Association have provided leadership in nearly every metric while accommodating growing populations and economies.”\nSome key statistics from 2018 edition of The Greatest Story Seldom Told include:\n- As of 2016, combined emissions of the six criteria air pollutants for which there are national ambient air quality standards were down 73 percent since 1970.\n- According to U.S. EPA’s analysis of 2016 monitoring data, there has been at least a 30-percent reduction in the ambient levels of carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide since 1980, and available monitoring data for fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) show similar trends.\n- From 2006 to 2016, AAPCA Member States were responsible for approximately 66.5 percent of the national reduction in reported toxic air releases, accounting for more than 551-million pounds of the 829-million-pound total reduction.\n- Between 1997 and 2017, AAPCA Member States reduced nitrogen oxide emissions by nearly 60 percent, from over 12.6 million tons to less than 5.4 million tons.\n- As of 2016, AAPCA Member States had reduced electricity sector sulfur dioxide emissions by 9.3 million tons compared to 1990.\n- From 2000 to 2015, the 20 states that comprise the AAPCA Board of Directors reduced energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by 337.4 million metric tons, accounting for more than 56 percent of cumulative national reductions.\n- According to U.S. EPA’s Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO), states were the leaders in full compliance evaluations related to the Clean Air Act, conducting full compliance evaluations for more than 14,000 facilities in 2017, more than 80 times as many that were conducted by EPA.\nThe Association of Air Pollution Control Agencies (AAPCA) is a national, non-profit, consensus-driven organization focused on assisting state and local air quality agencies and personnel with implementation and technical issues associated with the federal Clean Air Act. AAPCA members work collaboratively on behalf of states and the communities they protect to act as a conduit for and provide feedback to federal regulators on air quality rules that have significant impacts across the entire nation. AAPCA represents more than 40 state and local air agencies, and senior officials from 20 state environmental agencies currently sit on AAPCA’s Board of Directors. AAPCA is housed in Lexington, Kentucky as an affiliated association of The Council of State Governments (CSG).\nAssociation of Air Pollution Control Agencies | 1776 Avenue of the States | Lexington, Kentucky 40511\n# # #"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:458bfb09-4cd7-42ca-836d-8d1296976ba1>","<urn:uuid:c7f8830c-38c4-4a15-a4f5-568bb3a0da91>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the difference between soundproofing and acoustic treatment?","answer":"Soundproofing is the technique of preventing sound from entering and exiting a place, while acoustic treatment refers to controlling reverberations and echoes to improve sound quality within a room. Acoustic panels can be used during acoustic treatment to minimize reverberations and deflect echoes to create an ideal sound recording environment.","context":["Mic test… Mic test… okay, when it comes to setting up a home recording studio for music production, podcasting, or other forms of audio work, one key consideration is soundproofing. Do you know how to soundproof a studio? Even if you have the most expensive recording equipment on the market, your audience will be able to identify if you recorded in an unsuitable atmosphere for dealing with sound.\nYou’ll need to block outside noises from being heard, especially if the noise is coming from a drum, and record if you want to get the most out of your equipment and generate only professional-quality audio. Fortunately, effective sound insulation allows you to keep your noise inside while without bothering your neighbors. So, without further ado, let’s start!\nWhat’s the Difference Between Soundproofing and Acoustic Treatment?\nLet us first differentiate these two, because the words soundproofing and acoustic treatment are sometimes used interchangeably, but they have different meanings! The technique of soundproofing involves preventing sound from entering and exiting a place. Controlling reverberations and echoes in order to improve sound quality within a room is referred to as acoustic treatment (more info about soundproofing and acoustic treatment on soundguys.com).\nAcoustic panels can be used to minimize reverberations and deflect echoes during the acoustic treatment process to produce an ideal sound recording environment.\nSo, How to Soundproof a Studio?\nAs we mentioned before, there are four main methods for soundproofing a room.\n- The first is absorption, it’s about adding materials that absorb and trap sound waves.\n- The second is damping, it is the process of removing vibrational energy from a structure before it accumulates and produces sound waves.\n- The third one is decoupling, it is about creating a barrier between two structures that are in direct touch with one another to prevent sound transmission.\n- Lastly, filling the gaps, it’s about filling air spaces in a structure to prevent sound waves from easily passing through.\nNow that you’ve familiarized yourself with these methods, we will now incorporate them in soundproofing a studio.\nAdding a Mass\nThe most basic soundproofing strategy is to increase the amount of material inside the room’s perimeter. This thickens and densifies your walls, making it more difficult for sound wave energy to vibrate them. Sound will either be reflected, absorbed into the mass, or both when it reaches a thick barrier. This essentially blocks sound from entering and exiting the room. Here are few things you should do in adding a mass.\n1. Build a Denser Wall\nIf you’re starting from scratch, go with thicker drywall (about 1.6cm) to absorb more sound. To add an extra layer, use a sound isolation barrier or “sheet block” on the interior of the drywall. If you’re merely looking to improve an existing wall, you may use one of these methods:\n- Use the sheet block and place it on the exterior of the wall, and cover it with a second (thinner) layer of drywall.\n- Make a basic wall frame, connect it to the wall surface, attach it to existing studs, and paint it.\nVideo: Home Studio Soundproofing: 3 Big Mistakes To Avoid To Reduce Noise – AcousticsInsider.com\n2. Add a Padding\nEven if you build a denser wall, soundproofing may be improved by adding absorbent panels or foam mats that reduce sounds within the room while simultaneously absorbing sounds from outside. 12”x12” acoustic wedge-style wall panels are popular because they absorb both high and low frequencies effectively.\nThese foam panels are made to respond to sound in a regulated way, ensuring that you don’t wind up with an acoustically deadened space. They’re usually packaged with adhesive peeling for quick and easy installation on walls and ceilings. Invest in panels with a fiberglass core for the greatest results, since these have excellent sound absorption ratings and are quite durable, and easy to clean (read more about soundproofing materials on silencewiki.com)!\nVideo: $50 DIY vs $450 PRO Acoustical Panels (Worth It?) – Echo & Sound Proofing\nEven with denser surfaces, vibrations may not be totally dissipated, particularly in the bass area. These vibrations typically move throughout the room on the wooden frame, up the drywalls, and up your mic stands, causing disruptions in your recordings, well, you don’t want that!\n1. Green Glue\nGreen Glue (official website) is currently considered the most efficient damping material available in the market. Green Glue is sandwiched between two solid panels, such as drywall, plywood, or medium-density fiberboard (MDF), using two tubes per 48-foot sheet. You can simply establish a makeshift sound barrier for your studio by taping it to the floor, ceiling, walls, or even the door.\n2. Acoustical Glue\nAlternatively, you can use acoustical glue. This carefully developed elastic sealant, also known as acoustical caulk adhesive, and may be used to make wall frames and install drywall. It is widely acknowledged as the most effective strategy for reducing noise in a space. It will keep things together while damping bass vibrations if you use enough of it (more about acoustic sealants on soundproofnation.com).\nTo increase soundproofing, you may also use regular caulk to cover minor cracks, gaps, and seams in and around the walls and windows. Some caulks are water-based or paintable, making them easier to clean and conceal if they don’t match your walls’ color.\nWhen two constructions in your room are directly in contact with one another, sound vibrations from one can easily migrate to the other, aggravating the initial issue. Decoupling is the technique of preventing sound transmission by separating the contact points, which is commonly done with thick, malleable rubber.\nWhen you don’t have the option of knocking down or rebuilding your walls to add insulation and soundproofing materials, this is a great alternative. It’s also useful for getting crisper instrumental sounds in isolated booths with separate microphones. Here’s how to get started with structural decoupling:\n1. Build a Floating Floor\nIf you have space underneath you, you may need to use the same doubling principle for your floors. Instead of dampening glue and drywall, add a drywall layer to create an air gap between the layers. Many people also prefer to “float” the floor by covering it with thick soundproofing mats.\n2. Install Isolation Pads\nRemember those fantastic studio monitors you bought for your studio? Vibrations that you don’t want to be transmitted through surfaces are easily produced by them. Consider investing in isolation foam pads or a thick rug to lay behind your speakers. Isolation pads are also available for your drum set and other sound equipment that produces vibrations.\n3. Build Air Gaps\nWhisper clips and channels can be used when your inner wall components don’t meet and you can’t use an acoustic sealant to keep your walls and ceilings together.\nThe advantage of adopting these is that it separates your structural layers, resulting in air gaps that prevent bass vibrations from going directly from the frame to the drywall and into your room, and vice versa.\nYou may utilize the whisper clips and channels to construct a secondary wall to get the same isolating or “floating” effect even if you’ve previously filled your wall with stiff fiberglass and used an acoustical sealant to attach drywall over it. This soundproofing method enhances the absorption of noises and vibrations, making it perfect for professional recording studios (The Pros and Cons of Whisper Clips on soundproofcentral.com).\n4. Other Decoupling Techniques\n|Constructing Double Walls||This allows an air gap to assist block sound and can be improved by adding insulation to the open space.|\n|Isolating Layers||Creating a “floating” wall/ceiling with robust channels and robust sound clips.|\n|Isolating Structure||Joist gasket tape is used to isolate studs from the floors, walls, and ceilings.|\nVideo: How To Soundproof A Recording Studio\nClosing Air Gaps\nThis final step may appear to be a minor annoyance, but it is truly the cherry on top. If you neglect this step, you’ll undo all of your hard work and investment in your space. The good news is that it isn’t difficult, expensive, or time-consuming. All you want to do now is go back over your hard work and fill in any air spaces or gaps that have appeared.\n1. Seal the Gaps\nOnce you’ve identified the gaps, fill them with foam gaskets of the proper size. There are several inexpensive foam fillers that work well, but for more vibration absorption, you may load them with more insulation before sealing them up with the foam. The following are the three most frequent tools for plugging such gaps:\n|Acoustical Caulk||As we said before, this can be used to cover any gaps in the room’s perimeter, as well as any small holes that may occur elsewhere. This sort of caulk stays soft and malleable over time, so no gaps will appear.|\n|Foam Gaskets||These seal air gaps around electrical outlets, windows, and doors, among other things.|\n|Automatic Door Bottoms||Which close the gap between the door’s bottom and the ground. Which is identical to this other solution…|\n2. Install a Door Sweep\nFinally, seal the space between your door and the floor. Install a more professional-looking door sweep that instantly fills the gap with rubber or uses a long, horizontal pad that can simply be placed just below your door. Any thick door insert will suffice, but one that is dense enough to effectively block out noise is ideal.\n3. Other Solutions\nIf things are still not enough with the solutions we mentioned above, try these other solutions:\n|Use a laptop stand||When laptops grow heated, the fans kick in and make a lot of noise. Using a laptop stand is a terrific method to keep your computer cool. This raises the computer off the table and allows air to circulate under it. The fan still interacts now and then, but not nearly as frequently as before.|\n|Create acoustic separation||While this won’t entirely solve the issue. At the very least, creating maximum acoustic separation between your computer and mic can reduce noise to an acceptable level.|\n|Get an IsoBox||The IsoBox, is a high-end rack that addresses a number of issues that ordinary studio racks overlook. It features a soundproof cage that guards against overheating with a silent cooling fan and an alarm that warns you if there are any difficulties to address the problem of computer noise.|\nAs you can see, soundproofing in a studio needs some construction work, but there’s a bunch you can do without hiring a carpenter to limit the amount of sound that leaks into and out of a room.\nIt’s not difficult, and most of the work can be done by yourself. It’s just a little on the costly side. However, every money invested in a project like this will pay off in terms of the quality of your recordings thereafter.

{"question":"How should power management be handled in Arduino robot projects while ensuring fire safety?","answer":"Power management in Arduino robot projects requires using a 9V step-up booster to convert 4.8V from Ni-MH batteries to 9V for powering the Nano through Vin pin, while motors can run on 4.8V or 6V. For fire safety, it's crucial to avoid using lithium batteries as they are highly flammable and may explode when exposed to heat. The system should include proper ventilation to dissipate heat generated by current flow, secure connections to prevent resistance-related heating, and careful monitoring of input voltage and current levels. Additionally, the project should not be overloaded with too many components drawing significant current, as this can cause dangerous temperature increases and potential fire hazards.","context":["I’m always looking for a new project to do at my robotics workshop for kids. While spider robots are intriguing, almost all of them are either too complex involving 10+ servos or way over-budget for my workshop. In search for cheaper alternatives, I found this project: http://letsmakerobots.com/node/38744. Since this project appears to fit my budget range of $40-$60 and not too difficult (I think) for kids to work on, I decided to build a prototype. My version will have two operating modes:\n- Remote control using bluetooth module (HC-06) and an Android phone app. This is the default start-up mode.\n- Autonomous line-following. This mode is selected through an Android phone app.\nLet’s start building.\nStep 1: Parts and Tools\n- 2 x Spider robot kit. (Buy two kits from robotshop.com (http://www.robotshop.com/en/dfrobot-spider-robot-frame-kit.html), Amazon, Ebay, or Aliexpress)\n- 4 x Ni-MH battery/charger combo and AA battery holder\n- On-Off Switch\n- Mini breadboard\n- Arduino Nano (cheaper compatible works fine)\n- Motor driver (Using TB6612FNG breakout but L298x based driver should work just as well)\n- Bluetooth HC-06 module (mine is model fc-114)\n- 2 x IR line tracker sensor module\n- 9v step-up booster (4 x Ni-MH is only 4.8v. While motors will use 4.8v, I need to boost voltage to 9V to power Nano through Vin)\n- Dupont cables (male to male)\n- Approx 4” x 4” cardboard used as a platform. (This is just a prototype. Who cares how it looks.)\nUsual tools such as a wire cutter, soldering iron, and glue gun were used in this project.\nStep 2: Chassis\nSee http://letsmakerobots.com/node/38744 for building the base chassis. While 8 leg linkages are obtained from a single kit, you’ll need to use following parts from another kit to complete the chassis:\n- Motor and body\n- Leg linkage case without gears (This is used for joining two independent leg linkages)\n- Cross beam\nSince the built-in battery housing on the body pieces are not needed in my design, cut off about 3mm from the height and glue the platform cardboard on top. Use leftover plastic pieces to build a truss to support the platform above motors and build mounting beams for IR line tracking sensors between two motors.\nAs for the on-off switch location, I put that on next to the battery pack. This required cutting the plastic underneath the platform. I think the better location would be between the cardboard and the plastic body underneath the cardboard and use a glue gun to secure it.\nStep 3: Electronics\nWire all the components according to the diagram. You’ll notice that I use 9v step-up boost converter to power Nano through Vin pin. This eliminates having another 9V battery for the logic. Motors are still powered by 6V or 4.8V if using Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.\nStep 4: Android Mobile App\nWhile I could have built my own app using MIT App Inventor, why reinvent the wheel when there are numerous already written apps that fit for this purpose? I downloaded few from Google Play to evaluate them and eventually decided to use Arduino Bluetooth Controller. In Controller Mode, I customized following buttons to send specific characters that are recognized by the code.\n- Left = “l” (turn left)\n- Right = “r” (turn right)\n- Up = “u” (go forward)\n- Down = “d” (go reverse)\n- X = “s” (stop)\n- Select = “t” (toggle between RC and Line Following Mode)\nSee the video on the Intro page to see how the app works.\nStep 5: Code\nDownload the attached Arduino IDE code. Comments in the code should explain what’s going on in the code. It was written for Nano but it should work on other Arduino boards with no or little mods.\nStep 6: Future Improvements\nThe kit comes with a motor that is designed for low voltage/high current environment. When using an H bridge driver such as TB6612FNG, it’s better to use high voltage/low current motors. This may explain why, with heavier alkaline batteries, it couldn’t lift the body up to take a step. If you run into this problem, perhaps get a different set of motors such as this: https://www.pololu.com/product/1117. On my other tank project, I eventually had to switch out the motors that came with Tamiya twin-motor gearbox with this one to increase torque.","I’ll never forget a bad experience I had once as an electronics apprentice. When it comes to working with electronic equipment, Arduino included, knowing how to deal with fire hazards is crucial. If ignored, your Arduino can catch fire and cause you damage even if it’s the smallest component, such as a diode.\nBut, can Arduino catch fire? Here’s what you need to know: Yes! Arduino can catch fire under certain conditions. If this is not taken into considerations when working on your projects, it can cause serious damages or even hurt you.\nThis article will focus on the ways to keep your Arduino projects and yourself safe from the risk of fire and the factors which can prove to be a fire hazard when working with electronic equipment. So, make sure you give this article a good read till the last word.\nWhat Is a Fire Hazard?\nFire hazards are materials, situations, or practices that can lead to an uncontrollable fire. Strictly talking about electronics, a small spark can ignite a massive fire or even an explosion within a few seconds.\nThe incorrect methods of handling electronic equipment, together with the wrong type of components used in projects, are some of the factors that contribute towards an electrical fire.\nThere are many other types of fires, and each one has a different method of extinguishing it. Some fires need water to extinguish, while others are strictly put down by using only specific chemicals such as carbon dioxide.\nWhat Are the Causes of Fire in Arduino Projects?\nNow that you’re aware of what a fire hazard is, let’s take a look at the possible causes of fire in Arduino projects.\nWhat could go wrong when working on a simple Arduino project? You might be wondering.\nCan an Arduino board cause a fire? Let’s find out!\nHere 9 Reasons Your Arduino Can Catch Fire\nReason #1: Poor Ventilation\nThe most common cause of fires in Arduino projects as well as other electronic projects is poor ventilation.\nWhen an electric current passes through a piece of conductor, it produces heat energy because electrons are flowing through the conductor, and they bump into atoms of the conductor, giving off heat energy.\nWe use to make many connections on our Arduino boards when working on a project, meaning that multiple currents are flowing through it; hence generating a considerable amount of heat energy.\nSo, the heat that electronics projects produce needs to be guided out of the system through a proper ventilation channel.\nYou shouldn’t, for example, build an Arduino project and keep it without proper ventilation (or close it in a tiny room) where there is zero ventilation because sooner or later, you’d have to call the fire brigade to help you out!\nSo, always make sure to place your Arduino projects in a well-ventilated area when powered on.\nReason #2: Loose Connections\nLoosely connected wires or other components are another cause of the fire because they obstruct the current path and increase the resistance of that connection, causing heat to dissipate.\nIf you’ve ever seen a loosely connected plug hanging on the wall socket, you would’ve noticed that it has turned black or it’s hot at the touch, because of the extra heat produced.\nLoose wires in Arduino projects can also burn out and cause a fire to start.\nReason #3: Short-Circuiting\nA short circuit occurs when two wires or two conductors come into contact with each other when they’re not supposed to.\nThese “wrong contacts” lead to a high flow of current, and often you can see a spark coming out of it.\nIf the short circuit continues, the spark may develop into a fire and create a lot of unwanted mess.\nReason #4: Defective Components\nUsing inferior quality components in Arduino projects or using a fake Arduino board is also classified as a fire hazard because the defective parts cannot handle a lot of heat. Hence, they often burn out and may cause a fire to flare up.\nIf you want to check whether your Arduino board is original, check out this article.\nReason #5: Overloading\nAlways make sure not to overload your Arduino board because it might lead to a fire incident.\nOverloading means connecting the Arduino board to too many components, where each of them is driving a significant amount of current from the microcontroller board.\nWhen you overload your Arduino board for a long time, the connections heat up, and eventually, the temperature of the board rises above the safe limits and leads to a fire.\nHence, you should always avoid overloading your Arduino board when using it in projects.\nReason #6: Presence of Flammable Materials\nMaterials that can catch fire easily, such as clothes and flammable liquids, must always be kept at a safe distance from electronic circuitry.\nAvoid keeping these items near your Arduino project because these materials will help the fire spread very fast.\nEven if there’s just a tiny spark that won’t turn into a fire, these materials can make the sparkle grows into a fire.\nTo see which household substances are highly flammable, click here.\nReason #7: Faulty Outlets\nFaulty outlets and outdated electrical wiring in the house is a significant reason behind household fires.\nSo, if you’re using a DC adaptor plugged onto a wall socket to power your Arduino board, make sure that the wall outlet is not faulty to prevent a fire in your house.\nOne can easily recognize faulty outlets checking simple signs, such as burn marks near the socket.\nIf you need to read more about how to identify faulty sockets around the house, click here.\nReason #8: Lithium Batteries\nUsing lithium batteries to power up your Arduino board is a big NO! Because lithium batteries are highly flammable and may explode when exposed to heat.\nArduino projects, as explained before, dissipate heat especially if running for a long time, and this can flare up a fire in the presence of highly flammable lithium batteries.\nSo, it’s best not to use those batteries since you have a lot of other alternatives to power up your Arduino projects which offer a low risk of fire.\nReason #9: Polarized Capacitors\nUsing polarized capacitors in Arduino projects can sometimes prove to be catastrophic, mainly when these capacitors are supplied with either reversed-polarity voltage or exposed to high temperatures.\nSometimes, a high AC can also lead to a fire. Hence, always make sure to take necessary precautions when using polarized capacitors in Arduino projects.\nIf you want to know everything about capacitors, check out this awesome article that even shows a lab test with an explosion. Who does not love to blow up things in the lab?!\nMake sure to place the project in a cool, well-ventilated place when powered on, and the input voltage and current are at the right level.\nHow Can You Reduce the Risk of Fire in Arduino Projects?\nNow that you know what the possible causes of fire in Arduino projects are, you can quickly reduce the risk of fire by following the following, simple steps.\nStep 1. Monitor the Temperature\nAlways place your projects in a well-ventilated area or attach a cooling fan along with your project. Taking these precautions will make sure that the temperature of your Arduino project does not reach the dangerous level where a fire can quickly start.\nYou can also program your Arduino project in such a way that if the temperature rises above a certain level, the project turns itself off for a while and then starts again when the temperature drops down.\nStep 2. Double-Check the Connections\nAdopt the practice of checking your Arduino project’s connections before powering it on.\nMake sure you’re supplying the right amount of voltage with the correct polarity, and to fit all the connections tightly.\nIn case you’re using an adaptor to power up your Arduino board, make sure to connect it firmly to a power outlet that isn’t faulty, thus reducing the risk of fire.\nStep 3. Calculate the Currents\nSupplying current higher than the recommended value can cause unnecessary heat to build up and increase the temperature of your Arduino project.\nSo, the best practice would be to calculate the currents before assembling the project so that you don’t have to deal with the hassle of putting out an electrical fire.\nStep 4. Keep it Away from Flammable Materials\nFlammable materials are a primary cause of spreading fire. As mentioned above, these substances can catch fire within a few seconds; hence, keep these materials away from your Arduino project when they’re powered on.\nStep 5. Build Neat Circuits\nCircuit boards that have a lot of components squeezed into a tiny area are more likely to develop a short circuit in comparison to those neatly constructed, with components placed apart and separate connecting wires which are not tangled up.\nAnother advantage of building a neat circuit is that you’ll know which wire is connecting which components and when making amendments, you wouldn’t have to spend a lot of time figuring out which connection you have to break or change.\nAs you can see, neat circuits are not only a treat for the eyes, but they also help reduce the risk of fire.\nNow, after reading this article, you’re ready to fight/prevent the risk of fire associated with Arduino boards or any of your electronic projects.\nAll you need to do is always to keep the causes of fire, described above, in mind while working on your upcoming Arduino project!\nHave you ever had a bad fire hazard experience while working on your electronics or Arduino projects before?

{"question":"What's the relationship between jealousy and manipulation in Othello's downfall?","answer":"Jealousy and manipulation are deeply intertwined in Othello's tragedy. Iago, who is himself jealous of Cassio's promotion and possibly suspects Othello of sleeping with his wife Emilia, manipulates Othello by planting seeds of sexual jealousy regarding Desdemona's supposed affair with Cassio. Through Iago's skilled manipulation, Othello becomes consumed by jealousy to the point where he doubts his beloved wife's faithfulness, despite her assurances. This jealousy, described as the 'green-eyed monster,' ultimately drives Othello to murder Desdemona and then take his own life. While Iago is primarily responsible for the tragic events through his manipulative abilities, Othello's susceptibility to jealousy and his excessive trust in Iago contribute to his own downfall.","context":["In William Shakespeare’s Othello, Othello wrestles with the rumors circling around his wife, Desdemona, and her virtue, and counsels with Iago in his private chambers. Their exchange is full of echoing repetitions and circuitous thoughts that come bouncing back to Othello, further disorienting him.\nOthello: Indeed? … Is he not honest?\nIago: Honest, my lord?\nOthello: Honest? Ay, honest. What dost thou think?\nIago: Think, my lord?\nOthello: “Think, my lord?” By heaven, thou echo’st me\nAs if there were some monster in thy thought\nToo hideous to be shown.\nLittle does Othello know, the “green-eyed monster” of Jealousy (a modern commonplace from good ole Bill Shakes) lives inside Iago. The echoing exchange fails to help Othello locate truth in his chambers. Echoing themes outside his rooms do little to further expose the “monster in [Iago’s] thought/ Too hideous to be shown.” “O blood, blood, blood!” is paralleled by Desdemona’s “O Lord, Lord, Lord!” Othello is a “fool, fool, fool” for relying solely upon fading, fragile “reputation, reputation, reputation.”\nOthello is, by Iago’s manipulative hand, isolated in body and spirit. The play’s action is precipitated by a move from the cosmopolitan hub of Venice to the island of Cyprus. While Iago has more soliloquies and asides, Othello is isolated onstage frequently, and is left alone with the bodies of Emilia and Desdemona. Iago manipulates social and emotional distance between characters—where once a stream between Othello and his lovely bride, now a gulf. And we cannot overlook the isolating Othering that, from the beginning, marks Othello as separate. Othello’s skin color, read as a somatic marker of difference and emphasized in characters’ speeches and asides, segregates Othello visibly, socially, and psychologically. Through dramatic irony, the audience can see what Othello cannot. Even when, especially when, with Iago, Othello is heartbreakingly, tragically alone.\n“Echo + loneliness” are etched in the mythological tree under “together 4eva,” thanks to Ovid, among others. In a tale as old as chronos, Echo the mountain nymph played wing-woman for Jupiter and her friend. Juno caught wind of the affair, but was distracted by Echo’s loquacious ramblings. She wised up in the end, cursed Echo for chatting her up, and got upset at Jupiter for, well, being Jupiter. Echo, no longer able to say more than the most recently spoken words of another person, was left to wander alone through mountain and glen.\nTired of isolation, she fell for Narcissus. Those familiar with that vain boy—or any, really—know how this story goes. After Narcissus died courting his own reflection in the pool, Echo, too, wasted away. Her bones turned to stone, her beauty gray. Her voice alone remained, keeping those who traverse her bones company.\nTurn we now to a bit of social media spelunking. If we dive deep into chambers and chat rooms, we find echoes of the vain, the jealous, the lonely. An echo chamber is an environment in which a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own. Existing views are reinforced, alternative ideas are not considered. In extreme echo chambers, one person will make a claim, which many like-minded people then repeat, overhear, and repeat again, until most people assume that some extreme variation of the story is true. Like Iago in Othello, the echo chamber doesn’t seek to erode someone’s interest in seeking truth—Othello is encouraged by Iago to track down the “truth” behind Desdemona’s handkerchief. Rather, the echo chamber manipulates a source’s credibility so that fundamentally different establishments will be considered “truthful” or honest sources of authority. Thus, Othello comes to doubt his beloved’s assurances of love and faithfulness, to a violent end.\nOddly, the echo chamber of social media maps more onto the figure of Narcissus than poor, near-mute Echo. It is Narcissus who falls prey to an illusion, while Echo can see the truth. And while Narcissus only hears from Echo what he himself has said—he exclaims, “Away with these encircling hands! May I die before what’s mine is yours,” to which Echo can only, miserably, answer, “What’s mine is yours!” before fleeing in scorned grief—Echo can only work with what Narcissus gives her. Thus, in a world spinning over social media platforms’ toxic echo chambers, we would do well to question not only the capitalist structures that reinforce echo chambers’ damaging effects, but also what we say in the chambers, in the chat rooms, in the cloud. Echo is dependent upon Narcissus for substance, not the other way around.\nEcho—the nymph, the voice, the villain in most narratives of modern communication. But echoes have always been good at bouncing back. Echolocation, the ability of animals to map their surroundings by sensing echoes from objects through creating sounds of their own, helps “blind” bats see, and people who are blind map the world around them. By tapping their canes, lightly stomping their feet, making clicking noises with their mouths, or snapping their fingers, people trained to orient themselves by echolocation can interpret sound waves received, processed, and, in a spirit of generosity, given back.\nDaniel Kish, who works for the non-profit organization World Access for the Blind and who has been blind since infancy, says, “The sense of imagery is very rich for an experienced user [of human echolocation]. One can get a sense of beauty or starkness or whatever—from sound as well as echo.” In the quiet, he can hear the warm quality of wood and the cold of metal. It is a matter of sending signals, yes, but more so, listening for how the real responds. Echoes locate the listening subject. They ground them and help them see when clear sight has failed.\nMaybe, in a strange twist, we need the echo chamber more than the reflecting pool. Maybe Echo, yearning for connection, needs better conversationalists.\nThis post was written by Abby Thatcher, Humanities Center intern.\n 3.3.103-112, in Shakespeare, William. “The Tragedy of Othello the Moor of Venice.” The Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition, edited by Stephen Greenblatt, 2nd ed., W.W.

First performed around 1604, the play is also a pioneering exploration of racial prejudice. Read a character analysis of Othello, plot summary, and important quotes.\nWhat is the main cause of the tragedy in Othello?\nJealousy is a powerful emotion, one that can destroy relationships, and consume the mind. Whether sexual or platonic, once the seed of jealousy is planted it can lead to devastating consequences. Such an emotion created by the relationship between Desdemona and Cassio causes the tragedy of Othello.\nWhat is the main point of Othello?\nSome of the major themes in this play include racial prejudice, manipulation, and jealousy. Specifically, Othello is regarded as a beast by other characters because he is black. Iago is jealous of Cassio because Othello promotes him to a higher military position.\nWhy is Othello called the Moor of Venice?\nYet the full name of the play is The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice, because Othello is the one who seems to suffer the most throughout the play. They refuse to refer to him by name, choosing instead to call him “the Moor”, a reference to his Middle Eastern descent, or simply, “him”.\nWhy does Othello kill himself in the end?\nIago is furious about being overlooked for promotion and plots to take revenge against his General; Othello, the Moor of Venice. Iago manipulates Othello into believing his wife Desdemona is unfaithful, stirring Othello’s jealousy. Othello allows jealousy to consume him, murders Desdemona, and then kills himself.\nDid Othello slept with Iago’s wife?\nAt the end of Act I, scene iii, Iago says he thinks Othello may have slept with his wife, Emilia: “It is thought abroad that ‘twixt my sheets / He has done my office” (I. iii. 369–370). Iago is often funny, especially in his scenes with the foolish Roderigo, which serve as a showcase of Iago’s manipulative -abilities.\nWho is responsible for the tragedy of Othello?\nThough Iago is mostly responsible for the tragic happenings in the lives of most of the leading characters in Othello, he proves himself as an ambidextrous manipulator. As a villain Iago has almost supernatural ability to manipulate the other characters of the play.\nWhat are the 5 elements of a Shakespearean tragedy?\nElements of Shakespeare’s Tragedies\n- A tragic hero.\n- A dichotomy of good and evil.\n- A tragic waste.\n- Hamartia (the hero’s tragic flaw)\n- Issues of fate or fortune.\n- Foul revenge.\n- Supernatural elements.\nIs Othello responsible for his own downfall?\nIn addition to being manipulated by Iago, Othello is entirely too trusting of him. He places his trust in Iago without realizing that his so-called friend is actually mistreating him.\nHow is jealousy a theme in Othello?\nJealousy runs the characters’ lives in Othello from the beginning of the play, when Roderigo is envi- ous of Othello because he wishes to be with Desdemona, and to the end of the play, when Othello is furious with envy because he believes Cassio and Desdemona have been engaging in an affair.\nIs Emilia Desdemona servant?\nIn Shakespeare, she is named Emilia, is the wife of Othello’s ensign, Iago, and is an attendant to Othello’s wife, Desdemona.\nIs Iago jealous of Othello?\nIago was also jealous of Othello which is why he plotted to have him killed. Iago felt that Othello was not suitable to be in charge and wanted it for himself. Iago was so jealous that he didn’t care who died as long as he got what he wanted.\nWhy is it important that Othello is black?\nIt is due to his colour (race) that Othello is considered an outsider. If he was not of African origin, Iago would have found it difficult to prove that Desdemona did not love him. His colour also gives rise to an inferiority complex in Othello who does not want to believe it, but feels forced to think as Iago wants.\nWhat were Othello’s last words?\nOthello’s suicide serves as a kind of trial in which he decides on and enacts a punishment for his crime of killing Desdemona. In his final speech, he explains how he hopes to be remembered, saying “When you shall these unlucky deed relate / Speak of me as I am” (5.2.).\nWhat does Venice symbolize in Othello?\nIn Othello, Venice represents civilization, while Cyprus symbolizes the wilderness."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:08926fce-5be5-46f1-836e-7f564afbd94a>","<urn:uuid:b520107d-d863-4a65-bd38-ec29b7b1b225>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between medical emergency treatment approaches for hematemesis and sclerosis-induction therapy for hemorrhoids?","answer":"Hematemesis (upper GI bleeding) treatment and hemorrhoid sclerosis therapy differ significantly in their approach and urgency. Hematemesis treatment is considered a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention, including airway protection (possibly with endotracheal intubation), IV fluid replacement, and blood transfusions to restore intravascular volume. Treatment focuses on stabilizing the patient and preventing complications like aspiration of blood, with patients often requiring intensive care unit admission and consultation with both gastroenterologist and surgeon. In contrast, sclerosis-induction therapy for hemorrhoids is a specialized, non-emergency procedure where special solutions are injected into internal hemorrhoids to induce sclerosis and withering. This technique is less urgent and can be performed selectively by experienced physicians as a targeted treatment for internal hemorrhoids.","context":["US Pharm. 2009;34(12):HS12-HS16.\nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can originate anywhere from the pharynx to the rectum and can be occult or overt. It differs from internal bleeding, where blood leaks from the blood vessels in such a way that the bleeding cannot be seen outside of the body. GI bleeding has a variety of causes, and a review of patient medical history and a physical examination can distinguish between the macroscopic and microscopic forms. The manifestations depend on the location and rate of bleeding, from nearly undetectable to acute and life-threatening. Upper endoscopy or colonoscopy are generally considered the best methods to identify the source of bleeding.1\nHistory of present illness should be reviewed to ascertain quantity and frequency of blood passage. However, quantity can be difficult to assess because even small amounts (5-10 mL) of rectal bleeding or modest amounts of vomited blood are alarming to a patient. Whether blood was passed with initial emesis or only after several nonbloody vomiting episodes could indicate different causes.1\nTo evaluate the patient, there are a number of symptoms that need to be reviewed after GI bleeding. These include presence of abdominal discomfort, weight loss, easy bleeding or bruising, previous colonoscopy results, and symptoms of anemia (weakness, fatigue, dizziness). Past medical history should also inquire about previously diagnosed or undiagnosed GI bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), bleeding diatheses, and liver disease.\nSeveral drugs increase the likelihood of bleeding, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and heparin. Chronic liver disease due to excessive use of alcohol can also cause bleeding. GI bleeding may also precipitate hepatic encephalopathy (brain and nervous system damage caused by liver failure) or hepatorenal syndrome (kidney failure secondary to liver disease).2\nTypes of GI Bleeding\nUpper GI Bleeding: Hematemesis is vomiting of red-colored blood and indicates upper GI bleeding, usually from an arterial source or varix. It is considered a medical emergency, and the most vital distinction is whether there is blood loss sufficient to cause shock. The bleeding is similar to dark brown emesis, with granular material that resembles coffee grounds. This results from upper GI bleeding that has slowed or stopped, with conversion of red hemoglobin to brown hematin by gastric acid.3\nThere are many causes for hematemesis, including irritation or erosion of the lining of the esophagus or stomach; bleeding ulcer located in the stomach, duodenum, or esophagus; vomiting of ingested blood after hemorrhage in the oral cavity, nose, or throat; vascular malfunctions of the GI tract; and tumors of the stomach or esophagus.\nMinimal Blood Loss: In this case, the patient is administered a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole, given a blood transfusion, and kept nil per os (Latin, “nothing by mouth”) until endoscopy can be arranged for further investigation.\nSignificant Blood Loss: In a hemodynamically significant case of hematemesis (e.g., hypovolemic shock), resuscitation is an immediate priority to prevent cardiac arrest. Fluids and/or blood are administered, preferably by central venous catheter, and the patient is prepared for emergency endoscopy. If the source of bleeding cannot be identified endoscopically, a surgical option is usually sought for laparotomy.3\nLower GI Bleeding: Hematochezia is the passage of gross blood from the rectum and usually indicates lower GI bleeding. It is distinguished from melena, which is stool with blood that has been altered by the gut flora and appears “tarry” black. It is also different from bright red blood per rectum, which is caused by hemorrhoidal or fissure problems and is a local rectal bleeding. Hematochezia might also result from vigorous upper GI bleeding with rapid transit of blood through the intestines. Most common causes in adults are diverticulosis and hemorrhoids, both relatively benign, although this bleeding might be a warning sign for colorectal cancer.\nHematochezia in newborn infants may be due to swallowed maternal blood at the time of delivery. In the most serious cases, it can also be an initial symptom of necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition affecting premature infants. In young adults, IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis, is a serious cause of hematochezia that must be further investigated for rapid treatment.1-3\nMelena: Melena is a black, tarry stool that is caused by GI bleeding. The black color is due to the oxidation of blood hemoglobin during the bleeding in the ileum and colon. Melena also refers to stools or vomit stained black by blood pigment or dark blood products and may indicate upper GI bleeding. Bleeding from a lower source that occurs slowly enough to allow for oxidation is also associated with melena. About 100 to 200 mL of blood in the upper GI tract is required to cause melena, which can remain for several days after bleeding has stopped.4\nBlack stool that does not contain occult blood may result from ingestion of iron, bismuth, or various foods and should not be mistaken for melena. Peptic ulcer disease is the main cause of melena, but secondary causes include bleeding from the upper GI tract as in gastritis or esophageal varices or even from the ascending colon. Overdosing of certain drugs (e.g., warfarin, clopidogrel, or long-term use of NSAIDS) may also be a cause. Melena is not considered a medical emergency, but patients should be carefully monitored to find the cause and assessed for further treatment.3\nGI bleeding of any cause is more likely and severe in patients with chronic liver disease from alcohol abuse or hepatitis. It also occurs more commonly in patients with hereditary coagulation disorders or in those taking certain drugs. Drugs associated with GI bleeding include heparin, warfarin, aspirin, certain NSAIDs, clopidogrel, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which cause platelet depletion and reduce the ability to form clots. About 20% to 30% of GI bleeding is due to duodenal ulcers and gastric or duodenal erosions.4\nVarices and erosive esophagitis are responsible for 10% to 20% of upper GI bleeds. For the lower GI, the bleeding depends on the age group, but it is mainly due to anal fissures, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, Crohn’s disease, and colonic polyps or carcinoma.5\nEvaluation and Diagnosis\nThe first step in the diagnosis of GI bleeding is to stabilize the patient’s airways and administer IV fluids or transfuse blood. Bloody nasogastric aspirate indicates active upper GI bleeding, but about 10% of patients have no blood in the nasogastric aspirate.4 Then the focus should be on vital signs and any indication for hypovolemia (e.g., tachycardia, tachypnea, oliguria, confusion) or anemia (e.g., fatigue, pale skin, headache, coldness in the hands and feet, diaphoresis). In cases of lesser bleedings, the tachycardia and orthostatic changes (i.e., pulse, blood pressure) are milder but need immediate attention, especially in the elderly.6\nWhen the patient is stable, the signs and symptoms of external bleeding disorders, such as black and blue spots on the skin (petechiae, ecchymoses), are sought. Other signs to look for are ascites and erythema (chronic liver disease) and splenomegaly and dilated abdominal wall veins (portal hypertension).\nIn all patients with GI bleeding, a digital rectal examination is necessary to search for stool color, masses, and fissures. Anoscopy is done to diagnose hemorrhoids. Chemical testing of a stool specimen for occult blood completes the examination if gross blood is not present. In about 50% of patients, peptic ulcer can be the cause of GI bleeding.4 Epigastric abdominal discomfort that is relieved by food or antacids suggests peptic ulcer disease. These patients may or may not have pain.6\nBloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain suggest ischemic colitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, or an infectious colitis. Fresh blood only on stools suggests rectal hemorrhoids or fissures, whereas blood mixed with the stool indicates bleeding from a distal or farthest area of the colon. Occult blood in the stool may be the first sign of a polyp, particularly in middle-aged patients. A CBC should be obtained in patients with occult blood loss.6\nWith more significant bleeding, coagulation monitoring such as platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and liver function tests such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and albumin, are done in certain patients. In most cases, one or more diagnostic procedures are required.\nAlthough endoscopy is therapeutic as well as diagnostic, it should be done rapidly for significant upper GI bleeding. Angiography is useful in the diagnosis of upper GI bleeding and permits certain therapeutic maneuvers (e.g., embolization, vasoconstrictor infusion).\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy and ano-scopy may be all that is required acutely for patients with symptoms typical of hemorrhoidal bleeding. All other patients with hematochezia should have a colonoscopy, which can be done electively after routine preparation unless there is significant ongoing bleeding. If colonoscopy cannot visualize the source and ongoing bleeding is sufficiently rapid (>0.5 to 1 mL/min), angiography may localize the source.5,6\nEndoscopy is the preferred choice for occult bleeding, because diagnosis of this type of bleeding may be difficult, due to heme-positive stools from bleeding anywhere in the GI tract. Double-contrast barium enema and sigmoidoscopy can also be used for the lower tract when colonoscopy is unavailable or the patient refuses the procedure.4\nBoth hematemesis and hematochezia should be considered an emergency. Admission to an intensive care unit, with consultation by a gastroenterologist and a surgeon, is recommended for all patients with severe GI bleeding. General treatment is directed at maintenance of the airway and restoration of circulating volume. Hemostasis and other treatments depend on the cause of the bleeding.7,8\nAirway: A major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with active upper GI bleeding is aspiration of blood with subsequent respiratory problems. To prevent these issues, endotracheal intubation should be considered in patients who have inadequate gag reflexes or are obtunded or unconscious—particularly if they will be undergoing upper endoscopy.4\nFluid Replacement: IV fluids are initiated for any patient with hypovolemia or hemorrhagic shock. Patients requiring further resuscitation should receive transfusion with packed red blood cells (RBCs). Transfusions continue until intravascular volume is restored and then are given as needed to replace ongoing blood loss. Platelet count should be monitored closely, since platelet transfusion may be required with severe bleeding. Patients who are taking antiplatelet drugs (e.g., clopid-ogrel) and aspirin may have platelet dysfunction, often resulting in increased bleeding. Platelet transfusion should be considered when patients taking these drugs have severe, ongoing bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma should be transfused after every 4 units of packed RBCs.4\nHemostasis: Early intervention to control bleeding is important in order to minimize mortality, particularly in elderly patients. Specific therapy depends on the bleeding site. For peptic ulcer, ongoing bleeding or rebleeding is treated with endoscopic coagulation. Nonbleeding vessels that are visible within an ulcer crater are also treated. If endoscopy does not stop the bleeding and medical management does not control gastric acid secretion, then surgery is performed.4\nSevere, ongoing hematochezia from diverticula or angiomas can sometimes be controlled colonoscopically by electrocautery, coagulation with a heater probe, or injection with dilute epinephrine. Polyps can be removed by snare or cautery. If these methods are ineffective or unfeasible, angiography with embolization or vasopressin infusion may be successful.4 Angiography can also be used to localize the source of bleeding more accurately. Surgery may be used in patients with continued bleeding, but localization of the bleeding site is very important. Acute or chronic bleeding of internal hemorrhoids stops spontaneously in most cases. Patients with refractory bleeding are treated via anoscopy with rubber band ligation, injection, coagulation, or surgery.8\nTypically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 10% to 15% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties, and blood donation typically takes 8% to 10% of the donor’s blood volume.4\nGI Bleeding in the Elderly\nIn the elderly (age ≥65 years), hemorrhoids and colorectal cancer are the most common causes of minor bleeding. Peptic ulcer, diverticular disease, and angiodysplasia are the most common causes of major bleeding. Approximately 35% to 45% of all cases of acute upper GI hemorrhage occur in elderly persons. These patients increasingly account for the 10% of deaths that result from a bleeding episode each year.4\nElderly patients tolerate massive GI bleeding poorly. Diagnosis must be made quickly, and treatment must be started sooner than in younger patients, who can better tolerate repeated episodes of bleeding.9\nAlthough upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are generally considered to be safe in the elderly, the risk of complications (including hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and perforation) is greater than that with younger patients. Approximately 30% to 40% of patients who undergo GI endoscopy are older than 70 years.4\nOn an emergency basis, therapeutic endoscopy is generally riskier than diagnostic endoscopy. Therefore, elderly patients—especially those with such comorbidities as obesity and cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, metabolic, or neurologic disorders—require careful evaluation before, and intensive monitoring during, the procedure. Endoscopy can be done in patients taking aspirin or NSAIDs who do not have a preexisting bleeding disorder.\n1. Ghosh S, Watts D, Kinnear M. Management of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.

Functie de localizarea lor relativa fata de piele sau fata de membrana intestinala, hemoroizii sunt clasificati ca interni, externi sau combinati. Un hemoroid intern este o vena sub o membrana mucoasa; un hemoroid extern este o vena sub piele; iar un hemoroid combinat presupune vene sub ambele.\nI Etiologie, Patologie şi manifestare clinică\nHemoroizii se pot forma din diferite cauze. Dieta necorespunzatoare poate afecta splina, iar insuficienta splinei la randul ei poate genera cresterea endogena a Uscaciunii si Caldurii. Uscaciunea si Caldura Endogena then press downward against the large intestine and may lead to the formation of hemorrhoids. Excessively prolonged sitting or bearing of heavy loads may cause impedance to blood circulation, which in turn may lead to blood stasis in the rectal veins. Cand Caldura ataca sangele, lupta dintre sange si Qi-ul cel rau poate produce miscari dezordonate ale Qi-ului si sangelui. Uneori, aceasta poate duce la stagnarea Qi-ului si a sangelui si sa duca la formarea de hemoroizi.\nAdesea constipaţia obisnuita duce la dezvoltarea hemoroizilor. Uneori, si diareea poate duce, de asemenea, la aparitia de hemoroizi.\nHemoroizii externi se formeaza sub the junction between the mucous membrane and skin. They are usually visible on inspection, and on palpation they feel like soft masses. They are most obvious immediately following defecation or squatting. Associated symptoms depend upon whether there is thrombosis (clot) in the dilated vein and whether there is inflammation. In the absence of thrombosis or inflammation, there may be no symptoms, a sensation of having an object in the anus, or mild itch. Daca exista o tromboza, there may be abrupt pain that is sometimes intense. Umflatura are aspectul of a dark purple mass. An inflamed external hemorrhoid may be quite painful and tender.\nHemoroizii interni se formeaza above the junction of the mucous membrane and skin. A small internal hemorrhoid may be asymptomatic or manifest only hematochezia (bloody feces). Upon inspection with an anoscope it may appear as a crimson red flat mass. A large internal hemorrhoid may prolapse, especially with defecation, and bleed. The prolapsed hemorrhoid may retract spontaneously, with bed rest if necessary, or may require manual manipulation to re-position. If the prolapsed internal hemorrhoid does not retract or is not manually re-positioned reasonably promptly, it may swell further from edema or inflow of blood. The blood may clot, or the hemorrhoid may necrose; in either case, prompt surgery may become necessary.\nCombined hemorrhoids may manifest symptoms of both external and internal hemorrhoids.\nII Tratament cu plante\n1 Tratament intern\nInternal treatment with herbal medicine is mostly suitable for hemorrhoids that have not prolapsed or though prolapsed can be re-positioned.

Prepare Jiu Hua Gao by grinding the ingredients together into fine powder and mixing it evenly in vaseline to form a 30% ointment.\n3 Other Treatment\ni Sclerosis-Induction Therapy\nIn this approach special solutions are injected into the internal hemorrhoid to induce sclerosis and withering. This is a very specialized technique and should be performed only by experienced physicians.\nii Ligation Therapy\nIn this approach the blood supply to the internal hemorrhoid is ligated at the base, so that the hemorrhoid would atrophy, become necrotic and slough without risk of causing bleeding. Again, only experienced physicians should perform this technique.\niii Taierea chirurgicala a hemoroizilor\nSurgical excision of hemorrhoids should be performed only by experienced surgeons.\nIII Acupuncture Treatment\nAcupuncture treatment is suitable for treating acute hemorrhoids with pain and swelling.\nFor downward flow of Dampness and Heat, select the acupoints Huiyang (BL-35), Chengshan (BL-57), Changqiang (DU-1), Yinlingquan (SP-9) and Sanyinjiao (SP-6).\nFor Yin deficiency with blood-Heat, select the acupoints Huiyang (BL-35), Chengshan (BL-57), Erbai (EX-UE-29), Quchi (LI-11), Xuehai (SP-10), Geshu (BL-17) and Sanyinjiao (SP-6).\nFor spleen insufficiency with prolapse, select the acupoints Baihui (DU-20), Shenque (RN-8), Pishu (BL-20), Sanyinjiao (SP-6), Zusanli (ST-36) and Huiyang (BL-35).\nMoxibustie.

Sometimes the bleeding was in the form of dribbling and sometimes in spurts, and the amount varied. Two months prior to consultation, she developed dry constipation, so that when she defecated she had prolapse of a soft mass and worsened hematochezia.\nThe mass retracted spontaneously. The increased hematochezia prompted the consultation.\nTemperatura ei era de 36,7°C. Pulsul ei era 70/min iar tensiunea era de 128/90 mmHg. She had a pale complexion. Her tongue was pale red, with thin white coating. Her pulse was taut and threadlike. Her anus was normal in appearance.\nDigital examination of the rectum was normal. Examination with an anoscope showed a hemispherical swelling of the mucous membrane above the juncture between mucous membrane and skin. The soft mass was dark red in color and had three spots of recent bleeding.\nDiagnostic. Internal hemorrhoid due to spleen insufficiency, with prolapse.\nPrincipiu terapeutic. Strengthen the spleen, mobilize Qi, astringe blood and stop bleeding.\nTreatment si Evolutie. Pacientul a fost tratat cu o formula pe baza de plante si cu injectie.

{"question":"I'm struggling with depression and considering treatments. How do mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and antidepressant medications compare in preventing relapses?","answer":"Both MBCT and antidepressant medications show similar effectiveness in preventing depression relapses. Studies demonstrate that about 44% of people using MBCT experienced relapses compared to 47% using maintenance antidepressant medication over a two-year period. MBCT works by teaching people skills to recognize and constructively respond to thoughts and feelings associated with relapse. While antidepressants can reduce relapse likelihood by up to two-thirds when taken correctly, MBCT offers a non-drug alternative for those who cannot tolerate medication side effects or prefer not to remain on medication indefinitely. Additionally, MBCT is relatively low cost since it's delivered as a group intervention, with no significant cost difference compared to antidepressant treatment when considering all health and social care services used.","context":["New voices: Are we mindful of how we talk about mindfulness?\nMindfulness dates back 2500 years, originating in Buddhism. Right now it is everywhere. People are talking about it as a state of being and way of life, writing about it, broadcasting podcasts on it, developing phone-based apps, offering groups and online courses. A few years ago, I went to the ‘Mindfulness in Society’ conference organised by Bangor University’s Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice. There was a vibrant buzz: you would have understandably left feeling inspired and thinking we should all take up mindfulness practice. Yet I continue to find a lot of people are unaware of what mindfulness really is and what it involves. Some may assume it to be religious, conjuring up images of people chanting. Some believe it to be an alternative or complementary therapy, or that it is at best relaxation: ‘Your PhD is about mindfulness?! That sounds calming, I could do with some of that.’\nMindfulness has been defined as ‘paying attention on purpose, non-judgementally, and in the present moment’ (Kabat-Zinn, 1982). One way of achieving this is through formal breathing or body-based meditation practices. Thoughts and feelings are acknowledged and accepted but not challenged as in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), for example. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been developed for use in both mental and physical health, aimed at relieving symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and more. Jon Kabat-Zinn developed the first structured eight-week course, Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR), for clients experiencing chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982), but you can now embrace mindfulness in workplaces (participating in ‘mindful lunches’ or ‘mindful walks’), in schools (to help children with stress and general well-being: Kuyken et al., 2013) and beyond. To see mindfulness accepted and becoming integrated into people’s lives is inspiring, but we need to be cautious with how we talk about and promote mindfulness, particularly so as to avoid creating unrealistic expectations in those new to mindfulness .\nIncreasing scientific research output has highlighted the growing interest and acceptance of mindfulness-based approaches. In the 1980s, only one or two academic papers were published. In the 1990s this increased to around 10–15 per year. In 2013 alone there were 475 publications on mindfulness (Black, 2014).\nOne particular field in which MBIs have been well researched is in depression. Despite both psychological and pharmacological treatments, many people continue to relapse into depression. Could the beauty of mindfulness lie in not only helping people to get better, but keeping them better? Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), developed in 1995 as an adaptation of MBSR (Teasdale et al., 2000), aims to provide people currently in remission from depression with skills in mindfulness supplemented with psychoeducational elements of CBT to help prevent further relapse. The first randomised controlled trial (RCT) shows that those who participated in the eight-week MBCT programme showed lower relapse rates 12 months later, compared with those receiving their normal treatment (Teasdale et al., 2000). In fact, 37 per cent of the MBCT group met relapse criteria compared with 66 per cent of the treatment-as-usual group. More recently RCTs have shown that MBCT is as effective as antidepressants in preventing depression and may be beneficial for those with higher childhood trauma (Kuyken et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2013). In terms of mechanisms underlying MBIs, MBCT has been shown to reduce rumination, worry and dysfunctional attitudes (Jermann et al., 2013; Williams, 2008). Both mindfulness and self-compassion have been reported to mediate the effects of MBCT on depressive outcome (Kuyken et al., 2010), and a qualitative study suggested that MBIs can lead to a greater sense of acceptance and control over symptoms of depression (Allen et al., 2009).\nAdditionally, research shows how mindfulness practice can alter brain structure and function in long-term experienced meditators compared with novices, but also following short-term mindfulness interventions of eight or just four weeks in those new to meditation (Tang et al., 2012). Studies investigating MBSR have shown that there are not only mood and well-being gains but also improvements in attention and in hippocampal and amygdala brain structure (Jha et al., 2010; Hölzel et al., 2010; Hölzel et al., 2011). My own PhD is attempting to identify the neuropsychological mechanisms through which MBCT works to prevent relapse in depression, targeting specifically mechanisms of self-compassion, rumination and brain structure.\nSuch evidence is exciting and suggests that taking up mindfulness practice has wide impacts beyond psychological well-being. However, we must remain cautious that we do not talk about mindfulness as a quick fix or, worse, a panacea. Research to date has largely ignored negative side-effects, but one qualitative study reports how MBCT participants expressed difficulties when realising MBCT is not a cure-all and reporting feeling that they could not ‘do’ the mindfulness practice successfully (Allen et al., 2009). Such concerns are not uncommon and would normally be addressed during an MBCT course, particularly as there is no right way to ‘do’ mindfulness. This highlights the importance of raising realistic expectations of MBCT throughout the course, which may also help to ensure continued practice beyond the eight weeks. Development of mindfulness skills will inevitably require longer than an eight-week course, but the course is well suited to providing a foundation for further development of mindfulness techniques.\nRecently an emerging area of research led by Willoughby Britton at Brown University has suggested that mindfulness practice may not be appropriate for all. Whilst scientific research has not yet uncovered many negative side-effects from meditation, there are texts hundreds of years old that do touch on negative experiences or the ‘dark knight of the soul’ (see tinyurl.com/jw4swbk), suggesting there are hardships in contemplative practices. Interestingly, whilst in medical studies side-effects would always be considered in RCTs, they have often been neglected in psychotherapy research (Dimidjian & Hollon, 2010), and thus far, in meditation research. We remain largely unaware of evidence on participants who may be more vulnerable to undertaking meditation practices or those who may experience negative emotions, paranoia, confusion or a loss of identity – some of the experiences reported in Britton’s early research. This can of course all be a natural part of the meditative process, but, for some, such negative experiences can be heightened to an extent they can become very unwell. So there needs to be an awareness of undertaking mindfulness practices with a suitable level of insight and readiness to start meditation. Meditation may look and sound simple, but mindfulness practice involves a considerable amount of active effort – it is quite a commitment to achieve and maintain the benefits reported above. As psychologists, we need to exercise caution in promoting the use of mindfulness as a therapeutic intervention for clients. As above, there may be some who are more vulnerable or not at the right stage in their lives to face the emotions mindfulness can bring to the forefront.\nAlthough there are not currently any formally recognised qualifications to teach mindfulness, and training pathways are not yet accredited, we must not forget that those teaching mindfulness should at the very least have their own established personal practice of mindfulness. Attendance at an eight-week course would not be sufficient for beginning to teach mindfulness techniques to others. We must encourage clients to seek teachers who have an established mindfulness practice, are appropriately trained and supervised and are following UK mindfulness teacher guidelines (Kuyken et al., 2012) to ensure continuation of credible and evidence-based courses.\nPersonally, I have practised mindfulness meditation for around four years; it is certainly not easy or a one-off practice. After all, you are connecting with inner thoughts and feelings you may have learned, over many years, to keep hidden under the surface. My practice has made me more self-aware and connected with my mind, my automatic reactions and behaviour around others, which has at times made me feel low or anxious. This is all a part of the process and is why mindfulness can be so powerful as a therapeutic tool. Whilst mindfulness practice for me has been a life-changing decision, it was not a simple, straight line journey and I’m sure I will have ups and downs as I continue to practise. As Jon Kabat-Zinn said at the mindfulness conference, it will not always be easy but ‘you don’t have to like it, you just have to do it’.\nI am a strong believer in MBIs and can see the benefits it can bring. Yet we must remain ‘mindful’ of how we promote and talk about mindfulness to ensure we carefully promote its use and application to mental or physical health issues whilst in the early days of its research. If we can avoid overstating mindfulness as a gold standard or panacea, those new to mindfulness can start to practise with realistic expectations, under suitably qualified courses, and can begin to experience the wonderful world of mindfulness meditation.\nKate Williams is a PhD student in the Neuroscience and Psychiatry Unit at the University of Manchester\nAllen, M., Bromley, A., Kuyken, W. & Sonnenberg, S.J.

Without ongoing treatment, as many as four out of five people with depression relapse at some point.'\n‘Currently, maintenance antidepressant medication is the key treatment for preventing relapse, reducing the likelihood of relapse or recurrence by up to two-thirds when taken correctly,’ added study co-author Professor Richard Byng, from the Plymouth University Peninsula Schools of Medicine and Dentistry. ‘However, there are many people who, for a number of different reasons, are unable to keep on a course of medication for depression. Moreover, many people do not wish to remain on medication for indefinite periods, or cannot tolerate its side effects.’\nMBCT was developed to help people who have experienced repeated bouts of depression by teaching them the skills to recognise and to respond constructively to the thoughts and feelings associated with relapse, thereby preventing a downward spiral into depression.\nIn this trial, which was conducted from the University of Exeter, UK, 424 adults with recurrent major depression and taking maintenance antidepressant medication were recruited from 95 primary care general practices across the South West of England. Participants were randomly assigned to come off their antidepressant medication slowly and receive MBCT (212 participants) or to stay on their medication (212 participants).\nParticipants in the MBCT group attended eight 2 1/4 hour group sessions and were given daily home practice. After the group they had the option of attending 4 follow up sessions over a 12 month period. The MBCT course consists of guided mindfulness practices, group discussion and other cognitive behavioural exercises. Those in the maintenance antidepressant group continued their medication for two years.\nAll trial participants were assessed at regular intervals over two years for a major depressive episode using a psychiatric diagnostic interview tool - the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.\nOver two years, relapse rates in both groups were similar (44 per cent in the MBCT group vs 47 per cent in the maintenance antidepressant medication group). Although five adverse events were reported, including two deaths, across both groups, they were not judged to be attributable to the interventions or the trial.\nNotes to editors\nKuyken, W. et al (2015) ���Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared with maintenance antidepressant treatment in the prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence (PREVENT): a randomised controlled trial’ The Lancet doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62222-4\nFor further media information please contact Jack Stonebridge, Press Officer, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King’s College London firstname.lastname@example.org/ (+44) 020 7848 5377"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f18737ec-04e7-4427-bbf2-811638a084bc>","<urn:uuid:75fc892f-ce60-45c8-9005-8208ad9ebbf4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the Fred Sehring Brewery and Milwaukee's earliest breweries differ in their founding years and initial approaches to beer production?","answer":"The Fred Sehring Brewery and Milwaukee's early breweries had different origins and initial approaches. Frederick Sehring founded his brewery in 1868 in Joliet, Illinois, and by 1900 was known for commissioning elaborate commemorative steins. In contrast, Milwaukee's first commercial brewery was established earlier, in 1839/40, by Simon Reutelshofer. Milwaukee's brewing industry grew rapidly, with 40 breweries operating by the 1860s, many focusing on wheat-based beers due to Wisconsin's position as a major wheat trading state.","context":["Never before or since, to my knowledge, has a brewery over a span approaching a decade issued a series of dated steins and mugs. The Fred Sehring Brewery of Joliet, Illinois, from 1900 through 1908 annually commissioned Hugo Theumler of Pittsburgh to provide it with a new items for gifting to favored customers. By that time, brewery founder Frederick Sehring, an immigrant from Germany, shown here, had died. His son, Louis, took the reins of management and may be assumed to have given the orders for the ceramics, and likely approved the designs.\nThe first in the series, a stein, celebrated the Turn of the Century. Nationally the 20th Century had been ushered in with great fanfare and Louis had caught the spirit. “Prosit! - 1900,” it reads. This was a traditional German toast, indicating “to your good health” with a tankard raised high. The decor also has the trademark of the Sehring Brewery, a shield with a foaming stein marked with an “S” rampant. Stalks of wheat and sprigs of hops surround the shield.\nThe following year Sehring adopted a calendar motif. The elaborate label includes, as shown here, a woman whose twisted body indicates a flamboyant mood as she lifts high a foaming goblet while straddling a wooden keg. A monkish figure graced the other side of the 1901 calendar. He has his arm around a beer keg. The elaborate transfer-printed design is typical of the artistic and technical capacity of the Theumler factory.\nFor some reason I have been unable to locate a 1902 Sehring issue. In 1903 the company replaced the stein format with a beer mug. This one bears an illustration of the Joliet brewery, replete with dark smoke coming from a stack. While such a picture today might indicate air pollution, at that time such plumes indicated that the brewery was operating full out.\nFor the 1904 version, Sehring decided on a dark brown glaze surrounding the same brewery logo seen on the 1900 version. Although Theumler provided the design of the transfers on his ceramics, he did not make the actual vessels. Those were purchased as “blank” ceramics from a variety of potteries in and around Pittsburg, decorated and often stamped with his own mark. In 1904 Sehring also issued a mini-mug cum match striker, shown below It carried a design similar to the 1903 mug.\nIn 1905, the front of the stein was a repeat of the 1904 stein. The obverse, however, held portraits of lovely young women displaying considerable cleavage and a saucy manner. In a departure from the past these Sehring steins were trimmed in gold with gold handles. I am particularly fond of the woman at right who seems to have “bee-sting lips” and two purple camellias in her hair. Very fetching, indeed.\nThe 1906 mug had an unusual label. The lead word is “Gezundheit,” literally meaning “God bless you,” usually said when someone has sneezed. This raises the issue of whether Fred Sehring Brewing Co. thought their beer would make people sneeze. This mug carries the same glaze and logo that bedecks the offerings for 1904 and 1905.\nMy personal favorite among the Sehring offerings is the 1907 stein. It is decorated in a Chinese blue and white motif that features a number of idealized flowers of varying sizes. If it were not for the Fred Sehring logo and “Joliet” to guide us, we might thing ourselves back in the late Ming Dynasty. It is a truly elegant cup from which to drink beer.\nThe last stein in the series is celebrates the anniversary of the firm, founded by Frederick Sehring in 1868. It was issued by the brewery in two styles, one with the letters spelling “Sehring” in deep red, matching the familiar logo and a second in which the letters are hollow. Both stein wish “greetings” to the drinker, perhaps not as compelling as “prosit,” but better than “gezundheit.”\nIn contemplating this array of steins and jugs I am curious about the decisions that went into approving the designs for each, year by year. As to why the series stopped in 1908, we might look to the death of Hugo Theumler in September 1908 apparently of “acute indigestion.” With his passing production in Pittsburgh ceased and and all references to the firm disappeared. Nonetheless, the Sehring brewery has given us a unique series of stein and mugs. Happy the collector who can line them up, year by year, on a display shelf.","Brewing Up Wisconsin History\nThe most recent Ale Through the Ages brewing series at Discovery World focused on Wisconsin and Milwaukee’s proud brewing heritage, as we recreated a traditional wheat ale. During the late 1800s, Wisconsin was a major wheat trading state, with Milwaukee as the primary hub of commerce on the Great Lakes. As a result of this lucrative grain trade, Wisconsin breweries had a steady and high quality supply of fermentable wheat and barley. Wheat became a staple ingredient in the production of a popular German beer, Weiss /Weizen and “weiss breweries” sprung up all over the state and in particular in Milwaukee. While the original recipes from the 19th century have yet to be publicly revealed, this recipe is an approximation of what these historic wheat beers may have tasted like. Therefore, we selected local wheat and barley malts, in addition to locally grown hops, as well as Wisconsin wildflower honey. A total of 12 gallons were brewed, 5.5 of which was fermented with Bavarian Wheat yeast, 5.5 gallons was fermented with Weihenstephan Weizen yeast, and 1 gallon was fermented with a local wild strain of yeast collected by a Milwaukee home brewer and class participant, Matt Spaanam.\nWheat (Triticum spp) is a grass species from Western Asia that was originally domesticated least 10,000 years ago, yet is now cultivated worldwide. Since the beginning of the European influx into America’s heartland, wheat has been a major crop and commodity of export to the global market. Milwaukee was one city in particular that was once at the forefront of the American and indeed global grain market. This is evidenced by the iconic Chamber of Commerce building, which still stands on the SE corner of Michigan St. and Water St. Completed in 1879 by the esteemed architect Edward Townsend Mix, it was inside this Italian Renaissance style building that the main trading rooms of the Milwaukee Grain Exchange were housed. It was here between1879-1935 that the price of wheat was set for the global market in the first “trading pit” in the country. Sadly the octagonal pit no longer survives. However, restoration of the trading room in the early 1980s resulted in preservation of one of best examples of mural-ornamented Victorian commercial interiors in North America.\nThe earliest evidence of a commercial brewery in Wisconsin opened in 1835 in Mineral Point (Iowa Co.) by John Phillips (Apps, J 1992). This region of southwestern Wisconsin saw the earliest influx of Europeans, who principally arrived from Cornwall, England and were employed in mining lead. These intrepid miners were given the nickname “badgers”, due to their burrowing tunnels, a moniker that eventually became Wisconsin’s mascot. It is likely that this pioneer brewery, as well as Rablin & Bray’s brewery in Elk Grove (Lafayette Co.) that opened in 1836, were likely brewing ales rather than lagers. Lagers would soon become the norm, once large numbers of German immigrants arrived in subsequent decades and opened their own breweries. By the end of the 1840s there were at least 22 breweries in Wisconsin. That number rose to at least 190 breweries in Wisconsin by the end of the 1850s. Towns and cities across Wisconsin would grow many industries, and breweries were no exception.\nWithout exception, Milwaukee’s brewing industry once stood head and shoulders above most American cities. In total, at least 120 different brewing companies have been established in Milwaukee over the past 175 years, giving justification for calling Milwaukee America’s “Brew City”. The most brewing companies in operation at any one time was during the 1860s when at least 40 breweries were in the production of beer, ales, lagers and often distilled spirits.\nMilwaukee’s first commercial brewery was established by Simon Reutelshofer in 1839/40, and was located at the southeast corner S. 3rd & Virginia Streets. This kicked off a tidal wave of other brewing operations that ostensibly became family businesses and wherein certain families became extremely wealthy. Without going into the entire chronology of Milwaukee’s brewing history, instead I’ll discuss just two historic Milwaukee weiss beer breweries that highlight the evolution of the industry as a whole.\nThe Gipfel Weiss Beer Brewery\nOne of Milwaukee’s early breweries that produced primarily wheat based beers was established by David Gipfel in 1843 when he purchased a small wooden framed building on Chestnut St (modern Juneau Ave.) for $400 from Wolfgang Weiss, and constructed a brewing operation. In 1851, David Gipfel’s eldest son Charles (Chas.) assumed ownership of the family brewery and renamed it the Union Brewery. In 1853 a four story Federal-Style cream city brick saloon and boarding house was built fronting Chestnut St. with the original brewery in the back. By the 1880s, the brewery was known principally for brewing weiss beer and was called the Charles Gipfel Whitebeer Brewery. However in 1890 the brewery closed due to increased competition among local breweries. The building housed various businesses over the next century, until 2007, when the building was jacked up and relocated from 423 Juneau Ave. to a vacant lot along Old World 3rd St. Sadly, in 2009 due to insufficient funding for redevelopment, the building which at the time represented Milwaukee’s oldest surviving brewery was demolished. Today it is a pile of bricks in an architectural salvage yard along the Milwaukee River.\nOne other historic Milwaukee brewery that focused primarily on brewing wheat-based beer was Eugene Louis Husting. Like many brewers before and after him, Eugene began as a brewer at the Northwestern Brewery, which was owned by Phillip Altpeter. After marrying Phillip’s daughter Bertha in 1872, E.L. Husting opened his own weiss beer brewery and soda factory on the east side of 5th St. between Cherry St. and Vliet St. in 1877. By 1884 Husting was brewing weiss beer in an 8 barrel brew kettle and selling the product in stoneware bottles. In 1897 the Husting Brewery expanded inventory to include ginger ale, soda water, cream and orange soda, raspberry wine, and cider. As a result of prohibition (1920-1933), brewing beer discontinued and instead soda was exclusively produced. Following prohibition the company evolved into a beer and soda distributor until 1970 when the plant shut down. Today, the main building is still intact and is now considered the oldest standing complete brewery in Milwaukee. Its current tenants are a ribbon factory on the first level and Great Lakes Archaeological Research Center on the second floor, ironically the same company this archaeologist used to work for!\nThe resulting Wisconsin Weizen ale that we brewed fermented quickly and will be bottled on Thursday, February 17th. Currently, it has a delightful wheat aroma, slightly hazy with a nice hop finish. In keeping with historic tradition, this wheat ale will be bottle conditioned, whereby adding a small amount of sweet wheat malt to each bottle in order to promote final carbonation. It should be ready to drink in two weeks, but will only get better with age. It is our hope that Milwaukee’s forgotten weiss beer brewers would be proud of this fermented concoction!

{"question":"As someone interested in water rights, I'd like to know how Islam views water ownership and distribution. What are the basic principles?","answer":"In Islam, water is considered a gift belonging equally to all living beings. While water ownership is accepted when someone builds infrastructure (like in a river course), there is an obligation to distribute any surplus free of charge. Water must be managed and distributed equitably among humans, animals, and plant life. Providing water to others is considered 'sadaqah' (a good deed), and there is an obligation to assist the thirsty, whether human or animal.","context":["The great cultural bloom that took place during the al-Andalus period was made possible from a material and social viewpoint thanks, among other factors, to the wise water management at those times. Countryside, cities, public bathhouses and fountains, mosques and gardens honoured the element of water. However, this water culture emerged from a distinctively Islamic conception which is briefly summarized in the following paragraphs.\nWater in the Holy Quran\nIn Islam, life and knowledge originated from water, a divine gift that symbolises profound wisdom, the drink that quenches the soul’s thirst. But it is also science. Thus, the word al-ma’a – water in Arabic – appears 63 times in the Quran, which revealed secrets in the 7th century recently discovered by science.\nDo not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth we joined together (as one Unit of Creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing (Quran, 21-30).\nIndeed, today we know that water covers more than 70% of Earth’s surface (mostly seas and oceans). We also know that water has been found in the interstellar clouds of our galaxy – the Milky Way –, as well as in Mars, and it is believed to be found in other galaxies. It also appears to be one of the first molecules on planet Earth.\nThe Holy Book states as follows with regard to living creatures:\nAnd God has created every animal from water: of them there are some that creep on their bellies; some that walk on two legs; and some that walk on four. God creates what He wills; for verily God has power over all things (Quran, 24-45).\nToday we know that as babies we are 75% water and as we grow older the body of an adult human being is made of approximately 60% water. Animals contain on average 60% water while vegetables up to 75%. Human brain is composed of 90% water. This means that the human being, which is the most perfect being in nature, talks, thinks, does, undoes, writes and invents on the basis of water.\nAllah thus asserts in the Holy Book that His Throne was upon the water. That is to say that he created life on the basis of water.\nWater also represents also purity in Islam. Thanks to water human beings take care of their body hygiene, as in all cultures, but also perform spiritual purification by means of the daily ablutions. In accordance with the great Sufi Ibn ‘Arabi of Murcia, who lived in the 12th and 13th centuries, by performing ablutions believers get rid of vanity and appearing themselves as servants of the Creator.\nMoreover, water is a powerful symbol of the rebirth and quickening, and it is commonly used metaphorically. God has brought life from death, and death from life, as the Holy Book tells us.\nAnd He it is Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy, and we send down pure water from the sky.\nThat with it We may give life to dead land, and slake the thirst of things we have created, cattle and men in great numbers (Quran, 25, 48-49).\nThis description refers at first sight to a natural phenomenon, but it is means the quickening of the soul or the spiritual awakening.\nSignificance of Water\nWater ownership is accepted as long as the person has built a particular infrastructure, for instance in a river course. But, over and above that, there is the obligation to distribute the surplus free of charge. Many institutions were established in order to ensure a balanced and fair water distribution, some of which have lasted up to the present day, such as the Water Tribunal of (Tribunal de las Aguas) de Valencia, the Council of Good Men (Consejo de Hombres Buenos) de Murcia and the Irrigation Communities (Comunidades de Regantes) in the Eastern Coastal Region of Spain.\nProviding water to others is considered as sadaqah, a good. Some hadith, or traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, relate to the obligation to assist the thirsty ones, whether humans or animals. According to a hadith, a little dog in need was given assistance by a man who descended to the bottom of a pit with no little effort, held his shoe with the mouth to fill it with water and gave the water to the dog. In so doing, he obtained divine favour. These are beautiful stories that help us to reflect upon. And let’s not forget that we reflect thanks to water.\nFinally, I would like to emphasize that water in Islam is considered as a gift belonging to all equally, which has to be managed and distributed with equity among all living beings, humans, animals and plant life. In fact, this is envisaged in the law on the right on water, named safa. We are of water, and we live on it. Hence, this precious and scarce resource must be managed with respect and the highest degree of responsibility, in an equitable manner both individually and collectively, as our ancestors from al-Andalus taught us in such exemplary fashion."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:870bafd5-36ef-4bb9-a829-3738a7b1f398>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Support system guidelines: How should family members balance providing post-surgical assistance while maintaining their own well-being, and what recovery principles apply to both surgical patients and intensive training?","answer":"For family members providing post-surgical support, it's important to coordinate with others for help, allow the patient regular rest periods, and ensure proper sleep for both patient and caregiver. They should take time for themselves and not hesitate to seek emotional support from social workers or family doctors. Similarly, recovery principles include adequate rest between sessions, whether surgical recovery or training, proper sleep (8 hours for active adults), and paying attention to warning signs of overexertion. In both cases, pushing too hard without proper recovery can lead to negative physical and mental health impacts.","context":["Find information for family and friends of patients undergoing surgery.\nIt is really important for people having surgery to have friends and family members to offer support and assistance.\nThe support person may take on the role of coordinator, making arrangements with others to help out.\nStress and medications can impair memory and clear thinking\nThinking about having surgery can be stressful, and stress can prevent us from remembering things and make it difficult to think clearly. Many medications can have the same effect. One of the ways you can help is to go with the patient to their appointments with the surgeon and at the Pre-Admission Clinic. Listen carefully, ask questions, and write information down so it is there for you and the patient to review later.\nSurgical patients cannot go home alone\nIf your family member or friend has had a medication to make you sleepy or that put you to sleep for your surgery, they must go home with someone who is a responsible adult. These drugs can stay in your body for up to 24 hours.\nIf your family member or friend has not had a general anesthetic or any medication to make you sleep with a minor surgery or some diagnostic procedures, they may go home without a responsible adult.\nAssume that your family member/friend will need to be driven or escorted home, unless you are specifically told otherwise by a member of their surgical team.\nIt is not necessary for you to have your own vehicle. You can accompany the patient in a taxi or on the bus. The important thing is for them to have a clear headed adult with them to ensure their safety.\nMake time to rest and sleep\nMost patients enjoy having visitors and some would love to have you nearby around the clock when they are in hospital. It is very important though, for both you and the patient to get a good night’s sleep, and for the patient to rest quietly several times each day.\nIt is therefore best for family and friends to leave the hospital in the evening, and to allow the patient some time alone during the day to rest.\nAsk the patient’s nurse for guidance about what is best for your family member/friend. Some hospital units have rest periods when visiting is not permitted.\nAfter the patient goes home, they may still need to rest several times each day. You can help by coordinating visitors and encouraging nap time.\nKnow when to call the surgeon or family practitioner\nCall your surgeon or family practitioner if you have any of the following:\n- You have a fever over 38.5°C (101.3F).\n- You feel increasingly tired or dizzy.\n- Your calf or lower leg is red, tender or painful.\n- You have problems urinating (going to pee).\n- You have stinging, burning or pain when you pee.\n- Your urine smells bad.\n- Your incision is red and swollen, and feels hot to touch.\n- You see blood or pus coming from the incision.\n- You have pain that does not decrease or ease with pain medicine.\n- Your pain is stopping you from moving and recovering.\n- You have a cough that continues to get worse.\n- You feel sick to your stomach or are throwing up often for more than 24 hours.\n- You have diarrhea that lasts for more than two days.\nIf you cannot contact your surgeon or family doctor, call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1 to speak to a registered nurse any time - day or night.\nYou or family member should call 9-1-1 for an ambulance if the following happens:\n- You have trouble breathing or any pain in your chest.\n- You have sudden severe pain that gets worse even with pain medications.\n- You feel cold but are sweating.\n- You start shaking.\nImportant: You should not drive yourself to the Emergency Department. Do not eat or drink anything unless you have been assessed and you have been advised you can do so.\nGetting help at home\nIf your friend/family member needs nursing care or assistance bathing, the care team at the hospital will make a referral to Home Health, and they will contact the patient to make arrangements.\nGetting help for you\nIt is very important for you to take care of yourself when you are helping to take care of someone else. It is not selfish for you to take time to be alone or to go out and do something you enjoy. There are likely other friends, family members, neighbours, or people from church who would be more than happy to help out if they knew what was needed, so just ask.\nDon’t be afraid or embarrassed to ask for help if you want someone to talk to about your own emotions or fears. All hospitals have social workers that you can talk to. You can also talk to your family doctor if you are worried about your own well-being.\nThis checklist is designed as a handy tool for you to keep track of what the patient has asked you to take care of and any tasks that you can hand over to other family and friends who are able to assist.282.99 KBUpdated 30/07/2018\nGetting ready surgery guide for older children and teens\nDownload our guide to help your older child or teen get ready for their upcoming surgery.\n- Abbotsford Regional Hospital\n- Chilliwack General Hospital\n- Eagle Ridge Hospital\n- Langley Memorial Hospital\n- Ridge Meadows Hospital\n- Royal Columbian Hospital\n- Surrey Memorial Hospital\nPreparing your child for surgery\nDownload our guide to help you get your child ready for their upcoming surgery.\nFrequently asked questions\nUnderstand more about your surgery by visiting our frequently asked questions section.","The dangers of overtraining\nWhilst regular exercise is encouraged for all its many health benefits, it is important to be aware that training too hard or for too long can have a negative impact on your body. This is what is known as overtraining. So how do we know if we are overtraining and what are the dangers associated with it?\nBelow are some of the most common signs to look out for. They can also be related to many other things, so need to be considered holistically in order to recognize whether they are in fact a possible result of overtraining.\n- Regular injuries. It is essential to get enough rest between training sessions as this allows your body to recover properly and can enhance performance and muscle growth. If you are struggling with frequent injuries, it could be a sign that you are not giving your body enough rest.\n- Low immune system. If you are generally feeling run down and finding you are getting sick more often this could be pointing to the fact that your body may benefit from more rest periods.\n- Muscle pain. Although a certain amount of muscle soreness and stiffness after training is to be expected, this should usually only last 1-2 days.\n- Struggling to focus and sleep and experiencing feelings of stress, anxiety and fatigue.\nWhat can we do to help prevent overtraining?\n- Cross-training is a great way of ensuring we do different types of exercise that benefit us in different ways and avoid putting too much strain on any one part of the body. Balance your training by doing a combination of cardiovascular workouts, lifting weights and exercises like yoga and pilates.\n- Keeping a training diary can be very useful. Note how you feel after a workout and how long it takes to recover.\n- Schedule regular rest days.\n- Alternate training between different muscle groups when lifting weights. For example, focus on your upper body on one day followed by a rest day and then a lower body workout followed by another rest day.\n- Ensure you are resting adequately within your workouts. For example, when lifting weights, leave some rest time between each set.\n- Make sure you are eating enough calories and the right type of food to complement your training regime. Focus on having a balanced nutritious meal 2-3 hours before a workout and refuelling around 45 minutes after.\n- Adequate sleep is essential – 8 hours is the ideal amount for an active adult.\n- Make relaxation part of your training plan – meditation, yoga, and massages are some great ways to help you unwind.\nPushing your body to the point where it is not able to recover well enough between exercise sessions can be detrimental to your physical and mental health.\nEnsuring you get enough rest can go a long way towards enhancing muscle gains, improving your overall performance and ultimately helping you reach your fitness goals.\nListen to your body."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ad682e88-8a5e-4554-ad01-d57ce95f4bc1>","<urn:uuid:1b46256b-39d4-42f9-9af9-1393b21d4490>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do safety monitoring requirements differ between hot work and powder coating processes?","answer":"For hot work, monitoring requires a trained fire watcher during the work, including breaks, and for 30-60 minutes after work stops (up to 3 hours in some cases). The area must be continuously monitored for combustible gases before, during, and after work. For powder coating, monitoring focuses on different aspects: the powder coating cubicle requires constant ventilation monitoring through exhaust fans and powder reclamation systems, operators must continuously wear protective gear like goggles and dust masks, and equipment maintenance must be regularly monitored to ensure safe and efficient operation.","context":["OSH Answers Fact Sheets\nEasy-to-read, question-and-answer fact sheets covering a wide range of workplace health and safety topics, from hazards to diseases to ergonomics to workplace promotion. MORE ABOUT >\nWhat is hot work?\nWorking with ignition sources near flammable materials is referred to as \"hot work.\" Welding and cutting are examples of hot work. Fires are often the result of the \"quick five minute\" job in areas not intended for welding or cutting. Getting a hot work permit before performing hot work is just one of steps involved in a hot work management program that helps to reduce the risk of starting a fire by welding or cutting in areas where there are flammable or combustible materials.\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 51B \"Fire Prevention in the Use of Cutting and Welding Processes\" serves as the basis for the fire codes and many fire prevention practices adopted by industry.\nWhat is a hot work management program?\nHot work management programs are put in place to control or eliminate hot work hazards and their risks. Programs include the development of policies, procedures, and the assignment of responsibilities and accountabilities for all aspects of hot work. A program includes:\na. Where hot work is permitted\nb. When hot work is permitted\nc. Who authorizes hot work\na. What must be assessed before permitting/performing hot work in an area or on a process piece of equipment or area\nb. What to do to prepare an area for hot work\nc. What to do if hot work cannot be avoided in a particularly hazardous area\nd. What hot work tools are required\ne. How to obtain a hot work permit, when they are required, and who can administer them\na. Employees, supervisors, maintenance individuals, fire wardens, trained fire watch individuals, and contractors all have different roles, and must be trained accordingly\na. Posting procedures\nb. Posting policies\nc. Posting signs in areas that are prohibited from having hot work performed in them\nCan hot work be avoided?\nYou may be able to substitute hot work with other methods. Below are some examples:\n|Saw or torch cutting||Manual hydraulic shears|\n|Sweat soldering||Screwed or flanged pipe|\n|Torch of radial saw cutting||Mechanical pipe cutter|\nBefore performing hot work, what are some general good practices?\nMake sure you are following your hot work procedure. Also consider the follow items:\n- Make sure that all equipment is in good operating order before work starts.\n- Inspect the work area thoroughly before starting. Look for combustible materials in structures (partitions, walls, ceilings).\n- Sweep clean any combustible materials on floors around the work zone. Combustible floors must be kept wet with water or covered with fire resistant blankets or damp sand.\n- Use water ONLY if electrical circuits have been de-energized to prevent electrical shock.\n- Remove any spilled grease, oil, or other combustible liquid.\n- Move all flammable and combustible materials away from the work area.\n- If combustibles cannot be moved, cover them with fire resistant blankets or shields. Protect gas lines and equipment from falling sparks, hot materials and objects.\n- Block off cracks between floorboards, along baseboards and walls, and under door openings, with a fire resistant material. Close doors and windows.\n- Cover wall or ceiling surfaces with a fire resistant and heat insulating material to prevent ignition and accumulation of heat.\n- Secure, isolate, and vent pressurized vessels, piping and equipment as needed before beginning hot work.\n- Inspect the area following work to ensure that wall surfaces, studs, wires or dirt have not heated up.\n- Vacuum away combustible debris from inside ventilation or other service duct openings to prevent ignition. Seal any cracks in ducts. Prevent sparks from entering into the duct work. Cover duct openings with a fire resistant barrier and inspect the ducts after work has concluded.\n- Post a trained fire watcher within the work area during welding, including during breaks, and for at least 30-60 minutes after work has stopped. Depending on the work done, the area may need to be monitored for longer (up to 3 hours) after the end of the hot work.\n- Eliminate explosive atmospheres (e.g., vapours or combustible dust) or do not allow hot work. Shut down any process that produces combustible atmospheres, and continuously monitor the area for accumulation of combustible gases before, during, and after hot work.\n- If possible, schedule hot work during shutdown periods.\n- Comply with the required legislation and standards applicable to your workplace.\nAlthough every effort is made to ensure the accuracy, currency and completeness of the information, CCOHS does not guarantee, warrant, represent or undertake that the information provided is correct, accurate or current.

But, and this is an important point, the equipment and materials do pose a threat to an operator. Just like any area that's reserved for a manufacturing operation, there are risk factors to address. Starting with the workshop premises, there are OH&S (Occupational Health and Safety) guidelines that exist to keep everyone and everything safe.\nDetermining The Risk Factors\nA safe working environment comes before all other considerations. In order to maintain that safety margin, the hazards associated with every stage of the process must be known in some detail. Again, this is essentially a work-congenial process, but it is a manufacturing technique, so a few hazards will always be in play. A hot curing oven, for example, will cause serious burns if it's mishandled. Likewise, the tiny powder granules are airborne, which means they could be breathed in until they cause respiratory problems. Finally, high voltages and corrosive stripping chemicals exist in different sections of the workshop, so only authorised personnel should be walking these floors.\nSatisfying Regulatory Concerns\nA few of the next regulatory dealings may sound like self-evident facts, but there's always one contractor out there who favours a short cut. The OH&S directives don't tolerate shortcuts, not in any form. Anyway, back to safeguards. All of those cleansing agents and caustic scrubbing chemicals need to be stored properly. At best, they could exude a vapour that burns a sensitive eye. At worst, however, they represent a fire hazard. Over at the processing cubicle, the equipment bay requires a sealing hood, a covering that stops the powder from leaking. Exhaust fans and powder reclamation systems take care of the airborne particles, but protective gear, especially goggles and a dust mask (www.worksafe.au), must be worn at all times during the application stage. Remember, these airborne particles are not usually toxic, but the fine dust will irritate an operator's respiratory airways.\nOnce out in the field, in the place the workpiece will function, it's certain to be dry and weather-resistant. However, the manufacturing equipment that produces this eco-friendly product does possess the potential to harm an inattentive operator. Additionally, the strong airflow and electrostatic charge used in the powder coating cubicle requires careful consideration, for there are commercial-grade air compressors and high-voltage appliances providing powder drive energy. Keep all of these discrete system parts in mind, and remember that all of this equipment requires maintenance if it's to work safely and efficiently.\nGP Industries Pty Ltd\n1 Regal Court,\nVermont South VIC 3133\nPhone: (03) 9802 1355\nFax: (03) 9802 6027\n20 Burgess Road,\nBayswater North VIC 3153\nPhone: (03) 9761 7676\nFax: (03) 9761 7671\nOptimized by NetwizardSEO.com.au\n- Powder Coating in Sheet Metal Processing\n- Powder Coating for Automotive for Best Finished Results\n- Is Powder Coating Better than Spray Paint?\n- Differences between Metal Plating and Powder Coating\n- Sustainable Powder Coating\n- Why Do You Need to Use High Temperature Masking Tapes When Powder Coating?\n- Benefits of the Powder Recovery System\n- Why You MUST Remove Moisture before Powder Coating\n- Electrocoat and Chemical Dipping Plants\n- Things to Look for When Buying Powder Coating Ovens\n- Process of Metal Pretreatment in Powder Coating\n- How to Judge a Perfect Powder Finish: What Should You Look For?\n- Dust Collectors and Cyclones in Relation to Powder Coating\n- Functions of Overhead Conveyors in Powder Coating Equipment\n- Keeping Corrosion Off Your Equipment: How Powder Coating Helps\n- The Role of Hot Ovens in the Powder Coating Process\n- Potential Cure Cycle Problem Areas in Powder Coating\n- Causes of Peeling and Pinholes in Powder Coating\n- Common Powder Coating Gun Problems and Solutions\n- Is It Possible to Apply Powder Coating Over Wet Paint?\n- What are the Differences between Electro Coating and Powder Coating?\n- Reliable Powder Coating Equipment Manufacturer and Supplier in Melbourne\n- Powdercoating Failures: What Causes Air Bubbles, Cracks and Peeling?\n- Is It Possible to Powder Coat Chrome Materials?\n- Pre-Treatment Process of Materials before Powder Coating\n- View all articles…"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1da0d476-b0e3-4abe-8b11-228dcede5286>","<urn:uuid:6f9a433e-1925-45b5-a20d-234eb911f05a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What maintenance requirements do solar-powered hot tubs and air source heat pumps have?","answer":"Solar-powered hot tubs require regular maintenance of the solar panel system and proper electrical connections, with particular attention to GFCI installation for safety. The system also needs battery maintenance for nighttime or cloudy day operation. In contrast, air source heat pumps have very few moving parts and require less ongoing maintenance than traditional heating systems, with only an annual service recommended to ensure optimal efficiency. This makes ASHPs generally easier to maintain over the long term.","context":["Hot tubs are a luxurious addition to any backyard, providing relaxation and comfort for you and your loved ones. However, operating a hot tub can be expensive, with high energy costs being a major concern.\nWith the growing popularity of renewable energy sources, you may be wondering if it’s possible to run a hot tub on solar power. Solar power is a clean, sustainable, and cost-effective way to generate electricity, making it an attractive option for powering your hot tub.\nIn this article, we will explore whether or not it’s possible to run a hot tub on solar power and what steps you need to take to make it happen.\nIt is possible to run a hot tub on solar power, provided that you have a sufficiently sized solar panel system. The number of panels required will depend on the size of your hot tub, your location, and your energy usage. Additionally, you may need to install a solar power system, including solar panels, an inverter, and a battery bank.\nCan You Run a Hot Tub on Solar Power?\nYes, it is possible to run a hot tub on solar power. However, there are several factors to consider before doing so.\nFirstly, hot tubs require a significant amount of energy to operate, especially when heating the water. This means that you would need a large and efficient solar power system to generate enough electricity to power your hot tub.\nSecondly, the location of your hot tub and the solar panels is also important. Your solar panels should be installed in a location that receives adequate sunlight throughout the day, ideally facing south and with minimal shading.\nThirdly, you may need to invest in additional equipment, such as batteries or an inverter, to store and convert the solar energy for use in your hot tub.\nLastly, it is important to consult with a qualified solar energy professional to ensure that your system is properly designed, installed, and maintained to ensure reliable and safe operation.\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of a Solar Power Hot Tub\nEven though it seems a win-win situation for you to have a solar-powered hot tub, everything has benefits and drawbacks.\nAdvantages of a Solar Power Hot Tub\nThere are several reasons why people are using solar energy more and more. Here, we’ll show you why solar-powered hot tubs are currently a big deal.\n- Save Money: Solar-powered hot tubs can save you money by eliminating the need to pay for electricity to power the hot tub.\n- Environment Friendly: Solar energy is a clean and renewable option, making solar-powered hot tubs an environmentally friendly choice.\n- Easy to Install: Installing a solar heating system is easy, either by DIY or hiring a specialist to do it for you.\n- Always Available: Solar-powered hot tubs can be used at any time of day or year as long as the battery is fully charged.\n- Reliable: Solar energy is reliable and always available, unlike electricity which can go out anytime.\nDisadvantages of a Solar Power Hot Tub\nThere are certain drawbacks also –\n- Requires Battery Storage: The system will only work when the sun shines, so battery storage capacity is necessary for nighttime or cloudy days.\n- Safety Concerns: Proper electrical connections and GFCI installation are crucial for safety.\n- Higher initial cost: Solar hot tubs tend to have a longer lifespan than those powered by gas or electric heaters, but initial costs may be higher.\nHow to Heat a Hot Tub by Solar Power\nHot tubs can be heated using one of two methods. The water from the hot tub must first go via a heat-exchanging panel in the first method. The second method uses conventional solar panels that are directly connected to energy-storing batteries.\nWhich approach is best for you? Let’s look more closely.\n#1 The Heat Exchange Panel Approach\nThe simplest way to use the sun’s rays to heat your hot tub is to use heat exchange panels. The technology is still simple but efficient.\nBut to make it work, you’ll need at least six hours of steady, powerful sunlight each day where you live. How does this method work?\nThe cold water traverses the heat exchanger as it leaves the hot tub’s bottom. The heat-exchanging panel is a sizable panel with numerous tiny tubes weaving around it. These tubes let the passage of water through them.\nThe tubes are set against a pitch-black background, absorbing heat in the process. The front of the panel is frequently covered with a perspex or glass covering, which assists in intensifying the heat.\nThe sun’s rays heat the chilly water as it travels through these tiny tubes. It goes through the other end of the heat exchanger after being heated. The water is then piped into the hot tub’s upper section from there. The water cools down and then descends to the system at the bottom of the hot tub, where it is heated up once more.\n- A relatively inexpensive and low-tech solution, all you’ll need are connecting tubes and a small pump.\n- Creates lots of free hot water in sunny climates.\n- Maintenance-free as it doesn’t rely on moving parts or mechanics that can break down.\n- Easy to fit and compatible with the electric heating system.\n- Requires a large heat exchange panel (up to 6ft x 2ft).\n- You may need more than one panel to provide enough adequate hot water.\n- Lack of temperature control could lead to dangerous situations such as extremely hot water.\n- No energy storage option for excess solar energy.\n#2 The System And Battery Approach\nWhat other choices do you have for a solar-powered hot tub? Solar panels and solar batteries can be used to collect energy from the sun and that’s the second approach. However, you’ll need to invest in a solar kit if you want to start using this method.\nYou will also need to maintain an electrical heating system, much like with the heat exchanging panel strategy. After all, a solar kit won’t be able to supply all the electricity needed for a hot tub on its own.\nWhat is the cost of this conversion for a solar-powered hot tub? These kits run over $2,000, but they will last you for a very long time. Additionally, according to the majority of experts, switching to a battery-powered system won’t void the warranty on your hot tub. Just keep in mind to confirm with your manufacturer to be certain.\nSolar Hot Tub Installation Tips and Warnings\nInstalling solar panels or a solar heat exchanger kit is simple. But follow these tips to get the most out of your hot tub-\n- Location is key when it comes to installing solar panels for your hot tub. For most people, the panels must be mounted at a 30 to 45-degree angle and facing south to ensure optimal sunlight exposure.\n- Ensure that the site where you install the solar panels receives 5 to 6 hours of sunlight daily to heat your hot tub effectively.\n- Consider investing in a solar controller, which can provide thermostat capabilities for your hot tub, and turn off the solar heating system when it rains or at night. Although this will add to the cost of your installation, it could be worth it if you use your hot tub frequently.\nHow Do You Heat a Hot Tub with Solar Panels?\nThere are several ways to heat a hot tub with solar panels, but the most common method is to use solar panels to generate electricity for an electric water heater. This involves installing solar panels on your property and connecting them to an inverter, which converts DC current to AC. The AC power can then be used to run the electric water heater, which heats the water in your hot tub.\nTo ensure that you have a constant supply of electricity, it’s important to connect batteries to your solar panels so that you can store the electricity they generate for use at night or on cloudy days when the panels aren’t producing as much power. It’s also important to install monitoring software to keep track of how much power your panels are generating and what appliances are using that power.\nAnother option for heating an outdoor hot tub with solar power is to use thermal mass storage technology, which can store the sun’s warmth for longer periods of time without significantly affecting your energy bills. This involves using materials like water or rocks to store heat during the day and releasing it at night to keep your hot tub warm.\nIf you’re considering a solar-powered hot tub, it’s important to choose a professional installer who can help you choose the right size and type of solar panels for your needs and ensure that the installation is safe and compliant with all local regulations.\nWith the right installation and maintenance, a solar-powered hot tub can be an efficient and environmentally friendly way to enjoy a relaxing soak outdoors.\nCan I Heat My Hot Tub with Solar Power in Winter?\nWinter solar hot tub heating requires extra planning. Solar panels produce less electricity in the winter due to the reduced amount of sunlight available, so you may need a backup energy source.\nOne solution is to add a solar hot water heater to your solar panels. This technology stores solar energy and heats your hot tub at night. This will preheat your hot tub by winter, making it more comfortable even in the snow.\nAnother solution is to use a hybrid heating system that mixes solar energy with gas or electricity. This will keep your hot tub warm on cloudy days when solar panels may not generate enough electricity.\nHow Much Will a Solar Hot Tub Cost Me?\nThe cost of a solar hot tub will depend on various factors, such as the size of your hot tub, the type of solar heating system you choose, and the professional installer you hire. It’s important to note that the initial cost of installing a solar heating system will be higher compared to traditional methods, as professional installation is crucial for the system to work effectively.\nIn terms of ongoing costs, solar hot tubs are a more economical option in the long run because you won’t have to pay for electricity or gas bills. The money you save will depend on your energy usage and how well you maintain your solar panel system.\nIf you’re currently spending $200-$300 monthly on heating your hot tub, a solar-powered alternative can help you save money and reduce your environmental impact. However, if the initial investment is not feasible for you at the moment, it’s better to stick with traditional methods until you can afford to make the switch.\nIn conclusion, if you’re looking for a sustainable and cost-effective way to power your hot tub, running it on solar power is a great option. You can save money on electricity costs, reduce your carbon footprint, and enjoy your hot tub all year round.\nHowever, before you make the switch, you need to consider the size of your hot tub, energy usage, the location of your hot tub, and the necessary equipment, such as batteries or an inverter.\nIt is essential to consult with a qualified solar energy professional to ensure that your system is properly designed, installed, and maintained to ensure reliable and safe operation. With the right solar power system in place, you can relax and soak up the sun while enjoying the comfort of your hot tub.","An Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) captures heat from the air circulating outside your property and boosts the temperature to provide heat and hot water. It is a very effective, low carbon way of heating your home and can be combined with a number of renewable and energy efficient technologies to deliver a truly sustainable home or commercial premises.\nAn ASHP can be installed in new and existing properties and the Government’s Renewable Heat Incentive provides cash payments for all eligible installations, which makes the investment even more attractive.\nIn warmer months ASHPs can operate as air conditioning units, meaning that you benefit from your heating system all year round, whatever the weather!\nHow air source works\nAn Air Source Heat Pump uses the same technology as your kitchen fridge to move heat from one place to another.\nAn ASHP uses the temperature of the air circulating outside to warm a liquid refrigerant.\nThe heat pump turns the refrigerant into a gas, compresses it and then condenses back into a liquid again which generates heat energy and the cycle starts again.\nWhat makes heat pumps sustainable?\nThe temperature of the air outside is determined by the sun and local weather conditions and is therefore a renewable source of heat.\nUsing this renewable energy to help heat your home is more sustainable than fossil fuel alternatives.\nHeat pumps are electric, but by using heat from the air they use less electricity to produce heat than traditional electric heating systems.\nCombining your ASHP with your own solar energy increases their sustainability and further reduces carbon emissions.\nAre air source heat pumps efficient?\nThe efficiency and performance of an ASHP is measured using Coefficient of Performance (COP) and this varies by model and brand.\nA number of factors including the insulation levels that your property has, your existing heating system and whether you are using under floor heating versus radiators will determine the overall performance of your ASHP.\nGovernment incentive schemes to encourage investment in low carbon technology can currently cover the cost of installation and ongoing maintenance costs are lower than with traditional heating systems.\nGeo Green Power have extensive experience and will ensure you understand the options available.\nLearn more about how ASHPs work\nIf you choose Air to Air your ASHP will provide hot air to heat your property and you will need an alternative system to provide hot water.\nIf you choose Air to Water then your ASHP will provide hot water to heat your property and provide hot water for use within your home.\nIt’s important to consider your requirements and any unique aspects of your property and location to create the best solution.\nWhen designed and configured correctly your ASHP does not require a back-up heating option.\nHeat pumps are designed to maintain properties at a consistent temperature. This is when they run at their optimum efficiency and are most effective.\nASHPs can be combined with over-sized radiators or underfloor heating. Underfloor heating is often more efficient, but great results can be achieved with other forms of heating.\nWe will ensure that we recommend the right option for you and your property\nASHPs work all year round and in temperatures down to -15 degrees.\nThey are more efficient when the outside temperatures are higher, however in the UK the difference between seasons is very minimal.\nAll air that is above the temperature of absolute zero has heat energy!\nIn recent years ASHP technology has improved considerably. The cost of ownership has come down and the units have become quieter and more efficient.\nRequest a call to discuss your project\nWhat is the installation process?\nASHPs are fitted to the outside of your property and are about 1m wide, 1m high and around 30cm deep.\nNo ground works are required.\nDepending on your existing system, your ASHP may easily link to your water tank and heating with limited additional works. You may need to replace your radiators for larger units.\nA domestic installation in a single property is usually completed and commissioned within 5 working days.\nLearn more about installation\nASHPs have very few moving parts and require less ongoing maintenance than traditional heating systems. We recommend an annual service to ensure that your system is running at its optimum efficiently.\nYou do not require planning permission for an ASHP.\nYour ASHP is positioned outside your property and is best in a sheltered location which has good air flow. Most properties can easily accommodate an ASHP in a location that is both effective and convenient.\nASHPs work best when they are combined with other energy saving technology such as insulation and double glazing. Running your heat pump to maintain your property at a consistent temperature is also advisable.\nChanging from Oil Fired Heating to Air Source\nWhen Paul took on a 1970s property he wanted to move away from oil fired heating. He carefully compared the cost of replacing the old oil boiler with an up to date condensing oil boiler or an Air Source Heat Pump system and found that the heat pump option was the right choice for him.\nCosts & Expected Returns\nWhat is the installation cost for air source?\nOur ASHP installations start from around £12,000\nHow much do ASHPs cost to run?\nIt’s very difficult to estimate the running costs of your installation as it will depend on the size of the space you want to heat, the temperature you are running the system at and a number of other factors such as insultation and whether you are using underfloor heating or radiators.\nWe will be happy to provide an estimate of your running costs if you would like to discuss your project.\nWhat will my return on investment be?\nThe return on investment that you receive will be determined by the type of fuel you are looking to replace and the cost of running your system. Higher returns can be achieved when switching from oil or LPG heating systems.\nThe current Renewable Heat Incentive provides payments that, in a number of cases, can cover the cost of the installation.\nHeat pumps require less maintenance and repair than most traditional heating systems, which also makes them an attractive investment.\nGet in touch to discuss your ASHP project\nJames oversees all of our air source heat pump installations. Get in touch today to organise a no-obligation consultation about your next project.\nWhat is the RHI and are Grants available for ASHPs?\nThe current Government scheme is the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI).\nThe domestic scheme provides payments for 7 years and applies to eligible heating systems that are used for one dwelling\nYour system will have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and a Seasonal Performance Factor and these two values will be used to calculate your payments based on your usage and the current tariff.\nEstimated output: 12,000kWh per annum\nEstimated RHI income: £900.00 per annum (7 year contract)\nEstimated CO2 savings: 4 tonnes per annum\nASHPs in Commercial & Domestic Buildings\nASHPs in commercial buildings\nASHPs can easily be installed in commercial premises to provide heating and air conditioning and are particularly efficient when running to provide a consistent temperature for offices and workspaces.\nASPHs in domestic houses\nASHPs provide a low carbon, energy efficient way of heating homes. The systems are low maintenance and combining them with other energy efficient technology helps to ensure that they perform at their best.\nASHPs in New Builds vs Existing Properties\nASHPs installation in new builds\nThe construction of a new property is the perfect opportunity to consider and implement energy efficient, sustainable technology to ensure that the finished result is as cost effective and environmentally friendly as possible.\nThe UK Government is due to bring in the Future Homes Standard in 2025 which will prohibit any new build property from having a fossil fuel heating system.\nIncorporating low carbon, renewable heating into new build projects will ensure that you remain ahead of legislation.\nASHPs installation in existing and historic buildings\nASHPs can be retrofitted into existing properties to replace oil, LPG and mains gas heating systems. The return on investment will vary depending on the existing heating system and other factors such as the property’s energy ratings.\nAir Source vs Alternative Heating Solutions\nComparing ASHPs to existing gas and oil systems\nAn ASHP provides an energy efficient, low carbon option when compared to gas, oil or LPG heating systems. It delivers a significant reduction in CO2 emissions and has lower ongoing maintenance costs.\nThe costs of installation may be higher than traditional fossil fuel systems, but this is offset considerably by the RHI payments you will receive.\nRunning costs are usually comparable to mains gas systems, and significantly cheaper than oil or LPG.\nAir source heat pump or ground source\nAn ASHP installation is often cheaper and less intrusive than a GSHP installation and is ideal for smaller properties and those with limited outside space.\nIf you have a large property to heat, and enough outside space a GSHP will outperform an ASHP. A GSHP system can collect more renewable heat from the earth and therefore requires less electricity to produce the same heat output.\nAir source heat pump or solar panels\nWhen considering an ASHP or solar panels, the best choice for you will depend on your heating requirements, budget and energy usage and we will be happy to discuss your options with you.\nIt may be most cost effective for you to consider a scheme that incorporates both. Using solar power to run your heat pump could deliver the greatest cost efficiency and deliver the most sustainable scheme.\nFind out more about renewable energy…"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a9b48e35-ad3d-42cd-a832-7adfcfc81417>","<urn:uuid:416a8aee-e3a5-4e75-a89b-505befe84c0e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in storing expensive vintage wines long-term. What's the key difference between traditional decanting methods and regular storage requirements?","answer":"Traditional decanting for vintage wines requires careful preparation to handle sediments, including standing the bottle upright for two days and using tools like a decanting cradle and candle for careful pouring. In contrast, regular wine storage focuses on four main factors: maintaining a constant cool temperature (ideally 55°F), protecting from light, avoiding vibration, and keeping the cork wet by laying bottles on their sides. For expensive vintage wines meant for long aging, these storage requirements become especially critical and may warrant investment in commercial storage units or temperature-controlled storage facilities.","context":["I suggest that you read “When Should You Decant Wine?” before you read this article.\nYou have probably seen wine decanted in many different ways. You have probably seen wine being carefully poured into a wine decanter or wine carafe. You have also probably seen what I like to call the “Slam Dunk” method of wine decanting; in this instance, the host turns the wine bottle upside down and, without any restraint, dumps the wine into the wine decanter.\nSo, which wine decanting method is better: the careful wine pouring or the unrestrained wine dumping? The truth is that you can do both – but not with all wines. Some wines are better served by careful decanting; some are better served by the Slam Dunk decanting system.\nWine Decanting Tools\nThe following are the basic wine decanting tools:\nThe use of a decanting cradle is optional, but I highly recommend that you use one. A decanting cradle will ensure a steady rate of wine flow, so you won’t stir up the sediments as you pour the wine. If you disturb the sediments while pouring, you will get less wine out of the wine bottle. If you do not have a decanting cradle, use a funnel instead; a glass funnel is preferred.\nYou also need a candle or any kind of backlighting. This will let you see through the bottle as you pour the wine into the decanter. When decanting, do not place the candle directly under the wine bottle; this will darken the bottle and produce unwanted smoke.\nOne piece of advice regarding wine decanters: when buying a wine decanter, make sure that it is functional and easy to clean. I have\nthis really beautiful wine decanter that I never use as it takes forever to clean. It is also so badly designed that the last one-half of a glass was wasted when I used it.\nThe Traditional Wine Decanting Method\nOld and fine wines, while patiently waiting for judgment day, typically form plenty of sediments through the years. If you are decanting old and fine wines, do the following:\n- Two days before serving, take the bottle of wine from storage and let it stand upright. This way, the sediments will have time to settle at the bottom of the wine bottle.\n- On the day of serving, open the wine bottle carefully to ensure that you will not disturb the sediments that have already settled at the bottom.\n- Before decanting the wine, make sure that your wine decanter is clean and does not smell of stale air.\n- When the wine and the decanter are ready,\nplace the wine bottle in your decanting cradle (if you have one), light the candle and, with a steady hand, start pouring the wine into the funnel or directly into the wine decanter. Do not stop pouring until you see the sediments getting too close to the neck of the wine bottle.\n- Let the wine rest in the decanter for a bit (30-60 minutes) and serve.\nMy Personal Decanting Method for Old, Vintage Wines\nI use the traditional decanting method for old, vintage wines, but I like to start a week in advance.\n- First, I take the wine bottle from my wine cellar then let it stand in an upright position for two days. I make sure that the wine bottle is away from light throughout this time.\n- After two days, I open the wine bottle, place it on the decanting cradle, light the candle, and then pour the wine into\n- I wash the wine bottle, find a new cork if the one I’ve just removed is too damaged, funnel all but one small glass of the wine back into the now clean bottle, spray inert aerosol gas (I use Private Preserve) into the bottle, and put the cork back on.\n- I let the bottle stand in an upright position until I am ready to serve the wine a few days later\nWhy do I follow this intricate decanting process? Why decant the wine then pour it back into the bottle a few days before actual serving? I have two main reasons:\nFirst, this decanting process allows the wine to clear up even more. In the process of pouring wine into the decanter, the smaller sediments may have been stirred up. My decanting method gives these sediments time to resettle.\nSecond, this process also gives me the opportunity to taste the wine and detect faults, if any. I would really hate to find out on the day of serving that the great\nwine I told all my friends about is faulty. Imagine holding a party for the express purpose of letting other wine lovers sample a special wine. On the day of the tasting, you discover that the wine you’re planning to serve – the wine that is the main reason for the wine tasting party – is actually faulty. In that case, you’ll have to find a replacement right away, and you probably won’t have time to decant your replacement wine properly. A mistake like this can definitely ruin your party.\nMy personal method of decanting old, vintage wines is tedious, I admit, but it just goes to show how much I really love fine wines.\nThe Slam Dunk Decanting Method\nThe slam dunk method is best used on younger wines that have no visible sediments. In this case, decanting is done mainly to aerate the wine. The slam dunk method lets the wine breathe by almost breaking it up.\nnI use this wine decanting technique when serving young wines with big tannins, which are still immature and closed up. After pouring the wine into the decanter, I let it sit there for at least an hour or two before serving.\nNote: You can now buy aerating gadgets (i.e. wine aerator) that you can use to open up wine. These gadgets do the trick, and they work even faster than dumping the wine into a decanter.\nI will end my discussion of wine decanting here. I hope that you have learned something from this post and that the next time you’re serving and decanting wine, you will be able to apply the wine decanting techniques discussed here. Cheers!","Many people think that if they’re going to store wine at home then they need a cellar. But the word “cellar” conjures up images of dark, cavernous chambers cut out of bedrock, or slick, temperature and humidity-controlled rooms lined with mahogany wine racks. All very nice, but not at all necessary. We recommend you interpret “cellar” somewhat loosely.\nThere are four main things to consider when storing wine: temperature, light, vibration and keeping the cork wet.\nTemperature: Both red and white wine likes to be kept cool. 55°F is ideal, but more important than this magic number is that the temperature doesn’t fluctuate. Better a constant 65°F than 40° one day and 80° the next.\nLight: Bright light and sunlight can damage wine as it ages in bottle, so the darker the room, the better. Total darkness is easily achieved by simply closing the lid of the case or the closet door.\nVibration: Areas subject to heavy foot traffic (or vacuum cleaners) should be avoided as wine, unlike martinis, should be neither shaken nor stirred.\nKeep the cork wet: Laying your bottles down on their sides keeps the wine in contact with the cork, which in turn prevents the cork from drying out. Dry corks contract, allowing air to pass into the wine and wine to leak out. If air gets in, it renders the wine dull and lifeless and it will taste more like old sherry than wine.\nIf you keep these basic requirements in mind, you’ll find it remarkably easy to find a place to store your wine, and you won’t need a cellar at all. A corner of the basement, a closet in a spare bedroom, your shipping box or the cupboard under the stairs will all do nicely. And remember, the longer you plan to store your wine, the more important these factors become. If a newly-purchased wine is to be drunk in a day or two, it really doesn’t matter too much where you keep it, but if the wine is to be kept for weeks or months then find it a nice cool, dark spot.\nNow, some wines require not months but many years, even decades, of bottle aging before they’re ready to drink. This is a small percentage of all the wines made, but nonetheless, it is an important one. Where you store these high quality (and often expensive) wines designed for long aging takes on a special importance if your investment is to be protected. In this case you may want to consider one of the commercially available wine storage units, which come in a variety of sizes and finishes. Another alternative is off-site storage, where you rent a locker in a temperature and humidity-controlled wine storage facility. This option is great for wines that you don’t plan to drink for some years and has the added advantage of being out of reach; a real bonus during those weak moments.\nAs your collection of wine grows you’ll need to keep track of it. An old-fashioned cellar book where you record each new wine that goes into your cellar and cross them off as you take them out, works just fine. These days, however, there are also numerous cellar software programs that make it easy and fun to manage your wine collection."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:624d050d-fceb-4ba4-b37e-314abaf98d97>","<urn:uuid:894311c3-40f9-481e-9b9e-3a9ed34c8672>"],"error":null}

In her 2016 book, Weapons of Math Destruction, she cites some troubling examples in the United States:\nPublic schools in Washington, D.C. in 2010 fired more than 200 teachers—including several well-respected instructors—based on scores in an algorithmic formula which evaluated performance.\nA man diagnosed with bipolar disorder was rejected for employment at seven major retailers after a third-party “personality” test deemed him a high risk based on its algorithmic classification.\nMany jurisdictions are using “predictive policing” to shift resources to likely “hot spots.” O’Neill says that depending on how data is fed into the system, this could lead to discovery of more minor crimes and a “feedback loop” which stigmatizes poor communities.\nSome courts rely on computer-ranked formulas to determine jail sentences and parole, which may discriminate against minorities by taking into account “risk” factors such as their neighborhoods and friend or family links to crime.\nIn the world of finance, brokers “scrape” data from online and other sources in new ways to make decisions on credit or insurance. This too often amplifies prejudice against the disadvantaged, O’Neil argues.\nHer findings were echoed in a White House report last year warning that algorithmic systems “are not infallible—they rely on the imperfect inputs, logic, probability, and people who design them.”\nThe report noted that data systems can ideally help weed out human bias but warned against algorithms “systematically disadvantaging certain groups.”\nZeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies technology and society, said automated decisions are often based on data collected about people, sometimes without their knowledge. “These computational systems can infer all sorts of things about you from your digital crumbs,” Tufekci said in a recent TED lecture. “They can infer your sexual orientation, your personality traits, your political leanings. They have predictive power with high levels of accuracy.”\nSuch insights may be useful in certain contexts—such as helping medical professionals diagnose postpartum depression—but unfair in others, she said. Part of the problem, she said, stems from asking computers to answer questions that have no single right answer. “They are subjective, open-ended and value-laden questions, asking who should the company hire, which update from which friend should you be shown, which convict is more likely to reoffend.”\nFrank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor and author of The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, shares the same concerns. He suggests one way to remedy unfair effects may be to enforce existing laws on consumer protection or deceptive practices.\nPasquale points at the European Union’s data protection law, set from next year to create a “right of explanation” when consumers are impacted by an algorithmic decision, as a model that could be expanded. This would “either force transparency or it will stop algorithms from being used in certain contexts,” he said.\nAlethea Lange, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said the E.U. plan “sounds good” but “is really burdensome” and risked proving unworkable in practice. She believes education and discussion may be more important than enforcement in developing fairer algorithms.\nLange said her organization worked with Facebook, for example, to modify a much-criticized formula that allowed advertisers to use “ethnic affinity” in their targeting.\nOthers meanwhile caution that algorithms should not be made a scapegoat for societal ills. “People get angry and they are looking for something to blame,” said Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We are concerned about bias, accountability and ethical decisions but those exist whether you are using algorithms or not.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fc1d49fc-ee4b-48a2-a680-06889c01f3fe>","<urn:uuid:6ac4c8f9-4485-43b7-b764-b48a249516fb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Indoor Environmental Quality impact tenant satisfaction and building occupancy rates, and what specific air quality problems commonly affect commercial buildings?","answer":"Indoor Environmental Quality significantly impacts tenant satisfaction and occupancy rates, with building owners finding it easier to rent clean, attractive, comfortable spaces and potentially command premium rents in some markets. While location and price remain dominant factors, tenant awareness of IEQ and green issues increasingly drives the market, particularly among newer generations of workers who are more concerned about their personal environment. Regarding air quality problems, EPA estimates that one in three commercial buildings in the U.S. have poor indoor air quality, caused by issues such as contaminated ductwork, improper filtration, airborne particulates, mold-producing water leaks, off-gassing of chemicals from carpets and other materials, and CO2 from human exhalation. These problems can lead to decreased worker productivity, occupant discomfort, fatigue, asthmatic symptoms, and Sick Building Syndrome when combined with poorly operating ventilation systems.","context":["Building owners and managers over the past decade have become increasingly knowledgeable about the importance of good indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in their buildings. Programs such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Globes, and the Building Owners and Managers Association International’s 360 Performance program have served to raise the level of awareness of all aspects of building performance. Fortunately, HVAC design engineers and facility managers correspondingly have also raised their games and become valuable partners to owners and managers who are striving to provide the best IEQ possible in their buildings.\nMany Interrelated Factors\nWhen discussing IEQ with building owners and facility managers, the most important point to make is that good IEQ in a building is not just about filtration or ventilation. It is comprised of a number of interrelated factors. Owners and managers need to understand the holistic nature of how to provide good IEQ.\nTake filtration and ventilation as examples. Even these basic IEQ concepts have many facets for an owner or manager to consider. Are we bringing in enough air? How are we doing it? What is our filtration situation? Are we doing it right, or do we need to upgrade our filtration? If we do that, what other kinds of consequences are we likely to run into? For instance, if we upgrade the filtering, is that going to degrade fan performance?\nFurthermore, ventilation and filtration needs will be affected by other factors. For example, they must be viewed in light of the materials being used in a building with finish-outs, carpets, and office systems. What kinds of volatile organic compounds do those items emit? What kind of cleaning materials are being used? How do they affect IEQ? What types of paints, coatings, and adhesives are being used in tenant spaces?\nGoing a step further, ventilation and filtration may be affected by steps taken to prevent or minimize contaminants from entering a building. Matting, scraper, and absorption surfaces and careful consideration of air rates and airflow at entryways can help reduce airborne dirt and excess moisture in a building.\nAdditionally, daylighting and acoustics are examples of items that building owners may think of as separate from IEQ, but, in reality, are interrelated. Although the awareness of IEQ is greater than ever among building owners and managers, there is less universal understanding of the complex interrelationships that take place in a building. Energy and IEQ are obviously intertwined; for example, more robust filtration could increase energy use from the higher-capacity fans and motors that may be required. Many owners and managers do not necessarily think that way, at least not in the way they operate their buildings. They look at IEQ as one thing and energy efficiency as another.\nProductivity and Health\nBuilding owners and managers likely have heard about how good IEQ in a building will help tenants improve their productivity, but it is important to not overstate this idea. Tenants may wish to judge IEQ on absentee rates and create productivity rates specific to their businesses, but from a building-industrywide perspective, it is difficult to nail down productivity specifics; the studies we have are not that definitive.\nMost building owners do fairly extensive tenant-satisfaction surveys, and most would agree that by providing good IEQ, the amount of productivity possible in tenant spaces certainly improves.\nIt is also important to be cautious when making any health claims related to building IEQ.\nIn the standards-writing and building-code arena, it is very problematic to claim health impacts without definitive research or studies to justify such claims.\nUnfortunately, in our litigious society unintended liability can attach to unsubstantiated health-impact claims. For example, if a building occupant gets sick, is the owner automatically at fault? Clearly that is not the intention of the code. We are trying to provide a good working environment that promotes comfortable, productive spaces.\nTenant Satisfaction and Occupancy Rates\nIn the last five or six years, there has been an increasing amount of hard data to support what building owners know inherently: They will have an easier time renting a clean, attractive, comfortable space and, in some markets, may be able to command a premium rent for that space.\nAgain, it is difficult to pin this down to a hard-and-fast statement that would apply coast to coast. The old adage in commercial real estate still holds true: Location and price dominate everything else. However, other trends, such as tenant awareness of IEQ, energy efficiency, and green issues, are beginning to drive the market.\nTherefore, in discussions with building owners, make sure they understand how paying attention to IEQ can help them better market and position their properties. These things will be more important to the new generation of workers entering the workforce. In many cases, they are “greener” than previous generations and more concerned about not only the global environment, but their personal environment.\nAddition, ensuring that employees have a workplace that they feel good about is a way building owners can enhance the experience of their employees and tenants when the economy is tough. They may not be able to give big raises, but they can give employees a quality space and the benefits that go along with it.\nLooking ahead over the next five to 10 years, it is safe to say there will be more monitoring of everything being done in a building. This trend is evident today with energy monitoring. In fact, a growing number of buildings are presenting their energy use for all to see in the form of energy dashboards in their lobbies. An increasing number of municipal jurisdictions will require disclosure of energy use; that is going to become common over time.\nMoving forward, monitoring will be increased to gather hard data about IEQ and other building operation systems and elements. The way owners are going to be able to respond to their buildings’ performance and improve it to see short- and long-term benefits for their tenants—and, therefore, their bottom lines—certainly is coming.\nMore robust monitoring will lead to more robust preventive-maintenance programs and building-operations-monitoring programs. An increasing emphasis (and value) will be placed on owners and managers providing a very professionally run building. HVAC design and facility engineers should look for opportunities to offer their expertise to ensure owners and managers are doing things the best way possible in their buildings.\nHVAC building engineers can be a valuable resource to help building owners and managers understand how the elements of IEQ are interconnected and how IEQ needs to be part of a holistic program of how a building is being run. Ultimately, building owners and managers need to make IEQ a major area of focus so they can make sure they are budgeting properly every year to ensure the best IEQ possible. It will become increasing valuable for their tenants as well as their position in the marketplace.\nIn addition, there is a marketing component of IEQ that is important for building owners to take to their tenants. As more people become aware of how “green” their building is, part of the conversation should include how owners and managers are striving in their day-to-day operations to provide the best working environment for their tenants. Is that being communicated? And what kind of information can building engineers provide to owners and managers to bring added value to their conversations with tenants? If tenants understood how professionally a building was being run, and how efficiently the building’s systems were being operated, that could create a powerful marketing and image tool.\nRon Burton is the codes and standards consultant for the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) International.

Causes can include contaminated ductwork; improper filtration; airborne particulates; mold-producing water leaks; off-gassing of chemicals from carpets, vegetation and other bio-sources; and carbon dioxide (CO2) from human exhalation, to list but a few. Advances in instrumentation and technology help remedy these types of indoor air problems.\nCO2 gained increased attention after research linked CO2 buildup in buildings to decreased worker productivity and occupant discomfort, fatigue and asthmatic symptoms. Combined with poorly operating ventilation systems, this produces Sick Building Syndrome.\nCO2 monitors use infrared sensing optics and can be hardwired to standard junction boxes or other 4-20mA power sources for on-demand activation of the ventilation system. Sensors are housed in small plastic enclosures that blend with other building security system devices. Other models can be duct-mounted with powerful pumps to monitor incoming and returned airflow. These units enhance building comfort in a measurable way.\nA “fixed” prescription\nFixed-install gas detectors capitalize on the latest developments in sensing technologies and interoperability with building management systems (BMS). New capabilities provide real-time information about gas concentration levels and other relevant data through PLCs (programmable logic controllers) in the control room or to a wireless mobile communications device. In critical life safety situations, the process can be totally automated.\nAnother option is to use gas sensors that provide an output suitable for direct interface to the BMS. In this case, the BMS can cut the gas supply, switch off any potential ignition sources and vent gas as needed.\nIncreasingly, new fixed-mount gas detector systems are being integrated into an indoor environmental quality (IEQ) system that also monitors heat, smoke, temperature, humidity, particulate filtration and other atmospheric variables. If any combination of these (within a zone) exceeds a pre-determined level, communication to the DDC (direct digital control) is instantaneous and the relays are triggered.\nHand-held portable gas leak detectors with infrared and electrochemical sensors provide diagnostic and troubleshooting features to supplement fixed instrumentation systems. A portable instrument with a PID (photoionization) sensor detects a broad range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Characteristically, VOCs evaporate at room temperature and may or may not be discernible to one’s sense of smell. Some VOCs may pose a combustible threat, and all can degrade IAQ.\nHand-held portable IAQ monitors are specifically designed to test IAQ conditions including temperature and humidity as well as the most common gas hazards found in buildings, usually carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and natural gas.\n1 Boiler rooms: Natural gas is one of the most widely used fuels for heating commercial and industrial property. An undetected leak can present an explosive risk.\nPredominantly methane, natural gas is approximately half the weight of air and will rise toward the ceiling or roof space of a boiler room. Sensors should be located over potential leak areas, such as the gas burner assembly, gas train assembly, pressure boosters (if so fitted), gas shut-off valve, combustion air intake and gas meter. On a small gas boiler installation, a number of these points may be closer together, requiring a single point of detection.\nBecause most boiler rooms are visited infrequently, a leak may go undetected if gas sensors are not properly positioned. When positioning a sensor, consider mechanical ventilation and its likely effect on the path of leaking gas. Strategically placing gas detectors should be a collaborative effort involving an experienced gas detection system installer or engineer, facility manager and HVAC technician.\nThe prime objective for boiler room ventilation is to ensure an adequate supply of combustion air. For this reason, gas detection systems are widely used.\nThe process can help reduce the buildup of a flammable gas concentration; however, this cannot be guaranteed. Potential sources of ignition are many, and include any uncertified electrical equipment such as lighting, switches and control panels.\n2 Mechanical equipment rooms with refrigerants: Leaks from CFC, HCFC and HFC refrigerants such as R-11, R-12, R-22, R-123 or R-134a can be expensive and potentially dangerous. Mechanical equipment rooms that use these refrigerants now require stationary sensors for permanent, continuous monitoring. Refrigerant leaks can come from mechanical wear of system components, vibration, bad soldering, corrosion, operational problems and more. To spot test leaks, the technician should use portable hand-held equipment with a wand attachment.\nWhen boilers and chillers are located in the same room, a refrigerant detector is employed to automatically shut down the combustion process. Shutting down the refrigeration system at high concentration of refrigerant in the mechanical system is a good way to minimize refrigerant loss. But this can have a major impact on the HVAC system of the building. Analysis of the effects of such actions on the facility is a critical undertaking.\n3 Confined spaces: More than half of all confined spaces are located below the surface level of a building. Electrical vaults, sewer channels and tanks are some examples of confined spaces. In these environments, common gases include methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide. Oxygen deficiency can also pose a threat. A multi-gas portable monitor is advisable, with a PID sensor for detecting a range of VOCs.\n4 Parking garages, offices and other areas: Vehicular exhaust products contain carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. In parking garages, these can form gas clouds that migrate through HVAC ductwork to contaminate air inside the building envelope. Gas transmitters that use powerful internal pumps can be installed in ductwork to monitor air.\nNew technology uses mesh wireless communications to relay gas readings to a central controller connected to the DDC. Wireless systems require little conduit or electrical wiring, making it easy to retrofit a building or augment an existing hard-wire system. These wireless detectors are good at sniffing for toxic CO and NO2 in hard-to-reach areas. Wireless systems may become the preferred sensing network as battery life is extended; the industry is moving toward a 10-year “fit and forget” operating life.\nToday’s tight building envelopes require fast, reliable sensors to detect toxic and combustible gas hazards and other airborne contaminants. A good IAQ strategy begins with the right tools of detection, followed by a well-executed plan of protection."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bd3d0fd4-17e5-4fc0-9c1f-f4a6717d3314>","<urn:uuid:9440855d-f49f-4078-afb9-5b56c32399f2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the role of text-only versions in making digital content more accessible compared to HTML versions?","answer":"Text-only versions play a crucial role in accessibility. For emails, the plain text version makes content more accessible to people with disabilities as it's easier for screen readers to decode. Similarly, in web content, screen readers help visually challenged users browse websites, and proper text implementations with appropriate roles and properties ensure important updates are properly announced to these users. While HTML versions provide visual appeal with fancy fonts, colors, and images, text versions are essential for both email and web accessibility, ensuring all users can access content effectively.","context":["In this article:\nNot everyone was able to receive HTML email a few years back. HTML emails were considered heavy and hard to read by email softwares. Some softwares didn't even support them. Emails were therefore sent in two parts: HTML and text only (hence the multipart-alternative format).\nThe HTML version of your email is the version where you can add images and style, with a pretty font, bold, colors and more. The text version is simply that. It's a version of your email in which there is only plain text. No fancy fonts, no alignment, no images, no colors...only plain and simple text.\nIdeally...both! Our platform makes it easy to send emails in a \"Multi-part MIME (MultipurposeInternet Mail Extensions)\" format. This format allows you to include simultaneously a HTML and text version to your email.\nWhy should I provide two versions of my email?\nThe HTML version is the pretty one. It's the version that is visually exciting, the one that allows you to quickly make a statement, capture the attention of your reader and make a quick impact.\nThat being said, the text version is also very important. Even though email softwares have come leaps and bounds in the last few years, it is still possible that some platforms don't support HTML or simply prefer text. An example that quickly comes to mind are the smart watches such as iWatch. Other platforms offer the option to display only the text version, even though they support HTML just fine. Some users prefer their emails in simple text, as the size of the email will be lessened. Additionally, the plain text version makes your email more accessible to people with disabilities, as the text version is easier to decode for screen readers. The text version also gives you good points from antispam software and will help you avoid being delivered in the spam folder as spammers rarely take the time to include a text version. Those are all positive things to consider.\nThe text version of your email should only be generated when your HTML version is complete.\nAdding a text version to your email is actually quite simple. All you need to do is click the \"Text version\" option in the black option menu on top of our template builder.\nYou can either type in your content or click the \"Generate\" button found on the the bottom right of the dialog box. By clicking this button, we'll generate automatically a text version based on the content of your HTML version. If the HTML version of your email contained images, they'll be replaced by the alternative text you have entered. Links entered in your HTML version will appear textually.\nDon't hesitate to make adjustments to your text version if necessary. Click \"OK\" to confirm your version when complete. When planning a mailing from this template, the text version you made will automatically be included in your mailing.\nNote: Don't forget to update your text version if you use an existing template! Otherwise, the old text version will be sent with your new content.","Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages (Level AA): In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.\nAs you may aware of, people with visually challenged use the screen reader software to browse the website or access the information on the web. While browsing the website, it is natural thing for anyone to perform some actions like submitting the form, adding items to the cart, and so on..) in order to get the information that he/she is looking for. when an action is performed then updates or changes(popping the error messages, success messages after adding the item to the cart, and so on..) may take place then and there without page refresh on the few websites. Those updates are obvious for the visual users but the same updates may not be obvious to the screen reader users. When screen reader users are not aware of these updates/changes then they do not get the same experience like how the sighted person experiences while browsing the information. As a result, screen reader users may not understand what is going on the page and might end up with the confusion/frustration\nIn order to address these type of situations, WCAG2.1 introduced this new checkpoint. The intent of this Success Criterion is to make users aware of important changes in content that are not given focus, and to do so in a way that doesn’t unnecessarily interrupt their work. Having said that, do you think all the changes that takes place in the dynamic website deal this success criterion? Answer is no. The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve status messages. You might be wondering what status message is about. Status message has specific definition in the WCAG. There are two main criteria that determine whether something meets the definition of a status message:\n- the message “provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a process, or on the existence of errors;”\n- the message is not delivered via a change in context.\nThe changes to the content need not to be always addition of new text to the screen and may be in the other formats too(like non-displayed text specific to assistive technology users and non-text content. As long as the changes to the content meet above conditions, it fits within this success criterion.\n- new content is announced to the screen reader users When appropriate roles or properties are assigned to status messages, in such a way as to assist blind and low vision users.\n- Assigning proper roles or properties to status messages provides possible future uses and personalization opportunities to assistive technologies for users with cognitive disabilities. assistive technologies for users with cognitive disabilities may achieve an alternative means of indicating (or even delaying or supressing) status messages, as preferred by the user\nThe below are the few scenarios where this success criterion is met\n- after recipient email address is selected from the suggested list in the email application, recipient email address is added on the screen. The screen reader announces as suman damera added. It is important to understand that the text “added” may not be visible on the screen but screen reader announces as suman damera added. In order to give the context to the screen reader users, the extra piece of information is necessary in the form of non-displayed content\n- after recipient email address is removed from the list of selected recipients in the email application, recipient email address is removed from the screen. The screen reader announces as suman damera removed. It is important to understand that the text ‘removed” may not be visible on the screen but screen reader announces as suman damera removed. In order to give the context to the screen reader users, the extra piece of information is necessary in the form of non-displayed content\n- while entering the password at the password text area in the few signup forms, there is a visual indication how strong the password is. . screen reader announces weak/weaker/strong\n- after the incorrect form submission, there is a message on the screen like 5 errors are found. screen reader announces as “5 errors are found”\n- after the successful form submission, there is message on the screen like your form has been successfully submitted, will contact you soon. screen reader announces the same.\n- after adding the items to shopping cart by using add to cart button of the product in the eCommerce websites, cart count gets updated visually like 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and so on.. screen reader announces as “item has been added to the cart and currently cart has 2 items”\nNot applicable/exceptional scenarios\nThe following scenarios identify situations where no additional author action is necessary. All cases are excepted from this Success Criterion since they do not meet the definition of “status messages.”\n- When an error message is displayed in the dialog then authors need to place the focus on the dialog. By doing so, screen reader announces the error message. In addition, this is not a change of content and it is change of context. Thus, this scenario does not fit into current success criterion.\n- When there is an expand/collapse element(such as menu, select, accordion, tree, ) and screen reader announces the state of the element(expand/collapse) appropriately then user understands whether content is revealed or hidden with the help of state itself. Thus, this scenario does not fit into current success criterion\n- When there is tablist widget and screen reader announces the selected state of the tab item appropriately then user understands whether content is revealed or hidden with the help of state itself. Thus, this scenario does not fit into current success criterion\nHere are the few techniques that author can use to meet this success criterion\n- Using aria role=”status” to provide success or other feedback\n- ARIA19: using ARIA role=alert or Live Regions to Identify Errors\n- Using aria role=”progressbar” to convey the progress of the process"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:27a72721-b5e0-46a3-b720-19d811676072>","<urn:uuid:975442fc-cceb-4a92-b3e0-d18d6b522894>"],"error":null}

There are multiple novels that have helped pave the way for the current boom of art-related historical fiction titles, for instance, Ivring Stone’s novels Lust for Life and The Agony and Ecstasy, Tracey Chevalier’s The Girl with the a Pearl Earring, and Sarah Dunants’s The Birth of Venus. Highly anticipated forthcoming books like Susan Vreeland’s Lisette’s List (releases August 26, 2014), Donna Russo Morin’s women artists of the Renaissance trilogy, and Heather Webb’s Rodin’s Lover (releases 2015) show that historical novels interwoven with art is a flourishing niche.\nTo launch the series I’d like to introduce preeminent writer of art in fiction, Susan Vreeland, author of eight novels, all of which investigate in some way the arts and artist.\nStephanie Renée dos Santos: Uniquely, Susan you have dedicated your writing career to telling stories of the female artist and the arts. Will you share with us about this passion?\nSusan Vreeland: First, I must issue a correction. While three of my novels focus on female artists, the other three feature male artists. Of course, I was motivated by giving Italian Artemisia Gentileschi, Canadian Emily Carr, and American Clara Driscoll the attention their skills and determination deserved and popular history neglected, but I was equally moved by the struggles and joys of the more well-known French Auguste Renoir, Dutch Johannes Vermeer, and American Louis Comfort Tiffany.\nSRDS: What compelled you to include or focus on art or artist(s) in your historical novels?\nSV: The short answer is love. One reason I devote myself to writing about art is for me; the other is for the reader and the world.\nExploring the world of art teaches me to see, to be more responsive to and appreciative of the appearance, color, shape and texture of things around me. Oh what I would miss otherwise. Art stops me. It makes me rise. It invites me to ponder some subject–a pear (Cezanne)or a violin in the sky (Chagall), a massive cedar tree (Emily Carr) or the marble lovers of Rodin’s “The Kiss” or a cathedral–until its qualities teach us something, balance or stretching or boldness or tenderness. It inspires us to ask ourselves: Do I have balance in my life like that pear? Can I be as jubilant as that fiddler in the sky? Am I growing and stretching like that cedar? Does my thinking soar like a French Gothic cathedral? Am I bold enough in what I claim and do? Am I tender enough to care about a wounded enemy soldier and save his life?\nFor the viewer and reader, art’s effect on the imagination is crucial to our civilization. Thanks to art, instead of seeing only one world and time period, our own, we see it multiplied and can see into other times, other worlds which offer a window to other lives. Each time we enter imaginatively into the life of another, it’s a small step upwards in the elevation of the human race.\nWhen there is no imagination of others’ lives, there is no human connection. When there is no human connection, compassion does not develop. Without compassion, then community, commitment, loving kindness, human understanding and peace shrivel. Individuals become isolated, fearful, resentful, marginalized, and these states of mind can develop into cruelty, where the tragic hovers in forms of domestic, civil, international violence. Art, and its concomitant, literature, are antidotes to that.\nSRDS: What draws you to your specific visual art mediums, art works, and artists?\nSV: Again, love, and curiosity. Painting is my primary love, but I love Bernini’s sculpted Apollo and Daphne as much as I love Renoir’s painted Luncheon of the Boating Party. Both draw me into their moment in time, hold me in a trancelike state so that I can touch with my understanding their circumstances.\nI can answer this question best by tracing my career. In the Los Angeles County Museum of Art shop, I came upon a book of Vermeer’s paintings, open. It made me consider that a thing made by hand, the skill and thought of a single individual, can endure much longer than its maker, through centuries in fact, can survive natural catastrophe, neglect, and even mistreatment. I was filled with wonder. The book invited me to see a connection between Vermeer’s Dutch nationality and my little-known Dutch family heritange. With that slim connection, I came to know his paintings, imagining them as my ancestors; I selected elements from several, and composed my own fictional Vermeer canvas for which I could invent a provenance. That imagined territory would become Girl in Hyacinth Blue.\nArtemisia Gentileschi’s powerful women from history, classical myth, and Biblical sources opened for me an appreciation of her courage reflected in the independent thinking of her women–her Cleopatra who died by her own will rather than by the bite of a serpent, Lucretia who protested that a raped woman did not need to kill herself out of shame, Judith who.stealthily cut off the head of the enemy general about to lead his forces against the Jews, the penitent Magdalen ambivalent about the life she would give up in order to follow Christ.\nEmily Carr’s love for British Columbia’s deep forests and wild seacoast reflected my own passions. Her art taught me to be curious about the native peoples she depicted–the Kwakiutl, the Haida, the Squamish, the Nuu’chah’nuth, and taught me respect for their complex belief system, their highly developed culture, and in turn, instilled in me their respect for nature–all of this resulting in The Forest Lover.\nOh, France, how I love it!–its art, language, architecture, music. Selecting Renoir’s masterpiece of fourteen of his friends posing after eating lunch on a balcony overlooking the Seine, peopled my novel with fascinating individuals who so vividly represented the joie de vivre of Belle Epoch Paris–an actress, a mime, a singer who rose from the streets, an Italian journalist, a Russian art collector, a seamstress, an artist and champion sailor, the son and daughter of a proprietor of a riverside restaurant–each one a gift to me.\nThat the creator of the famous stained glass lamps was kept out of the limelight by the egotistical Louis Comfort Tiffany enraged me, especially when I discovered that she developed a large department of women artisans, introducing them to the workplace of industrial design beyond the sphere of home crafts.\nSRDS: How do you go about incorporating art and artists into the novels?\nSV: Except for my work-in-progress, Lisette’s List, I start with an artist or a piece of art, and work out from there. I don’t add them in to an already constructed novel, although their presence and import deepens as I work on multiple drafts. First I learn as much as I can about his/her biography and major works. Then I research his/her contemporaries. I look for letters and reviews of the artist’s work. Next, I explore the time and place. Then I settle down to think about what I want the novel to say about work, art, nature, life, God, love.\nSRDS: Do you have any messages you are trying to convey by including art and artist(s) in the books?\nSV: Yes, but it seems rather simplistic to lay out messages apart from the text of the novels themselves. Half of any message is the mind of the receiver. I can nudge, but I cannot control a reader’s response, and I certainly don’t want to curtail a reader’s reflection on the characters, action, and conversation by giving a capsule message.\nSRDS: What story lines do you see as unexplored in this niche of art in fiction?\nSV: Rather than story lines, I see individual paintings which are not yet represented in fiction: Keeping my favorites to myself, I offer these:\nDisposition of Christ, Giotto\nReturn of the Prodigal Son, Rembrandt\nYoung Woman with a Water Jug, Vermeer\nThe Death of Marat, Jacques-Louis David\nThe Gleaners, Jean-François Millet\nThe Bar at the Folies Bergère, Manet\nParis: A Rainy Day, Caillebotte\nSRDS: What do you think readers can gain by reading stories with art tie-ins?\nSV: Insight into the human condition and its concomitant, compassion. Appreciation for color, line, texture, nature. Understanding of other cultures and time periods. Enrichment. Soul.\nSRDS: Why does fiction with art and artists matter?\nSV: See last paragraph of my answer #2.\nSRDS: Are you working on a new historical novel with art and artists’ thread(s)? If so, will you please share with us a bit about the upcoming book.\nSV: In Lisette’s List, set in Provence, France in the years just before, during, and after World War II, an ochre miner of paint pigments has collected paintings by Pissarro, Cézanne, and Picasso which had to be hidden from German officers keen on contributing to Hitler’s collection of art. Their recovery is left to his grandson’s Parisian wife, Lisette, who loses a husband, gains a lover, befriends Marc and Bella Chagall hiding nearby, and learns the values of village life in her search not only for the paintings as part of the endangered legacy of French art, but for her place in the Paris art world.\nSRDS: Any further thoughts on art in fiction you’d like to share or expand on?\nSV: Yes, why I write novels instead of non-fiction explorations of these artists.\nI am not an art historian. I’m a story -teller. While an art history can give us an appreciation of a painter’s work, the view is from the onlooker, while fiction invites us in to the artist’s inner nature, takes us to his bosom, and makes us feel the artist’s strong emotions for ourselves–struggle, ecstasy, physical and mental exhaustion, frustration at limited skills, despair at creeping age, arthritis of the fingers, financial ruin, doubt, ridicule, scorn. Fiction gives us the individual in his own voice. To me, the artist’s ideas don’t dance in an academic review of a painter’s work. His brush does not sing in the act of painting. His soul is not laid bare by the conflicts that can be expressed in an approximation of his voice. We don’t come away from reading an art history wrung dry and panting after a session at the easel.\nThe person who goes to an art history lecture or reads an art history already has art in his bloodstream. A novel reaches a different audience–an audience or a society that needs art and may not know it. That’s where I want to point my pen.\nAbout the author: Susan Vreeland is an internationally known author of art-related historical fiction. Four of her eight books have been New York Times Best Sellers: Girl in Hyacinth Blue, The Forest Lover, Clara and Mr. Tiffany, Luncheon of the Boating Party, The Passion of Artemisia Life Studies, What Love Sees, and her soon-to-be-released Lisette’s List.

When most people think of retirement plans, they’re usually thinking of a defined contribution plan. This type of plan is an employee-sponsored plan with an individual account for each participant. The benefit is fully based on the contributions made by either or both the employee and the employer. These accounts are IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b) accounts, and sometimes profit sharing.\nThe defined benefit plan often is referred to as a pension plan. These types of plans calculate benefits using a fixed formula to calculate a monthly lifetime payment that typically factors in final pay and the number of years of service with the employer.\nWhat’s the difference between a traditional IRA and Roth IRA?\nArin Fife: These are both defined contribution plans, as I just discussed, but the main difference is the way that the contributions are taxed. A traditional IRA, similar to a 401(k), is not taxed when contributions are made, but they are taxed at the time they are withdrawn.\nWith a Roth IRA you will pay regular income taxes on the money when it’s contributed; however, when that money is withdrawn, you’ve already paid the taxes and there is not an additional income tax. There are some other differences and qualifications which really should be discussed with a qualified financial advisor when looking at what’s the most appropriate plan for you.\nFor someone getting divorced in their 30s or 40s, retirement can seem like a long time away. Why is it important to pay attention to the pension during divorce?\nArin Fife: It really is an easy thing to overlook and undervalue these assets when there’s something like a pension which seems so far off. But it is important to never forget that in assets, such as a pension, without great consideration even though it may be some time before that benefit is actually seen. Pension benefits can be very valuable and can grow considerably over time. You really don’t want to overlook those. It’s never too early to be planning for your future, even in your 30s and 40s.\nHow is a retirement account valued at the time of divorce?\nArin Fife: There are a couple of ways to value these accounts and that really depends on what type of plan it is. A defined contribution plan is much easier to value and therefore easier to divide within the divorce. The defined contribution plan has a certain value as of a certain date, which can be divided as either a percentage or a dollar amount to the other spouse.\nA defined benefit plan is valued as a future stream of payment based on a benefit formula. Most defined benefit plans are pension plans, which will not pay a lump sum amount and will only pay a spouse on a monthly basis for a lifetime starting around retirement age. The actual value is usually unknown until that benefit begins on that later date.\nHow is a retirement account divided?\nArin Fife: When dividing assets the client must really consider whether to divide the retirement account either by dollar amount or percentage or to negotiate a trade-off of the types of assets such as the marital home. However, the client must really be cautious when contemplating a trade-off of this type. Considerations should be made for things like taxes. For example, a defined contribution retirement account will be taxed as income when the funds are later withdrawn. However, the home’s net value is really in after-tax dollars. Those tax implications have to be considered when dividing the retirement accounts.\nWhat is a QDRO and when is it used?\nArin Fife: If you’re dividing a retirement account that is qualified, such as a 401(k) or a pension, your attorney will need to prepare a QDRO, which is a qualified domestic relations order. This is an order that will be entered with the courts that is then sent to the planned administer of the retirement account to effectuate the division. Non-qualified plans such as IRAs can usually be divided with a simple letter of direction and don’t require a QDRO.\nCan a retirement account be both marital and non-marital property?\nArin Fife: It absolutely can. When an account was in existence before the marriage, a portion of it may be non-marital. That portion will not be subject to division in the divorce. With a prime contribution plan, it’s also impossible to determine the account balance as of the time of the marriage.\nA good piece of advice maybe upon a later remarriage is to retain that last monthly statement prior to the marriage and all year-end statements thereafter, which will make it much more simple in the event of a future divorce to determine which portion is marital and which is non-marital and what is actually subject to division.\nWhat if it’s not possible to determine the balance at the time of marriage?\nArin Fife: If this is the case, a formula can be used to determine the non-marital portion of that account. You can simply multiply the average yearly contribution times the number of years worked prior to the marriage. The problem with doing this is that it really is an imperfect method. The premarital portion can easily be overestimated, especially in long-term marriages, as we all know as people age their incomes usually increase along with their contributions to a 401(k) or an IRA. This average can kind of be skewed and often over-value that premarital portion.\nIs a spouse who never worked entitled to a share of their working spouse’s pension or retirement accounts?\nArin Fife: A spouse who has never worked is absolutely entitled to a portion of their spouse’s marital retirement accounts. All money earned during the marriage is marital money which is subject to division in a divorce.\nCan Social Security benefits be divided on divorce?\nArin Fife: The actual Social Security benefits cannot be divided. This is because the Social Security benefits are regulated by the federal government and there is really no way to divide them and effectuate that through those regulations. However, this does not mean that a former spouse is not entitled to a portion of their spouse’s Social Security benefit, including survivor benefits. As long as they have been married for at least 10 years, their work credits do not exceed half of their spouse’s, and they do not remarry, they may qualify for these benefits.\nThis makes it an important consideration if you are in the process of divorce and you are approaching your 10-year marriage date. It may be beneficial to delay the divorce a little bit. Once you pass that 10-year mark you’re entitled to these benefits and there’s really no negative effect to your spouse in doing so.\nIf someone needs money today to pay divorce-related expenses, is there any way of gaining access to retirement funds they’ve acquired during property division without incurring the 10% penalty for early withdrawal?\nArin Fife: There is. As we discussed earlier, with a QDRO this can allow a divorcing spouse under the age of 59-and-a-half a one-time withdrawal of money from certain accounts without incurring that standard 10% early withdrawal penalty. The catch to this is that this withdrawal must be performed through a QDRO. But it can be very useful when needing to pay unavoidable expenses such as attorney’s fees incurred in the divorce.\nEveryone must, however, remember that this money will eventually be needed to live on, so it really should be carefully thought about and only when absolutely necessary be withdrawn. Also remember that the funds withdrawn, while they’re not subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty, they will usually count as taxable income for that year.\nOnce a divorce is complete, is there anything else that needs to be done with regards to retirement accounts?\nArin Fife: It is very important to follow through with the division of the retirement accounts. The QDRO, which hopefully was entered the same day of the divorce with the judgment, needs to be submitted to the plan administrator for approval. Additionally, recent cases have made it very clear that when it comes to federal retirement plans such as pensions and even things like life insurance benefits, a change of beneficiary notice is mandatory. Clients should really make sure that it is a priority to immediately remove a former spouse as a beneficiary from an account. This can be done by making sure that that beneficiary designation form is up-to-date.\nYou mentioned that it’s important to have the QDRO entered promptly upon divorce. Why is this important? Could it be a problem if it isn’t?\nArin Fife: It could be a problem if it isn’t. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon that we see cases where years have gone by and the QDROs have not been entered. It’s one of those things that can fall through the cracks once you’re divorced. You think everything has been done, but the division of these retirement accounts is not actually effectuated and people don’t realize this for years and years to come. This can create some major problems with the estate, and if someone does pass away prior to the entry of the QDRO, the retirement accounts don’t always listen or adhere to what a divorce decree says. It’s not a necessity that the QDRO be entered at the same time as the judgment, but to make sure that it’s not forgotten or overlooked, we as a practice like to try and do that.\nThis doesn’t mean that if in someone’s particular case that hasn’t been done that it can’t be done. The QDROs can be entered after the fact, and hopefully this is prior to anyone’s passing away or circumstances which will complicate the issue. But they can be entered after the fact and should be entered as soon as it comes to anyone’s attention that it has not done so."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:15167478-adef-421c-ac72-d2e10841e837>"],"error":null}

Each week, we’ll be exploring an important event that left its mark.\nThis week? Gioachino Rossini’s death inspired Verdi to launch an ambitious project involving twelve Italian composers to create a requiem in his honor. The project was eventually aborted, but Verdi’s musical tribute to Rossini survives in the Libera Me of his Messa da Requiem, a grandiose work composed in honor of another idol…\nLike most requiems, Verdi’s Messa da Requiem began with an ending.\n“A great name has disappeared from the world!”\nThe great opera composer Gioachino Rossini died in November 1868, and Giuseppe Verdi—the great opera composer of his own generation—was deeply moved. But, when Verdi wrote the above in a letter, he was also thinking about another Italian artistic titan.\n“When the other one who still lives is no more, what will we have left?”\n“The other one?” He was referring to Alessandro Manzoni, a poet and novelist of about Rossini’s age, best known for The Betrothed. But for now, Verdi’s attention was mainly focused on his dear, departed fellow composer.\nVerdi hit upon an original idea with which to mark Rossini’s life. On the first anniversary of his death, he proposed, a requiem mass would be performed. It would be written jointly by Italy’s leading composers, with Verdi contributing one movement himself—as it transpired, the final movement, Libera me (above).\nAs if that project weren’t unusual enough already, Verdi had some rather specific stipulations. For a start, rather than getting paid, the composers and performers would be expected to contribute financially to the project. After the performance, the score “should be sealed and placed in the archives… from which it should never be taken,” except perhaps for anniversaries. Oh, and Verdi would quit the project immediately if anyone foreign or unartistic became involved.\nCasting an eye over Verdi’s demands, it’s perhaps surprising that the Messa per Rossini project got off the ground at all. But a fairly promising start was not enough to make it happen. The project gave up the ghost fairly slowly, but seems to have been consigned to an unmarked grave by August 1871.\nBy then, however, Verdi had written his own Libera me. “Deliver me, O Lord” says the text… and yet Verdi’s music lingered unperformed.\nThen, on May 22, 1873, Alessandro Manzoni died.\nAnd this time, Verdi decided to write the whole thing himself. He had already written the ending.\nThings went far more smoothly this time. He met his own deadlines, and the first performance did indeed take place on the first anniversary of Manzoni’s death—May 22, 1874—at the church of San Marco in Milan. Unlike the plan for the Rossini requiem, further performances were permitted: three more immediately took place at La Scala. The reaction was positive from almost everyone, with Hans von Bülow one of few exceptions. An “opera in ecclesiastical costume,” he called it. Referring to a sacred work by a leading opera composer, this is surely one of music history’s least imaginative insults.\nThe troubled genesis of Verdi’s Requiem is now a matter for the history books. The ends of Rossini and Manzoni, and the conclusion of the Messa per Rossini project, proved to be the beginning of a work which remains very much alive—above all, thanks to its spectacular Dies irae, that unforgettable whirlwind of wrath and fear that still reverberates today.\nIt’s so thrilling, in fact, that it even seems to have terrified Herbert von Karajan, albeit only briefly.

{"question":"How do the reintegration processes compare between ancient Greek warriors and modern military personnel?","answer":"Ancient Greek warriors and modern military personnel face different challenges in their reintegration processes. In ancient Greece, the transition from war to peace was accomplished through ritualistic means, including dance and theater in Athens. This is reflected in Greek literature, such as Euripides' tragic story of Heracles killing his children in a madness, which symbolized the warrior's difficult reintegration into domestic life. In modern military science, the focus is on psychological adjustment, particularly addressing the challenges soldiers face in killing other humans. Modern military training must work to overcome humans' natural resistance to killing their own kind, using methods like psychological distancing and shared responsibility through crew-served weapons. This indicates that while both ancient and modern societies recognized the challenges of warrior reintegration, they developed different approaches to address this issue.","context":["War and Peace in the Ancient World\nKurt A. Raaflaub (editor), (Blackwell Publishing, 2007), 385 pages, $39.95.\nThis volume is the first in a new series whose stated purpose is to “pursue important social, political, religious, economic, and intellectual issues through a wide range of ancient societies.” The thirteen cultures considered include both the chronologically ancient—from late Bronze Age China to pre-Islamic Iran to Greece and Rome—and societies that are structurally early, such as the Aztec Empire. However, nearly half of the twenty essays included focus on ancient Israel or the Greco-Roman world.\nEach paper is concerned primarily with a single civilization, but the contributors, using different types of source material and adopting different approaches, consider many of the same questions: What motivated societies to go to war? What diplomatic measures were in place to avoid war or limit its impact? How were warriors reintegrated into the community? Kurt Raaflaub ties the entries together in his introduction by discussing some of the traits evidenced across different cultures.\nMost readers are unlikely to read this book straight through, but will instead dip into the historical stream at points of interest.

She also reflects on the fate of conquered soldiers, women as spoils of war, and the rituals attending the resumption of normal activity after war: “Significantly, both the warriors who have killed or touched a corpse and the captives who are to be integrated into the community must undergo a process of purification, as must any inanimate spoil that is to be brought into the camp.”\nThomas Krüger examines the biblical origins of the image referenced in his paper’s title, “‘They Shall Beat Their Swords into Plowshares’: A Vision of Peace Through Justice and Its Background in the Hebrew Bible.”\nIn “‘Laughing for Joy’: War and Peace among the Greeks,” Lawrence A.

Fry brings together leading experts in evolutionary biology, archaeology, anthropology, and primatology to find answers to fundamental questions about peace, conflict, and human nature in an evolutionary context. Anthony Oruna-Goriaïnoff finds it a comforting thought that our ancestors, at their most primitive, and for a long time after, were happier living in peace and avoided war even though the preconditions for war have been part of humanity from the start.\nWar, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views. Douglas P. Fry. Oxford University Press. April 2013.\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking that war is as old as human civilization. Certainly that seems to be the view of many scholars and politicians. That war is as old as we are; that, given the latest examples of human behaviour when at war, it will be with us until we are no longer around. Although that second posit is not one which can be entertained here, the first one certainly can be challenged, and forms the focus of War, Peace, and Human Nature, edited by Douglas P. Fry. This hefty and fascinating book presents readers with 27 chapters devoted to challenging the idea that humans have always been attuned to war.\nAnd how best to understand human behaviour than by studying the behaviour of species most closely related to us? In the chapter ‘Chimpanzees, Warfare and the Invention of Peace’, Michael Wilson asks if warfare is an invention or an adaptation, and adds to the dialectic started by Hobbes, who spoke of “Warre” as being the natural state of humans with strong institutions (the “Leviathan”) and Rousseau, who argued that “people were basically peaceful and cooperative”, unless institutions got in the way. Wilson sides with Rousseau, using archaeology, ethnography, as well as animal behaviour, to argue his point. Naturally, our cousins are aggressive and capable of killing their own. But Fry argues that their use of aggressive behaviour is selective, “escalating to damaging fights only when the stakes are high”. The reasons for intraspecific aggression, which seems to be a widespread trait of chimpanzees and not the result of circumstances peculiar to a few study sites, range from territorial defence to availability of resources. Nonetheless, the territorial aspect of the species may play a larger part than has been thought before, since there is now a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that “male chimpanzees seek to defend and expand a feeding territory for themselves, their mates and offspring.”\nSo how is their behaviour co-relatable to that of humans? According to the author, long-term data makes it clear that chimpanzees “regularly live under circumstances that Hobbes would describe as Warre.” He further argues that warlike behaviour in chimpanzees appears to be “adaptive in that participation leads to inclusive fitness benefits.” Their behaviour has been cited as evidence against arguments (Mead, 1940) that warfare is an invention. Nevertheless, according to Wilson, “the special features thought to be needed for humans to become warlike”, such as weapons, agriculture, ideology, states etc are “not present in chimpanzees” and yet they suffer “rates of intergroup killing comparable to human societies with endemic warfare.”\nThe difference the author stresses is that, unlike chimpanzees, human societies see a benefit in cooperation, trade etc. So if we seem to be predisposed to conflict, shouldn’t human history be laden with examples and clear evidence of war?\nAccording to R. Brian Ferguson, author of the chapter ‘The Prehistory of War and Peace in Europe and the Middle East’, instances of war in early human history are rare. Ferguson argues that whenever there is war, it leaves a trace, so to think that war somehow could have occurred and not left a trace, though not impossible, would certainly be rare. Ferguson writes that during the Mesolithic period (about 10,000 to 5000 BCE), evidence of war in Europe is inconsistent, and that in the comparable Epipaleolithic period in the Near East, war is just absent, pointing out the fact that it seems to have been absent in that area for at least half a millennium! So the data appears to support the idea that humans have not been at war from the start. In fact, until a certain point in time, data suggest much the opposite.\nIt is soothing to think that our ancestors, at their most primitive, and for a long time after, were happier living in peace and avoided war (though that is not to say they avoided aggression or violence) even though, as the author points out, the preconditions for war have been part of humanity from the start. That is to say, even though these conditions were there for extended periods of time, there is no evidence of war up until a certain point in time in the case of the southern Levant. And when the signs do appear, they do so very quickly. Towns become fortified in less than 100 years, and signs of war go from 0 to 100% in about the same time period. The author puts this down to the creation of a “tribal zone” in the area, which was a direct cause of the rise of imperial Egypt as the area’s hegemon.\nThis leads Ferguson to ponder the reasons why people who are at peace most of the time would decide to go to war, especially since, as he argues, it would be extremely difficult to get a people who have no history of collective attacks to start doing just that.\nSo, what makes humans so predisposed to kill one another in war? In chapter 25, ‘The Challenge of Getting Men to Kill: A view from military science’, Richard J. Hughbank and Dave Grossman waste no time in pointing out the obvious: we are not suited to kill each other. They base their argument on the need to train the midbrain, “or mammalian brain” to trust in military training, “equipment and fellow warrior” in “the chaos known as combat.” Both authors point out that in ancient warfare, and indeed all the way to the present day, when in battle, most of the killing took place when one army managed to make the other one flee. It is much easier to deny the humanity of a fleeing victim with his back turned since you don’t have to look that person in the eyes. Opposition soldiers turn into prey when they run away, so our brains make the transition from ‘killing’ to ‘hunting’, thus enabling humans to kill their own, argue the authors.\nHughbank and Grossman discuss that the best way to get men to kill is to divide the psychological responsibility of killing by distancing the soldier from it as much as possible. This ‘distance’ enables men to get away from the emotional resistance to killing and it has been achieved by getting archers to be driven from a chariot, by putting men together inside a battleship, or two or more crewmen inside a bomber, or by the use of the crew-served machine gun, which they refer to as “the key killer on the close-range battlefield.” So killing other humans is something which must be taught, since there is a natural animadversion to killing our own, and therein lies much of current military thinking.\nThis book is as fascinating as it is long. The subject matter, as distasteful as it is, is certainly presented in a well thought-out and straightforward manner. If war and peace studies are your target then this book will serve you well. And if they are not, you may be surprised at what you can learn.\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of EUROPP – European Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1fMkHH1\nAnthony Oruna-Goriaïnoff is an LSE alumnus, having studied for an MSc in International Relations.

{"question":"I'm curious about historical cheese protection - how do the trademark protections of Emmental and Parmigiano-Reggiano differ?","answer":"Emmental and Parmigiano-Reggiano have different levels of protection. The name Emmental itself is not trademark protected, which is why this cheese variety can be produced in many countries including Germany, Austria, France, and others. However, in 2006, Switzerland managed to protect the specific mark 'Ementaler PDO' which can only be produced in Switzerland. In contrast, Parmigiano-Reggiano has stronger protection as a D.O.P. (Denominazione d'Origine Protetta) product, which requires it to be produced only in five specific Italian provinces: Bologna, Mantova, Modena, Parma and Reggio-Emilia, using traditional ingredients and centuries-old artisan techniques. Anything made outside these regions must be called by the generic name 'parmesan'.","context":["Emmental or Emmentaler is a medium-hard pressed yellow cheese, easily recognizable by its distinctive large holes.\nThe birthplace of this sort of cheese is the Emme valley, the canton of Bern, from where it bears its name (“emme” – the name of the river and “tal” – from the German word for valley).\nThere is no information about who started to produce Emmental for the first time and how the idea came up, but there is evidence that in the 13th century this culinary temptation was already being produced in the valley.\nIn the beginning, the production of Emmental was quite limited, since the production of only one kilogram required 12 liters of milk, which is a large amount of input material.\nIn 1815, however, the producers began to share the raw material and opened small specialized dairy farms. This allowed them to produce not only more cheese but also to produce it in ever larger shapes (wheels)\nUnfortunately, the name Emmental is not trademark protected, and today this cheese variety is produced not only in Switzerland, but also in Germany, Austria, France, Ireland, Finland, Denmark, even in the United States, New Zealand and Canada.\nHowever, in 2006 the Swiss managed to protect the mark Ementaler PDO and today this cheese can be produced only in Switzerland.\nCharacteristics of Emmental\nFor the production of this variety of cheese, raw milk from no-silage fed cows is used. The milk used in the production of Emmental must be delivered to the cheese factory no later than 18 hours after milking the cows. Cheese is mainly produced during the summer, because at that time there is enough fresh milk.\nUsing any kind of additives and GMOs is absolutely prohibited. To produce a cheese wheel of 95 kg, around 1200 liters of raw milk, rennet and bacterial crops are needed.\nShape, size and weight:\nThe cheese is produced in circular shapes of 80 to 100 cm in diameter, with a height of 16 to 27 cm and a weight of 75 to 120 kg.\nThe classic holes that distinguish Emmental cheese from all other cheeses are formed during the ripening process. During the natural fermentation, carbon dioxide is released with nowhere to “escape”, so it is deposited in different parts of the cheese. The size of the holes may be from the size of a cherry to the size of a walnut. Interestingly, the fresher the cheese is, the smaller the size of the holes on it, and vice versa.\nEmmental’s rind has a natural yellow to golden coloration, the texture is soft and elastic, and the flavor is lightly nutty.\nSince this variety of cheese is made from a high quality full-fat cow milk rich in saturated fats and with high biological value, Emmental could not be classified as low-calorie cheese.\nIn exchange of its high caloric value, however, the cheese is not only tasty, but also useful because it is rich in of phosphorus, calcium, beta carotene, iron, selenium, copper, protein, vitamins of group B, vitamin A.\nEmmental is lactose-free!\nNutritional value for 100 grams of Emmental:\n- Water – 36 g.\n- Proteins – 29 g.\n- Fats – 31 g.\n- Mineral salts – 4 g.\n- Calories – 395 kcal\nHow is it produced?\nEmmental AOC is still produced manually, using traditional methods and original recipes, stored and passed from generation to generation.\n“The King of All Cheeses”, as Emmental is called, is subjected to a completely natural process of hardening and ripening.\nThe first step of the production involves centrifuging the milk to activate the whey, and then the cheese mass is warmed and boiled at 53°C. Then, rennet and propionic bacteria are added, and the mix is left to cool down. The resulting “huge lump of cheese” is cut with special tools in separate wheels, which are then reheated at a temperature of 40-45 degrees.\nThe following steps include pressing the wheels to remove the whey, soaking it in salt solution and adding spices. This is how the huge cylindrical cheese wheels are made with weight of 70 to 120 kg.\nAt the last stage of production, the trade mark shall be printed on the side of the shape (wheel) together with the manufacturing authorization number. Producers of the original product thus protect themselves against counterfeiting, and consumers can rest assured that they are buying an original product.\nThe ready cheese wheels are arranged in warm and humid rooms to ripen and ferment. During the fermentation, Ementaler/Emmental’s characteristic holes are also formed. Thanks to the heat in the maturing rooms, propionic fermentation is induced leading to carbon dioxide release. The rind of the cheese prevents leakage of the gas, which is slowly deposited and distributed to the cheese, forming the characteristic holes.\nDepending on the maturing period, Swiss cheese comes in several different types, but the most popular are: “Classic”, “Reserve”, “Extra” and “Premier Gru”.\nEmmentaler Switzerland Classic\n“Classic” is the most popular type of cheese that is available and consumed worldwide. It ripens and is ready for consumption after 4 months. The rind of this type of cheese is ivory-colored, its interior is yellow, the consistency is dense, its taste is walnutty. You can tell Emmentaler Switzerland Classic of the other types of Emmental by the holes, which due to the shortest maturation period are the smallest.\nEmmentaler Switzerland Réserve\nThis is a cheese that will appeal even to the most demanding gourmet lovers. Like “Classic” and “Réserve”, it is kept in maturing rooms for 4 months, but after these four months it is moved to other premises (cellars) where its ripening lasts for another 4 months. During this time, the cheese crust darkens to dark brown and develops its characteristic, more spicy and intense flavor and aroma.\nEmmentaler Switzerland Extra\nThis cheese has a distinctive spicy aroma and rind that during maturation darkens and is covered with a light patina.\nMatured in a cave, this cheese meets the highest demands and is particularly appreciated by cheese lovers. After six months, during which it is stored in rooms at appropriate temperatures for maturing, the cheese is transported in damp caves carved into the cliffs of the Swiss plateau.\nAir humidity, cool temperature and the special flora of these caves are ideal for the ripening process. The classic, original Emmentaler acquires the flavor, aroma and characteristic dark rind for at least 12 months of maturing in cave cellars that maintain a constant temperature of 13°C and an air humidity of about 95 percent.\nWe mentioned a little earlier that Emmental cheese can be produced in other countries, whereas Ementaler is a protected name and can only be produced in Switzerland. Among the most popular types of Emmental produced by other countries are:\n- French Emmental – it is produced in smaller wheels than the Swiss Emmental.\n- Bavarian Emmental – the cheese is similar to the French, but production is highly industrialized and respectively its qualities are less valuable.\n- Finnish Emmental – cheese is mainly for export, similar to the German ( highly industrialized production = not very good quality).\nEmmental is widely used in culinary. It is ideal for sandwiches, salads, for sprinkling various dishes. Emmental is also used to prepare the most popular Swiss dish – fondue, but also for soufflé, pasta, sweets and others.\nThe cheese is perfectly combined with different varieties of red and white wines such as Pinot Noir, Pinot Blanc, Traminer.","October 27th is National Parmigiano Reggiano Day, celebrating one of the world’s great cheeses—often referred to as the “King Of Cheeses.”\nThe point we’d like to make today is that “parmesan cheese” is not Parmigiano Reggiano: a cheese whose reputation is known worldwide, and whose quality is guaranteed with seels of authenticity.\nAnyone can make a cheese called “Parmesan,” which is why large-scale food companies do.\nTrue Parmigiano-Reggiano is a D.O.P. cheese are restricted by a governing body to production in specific locales, with traditional ingredients and techniques.\nD.O.P., Denominazione d’Origine Protetta, is the Italian certification of authenticity of origin.\nAn Italian D.O.P. cheese must be produced in its historic region of Italy, using the same centuries-old artisan techniques as its predecessors.\nIt guarantees that the milk of the cheese and its production methods take place in prescribed regions, with specified techniques. It guarantees the consumer that a cheese labeled Parmigiano-Reggiano will deliver the expected gustatory experience.\nProduction of Parmigiano-Reggiano can only be carried out in five select provinces: Bologna, Mantova, Modena, Parma and Reggio-Emilia. Some 350 small dairy farms produce more than 3.6 million wheels per year.\nEverything else made in the style of Parmigiano-Reggiano—whether in Italy or the rest of the world—must be called by the generic label “parmesan.”\nA cheese labeled as parmesan in the U.S. can still can be a tasty cheese—especially those made by artisanal cheese makers. Factory cheeses (made in bulk), however, have far less complexity and aroma. Just taste them side-by-side to see for yourself.\nIn the case of Parmigiano-Reggiano, the cheese must be made by a cheesemaker who is a member of the Consorzio Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano, a self-governing body of dairies.\nThe cheese is produced in accordance with strict regulations, and a fine-quality Parmigiano-Reggiano is one of the glories of the cheese world.\nHere’s more about the production process of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\nIf you’ve eaten (or just seen) aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, you know that its texture is slightly gritty. This is due to to the tyrosines, amino acid clusters that form with age (photo #3).\nTyrosine clusters are signs of a well-aged cheese, and are also found in aged Goudas (among other cheeses). The longer the aging, the more pronounced the tyrosines.\nIn the 13th century, in the northern Italy provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, and Bologna, a long-aged cheese began to be produced in some of the bigger Benedictine monasteries.\nThe story is that Parmigiano-Reggiano was first created im the 13th century in Bibbiano, a small town located in the central province of Reggio-Emilia.\nLocal Benedictine monks who managed dairies had been searching for a long-aging cheese for their milk.\nThey developed a recipe for what we now know as Parmigiano Reggiano. The hard, granular, flavorful and aromatic cheese quickly became popular, and production expanded into the nearby Parma and Modena provinces. The name of the cheese became a combination of the names of two of the producing provinces, Parma and Reggio-Emilia.\nThe first-known recorded mention of Parmigiano Reggiano was in 1254 C.E., when a noblewoman from Genova actually traded her house in order to have a yearly supply of 53 pounds of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (we’re assuming she had a second house to live in) [source].\nThe popularity of the cheese spread throughout Italy, and soon, the rest of Europe.\nDuring the 14th century, history has given us another mention of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, in The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio.\nWhen describing an imaginary town called Bengodi, he wrote that there was “a mountain of grated parmesan cheese” where “dwell folk that do nothing else but make macaroni and ravioli, and boil them in capon’s broth, and then throw them down the mountain.”\nBack to the monasteries: They had large tracts of land for dairy cow grazing. Cow’s milk (and sheep, goats, and other grazing milk animals) is heavily influenced by the diet of the animal. The monks planted clover and lucerne (alfalfa) in their meadows, which gave a particular flavor to the milk that came through in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\nNeither the cheese nor its production methods have changed substantially since the 1200s. The Consorzio Formaggio Parmigiano-Reggiano sees to that.\nAnd we are grateful for their efforts!\nIt still begins with the cows’ feed, by the way.\nAccording to the Consorzio’s regulations, cows producing milk destined to become Parmigiano-Reggiano can be fed only grasses and hay.\nAny fermented fodder, or silage, such as is commonly fed to dairy cows in the U.S., is forbidden.\nThe cows also cannot be fed any food of animal origin or any food by-product (another practice in the U.S.)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:68ad9f5e-5343-443e-a1ab-81028e3dd358>","<urn:uuid:ada813e5-89de-4d81-9d73-7005d136e4be>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I need detailed information about the sample collection methods from asteroids - what was the difference between Hayabusa 1's collection technique from Itokawa versus Hayabusa 2's planned sampling strategy for Ryugu?","answer":"Hayabusa 1's sample collection from Itokawa faced technical challenges as the impact-sampling method failed to shoot projectiles for sample acquisition. Instead, only floating dust grains entered the sample catcher, resulting in thousands of micron-sized silicate-dominated grains that had to be carefully scraped from the catcher's inside wall. In contrast, Hayabusa 2's sampling strategy for Ryugu was more sophisticated, involving the deployment of a Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI) to create an artificial crater in the asteroid. This allowed the spacecraft to collect samples from beneath the asteroid's surface, while a palm-size camera (DCAM3) observed the explosion from a safe distance as Hayabusa 2 took cover on the opposite side of the asteroid.","context":["(Guest post Summarized by Hirokuni Oda)\nThe special issue “Science of solar system materials examined from Hayabusa and future missions” was published as one of the thematic series of SpringerOpen journal Earth, Planets and Space (EPS). Hayabusa was the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) engineering mission to explore and return a sample from a near-Earth asteroid. It was launched in 2003 by 5th M-V launch vehicle, visited and explored asteroid 25143 Itokawa in 2005, and finally returned surface materials from there to Earth in 2010. The purpose of this mission was an engineering experiment of a round-trip journey to the asteroid, as well as scientific experiments for understanding the origin and evolution of the early solar system by exploring a primitive body. The S-type, sub-kilometer-sized asteroid Itokawa was found to be chondritic in composition and low-density rubble-pile in structure. Its surface was basically rough and covered with boulders, but smooth terrains such as MUSES-C Regio also existed where the first and second touchdown operations were conducted for sample collection (see Fig. 1).\nThe returned samples have been curated in JAXA’s Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center. These samples are of small amount and very fine grained, because the impact-sampling method failed to shoot projectiles for sample acquisition and only floating dust grains entered into the sample catcher (see Fig. 2). Thousands of micron-sized silicate-dominated grains other than artificial contaminants were found by scraping them from the inside wall of the catcher with a Teflon spatula and tapping on the chamber. These samples are consistent with chondritic composition as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The removal of tens of micron-sized particles (up to 300 μm) in the catcher was started using the newly developed electrostatic control manipulator. So far, about 500 particles have been catalogued for initial description about size, shape, SEM images, and representative elemental and mineral composition from EDS spectra, and part of those catalogued particles have been delivered for more advanced research including preliminary examinations and through an international announcement of opportunity.\nThe preliminary examination of Hayabusa-returned samples has successfully unveiled the mineralogical, petrographic, chemical, and isotopic relationships between an S(IV)-type asteroid and ordinary LL chondrite meteorites as predicted by ground-based observation and provided the first direct evidence that meteorites originate from asteroids. The particle-size distribution and existence of rounded grains as well as the noble gas isotopic compositions have also recorded asteroid surface processes such as meteoroid impacts, possible granular flow, and solar wind irradiation on the asteroid surface, which were not observed in meteorites. Organic analyses have been also performed, but indigenous organic compounds have not been identified from the samples to date.\nInvestigation of Hayabusa-returned samples has expanded to any interested researchers by applying to the International Announcement of Opportunity, and the successful winners started their advanced and sophisticated research. Hayabusa 2013: 1st Symposium of Solar System Materials was held for these researchers to come together and discuss their latest results, giving new prospects to understanding the asteroid-meteorite connection and the early solar system origin and evolution. All the papers presented in the symposium were invited for submission to this EPS special issue, and any papers related to the topics were also welcomed. In the end, 14 manuscripts were successfully completed for publication in this special issue.","Hayabusa 2 is a Japanese mission launched in December 2014 on a six-year mission to study the asteroid Ryugu and to collect samples to bring to Earth for analysis.\nThe Hayabusa 2 spacecraft arrived at the asteroid in June 2018.\nThe spacecraft deployed two rovers and a small lander onto the surface.\nHayabusa 2 fired an impactor into the asteroid in February 2019 to create an artificial crater.

In November of 1936, a luncheon was held of the faculty of Harvard Medical School where Karl Compton, PhD, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was invited to give a presentation entitled “What Physics Can Do for Biology and Medicine.” Saul Hertz who attended the luncheon spontaneously asked the very pertinent question that perhaps changed the course of treatment of thyroid disease, “Could iodine be made radioactive artificially?” We review the events leading up to the asking of this question, the preclinical investigations by Dr. Hertz and his colleague Arthur Roberts prior to the treatment of the first patient and what occurred in the years following this landmark event. This commentary seeks to set the record straight to the sequence of events leading to the first radioiodine therapy, so that those involved can be recognized with due credit.\nKeywordsHistory Saul Hertz Radioiodine therapy\nThe year, 2016, marked the 75th anniversary of Dr. Saul Hertz first using radioiodine to treat a patient with thyroid disease. In honor of this anniversary, we have spent a bit of time researching this wonderful advance, including what led up and was subsequent to this event. The excellent and informative history of nuclear medicine presented in 2014 by Peter Ell  describes a conversation between Howard Means of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Robley Evans of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that most likely did not occur. This misunderstanding is not surprising, given that many versions of these events have been presented and published over the years. In this commentary, we hope to set the record straight to the sequence of events leading to the first radioiodine therapy, so that those involved can be recognized with due credit.\nOn November 12, 1936, Karl Compton, president of MIT, was invited to give a presentation at a luncheon of the faculty of Harvard Medical School. His topic was “What Physics Can Do for Biology and Medicine.” Karl Compton was a physicist and the older brother of Arthur Compton, noted for characterizing the photon interaction that came to be known as “Compton scattering.” Dr. Compton had been appointed president of MIT in 1930. It is likely that, during his presentation, Compton touched upon the recent production of artificial radioactivity by Frederic and Iréne Joliot Curie .\nThis exchange between Hertz and Compton depended on more than 100 years of prior scientific advances in a number of disparate scientific fields. In 1811, the French chemist Bernard Courtois extracted iodine from the ashes of seaweed. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac recognized the vapor from the Courtois experiment as a new element and named it “iodine” given its violet color. In 1851, Chatin demonstrated that endemic goiter was associated with low levels of iodine in the drinking water. Kocher significantly improved the surgical approaches to treating thyroid disease and, in 1909, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology for his work on the physiology, pathology, and surgery of the thyroid gland. In 1895, Eugen Bauman demonstrated that the thyroid contains iodoprotein, which he called “thyroiodine”, that contained 10–15% iodine and that administration of thyroiodine could reverse myxedema. In 1911, David Marine utilized iodine repletion to treat endemic goiter and treated hyperthyroidism with iodine. In 1922, Means investigates the use of X-rays to treat toxic goiter .\nIn 1896, Henri Bequerel demonstrates that the uranium salts with which he was working emitted radiation similar to the “new kind of rays” that Röntgen had produced with the use of a cathode ray tube just months earlier. Working in Bequerel’s laboratory, Pierre Curie and Marie Sklodowska Curie isolated the naturally occurring radioactive elements polonium and radium. For these accomplishments, Bequerel and Pierre and Marie Curie shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1923, George de Hevesy demonstrates the tracer principle through his work using radioactive indicators to investigate the absorption and translocation of lead in plants for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1943 . In 1934, Frederic and Iréne Joliot Curie demonstrate the production of artificial radioactivity through their experiments of irradiation of lower Z elements with alpha particles . After alpha irradiation of aluminum, the resultant positrons are emitted, not instantaneously, but with a 2.5 min half-life. They recognize that this phenomenon demonstrates the presence of a new radioactive entity (phosphorus-30). For this accomplishment, Frederic and Iréne Joliot Curie were awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Iréne Joliot Curie was the daughter of Marie Curie leading to the only mother–daughter and the 2nd husband–wife (after her parents) recipients of the Nobel Prize.\nThis collection of scientific accomplishments over the span of the previous 100 years set the stage for Dr. Hertz’s question and the subsequent developments that led to treating the first patient with radioiodine. There are several notable points in the exchange between Drs. Compton and Hertz. Dr. Compton states that iodine can be made artificially radioactive with a half-life of 25 min. Thus, he is referring to 128I, which, at that time, could be produced by neutron activation of 127I, which had been demonstrated by Enrico Fermi. Dr. Hertz states in his reply to Compton that radioactive iodine may be “a useful method of therapy in cases of overactivity of the thyroid gland.” This extraordinary hypothesis may have been built upon the earlier work by Means regarding the potential treatment of thyroid disease using external X-rays .\nIt soon became clear from these biokinetic studies that a radioiodine isotope with a 25-min half-life and the amounts of radioiodine that could be produced with the Ra-Be source would not be optimal for therapeutic applications. 10 years earlier, Ernest Lawrence and his team in Berkeley had developed the cyclotron for various investigations in nuclear physics. After the Joliot Curie paper, it became obvious that the cyclotron also could be used for generating artificial radioactivity. Drs. Compton, Evans, and Means petitioned the Markle Foundation in New York to help fund the installation at MIT of a cyclotron to be used primarily for medical purposes. As a result, the Markle Foundation provided a $30,000 grant for the purchase and installation of the MIT cyclotron. The cyclotron became operational in November 1940 and could produce therapeutic amounts of a mixture of 130I (90%) and 131I (10%). The half-lives of 130I and 131I are 12.4 h and 8.1 days, respectively.\nIn 1943, in the midst of World War II, Dr. Hertz decided to volunteer for military service. Upon his departure, responsibility for the MGH thyroid clinic was turned over to Earle Chapman, MD, who had been working in the clinic under the supervision of Dr. Hertz. While Dr. Hertz was absent, Dr. Chapman worked with Evans to continue to treat thyroid patients with radioiodine. However, in these cases, the administration of radioiodine was not followed with a dose of non-radioactive iodine.\nAfter the war, Dr. Hertz worked to re-establish himself in the medical community in Boston. After being unsuccessful in his attempt to rejoin the staff at the MGH, he joined the medical staff of the Beth Israel Hospital. During this time, it came to Dr. Hertz’s attention that Chapman and Evans planned to publish the results in 22 patients they had treated with radioiodine during the time Hertz was in the service, and that a manuscript without recognition of the work by Hertz and Roberts had been submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association. Hertz and Roberts reported on their initial 29 patients in the same issue of the journal, just previous to the Chapman and Evans paper. This resulted in the unusual circumstance of two manuscripts on the same topic from the same institution with no overlapping authorship being published back-to-back in the same medical journal [8, 9]. Later the same year, Dr. Seidlin and his group at Montefiore Hospital in New York also reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the use of radioiodine to treat 23 patients with metastatic thyroid cancer . Dr. Seidlin had consulted with Dr. Hertz regarding this research. In 1948, Means published a review article on the use of radioiodine in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease . In the article, Means recognized the initial treatment with radioiodine of patients with Graves’ disease by Hertz and Roberts as reported at the American Society for Clinical Investigation in 1941. In this article, he also recognized the subsequent work in this realm by Hamilton and Lawrence as well as Chapman and Evans.\nWe have researched these events to the best of our ability, given that they happened over 70 years ago, but we are confident that we have reported the proper sequencing of events so essential to the history of nuclear medicine. Not only do these events mark the first therapeutic use of radioiodine, but also the use of targeted radionuclide therapy to demonstrate the fundamental principles of both molecular nuclear medicine and theranostics. 75 years later, we find ourselves in an era of rebirth for radionuclide therapy, with the recent introductions of 223Ra dichloride for treatment of bone metastases and177Lu-labeled agents for treatment of both neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. The use of 177Lu-labeled agents opens up the potential for new “theranostic” applications, where, much as with radioactive iodine in the management of thyroid disease, the same agent can be used for both diagnostic imaging and therapy. The field of nuclear medicine is indebted to Dr. Hertz, his collaborators, and other early pioneers for their scientific vision, courage, and persistence.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge and thank Barbara Hertz for providing the material for the figures in this manuscript.\nThe authors received no funding for the work associated with this paper.\nAll authors made equal and substantial contributions to the conception and design of this manuscript, were directly involved in drafting and revising of the manuscript, gave final approval of the version to be published, and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
