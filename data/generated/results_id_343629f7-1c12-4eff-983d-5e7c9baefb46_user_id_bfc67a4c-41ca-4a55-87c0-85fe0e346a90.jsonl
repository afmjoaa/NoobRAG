{"question":"How do the modern preservation approaches differ between the former Joliet Steel Works and the Carrie Furnaces sites in terms of their cultural and artistic legacy?","answer":"While the Joliet Steel Works' historical legacy is primarily remembered through its contributions to early American skyscrapers and the pioneering Steel Workers Club, the Carrie Furnaces site has been actively preserved and repurposed as a cultural center. The Carrie Furnaces, managed by the Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation, now serves as a dynamic platform for the arts, hosting sculpture conferences, iron casting events, artist residencies, and educational programs through Rivers of Steel Arts (RoSA). This site has become a venue for various artistic activities including eco-arts, urban arts, film, dance, theater, and heritage arts programs.","context":["During the 1880s, the Joliet mill was in full operation. Its location was beneficial to take advantage of expanding markets. According to Bergstresser, the plant “occupied a central location between the ore supplies of Lake Superior and the Iron Mountain district of Missouri. Secondly, the Joliet area contained extensive deposits of coal and limestone that could be used, respectively, as fuel and building stone. In addition, several railroads, including the Chicago and Alton and the Rock Island, which (both) ran through the site, and the Michigan Central, which lay nearby, offered a convenient assembly system for raw materials as well as a shipping outlet for the mill’s finished products. Lake ore could also be delivered to the site via the Illinois and Michigan Canal, which flowed past the factory.”\nDuring this period, two blast furnaces towered 72 feet into the sky.\nEach furnace required the complicated coordination of 250 workers, who loaded materials — iron ore, limestone and coke — into wheelbarrows and were transported by elevator to the top of the furnaces where the materials were dumped in.\nLocal steel played a major role in the outward and upward building of America. In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed much of the city, and former wooden structures were replaced with steel buildings. In 1885, the 10-story Home Insurance Building was completed in Chicago. This was the first modern skyscraper with its steel load-bearing frame. Throughout the next 20 years, Chicago would lead the world in designing and building steel frame skyscrapers.\nManagers of the Joliet factory appear to have been socially advanced for their day. In 1889, at a cost of about $75,000, they built the Steel Workers Club, “apparently the pioneer workingmen’s club of any size in America,” according to Will County ILGenWeb’s The History of Joliet Illinois 1927. Membership was restricted to employees of the factory, who paid a nominal fee of $2 per year to use the facility.\n“The club contains pleasant reading rooms, with more than sixty periodicals and newspapers, a large billiard room with six tables, a well-furnished and lighted gymnasium and handball court, fine bowling alleys, a tennis court and an athletic field. There is a bath room with a swimming pool, shower and tub baths, a kitchen, card rooms, and a large reception room and three pianos, a large assembly room seating more than nine hundred people.”\nIn 1901, the United States Steel Corporation was founded, the largest business enterprise ever known. It began with a merger between Carnegie Steel and the Federal Steel Company that soon began to buy and incorporate other companies. The Joliet Steel Works, as it was then referred to, was one of these companies acquired in 1901. In that first year of operation, U.S. Steel produced 67 percent of all steel made in the United States.\nIllinois was second only to Pennsylvania as the largest manufacturer of steel rails in the world, and the Joliet plant employed more than 2,000 men with an annual payroll in excess of $2 million.","Almost 100 feet tall and constructed of 2.5-inch-thick plate steel lined with refractory brick, the iron cupolas at the Carrie Furnaces National Historic Landmark in Swissvale and Rankin, Pennsylvania, are extremely rare examples of pre-World War II iron-making technology. Since the collapse of the Pittsburgh region’s steel industry and the dismantling of most of the mills along the waterways of southwestern Pennsylvania, the Carrie Furnaces are the only non-operative blast furnaces in the area that remain standing. A visit to the Carrie Furnaces is like stepping into a cathedral of iron and steel. The architecture is both overwhelming and inspiring. This is a sculptor’s paradise, and it also happens to be one of the sites for the 26th International Sculpture Conference, “Sculpture in Context: Tradition and Innovation.”\nPlace matters, and tradition and innovation surround this National Historic Landmark. Built in the late 1880s, the Carrie Furnaces produced iron for the Homestead Works steel operation (after 1898), which was owned by Andrew Carnegie, and then US Steel (Henry Clay Frick). Iron flowed from its seven cupola furnaces for close to 100 years. Furnaces 6 and 7 are the only ones that still remain on the site. During the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, Carrie 6 and 7 consumed approximately four tons of raw iron ore, coke, and limestone for every ton of iron produced. The cooling system for the blast furnace required more than 5,000,000 gallons of water a day, all supplied by the Monongahela River. The furnaces reached their peak production in the 1950s and ’60s, when they were producing 1,000–1,250 tons of iron a day. It was here, just outside Pittsburgh, that steel became synonymous with American progress and industrial revolution. This is the birthplace of American big steel. From these furnaces flowed the molten alloy that was formed into many monumental icons of the American built environment, including the Empire State Building, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Brooklyn Bridge.\nUS Steel ceased operations at the Carrie Furnaces in 1984. When the site was sold to the Park Corporation in 1988, the company started to dismantle and salvage the steel structures and machinery. During that time, many local artists would jump the fence and explore the derelict site, including the locally famous Industrial Arts Cooperative (IAC), a rogue group of guerrilla artists led by sculptor Tim Kaulen. The group created monumental site-specific installations from materials found there and spent several seasons of dedicated effort creating the massive Carrie Deer that is still on the site today. Many sculptors and graffiti artists created passionate works among the rusting giants of the Carrie Furnaces.\nThe Steel Industry Heritage Task Force was also founded in 1988, the same year that the Park Corporation bought the Carrie Furnaces. In 1991, the organization morphed into the Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation (RSHC). A visionary nonprofit, the RSHC was formed through a collaborative effort between the National Parks Service and the Pennsylvania County and State Departments of Conservation and Recreation with the intention to secure the Carrie Furnaces site. The RSHC now owns and stewards many sites of cultural importance in the Pittsburgh region, repurposing and preserving them for future generations. Its mission includes historic preservation, cultural conservation, education, recreation, and resource development. Through the tireless efforts of the RSHC and its main historian and hyper-passionate site manager, Ron Baraff, the Carrie Furnaces now offers a dynamic platform for the arts. Baraff and the RSHC have approached the site in an extremely open manner. Realizing that the site had more potential than just a monument to the region’s past and that it could be accessed through multiple forms of interpretation, they welcomed art as a catalyst.\nAnyone who has a foundry practice or understands the steel and iron heritage of the area will marvel at the majestic array of buildings and cupolas that make up this unique campus. In the mid-2000s, local sculptor Ed Parrish Jr. started running iron pours at the Carrie Furnaces as part of his Hot Metal Happenings (funded by the Sprout Fund), whose purpose was to share with the regional community the fact that iron casting in Pittsburgh is still happening (at a smaller scale)—this time, for making contemporary art.\nIn 2013, two art professors from Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP)—Chris McGinnis, a curator, and fellow colleague/ sculptor Sean Derry—formed Alloy PGH. Artists accepted to this biennial residency, education, and exhibition program receive the opportunity to respond to the Carrie Furnaces site. Funded by local arts organizations such as the Sprout Fund, IUP’s Kipp Gallery, and Radiant Hall Studios, Alloy PGH has brought in artists, historians, ecologists, and curators to help the artists-in-residence learn more about what it means to work contextually. Luminaries such as Ann Hamilton and Mary Jane Jacob helped younger artists, including Ricardo Robinson, Oreen Cohen, Carl Bajandas, Ryan Keen, and Edith Abeyta, to create fantastic installations on site during the 2015 program. McGinnis and Derry had the vision and the drive to bring artists to this dynamic location to demonstrate how the visual and performing arts can transform neglected sites into gathering places. The 2013 and 2015 iterations of the program have been extremely successful, establishing the model as a regional gem of an art exhibition that challenges visitors to experience the Carrie Furnaces in a whole new way.\nAt the same time that iron casting events and Alloy PGH were beginning to take shape at Carrie, landscape ethicist and photographer Rick Darke had been documenting the site’s ecological fabric. Darke’s passion for place and the site led him, in consultation with the RSHC and Baraff, to invite the Penn State Master Gardener Program of Allegheny County to develop a comprehensive plant survey in and around Carrie.\nIn 2014, the Master Gardeners—led by Susan Marquesen, Joanne van Linden, Addy Smith-Reiman, and Anna Johnson—put together a team of artists, ecologists, historians, and students to develop a multi-disciplinary approach to interpreting the native and invasive plant species that are surviving, and even thriving, in the disturbed soils of the Carrie Furnaces site. As part of their research, they addressed best practices in environmental stewardship and responded to the site itself with the Iron Garden Walk, which is open to the public and features a series of 10 interpretive iron plaques. First, the Master Gardeners consolidated their research to develop the content, which includes botanical illustrations from the Hunt Institute of Botanical Documentation at Carnegie Mellon and descriptions of the various plants growing around the foundry, and Smith-Reiman created the layout of the plaque designs. The designs were translated and milled in high-density urethane (HDU) on the CNC in the Carnegie Mellon Sculpture Department by art student Lauren Valley. The patterns were molded by myself and Ed Parrish Jr. and cast on site with the Master Gardeners, CMU students, a large contingent of local artists, and Casey Westbrook of Carbon Arts. After the pour, the plaques were installed for future generations of visitors to discover through the seasons.\nThe Iron Garden Walk is a perfect example of collaboration between multiple organizations, using art and cast iron to bring people with related ideas together. The Master Gardeners, with the help of historians and artists, were able to realize their concept of how the site might be seen. By supporting projects like the Iron Garden Walk and Alloy PGH, the Rivers of Steel Heritage Corporation has been forward-thinking in its approach to how this site can benefit from its context, heritage, and public engagement.\nThe RSHC continues to diversify, bringing more artists to engage with the Carrie Furnaces. It recently unveiled a newly formed program, Rivers of Steel Arts (RoSA), headed by artist Chris McGinnis. Through RoSA’s multifaceted programing, the Carrie Furnaces is quickly becoming one of the region’s most exciting venues for the arts, education, and entertainment. RoSA has seen the benefits of multiple forms of community outreach and has teamed up with Parrish Jr. and Westbrook to develop Carbon Arts at Carrie, a metal arts program that will offer educational opportunities for mold-making, casting, and welding in the coming years. The groups are in the process of putting together infrastructure for a permanent foundry on the site, outfitted with a gantry, material storage, classrooms, and eventually multiple iron cupolas of various sizes. RoSA is dedicated to artistic programming that reimagines the future of familiar places, builds pride in community, and attracts renewed public interest in Pittsburgh’s Monongahela River Valley. It continues to evolve and hone its program offerings to attract new visitors from the local, regional, and global community to the site, while knowing the past and embracing the future. RoSA has already generated a substantial and eclectic program, including artist residencies, eco-arts, photo arts, urban arts (graffiti), film, dance, theater, festivals, and heritage arts consisting of a regional folklife center that represents eight counties in southwestern Pennsylvania.\nDuring the 26th annual International Sculpture Conference, conference-goers will have a chance to visit the Carrie Furnaces for panel discussions, cast iron workshops, tours of the Iron Garden Walk, and an exhibition of contemporary cast iron sculpture curated by Westbrook and Parrish Jr. For more on the arts at Carrie, visit http://rosarts.org.\nJoshua Reiman is an artist living in Portland, Maine, where he is also an assistant professor in the MFA in Studio Art + Sculpture programs at the Maine College of Art.\nWatch these videos on the Carrie Furnaces"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9631f28e-e4ce-4757-b3fc-33b442b16368>","<urn:uuid:eef00725-c4d0-4ba0-8f28-fcef60e8f74c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What major changes occurred at Bethells Beach after European arrival in the 19th century?","answer":"After European arrival in the 19th century, two major changes occurred at Bethells Beach: the clearing of land for timber and pastoral farming (which began in 1854 and continued until the 1920s), and the construction of a dam on the Waitakere River in the 1920s which altered the riverbed level and reduced water outflow to the sea.","context":["Te Henga (Bethells Beach)\nTe Henga (Bethells Beach) is a coastal community in the Auckland Region in the north of the North Island, New Zealand. The Māori name Te Henga, meaning sand, originally applied to a wide area of the lower Waitakere River valley, but in 1976 the New Zealand Geographic Board changed the name of the beach from Bethells Beach to Te Henga (Bethells Beach).\nThe beach is approximately 30 kilometres north-west of Auckland City, at the mouth of the Waitakere River where it flows into the Tasman Sea. One of several popular resorts in the area (others include Muriwai, Piha and Karekare), it experiences a population explosion in summer when Aucklanders head to the sea.\nThe Te Henga Valley shows evidence of human settlement dating back over 1000 years. The cultural history of the area is of archaeologically significant sites, including food gathering areas, pā, walkways, canoe landings and sacred places.\nThe arrival of Europeans in the 19th century led to major changes in the character and shape of Bethells Beach. The most significant of these changes was the clearing of the land for timber and pastoral farming which began in 1854 and continued until the 1920s. In addition, a dam was constructed on the Waitakere River in the 1920s, drastically altering the level of the riverbed and reducing the outflow of water to the sea.\nJohn Bethell negotiated with the Waitakere County Council to sell the land that is now known as Te Henga Park. The Council considered the beach and park area would provide excellent recreation facilities for residents of Auckland. Te Henga was recognised as a place of regional significance.\nThe sand dunes have accumulated in several phases over the last 4,500 years. This accumulation has occurred since sea levels returned to about their present levels following the last glaciation 6,500 years ago. These sands contain quantities of black titanomagnetite derived from the volcanic rocks of Taranaki and carried north by coastal currents. The dunes continually move in a dynamic coastal process. There are three dune-impounded lakes: Lake Wainamu, Lake Kawaupaka and Lake Waiataru.\nEcology of the Waitakere River catchment\nThe Waitakere River catchment consists of roughly 70 km² of the bush-clad Waitakere Ranges. Located on the west coast of the Auckland Region approximately 75% of the catchment consists of native vegetation in spite of extensive milling, farming and settlement.\nThe major features of the catchment are:\n- the abundance of native vegetation\n- the steep and rugged terrain\n- the Te Henga wetland\n- the sand dunes\n- Lake Wainamu\n- The Waitakere Reservoir\nThe Waitakere River has two main tributaries, the Mokoroa and Waiti streams. The headwaters of the river are in the vast and steep Waitakere Ranges and drain out at the Bethell’s Beach river mouth.\nIn comparison with other North Island beaches, and to some extent even the west coast beaches of Muriwai and Piha, settlement at Bethells has been minor with most development revolving around horticulture and agriculture.\nWith the exception of the Waitakere Reservoir the catchments resources have largely escaped development.\nIn 1990 The Auckland Regional Water Board developed and prepared a Waitakere River Catchment Water and Soil Plan. This pre-Resource Management Act document aimed to deal with the competing water and soil resource demands within the catchment in terms of \"conservation, allocation, use and quality of natural water and in terms of soil conservation and preventing damage from flooding.\" Although this document may be almost 16 years old many of its principles still apply.\nLake Wainamu is a dune lake that formed during the last 6,500 years when the Wainamu Stream Valley was dammed by dunes of sand blown inland. A decline in water quality was noted in 1990s and was thought to be caused by exotic fish accelerating the loss of the submerged plant life. In response the Auckland Regional Council removed over 9,000 exotic fish (particularly perch, goldfish and rudd) between 2004 and 2007. In 2009, grass carp were introduced to the lake in an attempt to rid it of introduced egeria. The lake is also home to native freshwater fish including banded kokopu, inanga, common smelt, common bully, grey mullet, longfin and short-finned eel.\n- Surfing is the main pastime. Other pastimes include parasailing and hang gliding, for which the prevailing westerly wind often provides favourable conditions.\n- Fishing is also popular, although dangerous in many places and many deaths have taken place from this.\n- Bush walking is encouraged, with boardwalks in place.\n- Sunbathing, swimming, picnics, running etc.\n- Skimboarding is also becoming quite popular with young people.\nThe beach has been used as a filming location for several projects, one of the earliest being a four month shoot for awardwinning drama series Children of Fire Mountain (1979). Other shoots include the music video for Shania Twain single \"Forever and for Always\"(2003), TV series The New Adventures of Black Beauty, Brit/New Zealand TV movie The Man Who Lost His Head, and episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess.

{"question":"How does Notre-Dame Cathedral's historical role as a community monument compare to the modern community-building aspects of urban farming initiatives?","answer":"Notre-Dame Cathedral was historically a monument built by the masses rather than rulers, taking almost two centuries of community effort to complete. It remains Europe's most visited monument, attracting 12-14 million visitors annually, symbolizing communal achievement and dedication. Similarly, modern urban farming initiatives build community through collective effort, providing spaces for citizens to grow produce together, creating local job opportunities, and establishing farmers' markets. These farms serve as community hubs that offer job training, health education, and improved nutrition while helping revitalize urban areas and creating self-sustaining local food systems that keep economic benefits within the community.","context":["“Notre-Dame is burning!”\nAnyone in Paris on the evening of April 15th must have heard this incredulous statement. In the sky, a thickening plume of smoke made sure there was no mistaking. Its changing colors were odd, so was its origin, seemingly soaring from the very center of the city.\nIn fact it did. On the south bank of the Île de la Cité, where Parisian history started, the square spreading at the feet of Notre-Dame marks the official point from which all distances from the capital are measured.\nWhen construction started more than 850 ago, the cathedral was to be seen by all – it remained the tallest structure in the French capital until the completion of the Eiffel Tower in 1889. To this day, the medieval imagery of Paris features its imposing yet majestic silhouette rising at the end of every street.\nParisian houses and buildings have since gotten taller, and not everyone has the chance – today the dread – to see the cathedral from their window. As to make sure this is really happening, emulating doubting Thomas on an already unsettling Holy week, residents and locals flock to the hills to watch history burn.\nA growing crowd assembles atop the Belleville belvedere, just four kilometers northeast of the island. There she stands, her roof and spire engulfed in other-wordly flames. Thought to be timeless, the monument had never appeared so fragile. In a striking paradox, glowing in the heart of Paris, it had also never seemed so tall.\nFrom such a distance, it is impossible to imagine the battle raging on the burning ridges of Notre-Dame. All you can see is the fire, not the hundreds of firefighters trying to save the monument. A helicopter circles above the disaster like a powerless fly.\nNews reports soon provide more details to the troubled crowd. What witnesses can see burning is the cathedral’s ancient rooftop, made with the equivalent of 2,000 oak trees of wooden frame and 210 tons of lead tiles. Nicknamed “La Forêt” by the very few who ever got to walk under its venerable beams, the structure still included parts of Notre-Dame’s original roofing, including trees planted in the 8th or 9th century.\nThe cathedral’s iconic spire now stands like a gigantic torch in the heart of Paris. The elegant feature was added in the 1860s during Notre-Dame’s largest renovation program, led by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, who was 31 years old when he was chosen to lead the monumental revival efforts.\nA sudden stupor strikes the dense crowd gathered around the belvedere’s balconies: the wooden spire has fallen, eaten and broken up by raging flames. A cloud of golden smoke rises from the cauldron of the cathedral. A hellish vision for the history books, reminiscent of a time when capitals still vanished in fires and tragedies saw buildings going up in smoke under the bombs.\nPetrified, shocked, powerless yet again: witnesses cannot look elsewhere. How far can this go? Will the face of Paris be forever changed tonight? Are we really gonna see the towers of Notre-Dame crumble in the inferno?\nBeyond religion, the cathedral has a special place in history. Built over almost two centuries, a timeline spanning generations, it is not the accomplishment of rulers and kings, but the resolute work of the masses.\nAt the time of its construction, many of Notre-Dame’s architectural features were revolutionary: first and foremost the ingenious flying buttresses, crowning the choir like rays of sunlight, and the vibrant rose windows, then the largest ever conceived. Even with so many churches bearing the same name today, no one needs to precise which one they are talking about when mentioning Paris’ cathedral.\nThat the building still stands to this day is in itself miraculous. It has survived the many civil wars, invasions, and revolutions that shaped a decidedly wilful French – and Parisian – history. The most visited in Europe (12 to 14 million a year), it is by far the oldest major monument in the city. Can such an architectural icon so suddenly disappear?\nAs nightfall approaches, the fire slowly dies. The cathedral’s bells may not ring tomorrow within the twin belfrys, but thanks to the efforts of roughly 500 firefighters, they will get to stand another day in the heart of Paris.\nNotre-Dame is not destroyed ; she has lost her roof. The buttresses stayed strong. The rose windows still shine. The cathedral still stands.\nPhotos © ST","When you turn on the tv and watch the news, you’re quickly bombarded with bad news about climate change destroying the world as we know it and billions of people facing potential food and water shortages. It’s daunting, and it’s tough to assess where the data ends and sensationalism takes over, making it even more difficult to do something about the situation. It’s easy to feel insignificant when looking at the scale of the problem, which in turn leads to a lot of people feeling like they can’t contribute to finding a solution. This isn’t the case. There are opportunities to take control of your life, and in turn have a positive effect on the environment as well as your local community. One of these opportunities comes in the form of Urban Farming, and it’s starting to gain traction.\nAn urban farm is “a part of a local food system where food is cultivated, produced and marketed to consumers within that urban area.” These farms can take a variety of forms, including non-profit gardens and for-profit businesses, which provide jobs, job training, health education, as well as contributing to better nutrition and health for the community by providing locally grown, fresh produce. In addition, these urban farms can be used to help revitalize any abandoned or underutilized urban area and remediate the soil in brownfields. This remediation tackles the problem of contaminated land that may have negative consequences on our ground water and increases the amount of usable, fertile land.\nAddressing food shortages on a global scale presents a situation with an extremely difficult problem to solve, but when we focus on individual communities having access to healthy food options and eliminating the presence of food deserts, this problem becomes much more manageable. By creating community farms we can build a space for citizens of that community to grow some of their own produce, as well as create a connection with the origin of their food. This also contributes to peace of mind as they would know that their food is free of harmful pesticides. Taking this a step further, urban agriculture can be used to help feed the community at a larger scale, by producing a higher yield and a greater diversity of products. A distribution network can be created to either deliver these products directly to the citizens or redirected to a local farmer’s market in which these locally grown goods are available to purchase. Because of the close proximity to the source, costs will be reduced and the produce would be available for a longer window of time before they begin to spoil. Incorporating vertical farming and hydroponics into this system reduces the need for large plots of land while still providing the ability to produce a variety of fruits and vegetables.\nUrban farming is not only about growing produce though, as it can also include “animal husbandry (e.g., breeding and raising livestock), beekeeping, aquaculture (e.g., fish farming), aquaponics (e.g., integrating fish farming and agriculture), and non-food products such as producing seeds, cultivating seedlings, and growing flowers.” If these were to be incorporated it would go a long way in ensuring that the community can be self-sustaining, and therefore the community would no longer need to wait on policies to come to their rescue. Urban farming would also create economic opportunities for citizens, and the money would stay local so that further development and revitalization of the community could take place. It would also have a positive impact on reducing the amount of carbon emissions that have an effect on climate change.\nSequestering carbon in soil is a natural way of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere with fewer impacts on land and water, less need for energy, and lower costs than other means of capturing carbon emissions. The Earth’s soils contain about 2,500 gigatons of carbon, more than three times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and four times the amount stored in all living plants and animals. Traditional agricultural practices— such as tilling, planting mono-crops, removing crop residue, excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, and overgrazing— expose the carbon in the soil to oxygen and allows it to burn off into the atmosphere. Soil sequestration occurs through the process of photosynthesis, by which plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use water and sunlight to turn the carbon into leaves, stems, seeds and roots. Some carbon is then released into the atmosphere through respiration and some is exuded into the soil as a sugary substance through the roots, which then feeds the microbes that live underground. These microbes are beneficial for the viability of the soil and increase the fertility of the land so more plants can then be planted and more produce can be cultivated. This means that we can help to feed our communities with healthy, locally grown foods while at the same time helping to reduce the amount of carbon emissions in the atmosphere, solely through the use of nature.\nIn a time when our problems seem too grandiose for us to be able to do anything about them, it’s important for us to realize that there are solutions that we can implement ourselves that would not only benefit our local communities, but can also have an aggregate benefit to the rest of the world. There are plenty of resources out there that provide information on how to practice urban farming, whether at a small,at-home scale or on a larger, community oriented development, such as the Urban Agriculture Toolkit and courses offered at various institutions, including the Huntington Library Botanical Gardens. All that’s required is for the community to step up and take matters into our own hands."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4367f403-e15f-46ab-be22-8c756d4c67b7>","<urn:uuid:8483995d-2308-4eb0-9f33-73b04dab63b7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should CO2 enrichment be managed in cannabis cultivation for optimal results?","answer":"CO2 enrichment should be managed by considering multiple factors. While growers typically target 1,200-1,500 parts per million, these levels may be too high depending on other environmental conditions. CO2 uptake has a positive relationship with air temperature and light intensity - plants uptake more CO2 when both are increased. However, there's an upper limit around 1,200-1,500 ppm beyond which plants cannot use more CO2. Additionally, elevated CO2 levels cause plants to focus more on leaf development, which is beneficial during vegetative growth but could reduce yields if maintained during flowering. Therefore, CO2 levels should be adjusted based on growth stage and other environmental conditions.","context":["Understanding how carbon dioxide and vapor pressure deficit impact cannabis growth can save resources and lead to healthier, more productive crops\nAs the price of cannabis decreases and the cost of doing business increases, growers are actively looking for ways to optimize their use of energy, water and other resources, while maintaining the same level of productivity or even increasing output. At the same time, regulators and utility companies are concerned about the cannabis industry’s impact on regional power supplies, local ecosystems and watersheds, and waste stream management.\nFor those entities outside the sphere of cannabis cultivation and horticultural science, the solution seems obvious: regulate or incentivize more energy-efficient technologies, such as LED lighting, variable refrigerant flow HVAC systems, or other ready-for-market alternatives that have been successfully implemented on commercial and residential projects. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, because changing an environmental input can have a profound effect on how the plant responds to other inputs, ultimately affecting how the grower manages crop productivity and profitability.\nBut how do energy-efficient technologies and strategies impact plant productivity? Are these technologies the right solution for maximizing efficiency and reducing impacts on utilities and the environment? Unfortunately, these technologies do not live in a vacuum.\nWhat is VPD?\nVapor pressure deficit (VPD) is the difference between the amount of water in the air and the maximum amount of water the air can hold for a given temperature (saturation). It is usually measured in kilopascals (kPa) or bars. A low VPD is indicative of high moisture content in the air and a high VPD is indicative of low moisture content.\nThe surface of leaves is commonly assumed to be saturated with water. Plant stomatal opening is directly related to VPD. If VPD is too high, stomata will close to conserve water. If it’s too low, stomata may be fully open, but evapotranspiration will be slow and nutrient uptake will be impacted. Both conditions can cause wilting, leaf tip burn and other crop maladies. When VPD is managed correctly, plants will transpire freely, move nutrients readily to cells and maximize CO2 uptake.\nPlant Responses to Environment\nAs a C3 plant (see sidebar), cannabis is particularly well-suited for temperate climates, which are characterized by relatively small swings in daily and seasonal temperatures and abundant rainfall.\nRegardless of type, all green plants are autotrophs, meaning they use the chemical reactions of photosynthesis to self-generate the energy required to grow and reproduce. To support photosynthesis, all plants require the same basic environmental inputs: light, water, nutrients and CO2.\nFor flowering plants, such as cannabis, a change in one or more environmental factors can shift it from a vegetative state (leaf production) to a reproductive state (flower and fruit production). During its vegetative state, cannabis likes long, sunny days to maximize photosynthesis and chlorophyll production, resulting in big, beautiful green leaves. As the sun wanes after the summer solstice (June 21), the plant recognizes that resources will become more scarce, triggering the plant to move toward a reproductive state.\nBy the time days and nights reach a 12-hour split, the cannabis plant is in full flowering mode. Greenhouse growers extend their growing season by using a combination of light-dep curtains and supplemental lighting to manipulate the photoperiod (day length) and evoke the flowering response, regardless of time of year. Indoor growers do the same thing by switching from an 18-hour photoperiod to a 12-hour photoperiod when they want to induce flowering.\nAlthough light is essential for plants to photosynthesize and sets a timer for reproducing plants, it is only one of many environmental factors that plants require to grow. Air temperature affects the metabolic rate of plants and their ability to synthesize CO2 and nutrients into primary compounds (think chlorophyll) and secondary compounds (think terpenes). The relative humidity at a given air temperature impacts the opening of leaf stomata, which are responsible for the exchange of gases, specifically CO2 and water vapor. The larger the stomatal opening, the more CO2 can come into the leaf and the more water vapor can evaporate from it (via evapotranspiration).\nBecause the combination of air temperature and relative humidity (commonly referred to as vapor pressure deficit or VPD) affects the rate of evaporation from the leaf, it also affects the rate at which water is taken up by the roots and delivered through the plant. Therefore, if the stomatal opening is large, the plant will need more water to keep up with the rate of evaporation. If the roots do not receive enough water, the plant will respond by wilting. Because plants also use evapotranspiration to transport nutrients from the water to plant cells, if water deficiencies persist, the plant will begin to exhibit nutrient deficiencies, such as leaf tip burn (calcium deficiency). Plants can even lose their ability to ward off pests and pathogens due to a depressed immune system.\nAlternately, when stomatal openings are smaller (due to too either too much or too little moisture in the air), evapotranspiration rates will be lower and plants will require less water. But if too much water is supplied to the plant under this condition, the roots can become starved for oxygen, causing them to exhibit behavioral signs similar to under-watering.\nCO2 enrichment is often used by indoor and greenhouse growers to increase the rate of photosynthesis and plant growth. Typically, growers target CO2 levels between 1,200 and 1,500 parts per million in the production room. Although there have not been academic studies specifically researching the optimal CO2 level for cannabis cultivation, research into other similar horticultural crops reveals that these target levels are likely too high based on growers’ targets for other environmental factors, specifically air temperature and light intensity.\nIn general, the rate of CO2 uptake has a positive relationship with air temperature and light intensity, such that plants uptake CO2 at a higher rate when both air temperature and light intensity are increased. But there is an upper limit, at which no matter how high the temperature or light level, the plant simply cannot use more CO2. For most plants, this upper limit comes around 1,200 to 1,500 parts per million. Additionally, when CO2 levels are elevated, the plant uses more resources to support leaf development, which is great during the veg stage, but could reduce yields if continued during flowering.\nLEDs to the Rescue?\nA lot of attention has been given to the energy-saving potential for replacing high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps with LEDs. Utility companies are especially interested in this technology, as they witness steep spikes in electricity demand across their service areas where cannabis cultivation facilities are permitted.\nGrowers are also looking for solutions to reduce operating costs, with energy use commonly the largest expense after labor. Because LED lamps are more efficient at converting electricity into light, they produce less waste heat, thereby reducing the HVAC cooling requirements. It is this cascade effect of simultaneously reducing the electricity needs for both lighting and HVAC that causes many people to consider LEDs the “holy grail” of energy-efficiency opportunities.\nBut plants respond differently to different environmental conditions. Most people recognize that LEDs generally put out lower light intensities than HID lamps, even with full-spectrum ratings, and adjustments are made to lighting layouts and floor plans to compensate for the plants’ response to different light inputs. Rarely, however, are adjustments made to the room or other systems to also compensate for the reduction in waste heat.\nPlant leaves are essentially black bodies, similar to our hands, in that they capture radiant energy from the surfaces around them. Radiant energy comes in the form of light and heat. Any spectrums of radiant energy outside the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectrum — about 400 to 700 nanometers — is considered “waste heat.” This radiant heat affects leaf temperature, metabolic activity in the cells and the rate of evapotranspiration.\nIf you started growing in a facility outfitted with HID lamps, you have likely installed HVAC equipment and developed crop management strategies to accommodate this “high waste heat” condition, including finding the right balance of air temperature, relative humidity, irrigation rate and frequency, and fertilizer mix. But under a “low waste heat” condition, plants respond differently to these variables. Because they are being irradiated by less heat, the leaves will be cooler and evapotranspiration rates will be less, effectively reducing the plant’s thirst for water. And because there is less heat and moisture generated in the room, there will be a smaller requirement for cooling and dehumidification. Additionally, the combination of low light intensity under the same air temperature setpoint will reduce the rate at which plants fix CO2. Therefore, lower CO2 levels and less enrichment is required.\nBut that also raises other questions. If plants need less water and have a slower rate of metabolism under LED lights, does that also mean they need less nutrients, more concentrated nutrients, or a different balance of nutrients? Can your existing HVAC equipment handle the lower cooling and dehumidification loads? Can other environmental inputs be modified to achieve the same growth rate and produce the same phytochemical profile you’ve become accustomed to under an HID light environment?\nOne strategy to combat the change in metabolic activity is to increase the air temperature. If the plant isn’t going to receive radiant heat from the lamps, they can still receive convective heat from the air. It doesn’t take much to facilitate heat transfer from the air to the leaf — just 1-3 degrees Fahrenheit higher air temperature than leaf temperature.\nBy increasing the air temperature, you can further reduce the HVAC cooling requirements, though you may still need to dehumidify at a relatively high rate because plants transpire harder under higher temperatures. One potential drawback, if you use the same HVAC equipment under this new light condition, is that it could be too large for the needs. This could cause it to cycle on and off more frequently, increasing the risk of frozen cooling coils and shifting the equipment’s balance from heat to moisture, a condition most HVAC units aren’t adept to handle.\nUltimately, every environmental setpoint you target — light level, VPD, CO2, etc. — affects how the plant responds to other environmental factors in the production space. By understanding these plant-environment interactions, growers can make better decisions about how to manage their crop from seed (or clone) to flower, including what equipment to use, what environmental levels to target and when, and ultimately how to maximize yield and quality by managing resource inputs and minimizing waste.\nIf you are thinking about switching to LED lamps, be patient and recognize that everything you’ve known about growing a crop under HID lighting could change dramatically. But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth it. If you can discover the new balance between environmental factors, crop management strategies and technologies, LED lamps could be one solution to a profitable and more sustainable future.\nNadia Sabeh is the president and founder of Dr. Greenhouse (www.doctorgreenhouse.com), an engineering consulting firm focused on designing HVAC systems for indoor farms.

{"question":"How does Japan's custody law impact children after divorce, and what environmental health risks do these children face if relocated to e-waste processing areas?","answer":"In Japan, custody after divorce is typically given to the parent who has physical possession of the children at the time, as Japan does not recognize joint custody. This leads to an estimated 150,000 children losing contact with one parent annually, with about 66% of children not seeing their non-custodial parent after divorce. The Japanese court system lacks power to enforce access rights, even when court rulings grant them. If children are relocated to areas with e-waste processing, they face significant health risks. Research shows exposure to e-waste can lead to various health issues, particularly in children. Studies have found evidence of heavy metals in children's blood and developmental effects. For instance, lead exposure from e-waste recycling has been associated with child temperament alterations, and there is evidence of toxic pollutants in umbilical cord blood of newborns in e-waste recycling areas.","context":["Journalist, newspaper Helsingin Sanomat | World news\n(Japan) Thousands of children are taken out of reach of their other parent each year in Japan. Tapio Tarvas lost contact with his daughter. Jeffery Morehouse, an American, did not get his son back even by court order.\nIn 2008, Tapio Tarvas was waiting for his Japanese spouse and their baby to return to Finland. After weeks of silence, Tarvas received a message: she would stay with their daughter in Japan. Permanently.\n\"My ex-wife said she might come when the child was four or five. It was a mental breakdown for me.\" Tarvas only met his daughter again when she was 8 years old.\nAccording to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child should have contact with both parents after separation, unless it is harmful to the child.\nHowever, in the case of Mr. Tarvas and thousands of Japanese couples, this agreement is not being honored. In Japan, it is estimated that more than 100,000 children lose contact with one of their parents every year.\nThere are also shortcomings in their implementation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which Japan ratified in 2014. For example, the United States has repeatedly found Japan in breach of the Hague Abduction Convention.\nJohn Gomez, president of the Kizuna Child-Parent Reunion Organization in Japan, has been helping parents who have lost contact with their children for 12 years.\nHe says the problem lies at the heart of Japanese law. Japan is the only G7 country and, with Turkey, the only OECD country that does not recognize joint custody after divorce.\n\"In Japanese family law, custody is in practice always given to the parent who has the children at the time.\"\nIn Japan, it is not a crime to take a child away from one parent in secret, although in many other countries it is defined as child abduction. On the contrary, the person who has possession of the child is in practice considered to be the guardian, even if the other parent has not agreed to part with the child.\nGomez stresses that, although the proportion of abductions is unknown, the system that allows the loss of access is a significant problem.\n\"I estimate that around 150,000 children lose contact with their other parent in Japan every year.\"\nMr. Gomez's calculation is based on divorce statistics from the Japan administration and surveys of divorced families by various agencies. They show that around 66% of children do not see a non-custodial parent after divorce.\nThis was also stated by Yuko Nishitani, Professor of International Law at Kyoto University, and Noriko Odagiri, Professor of Clinical Psychology at Tokyo International University, at a seminar of the German Institute for Japanese Studies in 2019.\nUS citizen John Gomez has been in contact with around 200 Japanese and foreign parents who have lost contact with their child. According to Mr. Gomez, the country's legislation and the loss of access comes as a surprise to many parents.\nTapio Tarvas was not familiar with Japan's family law and did not discuss custody issues with his father before the divorce.\n\"We were aware of the challenges, because when we had the child we didn't have a long relationship or a common culture.\"\nThe couple had met in Finland a few years before the birth of the child, and married after finding out about the pregnancy.\nThey had planned to live together in Finland, but the mother wanted the child to be born in Japan. The couple returned to Finland together with their newborn.\nWhen they soon travelled to Japan again at his then wife’s request, Tarvas flew home before his family for an entrance exam.\nAfter their child's mother informed him that she was staying in Japan with the child, Tarvas was not able to reach her. He received help from Kaapatut Lapset Ry, the Finnish organization that helps parents and children in abduction cases and other similar cases. Kaapatut Lapset Ry contacted the correct authority, Consular Affairs Unit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\"The unit was able to contact the mother of my daughter through the Japanese consulate.\"\nEventually, Tarvas went to Japan to meet his child with his own mother. Contrary to his expectations, they were able to arrange a meeting, and some sort of connection was established. The daughter visited Finland twice before the coronavirus pandemic.\nHowever, contact has been intermittent. She is now thirteen and, contrary to his wishes, her father rarely hears from her.\n\"Tears come to my eyes every time I think of her.\"\nTarvas has not sought access to justice. The process would be long and the outcome uncertain.\nFor US citizen Jeffery Morehouse, even the Japanese court's decision didn't bring a child back, after his Japanese ex-spouse abducted his six-year-old son from the US to Japan in 2010.\nBefore the parents separated, the family had problems that left Morehouse with custody of the boy.\n\"She was still allowed to see our son, but the court order would have prevented her from holding his passport or travelling with him out of state,\" says Jeffery Morehouse of his status with his Japanese ex-wife.\nOn US Father's Day, 20 June 2010, Morehouse took his son to visit the mother by appointment,\n\"It was the last time I ever saw him.\"\nAccording to Morehouse, the mother had obtained a passport for the child from the Japanese consulate in another state and disappeared with the boy to her home country.\nIn Japan, the mother sought custody of the boy in court. The court rejected Morehouse's ex-wife's claims for legal custody in 2014 and physical custody in 2017.\n\"However, the court ruled that because the mother has visitation rights, the situation where our son remains held by his mother was left intact,\" says Morehouse.\nJohn Gomez, chairman of the Kizuna organization, says he knows of many other cases where a Japanese court ruling does not ultimately lead to the children being reunited or returned.\nThe courts have no power to enforce the right of access.\nThe European Parliament accused Japan of breaching international treaties in a resolution in July 2020, which was worked on by four organizations from different linguistic areas of the EU that assist in child abduction cases.\nBjörn Echternach from Germany was also involved. He says his wife abducted the couple's two sons to Japan in 2017.\nAccording to Mr. Echternach, the children were ordered to be returned from Japan in September 2018. It was the first Hague Convention return order for children from an EU country. Despite this, Mr. Echternach has not seen his children for four and a half years.\n\"I don't even know if they are alive,\" says Echternach.\nTarvas, Morehouse and Echternach all speak of the ongoing trauma of losing contact. They are reminded of their child from various everyday things, which provokes a strong emotional reaction.\nAbove all, however, they stress the consequences of separation for the child.\n\"There is a huge body of research evidence that it is better for the child to have contact with both parents,\" says Echternach.\nIn Japan, this is beginning to be recognized, although it is being achieved in very small steps, says Kyosuke Morimoto. He is an IT professional who, through divorce and custody disputes, has become a volunteer helping broken families.\nMorimoto recognizes the problems in the system and the need for change.\n\"In Japan, it is very easy to end up in a destructive divorce,\" says Morimoto.\nHe highlights the underlying factors: the movement for gender equality has not progressed in the same way as in the West, and there is a fear of losing face.\n\"In Japan, the man is still seen as the breadwinner and the woman as the caretaker of the home and children. Many also hold on to marriages for a long time because they are afraid of what divorce would look like in the eyes of others.\"\nAccording to Morimoto, the idea of a father longing for his children is still relatively new in Japan. Joint custody has partly turned into a men's rights issue, driven by conservative parties.\n\"The only party that has put joint custody on its pamphlet is controversially the conservative party Japan Innovation Party [Nippon Ishin no Kai],\" says Morimoto.\nOn the other hand, liberals and feminists have opposed shared custody, citing intimate partner violence.\n\"Some opponents of shared custody lump together all parents who have lost contact with their children into one violent group,\" says Morimoto.\nA system for assessing incidents of domestic violence is completely lacking in Japan, said Professor Noriko Odagiri in the Washington Post.\nMorimoto himself was constantly at work and otherwise away from home during his marriage. In the end, his wife took their two children to a new home without his knowledge.\nThe legal proceedings over custody were long and contentious, and also affected the children, whom Morimoto was allowed to see once a month.\nAfter six years, however, the daughter has a room in both parents' homes and relations with the son have also improved.\n\"Even in this old-fashioned and divisive system, my ex-wife and I were finally able to come to an agreement.\"\nMorimoto believes progress is possible but slow.\nFor international child abduction cases to Japan a total of 425 Hague Abduction Convention applications were filed with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs between 2014 and 2020: 271 return applications and 154 applications for access rights. The Finnish Central Authority, Ministry of Justice, is aware of one application for access rights under the Hague Abduction Convention, which was later withdrawn.\nThe Organization for Abducted Children has four cases from 2013-2021 where a Finnish parent was denied access to a child who had been taken to or left behind in Japan.\nThe organization Japan Child Abduction, represented by Björn Echternach, represents 9 parents in German-speaking countries in Europe who have lost or fear losing contact with a total of 11 children.\nThe US Department of State reports several child abductions to Japan each year.\nFrom the annual reports mentioned above, the US-based organization Bring Abducted Children Home has counted around 60 child abduction cases to Japan since 2014.\nThe same reports indicate that in 2020, a total of 68 abduction cases marked as \"resolved\" in Japan were not returned.\nIn total, more than 470 children have been abducted from the US to Japan, according to Bring Abducted Children Home based on US Government data.\nAccording to the organizations, many cases are also not included in the statistics, for example, because of Japan settlement decisions, children coming of age and informal settlements between parents.\n► Sources.

This has led to large quantities of electronic products discarded as electronic waste (e-waste), creating enormous environmental health challenges impacting the management of the product life cycle (PLC) of the global product chain for manufactured electronics. The environmental health impacts of e-wastes vary widely across geography. Major contributors of e-waste production as well as major e-waste importing countries are identified in this study. The “Chemicals in Products (CiP)”, their fate and distribution in the environment, based on the local geology of the land use, and toxicological effects in the human body upon exposure, are investigated. The study outcomes present the need for recommended actions and prospective solutions for mitigating the associated hazards from CiP and the risks of potential adverse effects to humans and the environment. Effective handling and PLC management of e-waste can be achieved through proper implementation, permeable reactive barriers use in incinerators, oil-water solvent systems for contaminant removal and revision of existing regulations. These recommendations will help protect the health of children and adults in susceptible areas and improve electronic products management and environmental sustainability.\nElectronic Waste, Heavy Metals, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Contamination, Exposure, Toxicology, Remediation\nUnited States Census Bureau - USCB (2017).

{"question":"What are the standard methods for obtaining building regulation approval, and what additional safety considerations must be addressed in high-rise construction projects?","answer":"Building regulation approval can be obtained through either a building notice or full plans application. A building notice is quicker but doesn't require detailed drawings, while full plans applications need comprehensive documentation. When working on high-rise buildings, additional safety measures are essential. These include installing catch-fences or windscreens around the roof perimeter to prevent debris from falling, monitoring wind speeds which can be 10-50 mph higher on the roof than ground level, shutting off fresh air intakes to prevent fume transfer, and ensuring crews are trained in first aid and CPR due to potentially delayed emergency response times. Workers must also be familiar with building evacuation plans and available fire exits.","context":["What documents are required for a planning application?\nWhat Does a Planning Application Include?\n- five copies of application forms.\n- the signed ownership certificate.\n- a site plan, block plan, elevations of both the existing and proposed sites,\n- a Design and Access Statement.\n- the correct fee.\nWhat plans are required for a planning application?\nMost planning applications need you to submit two plans as supporting documents: a location plan, which shows the site and the surrounding area, and a site plan, which shows the proposed development in detail. You can buy both online from one of the Planning Portal's accredited suppliers, listed here.\nWhat happens if you lie on a planning application?\nIf a planning permission is fraudulently obtained no doubt that renders it liable to be revoked. If you have not already done so, you should notify the planning department in writing. You should also find out the names of the councillors on the planning committee and send a copy of the letter to each one.\nCan granted planning permission be revoked?\nOnly the applicant can make an appeal against a granted planning application. ... This means you cannot appeal a planning application decision which you have not submitted yourself.\nCan I do my own planning drawings?\nYou can do your own plans. They don't have to be too fancy for something like a garage, but they do need to have all the important information on them. (Address, name, dimensions, materials etc.)30 มี.ค. 2548\nCan I draw my own plans for building regs?\nYou have to apply for building regs before you start building and you can do one of the following. A building notice can be submitted by your builder but does not involve any working/detailed drawings. ... The other alternative is to have an architectural technician to submit drawings under a full plan application.\nDo I need Building Regs for an extension?\nIf you're planning to extend your home, you will need to comply with the building regulations. This is a legal requirement and, without formal approval and control, your local council could force you open up or re-build sometimes significant aspects of the project. It could even lead to prosecution and unlimited fines.\nDo you get a certificate for building regs?\nThere aren't any building regulations certificates from when we moved in. ... Building regulation requirements do change over the course of the years and with works that were carried out a long time ago, say 20 years, you often find completion certificates were not even issued at that time.\nHow do I apply for building regs?\nFollow these five steps to building regulations approval and getting that all important completion certificate.\n- Choose a building control surveyor. ...\n- Submit your building regulations application. ...\n- Get to work. ...\n- The building control surveyor visit. ...\n- Further information.\nHow much do building regs cost UK?\nHow much does building regulation approval cost? This can vary according to local authority fee rates and the nature of the work undertaken, but as a rule of thumb most conversion, renovation or extension work will cost around £100 to submit full plans and a further £200-400 for inspections.\nHow long do building regs take?\nCan I get building regs after work is done?\nCan I obtain retrospective approval for building work carried out without notification? Yes. The Building Regulations allow you to \"regularise\" unauthorised building work that has begun since 11 November 1985.\nWhat happens after planning permission is granted?\nThe authority grants/refuses planning permission by sending you a letter notifying you of its decision. Planning permission runs with the land. This means that land or buildings can usually be sold or let with the benefit of planning permission.\nDo I need building notice or full plans?\nYou can apply for building regulations approval from your local authority building control service by giving a building notice. Plans are not required with this process so it's quicker and less detailed than the full plans application.\nDo I need Building Control drawings?\nUnlike the Full Plans process, detailed drawings are not always required.

It’s not the actual roofing trade work that’s challenging – it’s project coordination.\nThe quality and thoroughness of project planning often determines the success of the re-roof project. A lot of information must be collected upfront. Facilities professionals should be ready to discuss building access, security, work restrictions, and parking with the selected roofing contractor before the project scope is even defined.\nHere are some factors you should take into consideration if you’re thinking about a re-roof for your high-rise building…\nStart with Communication\nConsulting with the city on details such noise ordinance is a necessity. Requirements change from city to city, but permits are usually required for parking, blocking a sidewalk, use of a crane, or street shutdown. If traffic is going to be obstructed, a permit is also needed to reroute vehicles.\nIt’s also a good idea to alert the local fire chief in advance of the project in case any emergencies or injuries were to occur laborers on the roof or to people walking along the building perimeter.\nAdditionally, if you’ve leased space to cellular companies, be ready to involve them very early on in the project – they will typically be the ones responsible for lifting and moving cell towers.\nCrew Size, Hours, and Speed\nIn hotel or multifamily towers, roofing crews will most likely need to start working later in the day to avoid disturbances. In an office building, a re-roof project might require nighttime work in order to be less disruptive. Beyond being less of a distraction for daytime tenants, traffic is also less, which makes it easier to block roadways for loading or unloading. The availability of parking spaces for laborers is less of an issue, as is the risk of heat-related illness for laborers.\nEvening work, however, requires extensive pre-planning meetings, along with development of a detailed project and communication plan between the facilities manager and roofing contractor. It also requires bright lights that, along with noise, could be offensive to occupants in neighboring buildings. The lighting also results in shadows that can compromise work quality and create a safety hazard for laborers. Additionally, project coordination is critical because workers typically can’t purchase additional supplies or equipment during evening hours.\nThe quicker your roofing contractor can complete the work, the better (for all involved parties). It may be possible to increase crew size if:\n- Crews can work in shifts. One crew can complete noisy tasks at night, and another can do quieter detail work during the day.\n- You have more than one roof area. Multiple crews can work simultaneously.\n- Access is challenging. A roofing contractor may use an additional crew on the job just for support.\nTear-Off and Loading\nDisposing of tear-off and staging and loading materials pose a greater logistical challenge in a metropolitan environment. If street closure is necessary to accomplish this, your contractor will usually subcontract out traffic control to set up necessary detour signs for vehicle rerouting. Job-site postings must be of specific reflective materials and dimensions, so typical postings won’t meet code requirements. How and where they are displayed must be in compliance to minimize exposure to property loss and personal injury claims.\nCrews may want to use space within a parking garage or designated loading zone, or along the building perimeter, for staging materials. Which space they use will depend on access and, in some situations, what neighboring property owners will allow. If using a parking garage, smaller trucks must be utilized to clear the eight-foot headway limit.\nIf space is limited, phased material deliveries will cut down on the amount of ground staging area square footage required. Overloading the roof with materials is usually not feasible because of roof congestion and the higher risk of materials becoming loose and airborne.\nPhased deliveries will require extra crane mobilizations unless the crane is brought in and left erected, and then the operator and rigger are scheduled as needed.\nBecause high-rises don’t usually have a large roof area and loading materials is a logistic challenge, careful planning is necessary to order the right amount of materials and use them entirely so crews don’t have to transport them up and down.\nMoving materials either from the roof (i.e. tear-off of an existing roof system) or to the roof (i.e. the new roof system and equipment) can be done any number of ways.\nRoofing crews can take debris down in a freight elevator and go through a lower-level interior space to dump it. While this may seem like the most economical option, man hours really add up because of how labor-intensive the process can be. When bringing new materials up to the roof via a freight elevator, crews may have to access interior space again if the elevator stops a floor below and doesn’t go all the way to the roof.\nAnother option is a helicopter or sky crane. Your roofing contractor will subcontract helicopter lifting with a company experienced in the process. Careful planning is required so that a helicopter with proper lifting capacity is used for the load weight and size of the roofing materials. Weather limitations will require flexible scheduling.\nHelicopter lifting presents many safety hazards (high winds from aircraft rotors can turn dust and debris into airborne projectiles). Street shutdown may also be necessary to protect the people and property below.\nCranes (either mobile or tower) are the most typical way to transport materials to and from the roof. Set up time will be lengthy, though.\nWhen disposing of the existing roof system, a tear-off tarp can be used. These have corner straps that are sewn in and hook to the headache ball. They encapsulate debris and are lightweight; when not in use, they can be folded up for storage. Skip boxes can also transport debris from the roof to the ground using a crane, but they require more space for storage.\nUnless your facility is a historic building, the best option to move materials may be via a construction elevator, which is set up on the outside of the building. It too has a slow set-up, but is the least disruptive option for building occupants.\nWhen it comes to disposal of roof tear-off, a chute is the least expensive option – but it requires quite a bit of labor for installation, maintenance, and tear-down. For a multistory chute, debris is brought down a freight elevator, and then disposed of through a lower-story window. A crane is necessary only during chute set-up and tear-down.\nUnless the roofing contractor subcontracts the construction of a stair tower platform or construction elevator, their crews will be using the building interior for roof-to-ground egress. Finishes should be protected from potential damage, with plastic covering cover carpet, elevators, etc.\nSecurity is another consideration. Additional guards may be required if roofing crews need entry through multiple locked doors, stairwells, and elevators, or if exterior doors need to be kept open as roofing crews load and unload materials. Work with your roofing contractor to decide if they should hire security personnel to accompany crew members, or if you should alert your own security team that additional resources will be necessary.\nProviding advance notice to building security is also required, especially if the roofing crew will be working evenings and weekends, and require access when security staffing is normally light. Special security badges, keys, codes, etc. may also be necessary.\nHigh-rise roofing projects pose unique safety risks that must be addressed. Falling or airborne debris is especially hazardous. The roofing contractor’s project manager should have designated laborers whose sole responsibility encompasses waste management. An intense housekeeping plan must be developed and executed with vigilance. Make sure the roofing contractor you hire has stringent safety policies and enforcement procedures; you can review their safety record for validation.\nCatch-fence or windscreen erected around the roof’s perimeter will assist in keeping lightweight material and debris from being blown over the edge. A scaffold tunnel in front of the building can cover the sidewalk to protect pedestrians from debris and/or tools and equipment being knocked over the edge.\nHigh winds are one element of weather that make it unsafe for the roofing crew (and anyone below or in neighboring buildings). The wind speed may be 10 to 50 mph higher on the roof than the ground. Material piles placed on the roof have to be maintained constantly to ensure that the tarps are secure. Hardhats may also be blown over the edge.\nCranes are equipped with wind meters; whenever necessary, the project will be halted to protect workers. Crews can also carry hand-held wind meters or use weather apps on their smart-phones to assist in wind-speed monitoring. High winds can result in unplanned shutdowns; in these cases, precautions need to be taken so the roof is not left exposed to the elements.\nFresh air intakes should be shut off to avoid fumes from roofing adhesives being transferred inside the building.\nAs with all roofing projects, the contractor’s crew should know which fire exits are available for their use. They should also be familiar with the building’s evacuation plan in case of emergency. Because it may take longer for emergency personnel to respond to a worker who is severely injured on the roof, or falls and is restrained by a fall protection harness, workers should also be trained to administer first aid and CPR, and rescue fellow crew members.\nA roofing contractor with experience working on tall, metropolitan buildings is already aware of these challenges; they can be accounted for in advance with proper planning and execution. Safety and crew capacity are equally important criteria on re-roof projects. The right roofing contractor will help you avoid the pitfalls of poor project planning."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9099cf4a-8c9e-41da-9197-171c558555c7>","<urn:uuid:e93a80d1-d174-4f0d-abe4-ff2d0efdc7f3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which fertilizer es mejor for indoor plants: 7-7-7 or 8-8-8, and why?","answer":"For indoor plants, both 7-7-7 and 8-8-8 can be appropriate, but they serve slightly different purposes. 7-7-7 fertilizer (like African Violet Plant Food) is formulated with micronutrients in addition to the main nutrients, making it particularly suitable for houseplants that need trace elements like iron and copper. 8-8-8 fertilizer is gentle enough to avoid over-fertilizing when used with rich potting soil and helps maintain steady nutrition for strong roots and healthy foliage. However, for flowering indoor plants like African violets, neither is ideal - these plants do better with a 7-9-5 NPK ratio that provides more phosphorus for flower formation.","context":["Most houseplants resume growth in March.

Balanced formula with micronutrients\nFor potted plants we use fertilizer that contains micronutrients\nas well as the big three elements -- \"trace\" elements such as iron\nand copper as well as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Read the\nfertilizer label to learn if it contains not only the big three but\nthe others, too. Some organic fish- or seaweed products are good.\n7-7-7 African Violet Plant Food and Miracle Grow for\nAcid Loving Plants fit the bill, too. (Even though fertilizer\nis not \"food.\" It's more like vitamins. Only the plant can\nmake its food -- sugars and carbs from sun, water and air.)\nBelow: 7-7-7 means 7% each of the big three nutrients\nnitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.","When a “balanced” fertilizer is recommended to you, that could mean any number of NPK options, depending on soil conditions and the specific needs of your plants. But, when is it best to use lower nutrient percentages, such as in an 8-8-8 fertilizer?\nWith just 8% each of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, this NPK can be used for a wide variety of applications. Lawns, vegetables, evergreens, and ornamentals can all benefit from it.\nThe sum of an 8-8-8 ratio can be achieved most accurately by simply purchasing a ready-made fertilizer labeled as such. Alternatively, you can organic materials such as well-aged compost that also contain valuable macronutrients.\nWhen combined with elements like bone meal, cottonseed meal, and manure, a triple 8 NPK can be easily reached. Which will not only provide extra nutrients to your plants but increase soil fertility, as well.\n- Understanding 8-8-8 Fertilizer Labels?\n- What is Triple 8 Fertilizer Used For?\n- Fertilizer Type\n- How and When to Use Triple 8 Fertilizer\n- 8-8-8 Fertilizer FAQ’s\nUnderstanding 8-8-8 Fertilizer Labels?\nWith so many options to choose from, determining if a triple 8 fertilizer is the best one for you may seem a little discouraging. Especially when all you want to do is to grow healthy plants.\nNo worries! You can easily match a fertilizer to your plant goals by understanding the fertilizer labels.\nMost fertilizers state their NPK ratio right on the label. On the back of the container should be an ingredients list. This reveals all the ingredients in that product starting with NPK content (macronutrients), then all secondary micronutrients, closely followed by trace elements and any included fillers.\nSo, what exactly is an NPK ratio?\nAn NPK ratio is a three-numbered formula that indicates a fertilizer’s proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.\nFor example, an 16-16-16 fertilizer NPK has 16% nitrogen, 16% phosphorus and 16% potassium. Every plant requires these three elements in order to thrive. Just in different proportions or NPK ratios.\nEach of these macronutrients plays a unique and vital role in plant cell formation, photosynthesis, and flower production.\nNitrogen plays a key role in encouraging the growth of healthy, green foliage, by fueling the production of chlorophyll. Which ensures that photosynthesized energy is available for plants to create their own food.\nNitrogen also fuels the proteins and enzymes responsible for regulating water and nutrient uptake and disbursement.\nPhosphorus is a major contributor to photosynthesis, focusing on flower and fruit production, rather than foliage. Triggering captured energy to convert starches and carbohydrates into food.\nAt the cellular level, phosphorus contributes to the construction of those same proteins and enzymes that nitrogen uses to regulate water and nutrients.\nPotassium circulates water, nutrients, and photosynthesized food throughout your plants. It also triggers proteins and enzymes, formed by phosphorus to build healthy plant structures.\nPotassium increases disease resistance and protection against environmental stresses by managing moisture conservation. And is especially effective in encouraging large, well-formed fruit on vining crops.\nWhat is Triple 8 Fertilizer Used For?\nA triple 8 fertilizer’s intended use is to increase plant success, while not overwhelming them. This would also apply to houseplants.\nIf you regularly add well-aged, nutrient-rich compost or manure to your topsoil, 8-8-8 fertilizer will help maintain a steady flow of nutrients to whatever is planted in it.\nA triple 8 NPK will encourage vibrant foliage for optimum photosynthesis on ornamentals and vegetables. While providing maximum support for flower and fruit formation. Although, many fruiting plants may need more phosphorus and potassium, once buds are set.\nWhy Use a Balanced Fertilizer?\nIndoor and outdoor plants will often require more of one macronutrient than another and at different times. When planted in poor soil, a balanced fertilizer can provide even nutrient availability that promotes healthy growth.\nA balanced, 8-8-8 fertilizer can also offset the leaching of vital nutrients from the soil (in potted plants) that can otherwise be a consequence of frequent watering. An equal NPK will keep the growing medium fertile enough to keep them happy.\n8-8-8 vs 10-10-10 Fertilizer\nThere’s only a 2% difference between a triple 10 and a triple 8 fertilizer. But, in small gardens, it’s important to note that a 10-10-10 fertilizer may actually be too high, especially in fertile soil. 2% can make all the difference between adequately supplementing nutrients and over-feeding.\nThere are four different application methods available to make nourishing your plants and soil easier.\n- Quick Release – liquid or water-soluble options provide immediate nutrient delivery. Offering accelerated, visible improvement for plants growing in poor soil.\n- Slow-Release – granules and spikes offer a steady stream of nutrients over an extended period of time, with fewer applications.\n- Organic – made from natural materials like well-rotted plant material and animal bi-products that, when combined, meet the NPK needs of most plants.\n- Inorganic – manufactured with synthetic chemicals. These can result in a higher yield, but can also potentially contaminate soil and nearby water sources.\nConcentrates, when mixed with water, help keep soil pH balanced and are often formulated as foliar sprays to combat deficiencies in leaves.\nPremixed options are available, as well. But, maybe higher in price. Caution is recommended, as liquid over-feeding is common and could lead to root burn.\nWater Soluble Powder\nPowder fertilizers can be applied directly to the soil around plants or diluted in water as a “tea”.\nPowders are also some of the most economical and have a virtually indefinite shelf life. But, they do carry a risk of root burn, if manufacturer instructions aren’t followed.\nConcentrated granules can provide consistent nourishment for up to nine months, with results showing in just a couple of weeks.\nThey’re less likely to cause root burn and are considered eco-friendly. Since no watering is needed to activate and is less likely to contaminate nearby surface or groundwater.\nSpikes are really convenient to use, especially if you have a substantial container garden. Pre-measured in various sizes, they’re easy to push into loamy soil.\nNutrients are slowly released by microorganisms in the soil and carry the added benefit of stimulating an increased resistance to disease and pests.\nHow and When to Use Triple 8 Fertilizer\nA triple 8 fertilizer can be applied as a liquid or by working slow-release granules into the soil.\nWhen planting saplings in nutrient-weak soil, a handful of 8-8-8 granules, in the hole prior to planting, will help them establish more quickly and the gentle formula will diminish the risk of root burn.\nWorking granules into the top few inches of soil in borders, or applying a water-soluble option, will provide plants with a great start.\nWith vegetables, applying a triple 8 NPK just after transplanting will contribute to an abundant harvest. When followed-up with an NPK higher in phosphorus and potassium, once buds set.\nTrees and Shrubs\nNew, perennial trees and shrubs produce robust root systems, vibrant color and size faster with a triple 8 fertilizer in the 3rd and 4th month after planting. Once established, these typically don’t require any further fertilizing. If symptoms occur, a quality soil test should reveal any deficiencies.\nCitrus and Fruit Trees\nCitrus and fruit tree fertilizers typically contain more phosphorus and potassium to help with flower and bud production and disease resistance. While triple 8 may be fine for young saplings and feeding at the start of the growing season, it is best to switch to high potassium fertilizer or high phosphorus fertilizer as the season progresses.\nBut, if you’re planting in poor soil, dry 8-8-8 fertilizer granules in the planting hole, in spring, will encourage faster establishment.\nOrnamentals need consistent nutrition to produce lots of summer color. A triple 8 NPK can ensure this and help accelerate maturity in annuals for a longer bloom time.\nInfertile soil, a slightly watered-down dose of 8-8-8 fertilizer will better support healthy plants without the risk of overfeeding them.\nGreen, leafy veggies thrive when side-dressed with a triple 8 NPK. Tomatoes, squash, and melons, though, require more phosphorus and potassium once buds are set.\nIf you’re starting with poor soil, a higher, balanced NPK after transplanting will create a healthy growing medium for the first couple of months.\nIs 8-8-8 Good for Tomatoes\nIn poor soil, an 8-8-8 fertilizer will provide a healthy growing environment that will encourage a robust root system and vibrant foliage. After which, a 5-10-10 fertilizer would be more appropriate.\nIf the use of a triple 8 NPK is continued, you’ll have more foliage than tomatoes.\nHouseplants require balanced nutrients for strong roots and healthy foliage. In rich potting soil, 8-8-8 fertilizer will support that without over-fertilizing. If your potting soil needs a boost, a 10-10-10 NPK would be more appropriate.\nHowever, indoor bloomers like African violets, need more phosphorus to form flowers. These do well with a 7-9-5 NPK.\nLawn and Grass\nLawns and native grasses need phosphorus to grow thick and lush. Yet, relying on high nitrogen fertilizers to maintain a tough, vibrant structure.\nIf a soil test has revealed nitrogen-rich soil beneath your grass, an 8-8-8 fertilizer would provide just enough nitrogen for a healthy lawn."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d88e1ed4-bcd6-4e37-ae93-5c6095227dd1>","<urn:uuid:45a05270-c548-4436-9986-5f5e9b725432>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do weather conditions play in greenhouse design, and what heating system solutions are recommended for different climates?","answer":"Weather conditions significantly impact greenhouse design - local factors like wind, hail, snow, and rain must be considered. In northern states with less winter sunshine and high snowfall, electrical lighting and heating systems are necessary. The heating system choice depends on efficiency needs - options include high-efficiency heaters or boilers (90% efficiency with natural gas or propane), biomass boilers (1/4 to 1/2 the cost of fossil fuel), shell corn heaters, and solar systems. Electronic controllers with +/-1°F accuracy can help manage these systems, potentially saving 500 gallons of fuel oil yearly in a 30' x 100' greenhouse.","context":["How to Build a Greenhouse – Designs, Planning and Material\nYou will have to plan carefully before you buy or build a greenhouse of your own. There are several things to consider when building your dream greenhouse. You can save a lot of time and energy by planning ahead. You will need an array of factors all working together to have the right greenhouse system, including an advanced lighting system depending on how much light you do or do not want into your new structure.\nGreenhouses come in a wide variety of styles and sizes. You can find premade greenhouses that will give you all the options you can think of, including a variety of designs, sizes and prices to best accommodate your budget. You can find an array of different materials, including plastic, polycarbonates, glass, partial wood, aluminum and more that makes up your greenhouse. If you build your own, you can find even more materials that you can use.\nYou will find similar issues if you buy or if you build a premade greenhouse. You will have to solve some questions on your greenhouse.\nYou will have to figure out what kind of foundation you want, including no foundation at all. Most times, however, your foundation will be either gravel, wood or cement. You can even find brick foundations. You will have to decide whether or not you want to cover your foundation with linoleum, tile or carpet on top of that, depending on your preference and where you live. You can also find floor heating systems that will keep your floors comfortable in the winter months. These systems, however, will take time to clean and investment funds.\nDepending on where you live, you will have to see what kinds of trees are around you and how many trees there are. This will influence how many hours of direct sunshine you get. You will have to learn your own local environment as well, to accommodate around wind, hail, snow and rain. You will need to ensure that your greenhouse can withstand your own elements.\nDepending on your geographic location, you will find greenhouses that can best accommodate your surroundings. In the northern states, you will see less sunshine in the winter months and have to deal with a high amount of snow, but you can find greenhouses that will help you around these factors, including electrical lighting and heating systems to protect your plants and flowers.\nThe amount of heat and moisture in the area will also affect your plants. Summers can be more dry in some areas of the country than in others, so these dry areas will need more water than more lush areas like the Northeast New Hampshire area.\nYou will need to also make sure that the size of your greenhouse matches the size of your property. You will need a flat area ideal for your greenhouse. You also don’t want an area that has too much wind or too many trees if you want more sun in your greenhouse. You can find trees that will block rainfall and the sunshine so depending on what you wan to do with your greenhouse, you will have to look out for these things on your own property.","Increasing energy costs make conservation and efficient use of facilities an important part of today's greenhouse operation New greenhouse designs better glazing improved heating and ventilating equipment and new management systems should be included when upgrading or adding on. With typical annual energy usage being 75% for heating, 15% for electricity and 10% for vehicles, efforts and resources should be put where the greatest savings can he realized.\nReduce Air Leaks\nThis is a good starting point as infiltration losses can be significant and are easy to fix at low cost. Infiltration losses double at wind speeds of 15 mph.\n- Weatherstrip doors, vents and fan openings. Close gap around stovepipe penetration.\n- Lubricate fan shutters frequently so that they close tight. A partially open louver may allow several air changes per hour. For example, a 48\" fan louver that fails to close properly leaving 1\" gaps, allows 23,000 Btu/hr of heat to escape costing $0.58 if you are burning $2.50/gallon fuel oil. Shut off some fans during the winter and cover openings with insulation or plastic.\n- Use poly with an infrared inhibitor as the inner layer for 15% savings. Payback is 2-3 months.\nPayback on insulation is usually less than 2 years.\n- Insulate the perimeter below ground - Installing 1\"- 2\" thick insulation board to 2' below ground level will reduce the heat loss from the warm interior soil to the cold ground outside.\n- Insulate the kneewall or sidewall/endwall to bench height - Use 1\" to 2\" of insulation board. Applying 2\" of foam insulation to a 3' high kneewall on a 28' x 100' greenhouse will save about 400 gallons of fuel oil/year. Cost is about $1/sq ft with a payback of less than one heating season. An alternative is to use double bubble insulation with aluminum foil on both sides. The cost is about half as much but the life is also shorter.\n- Insulate behind sidewall heat pipes - Use insulation board or aluminum faced building paper to radiated heat back into the greenhouse. Leave an air space next to the wall to prevent frost damage to the wall.\n- Insulate hot water pipes - Adding 1\" insulation to heating system supply pipes or domestic hot water pipes will save $2 to $4/linear foot in smaller diameter pipes and more with large diameter pipes.\nEnergy Conserving Screen\nReduce the air volume heated and lower surface temperature.\n- Install an energy/shade screen overhead for 20%-50% heat savings. Cost is $1.50 -$3.00/sq ft. Payback is 1 -3 years. Add a second screen to save an additional 10 -15%. Screens trap the heat inside and reduce the heat loss surface area. Tight closures should be maintained where curtains meet sidewalls, framing or gutters. Use a closed weave material for maximum savings. Heat and water lines should be insulated or located below the screen. Systems are available for hoophouses that are heated all winter.\n- Add roll-up or drop down sidewall screens for additional savings. These can be either manual or mechanized.\nEfficient Heating System\n- Yearly maintenance - Check boiler, burner and backup systems to make sure they are operating at peak efficiency. Have furnaces cleaned and adjusted and an efficiency test run before heating season. A 2% increase in efficiency for a 30' x 150' greenhouse will save about 200 gallons of fuel oil.\n- Installation of root-zone heat will allow air temperature to be set 5° - 10°F lower with a savings of 10-15% in heat cost. Heat source can be a boiler or hot water heater. Provide about 25 Btu/sq ft of growing area with a water temperature of 90-110°F. Use PEX tubing spaced 9 - 12\" apart for in-floor installation. Low—output fin under the bench or EPDM tubing on the bench provide uniform temperature. Control is with a remote bulb sensor thermostat.\n- Install high-efficiency heaters or boilers — Condensing heaters and low mass, condensing boilers can provide 90%f efficiency with natural gas or propane fuel. Extra heat is removed reducing the flue gas temperature to less than 200°F, PVC pipe can be used as the flue.\n- Insulated water tank heat storage- This system works well with wood or coal fired boilers and solar systems. Hot water stored during the day is used to heat the greenhouse at night. A smaller boiler can be installed. Typical storage capacity is one gallon per 200-300 Btu/hr of boiler heat capacity. Tank capacities to 500,000 gallons are available.\n- Biomass boilers - On a million Btu basis, wood cost is ¼ to ½ the cost of fossil fuel. New technology and design have improved the efficiency of wood boilers. Wood gasification smoke control, automatic chip or pellet feed, electronic combustion control and safety controls have helped to meet EPA standards. Available in sizes from 200,000 - 10,000,000 Btu/hr.\n- Shell corn - Locally grown corn can he economical if cleaned and dried to less than 15% moisture content. One bushel has the heat equivalent of 2.9 gallons of fuel oil or 4.4 gallons of propane. Average crop yield is 120 - 160 bu/ac. Automatic feed and ash removal are part of most larger corn fired heaters.\n- Used motor or cooking oil - Quantities of these may be available locally at less than half the cost of fossil fuel. Time for collection, filtering and handling needs to be added. Sludge disposal can add to cost.\n- Solar - With state and federal grants, the new improved photovoltaic systems can have a reasonable payback and help to offset the cost of electricity. A good site with solar access is required. A tie to the utility grid will help to even out the load and offset some of the purchased power.\nElectronic controls provide greater accuracy and less override.\n- Install electronic controllers with a +/-1°F accuracy. Potential yearly savings of 500 gallons of fuel oil in a 30' x 100' greenhouse when changing from a mechanical to an electronic control. Controllers also integrate the heating and cooling systems, provide clay/night and DIF settings, record environmental data and provides an alarm system. Additional controllers for misting, irrigation, lighting and carbon dioxide control are available.\n- Check accuracy of thermostats and sensors - correcting a reading that is 2°F high will save $100-$200 per year.\n- Aspirate thermostats or sensors for more uniform temperature control. Differential between on and off can be reduced as much as 6°F.\n- Install horizontal air flow (HAF) fans to get more uniform temperature in the growing area. Use 1/15th horsepower, 12\" to 20\" diameter fans spaced 40' to 50' apart suspended overhead to create a horizontal air flow pattern in the greenhouse. Fans should operate continuously except when the exhaust ventilation system is on. HAF also reduces disease pressure by drying the leaf surfaces and increases carbon dioxide level next to the leaves.\nAdditional information can be found in Energy Conservation for Commercial Greenhouses — NRAES-3, 100 pages, available from CIT Resource Store, UConn. http://www.store.uconn.edu/\nJohn W.

The area is also home to various intertidal creatures and forage fish that are critical to the ecosystem's health. In the deep Atlantic waters, species such as spotted lanternfish, rakery beaconlamp, stout saw-palate, and scaly dragonfish are found at depths of up to 600m. These marine populations face severe threats from plastic pollution - a study found that 73% of deep-water fish had ingested microplastics, one of the highest reported frequencies worldwide. A single 4.5cm spotted lanternfish had 13 microplastics in its stomach.

Other sources may be waste water effluents carrying plastic fibres from clothing and microbeads from personal care products. Due to their low density, most of these microplastics float at the sea surface.\nAs part of the study the NUIG scientists participated in a transatlantic crossing onboard the marine institute’s Celtic Explorer vessel. During this research cruise they took dead deep-sea fish from midwater trawls such as the spotted lanternfish, rakery beaconlamp, stout saw-palate and scaly dragonfish.\nThe fish ranged in size from the smallest species the Glacier Lantern at 3.5cm to the largest species, the stout saw-palate at 59cm. Upon return to Galway the fish were inspected at the NUIG’s Ryan Institute for microplastics in their stomach contents.\nPhD candidate and lead author Alina Wieczorek said: “Deep-water fish migrate to the surface at night to feed on plankton [microscopic animals] and this is likely when they are exposed to the microplastics.”\nOne of the inspected spotted lanternfish, which was 4.5cm in size, had 13 microplastics extracted from its stomach contents. The identified microplastics were mostly fibres, commonly blue and black in colour.\nIn total, 233 fish were examined and 73 per cent had microplastics in their stomachs, “making it one of the highest reported frequencies of microplastic occurrence in fish worldwide”.\nPrevious studies have shown microplastics can be ingested by numerous marine animals from zooplankton to worms to fish. The ingestion of microplastics may cause internal physical damage, inflammation of intestines, reduced feeding and other effects.\nWhat is also of concern, Ms Wieczorek said, was that many of these ingested microplastics have associated additives, such as colourants and flame retardants that are added to plastics during production process, and/or pollutants that are adsorbed on to the microplastics from the sea.\n“There is now evidence that some of these toxins on the microplastics can be transferred to animals that eat them, with potential harmful effects.”\nCo-author Dr Tom Doyle of the Ryan institute at NUIG, said: “It’s worrying to think that our daily activities, such as washing our synthetic clothes in our washing machines, results in billions of microplastics entering our oceans through our waste water stream that may eventually end up in these deep sea fishes.”\nThe fish were sampled from “a warm core eddy”, which is a circular current in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Similar to what are known as ocean gyres, these currents are now thought to accumulate microplastics and that the sampled fish may have originated from a particularly polluted patch of the Atlantic.\nMs Wieczorek added: “This would explain why we recorded one of the highest abundances of microplastics in fishes so far, and we plan to further investigate the impacts of microplastics on organisms in the open ocean.”\nThe research was carried out within the Plastox project, a European collaborative effort to investigate impacts of microplastics in the marine environment under the JPI Oceans framework and supported by the iCRAG (Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geoscience) project, funded by Science Foundation Ireland.\nThe study can be read at: http://bit.ly/2EEmMHI\n—From Irish Times"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:501301c3-8f08-4804-804f-630e4b50ebe3>","<urn:uuid:ad1ddfe2-8df6-481d-85ab-dd274751df17>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which immersive digital art venue attracted more visitors in their first periods - the Atelier des Lumières in Paris with its Klimt and Van Gogh exhibition, or teamLab's digital museum in Tokyo?","answer":"TeamLab's digital museum in Tokyo attracted more visitors, with 2.3 million visitors in its first year when it opened in 2018. In comparison, the Atelier des Lumières in Paris welcomed 2.2 million people with its Klimt and Van Gogh exhibition over an eighteen-month period.","context":["Art exhibition: a new ambitious show\n4 Nov, 2019\nIncreasingly spectacular, art exhibition as we knew it has mutated profoundly. It is digitalized, interactive, offers ever more immersion and takes the “visitor” on board towards a denser, stronger experience, disturbing the senses. Turn on your projector, we’re taking you to the museum!\nImmersion may be trendy, but the idea is not new. As the director and RV specialist Pierre Friquet points out, the first immersive art experience dates back to the Paleolithic and cave paintings. The torches of our ancestors swept the walls and the painted animals seemed to come to life.\nMore than 30,000 years have passed and technological developments have taken us to another level. We no longer discover works with a torch but armed with a smartphone. And even though paintings continue to attract crowds, visitors became spectator-actors in the midst of floods of pixels and illuminations.\nWhen augmented reality tells more about the works… or hacks them!\nMuseums understood early on that digital technology would enable them to enrich the traditional circuit from room to room and seized the opportunities offered by digital tools.\nVisitors’ assistance, tailor-made tours via dedicated apps, augmented reality… have become essential. The works become interactive and thanks to augmented reality, sometimes it is enough to point your phone at a painting or sculpture to learn more about its history or its underside. Picking up your smartphone and discovering the inside of a mummy enriches the visit of all audiences.\nThe possibilities are endless, especially for those with a creative -or even dissident – soul. A collective created by eight artists has been using augmented reality since 2018 to superimpose its animated content on the works of art presented in the “Jackson Pollock” section at MoMA New York. This content is accessible via a mobile application called MoMAR. Their objective is to denounce the elitism of the galleries and give back an active role to the visitor. Virtual hacking, a space to conquer…\nDigital creation combined with technological developments makes it possible to offer ultra-immersive virtual experiences, starting with virtual reality.\nFor years, the VR Arles Festival, which takes place at the prestigious Rencontres photographiques, has invited visitors to immerse themselves in other worlds, virtual or not. Alongside short films anchored in our reality (reports or fictions), 100% digital creations are proposed. The essential RV helmet is sometimes accompanied by a connected vest that vibrates to the rhythm of creation, making the experience even stronger and more immersive. We know the power of these helmets, which literally deceive our brains and make us lose our bearings.\nThe possibilities are obviously infinite, the powers of creation being also in the hands of coders, developers, engineers…\nWhen pixels and programs replace paint\nBeyond the individual experience offered by RV headphones, digital works are displayed in large format and attract a growing audience. The Immersive Art Festival, dedicated to immersive digital design and offered by the essential Culturespaces, gave the public a chance to immerse themselves in the works of 11 artists’ collectives.\nThese creations of 4 minutes each, combining video, photo, motion design and sound spatialization, were tailor-made for the Atelier des Lumières. Broadcast thanks to 140 video projectors, 50 speakers, spread over 3,000 m2 of projected area, the 50-minute show is complete. Despite its price (26$), the festival largely found its audience who had the opportunity to vote for their favorite work.\nThese places of immersion in digital art are multiplying all over the world and the figures are dizzying. One of the latest born is in Tokyo. Launched in June 2018, the Mori Building Digital Art Museum is a 10,000m2 modern and interactive art gallery created by the teamLab collective. Composed of 40 artists with various profiles, engineers, designers, graphic designers, architects, or artists from the audiovisual world, teamLab has given birth to more than a hundred projects around the world since the year the collective was created. He performed in La Villette in 2018, bringing together 300,000 spectators.\nFrance is not to be outdone since in April 2020, Les Bassins de Lumières will open a new venue in Bordeaux, managed by Culturespaces. Located in one of the five underwater bases of the Kriegsmarine on the Atlantic, this remnant of the Second World War will become the largest immersive art venue in the world with its 14,500m2 of projection area and 350,000 visitors expected.\nThe visit is reinvited. Immersive creations are constantly in motion and interact with the gestures and movements of visitors, even integrating real-time contributions (drawings or other) made by the public.\nThe spaces can be walked around standing upright… but the lying position is not so unusual to admire the projections. Visitors no longer hesitate to touch the walls since the works are elsewhere! The organizers even provide cushions, balls and sometimes…. climbing walls as in Tokyo at the Mori Building Digital Art Museum!\nAll the traditional codes of the exhibition spaces are overturned and everyone is strongly encouraged to share their experience on Instagram.\nThe master canvases in Waow effect version\nThis movement also affects the most emblematic artists.\nVan Gogh, Klimt, Klee, Picasso… Their works are now projected into immense spaces and there are few detractors to challenge the legitimacy of such a staging. Today, these works are broadcast in large format, animated with music for ever greater emotion, and take on a new dimension.\nWe no longer extol the painter’s brushstroke, we no longer approach the canvas by scrutinizing the material. We can discuss zooms, animations that disturb the original work.\nBut the advantages of these exhibitions are numerous: after negotiations with the beneficiaries on cropping and other staging requests, there is no longer a need to be moving works worth several millions of euros around the world. These events can travel the world very easily and bring together a wide audience.\nInaugurated eighteen months ago in eastern Paris, L’Atelier des lumières welcomed 2.2 million people with its Klimt and Van Gogh event.\nIt is now in La Sucrière, in Lyon, that the new exhibition “Imagine Picasso” offers, without any painting or drawing, 200 works by Picasso projected not only on the walls, but also on the floor and inclined walls, incorporating the codes of digital arts that play on architecture.\nWelcoming instagrammers, a new type of visitors walking around with their smartphones and staging themselves in the middle of screenings.\nEven the Louvre, with its mega exhibition on Leonardo da Vinci’s work, is offering to rediscover the Mona Lisa in virtual reality in a dedicated room at the end of the journey, while it remains quietly in the room assigned to it in the Louvre.\nWith these new digital narratives, art and entertainment are now one. The field of play is huge and brands should soon take over…\nFrance TV Info","Digital art and curated art that is presented in digital media are nothing new. However, in recent times, both have been gaining more and more attention both within the art world and among the general public. A big driver behind this has been the socially distanced world that became such an abrupt reality early in 2020. However, blockbuster immersive digital exhibitions were already making headlines well before the world knew about Covid-19.\nSo, what is going on? Has the pandemic simply sped up the uptake of digital media to exhibit art or was the world already heading inexorably in this direction already? Naturally, different people will take differing views of this depending on their standpoint. Consequently, it will be worth looking back at some of the digital exhibitions which have been put on in recent years to see whether there are some discernible trends. Digital are shows have been around for some time but their immersive nature is what seems to be most striking of all given where the world is today as it attempts to vaccinate itself back to normality.\nThe current trend in digital art exhibitions is for more and more immersion into the art. Digital technologies can certainly offer this more experiential form of art consumption. Is the public no longer simply happy to view images or art? Have tastes changed to such a degree that art exhibitions of the future will need to put on more of a show? Of course, no one can say for sure what the post-pandemic art world will look like. That said, there are some tantalising insights that can be gleaned from the immersive digital art boom we have witnessed in the last year or so. Before looking a little closer at some of those, however, it will be worth turning the clock back a little further.\nCurated for an initial show at the Barbican Arts Centre in the City of London in 2014, Digital Revolution offered a glimpse of what immersive digital art might look like. Before moving on to Sweden, Greece, Turkey, China and Germany, this exhibition put digital technology at its core.\nBringing together digital art from as far back as the 1970s with architectural design, film making, video game graphics, digitised music and even robotic dance, the show was seen as a landmark when it first launched. Exploring the then relatively nascent world of augmented reality along with other interactive elements, such as an immersive laser show, the exhibition was unequivocal about its subject matter – art in a digital world. Although some aspects of the show have necessarily aged as digital technology has progressed, it was the immersive nature of parts of the exhibition that set the standard for what was to follow even though many of the current crop of immersive digital exhibitions have a more backwards-looking curation style.\nAtelier des Lumières\nA prime example of the sort of blockbuster show that is showing just how popular digital exhibitions can be is Atelier des Lumières. Launched in 2018, and currently closed due to social distancing rules in the French capital, this exhibition is located close to the Bastille in a former Parisian foundry. Operated by Culturespaces, the initial digital show featured the artwork of Egon Schiele and Friedrich Stowasser, better known as Hundertwasser, as well as numerous artists of the Viennese school, notably Gustav Klimt.\nMaking use of state-of-the-art visual projections as well as audio, the various artists’ works were truly transformed into digital representations. Not only were the paintings reproduced in digital forms but they were projected at a much larger scale. Even walls that were ten metres high or more got the cinematic treatment by the use of no fewer than 140 laser video projector. Overall, the exhibition space comprised an enormous 3,300 square metre surface area in which the humans viewing the spectacle were inevitably dwarfed by the images. What’s more, the immersive digital show could be changed relatively easily. As well as devoting some of the smaller gallery spaces to emerging artists, Atelier des Lumières was able to show other famous images without needing to borrow them from their owners. For example, Van Gogh’s Starry Night was introduced into the exhibition at one point. It garnered attention well outside of the art world when it featured in a Netflix TV series called Emily in Paris.\nPerhaps because of the notoriety that Atelier des Lumières gained across the world for its creation of a truly digital space in which it was possible to roam freely, the Indianapolis Museum of Art – now known as the Newfields Museum – took the decision to radically alter an entire floor of the gallery.\nThe art museum’s director, Jonathan Berger, explained that over 3,000 square metres of the institution on its fourth floor would be devoted to a virtual space where immersive digital art shows could be installed. “The public is introduced to and engages with art differently now,” he said. Berger went on to add that the, as yet, unopened gallery space would be the first of its kind in the US. He also said that, as a cultural institution, the Newfields Museum has to reflect the changing nature of the way people interact with art these days. “Even though society has changed, [many]… museums have not,” he said.\nBassins de Lumières\nCulturespaces work in Paris is not a one off. As the developments in the US show, digital exhibitions are likely to be popular when attendance of galleries becomes possible once more.\nThat said, online versions of these shows can still be enjoyed despite the lockdown rules. This is the case with Bassins de Lumières which replicates much of the work Culturespaces did at Atelier des Lumières. This time, however, the exhibition space is a former submarine base and the artistic projections are even more monumental among the brutal architecture. Culturespaces’ president, Bruno Monnier, said that replicating and adjusting digital exhibitions for different spaces took skill but since they worked with only a digital projection, not the real art itself, there were virtual no transportation, security or insurance costs to speak of.\nImmersive Van Gogh\nThere have been a number of digitised shows featuring the work of one of the world’s most famous artists. The Van Gogh Museum, in Amsterdam, launched an an official Meet Vincent Van Gogh Experience back in 2016 when it started to use large-scale digital projections of the Dutchman’s art in a pop-up exhibition in Beijing as far back as 2016. This ‘experience’ as it was billed went on to be shown all over Asia, North America and Europe. Put together by Event Communications, a London-based museum design consultancy, the show would go on to win a Themed Entertainment Award in 2017 for the best touring immersive museum exhibit. When the show came to London, it was marketed as the Van Gogh Immersive Experience, a telling sign that the immersive nature of the project had become one of its signature selling points. Making use of 360-degree projections and elements of virtual reality, the show featured projections and sound to augment the immersive nature of the experience.\nAlthough it was panned in some areas of the British press when it first took up its residency on the South Bank of the Thames, close to the Tate Modern gallery, the exhibition was popular with members of the public until lockdown rules prevented it from reopening. Of course, it may well be that the public’s appetite for Van Gogh and large digital projections of his art is unabated and the show will continue to attract large numbers of visitors when it reopens later in the year. Certainly, this is the hope in San Francisco because a pop-up version of the show has been admitting visitors there since mid-March.\nFinally, although digital immersive art shows may simply be a recent fad that has become trendier simply because of the pandemic, it should be noted that art collectives like teamLab have been serving up this sort of thing for two decades. Referring to themselves as ultra-technologists, the artists in the collective have been curating and displaying their digital works in Tokyo since 2001. The collective launched a second digital museum in Shanghai a few years ago and has staged temporary exhibitions in Finland before.\nIn 2018, when teamLab first opened its doors to the public in its own, eponymously titled exhibition space, it succeeded in attracting 2.3 million visitors in the first year alone. That astonishing figure may belie the fact that the appetite for immersive digital experiences in art is far from a passing trend. After all, it is the largest attendance statistic for a single-artist institution anywhere in the world. In 2021, the collective announced it had teamed up with the Chinese social media platform, TikTok, to produce a new virtual immersive art experience. As such, few people would bet against it coming up with another hit digital show, even if it happens to be an entirely virtual one.\nAbout the author – Manuel Charr\nManuel Charr is a journalist working in the arts and cultural sectors.

{"question":"What are the key differences between portfolio mobilization and portfolio capacity management?","answer":"Portfolio mobilization and capacity management serve different purposes. Portfolio mobilization is a one-off project that establishes the infrastructure required to coordinate projects and programmes, including setting up permanent structures like PMOs and communities of practice, and requires board-level support to be embedded in the organization. In contrast, capacity management focuses on determining what types of resources are needed, how many are needed, and when they are needed to support portfolios to ensure alignment with portfolio objectives. While mobilization is about setting up the structural framework, capacity management is an ongoing function that addresses resource requirements throughout portfolio execution.","context":["Mobilisation makes sure that appropriate organisational and technical infrastructures are in place for acquiring and deploying resources. It also ensures that these are dismantled or redeployed when no longer required.\nThe goals of mobilisation are to ensure that:\n- capital assets are operational and accessible;\n- facilities are operational and accessible;\n- delivery team members are competent and capable;\n- all resources are redeployed, returned or disposed of, at the end of the work.\nMobilisation occurs at various points in the life cycle. The way mobilisation operates within the life cycle processes is covered by the corresponding activities in definition process and boundaries process.\nDuring the identification process and definition process some mobilisation will be required to put in place teams, and possibly facilities, that can complete the work. Mobilisation of the full project infrastructure will occur once authorisation has been given (although some limited mobilisation may take place earlier to shorten the overall schedule). Mobilisation is also used to a lesser extent as each tranche or stage is started and finished.\nOn larger projects or programmes some mobilisation will be performed at the beginning of each stage or tranche. In a portfolio it is simply the decision to operate formal portfolio management that authorises the creation of a suitable infrastructure.\nThe mobilisation procedure can cover any of the following:\n- the management team;\n- IT hardware, software tools and telecoms;\n- plant and machinery;\n- internal and external resources;\n- governance procedures.\nThe initial management organisation is put in place to execute the identification and definition phases of a project or programme. The full organisation that will manage the delivery phase is designed during the definition process and, after approval of the full business case, the various posts are filled.\nIn many cases, the management teams will be located in existing premises. These management teams should be co-located whenever possible to improve communication and teamwork. Sometimes co-location isn’t possible, this may be because multiple companies are working in partnership or because work is managed in different countries. This will put additional pressure on the cohesion of the management team and IT infrastructure that facilitates virtual teams must help alleviate this.\nAcquiring resource from internal sources often involves difficult negotiation. In a matrix organisation, for example, resources may retain their departmental home as well as having a role in a project, programme or portfolio. The P3 manager’s resource plans may conflict with business-as-usual demands when trying to allocate these resources. That is when good conflict management and influencing skills will come to the fore.\nThe temporary nature of projects and programmes means that mobilisation will always be followed by demobilisation once the work is complete. This is has an impact on widely differing aspects of the work:\nwhere capital investment in plant and machinery is needed, decisions must be made whether to buy, with resale in mind, lease or rent;\nwhen P3 teams are being built, their managers must always bear in mind that approaching demobilisation affects traditional team cycles such as Tuckman.\nAs the need to demobilise approaches, plans must be drawn up to dispose of assets, redeploy staff and, if necessary, reinstate premises to their previous condition.\nProjects, programmes and portfolios\nOn some small projects very little will be needed in the form of form mobilisation. Facilities are all in place and resources don’t need to physically move. What needs to be done is more about teamwork than mobilisation.\nHowever, models for team work are normally based on semi-permanent business-as-usual teams rather than the transient teams found in projects and programmes. Even small projects must consider the demobilisation of the team.\nWhen mobilising programmes and large complex projects, the management team must consider the needs of the component work packages or projects. While the management team and its infrastructure will be in place for the duration of the work, there will be components that need to be mobilised and demobilised during the course of the life cycle.\nIn these situations the management team must consider the impact of the overall schedule on the infrastructure requirements. Some options for the way the way the work is structured may have a significant impact on the infrastructure costs. For example, the ability to share the costs of mobilisation across multiple projects must be weighed against the impact on benefits and the business case.\nA portfolio organisation has is more permanent than projects and programmes, although a structured portfolio may go through multiple planning cycles and be reshaped according to the needs of a revised strategic plan. Portfolio mobilisation is typically a one-off project that sets up the infrastructure required to co-ordinate projects and programmes through multiple cycles.\nA dedicated portfolio infrastructure forms the basis for an organisation to improve its capability maturity. It may be set up to include permanent organisational structures, such as a project management office (PMO) to provide support and governance. There could also be communities of practice to support the continual improvement of individual competence, or professional development programmes to encourage professionalism.\nThe mobilisation of a portfolio requires support and commitment at the host-organisation’s board-level to ensure that it is thorough and resilient. Only then will the portfolio infrastructure be embedded in the organisation as the preferred way of delivering projects and programmes.","Capacity and Capability Management in IT PPM - Review\nMany organizations are now considering Project Portfolio Management (PPM) to ensure that their strategies are aligned with organizational goals. PPM provides senior executives, portfolio manager(s) and team, and stakeholders with an overarching view of their programs and/or projects, including how they fit into the organization's directives and strategy, advancing insights into the potential returns and risks involved. Through PPM, organizations intend to achieve their ultimate goals by linking PPM with organizational strategy to establish a balanced and executable plan, and that plan includes grouping different programs and projects, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed to achieve strategic objectives. One of the main elements in PPM is portfolio resource capacity and capability management, to ensure that the portfolio’s capacity and capability demands are in alignment with portfolio objectives and can be supported or met by the organization’s resource capacities and capabilities, thus enabling successful portfolio execution and expected portfolio returns, and the capacity and capability management function plays a critical role in the organization’s overall portfolio management, from strategic planning to portfolio selection and optimization, through portfolio execution, to realizing the resulting value for the organization. Capacity management addresses what types of resources are needed, how many are needed, and when resources are needed to support portfolios, whereas Capability management elaborates what aspects of resource capacity are available and addresses the attributes, competencies, and skills associated with resources and organizational support for portfolios. To this end, this paper reviews the importance of the capability element in IT PPM to provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace and deliver a desired customer value proposition and the achievement of the organization’s goals and objectives. The outcomes indicate that IT PPM is, however, facing capability challenges, especially with soft skills in the managing project portfolio.\nDaniel, E., & Ward, J. a. (2014).

{"question":"As a guitar enthusiast interested in unique designs, what makes the Ovation 1798 Figured Koa Elite's soundhole placement special?","answer":"The Ovation 1798 Figured Koa Elite features an unusual soundhole placement in the upper bout, which creates a more contemporary look. This relocated soundhole delivers more bass frequencies and is positioned closer to the guitarist's ear. The design is accommodated by a Quintad 'T' spruce bracing pattern inside the guitar.","context":["Ovation 1798 Figured Koa Elite\nThe folks at Ovation decided to shake things up a bit and revisit the design of their standard roundback models. The result was the limited-edition 1798 Figured Koa Elite, pretty much the state-of-the art Ovation instrument.\nVisually, the 1798 is a darned attractive acoustic. The figured, bookmatched koa top has a natural finish to highlight the honey hues of the tonewood. The traditional Ovation headstock is faced with black veneer and a small koa truss-rod cover. Dial in the gold hardware on the tuners and it all amounts to a very luxurious look. Other visual details include a koa “Ovation” inlay at the 12th fret and a simple inlay around the oval soundhole.\nThe 1798 has an extra-deep Venetian cutaway that reveals a small, elegant strip of koa along the bottom of the fingerboard, as well as a tapered fingerboard from the 18th to 22nd frets. Inside, there’s a Quintad “T” spruce bracing pattern to accommodate the unusual soundhole, which Ovation relocated to the upper bout, creating a more contemporary look and delivering more bass frequencies and placing it closer to the guitarist’s ear. The 1798 sports a medium-depth Lyracord roundback design, while the neck is a five-piece laminate of mahogany with two strips of maple to create a center stripe. Like the bridge, the fingerboard is ebony and sports a scale of 251/4″.\nFor electronics, there’s an OCP-1K pickup and OP-PRO preamp, part of Ovation’s series of swappable preamps that allow players to try out different units and tones. The OP-PRO has a built-in tuner, three-band EQ, Gain and Drive controls, and an Expressor circuit to bring in the compressor/limiter effect (a critical tool for acoustic guitarists), with a little “aural exciter” sparkle added for good measure. And if noise control is an issue, the OP-PRO adds a balanced XLR output for connecting to a PA, mixer, acoustic amp, or recording rig. The removable preamp pops out via a little button on the top and has a compartment within for a 9-volt battery. Care should be taken when reinstalling the preamp, though – pushing it too hard at the wrong angle can cause it to become wedged. It’s not difficult to figure out the correct installation, but try it gingerly at first.\nOne feature of the 1798 Figured Koa Elite that jumps out immediately upon playing the guitar is its stunning neck. Truly, this is one of the fastest necks imaginable on an acoustic guitar, and it’s complemented by a superior setup. In fact, this is a rare case where the actual construction and setup of the neck arguably improves the physical technique of the player. Ovation has always been known for its swift-necked acoustics, but this is as good as it gets. Acoustically, the 1798 delivers good tone, but don’t expect tons of projection from its roundback design. The offset soundhole is made primarily for acoustic-electric use.\nPlugged in, the 1798 exudes loads of personality. It’s fun to play around with the Expressor knob, dialing more exciter and compression into the overall tone. The Drive knob adds woodier tones to the upper frequencies, but keep in mind that it’s relative to the Expressor, i.e., a more-pronounced Drive effect is apparent the more the Expressor is increased. On the subject of controls, care should be taken when adjusting the Drive knob on the fly during a gig – it’s easy to accidentally turn down the Gain knob at the same time. Overall, the 1798 sounds full and interesting going through an acoustic amp and PA, but it’s important to remember that it will sound like an Ovation, not a Martin. That’s just acoustic-guitar physics.\nIn all, the 1798 Figured Koa Elite is a terrific instrument that sounds good, looks gorgeous, and has a neck to die for. This is truly a luxury acoustic that reimagines the traditional Ovation design as something fresh and new.\nThis article originally appeared in VG March 2013 issue.

{"question":"How do pharmacy technicians handle medication dispensing in different settings, and what safety features do automated dispensing cabinets provide?","answer":"Pharmacy technicians work in various settings, including community pharmacies and hospitals, where they dispense prescription medications and handle third-party insurance billing processes. In hospitals, they manage medication dispensing throughout the facility and compound intravenous medications. Automated dispensing cabinets enhance safety through multiple features: they provide computer-based storage with secure access controls, use visual guiding lights to direct staff to correct medication locations, implement double-lock access for narcotics and controlled substances, and can require two-person verification for dispensing controlled drugs. The system also includes features for managing drug returns and maintaining accurate inventory tracking.","context":["Registered Pharmacy Technicians in the NHS are responsible for the training and development of Pharmacy Support Workers; Senior Pharmacy Support Workers and Pre-Registration Trainee Pharmacy Technicians. Further training and qualifications after initial registration as a RPhT enable them to perform this mentoring role. Pharmacy Technicians in the UK (as with other countries e.g. Canada) are now referred to by some as professionals, although Registered Pharmacists are obviously considered experts in the Pharmaceutical field and RPhTs are subordinate to Pharmacists. The reference to pharmacy technicians as professionals has been subject to challenge.\nPima Medical Institute offers multiple training options, including an Associate program and a Certificate program. All programs are based at their Houston campus in the city of Houston. The majority of of the school’s 993 students are on 2-year programs. The college is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Bureau of Health Education Schools. Tuition fees for the Vet Tech program are likely to be in the order of $12,024 yearly. Learning materials may cost about $743. Program completion is usually 8 months.\nThere are many pharmacy technician jobs available in community pharmacies such as the ones you find in your local grocery or drug store. Working in community pharmacies means working with people. If you like an active environment where keeping customers happy and comfortable is important, pharmacy technician jobs in community pharmacies offer some great advancement opportunities.\nA degree program is generally two years and results in a full academic degree, an associate’s degree (AA), that will distinguish your credentials and provide a foundation on which to build. That is, when you complete an AA, you will have a transcript of accredited courses that can apply to a full, four-year degree later on. Even if you never return to college again, having a full degree will be worthwhile. The additional courses will inform you as a person and professional, expanding your ability to communicate and understand your patients.\nCPhT is the abbreviation for Certified Pharmacy Technician. The CPhT works directly under a pharmacist, R.Ph or a PharmD. (An R.Ph is a Registered Pharmacist, who is a licensed pharmacist in that state and may have either a bachelor's degree in pharmacy or a Pharm.D.) The profession has different educational and certification requirements in different locales, set by each state's Board of Pharmacy. For example, in order to remain licensed, all Illinois pharmacy technicians hired on Jan 1, 2008 (and after) will need to be certified within 2 years of registration with the Division of Professional Regulation.\nThere are many scopes of the workplace for the Certified Pharmacy Technician. In a retail setting, a CPhT works under the direct supervision of a pharmacist who dispenses prescription medication (tablets, capsules, gels, ointment, creams, suspensions, injections, and inhalation medications), and must be familiar with over-the-counter areas as well as third party insurance billing processes. In an inpatient setting, the CPhT works throughout the hospital, packing and dispensing medications in satellite pharmacies and to the various nursing units; compounding intravenous medication while using aseptic technique; narcotic medication dispensing and inventorial procedures; as well as documenting patients' weight, height, drug allergies and other needed information in medication records.\nThey help during patient examinations and surgical procedures by restraining animals when necessary, stocking examination and surgery rooms with supplies, sterilizing tools and ensuring that equipment is in working order. Veterinary technicians also communicate with pet owners and update patient files. Veterinary technicians often work Saturdays and may be on call in some facilities 24 hours a day.\nSome veterinary technicians decide to specialize in a certain area. According to the National Association of Veterinary Technicians in America (NAVTA), an academy is a group of veterinary technicians who have received formal, specialized training, testing and certification in an area. The recognized academies include specialties in dental technology, anesthesia, internal medicine, emergency and critical care, behavior, zoological medicine, and equine veterinary nursing.\nEach applicant who has received a bachelor of science degree (6b) in an area related to an animal science or completed an accelerated program(6c) must submit a Board approved Veterinary Technician Qualification List and show proof of completion of at least 4000 hours of supervised clinical experience in a veterinary hospital that are verified by an actively practicing veterinarian.\nAll pharmacy technicians and all individuals training to work as pharmacy techs are required to register with the Board by completing and submitting a new application for registration, either the certified pharmacy technician registration or the technician trainee registration, within 30 days of accepting employment as a certified pharmacy technician or technician trainee in an Iowa pharmacy. An individual who fails to register as a pharmacy technician may be subject to disciplinary sanctions.\nWhile the majority of veterinary technicians are employed in private practice, the demand for technicians is rapidly expanding to include new employment opportunities in human and animal health-related areas and specialties such as military service, food safety inspection, teaching, zoo animal and wildlife care, diagnostic laboratory support, veterinary supply sales, animal control and humane society animal care, and drug and feed company technical service and sales.\nTwo organizations offer certification. The Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB) certification requires a high school diploma and the passing of an exam. Applicants for the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) certification must be at least 18 years old, have a high school diploma, and have completed a training program or have 1 year of work experience. Technicians must recertify every 2 years by completing 20 hours of continuing education courses.\n2. Become a technician specialist. Whether you focus on clinical practice or specialize in a more focused area like surgery, dentistry or rehabilitation, you can bring knowledge and exceptional skills to general practice. Along with standardizing our title to registered veterinary nurse, specialties help us take our careers to the next level by demonstrating our commitment to high-quality medicine, patient health and nursing. You can learn more about the specialty options here or here.\nTake the pharmacy technician certification exam. Exams are given in virtually every state. The Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB) and the National Healthcareer Association (NHA) administer certification exams. Which one should you choose? Start by reviewing each exam’s prerequisites. You may be required to have work experience or formal education in order to take the test. It’s also a good idea to check with your state board or local employers to see which certification is accepted.\nIn addition, pharmacy technicians may be needed to take on a greater role in pharmacy operations because pharmacists are increasingly performing more patient care activities such as giving flu shots. Technicians will need to perform tasks such as collecting patient information, preparing more types of medications, and verifying the work of other technicians, tasks formerly done by pharmacists.\nThe number of vehicles in use is expected to continue to rise. More entry-level service technicians will be needed to perform basic maintenance and repair, such as replacing brake pads and changing oil, on these vehicles. New technologies, however, such as electric vehicles, may limit future demand for automotive service technicians and mechanics because these vehicles will be more reliable and thus require less frequent maintenance and repair.\nis the nation’s largest nonprofit certification organization for heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVACR) technicians. NATE tests represent real-world working knowledge of HVACR systems and validate the professional competency of service and installation technicians. Contractors, manufacturers, distributors and educators across the industry partner with NATE to develop knowledgeable, competent HVACR technicians. Home and business owners choose HVACR contractors who employ NATE-certified technicians to get repairs done right – the first time.","Reading time: 5 minutes\nProviding quality patient care is the core responsibility of a caregiver, and ensuring the right drugs are given to the right patient at the right time is of utmost importance to positively impact the patient’s recovery journey. However, do you find yourself feeling uncertain of the dispensed drug, wondering if there was an earlier batch at the back of the cupboard? Or the need to recite A-B-C silently when looking for Omeprazole in the drug cupboard of the new emergency room that you have been assigned to? An automated dispensing cabinet could be the relief that you are looking for and even more…\nWhat are automated dispensing cabinets (ADC)?\nAn ADC is a computer-based system for the storage and dispensing of medication at hospital’s points of care such as wards, emergency rooms, and critical care units. They are mainly used by hospitals that practice decentralized medication management: drugs are centrally managed but physically distributed to various points of care within the hospital.\nIn this model of medication management, the ADC takes on the role of a decentralized warehouse to store and track drugs securely while enabling nurses to accurately dispense patient-specific or drug-specific medication on demand.\nThe MedSMART automated dispensing cabinets are a combination of a main tower and an auxiliary tower. The main tower features an integrated touchscreen where caregivers use to log into the system to replenish or dispense medications. The auxiliary tower provides additional shelf or drawer storage for the medication at the point of care. Flexible configurations of an ADC enable secure storage and dispensing of different types of drug forms such as:\n- single doses,\n- multi doses,\n- blister strips,\n- boxed medication,\n- bottled medication,\n- vials, and\nAccurate dispensing with automated dispensing machines\nDuring daily scheduled drug administration timings, nurses log into the ADC. They are granted access to the system to select the patient for whom medication is to be dispensed. The system lists the prescription specific to this selected patient and the nurse selects the drugs to be dispensed, which automates the process of dispensing medications sequentially.\nVisual guiding lights illuminate the doors, drawers, and exact compartments within the drawers where the selected medications are stored. This directs the nurse to the right drawer to pick and dispense the right drug. On top, there is on-screen guidance to show where the exact drug is stored. Once all prescribed drugs specific for that administration timing are dispensed from the ADC, nurses have the option to print out a prescription list that aids them during their administration process.\nThe automated dispensing machines can be programmed to support both patient-specific and drug-specific dispensing modes, catering to emergency responses, especially within the emergency rooms and critical care wards. The drug-specific dispensing process is the same as the patient-specific dispensing process except for the initial patient selection. During an emergency, caregivers will be able to access all drugs stored within the ADC. Simply by searching the drug name and selecting the drug to be dispensed, the automated dispensing process starts.\nHandling narcotics, controlled substances, and high-alert drugs\nNarcotics, controlled substances, high-alert, and sometimes expensive drugs are stored exclusively in the sliding drawers of the MedSMART ADC, which are secure drawers with double-lock access. With ADC credentials and the access locks of both the drawer and the drug’s storage compartment, this physical hardware complies with JCI requirements of implementing a process for reducing the risk and harm of high-alert medications.\nFor an additional layer of security when storing and dispensing narcotics, hospitals have the option to implement the two-man rule to securely dispense controlled drugs only after verification by a second authorized user of the system.\nSo, when nurse A logs in the ADC to retrieve a narcotic, the system will prompt another authorized caregiver B to log into the system as a second set of verification before the system unlocks the drawer and storage location of the narcotic for nurse A to retrieve the drug.\nHandling drug returns\nWhether a drug will be returned to the cabinet stock or the return bin will be set up during the medication definition stage. A drug that is defined as going to the return bin will be sent back to the pharmacy so it can be redistributed to other wards in need of this drug. MedSMART ADC can manage both types of returns within its footprint.\nSteps of returning drugs to the cabinet stock or return bin:\n- After logging into the ADC, the nurse selects the patient whose drugs were un-administered and clicks on the return button.\n- The screen will list previously dispensed medication for this specific patient and the nurse selects the drug to be returned as well as its returned quantity.\n- Select the return button again to confirm the returned drug and quantity.\nThe return bin or the correct drawer will be unlocked (sequentially if returning more than one drug).\n- There will be on-screen and visual guiding lights to direct the nurse to where to return the drug.\nBenefits at a glance\nAutomated dispensing machines digitize the process of medication handling at the hospital’s points of care. An ADC is an intuitive system that enables secure drug storage, supports accurate dispensing, and empowers drug traceability at various points of care within a hospital. This results in:\nIncreased operational efficiency for both the nursing and pharmacy staff\n- Improved medication management practices to increase patient safety\n- Improved drug inventory to reduce medication waste and loss.\nChoosing the right automated dispensing cabinet\nAutomated dispensing machines can be as simple or sophisticated as needed, depending on several factors such as number of line items to be stored, size of all drugs to be stored onsite, quantity to be stored, replenishment schedule, and the list goes on. To simplify the process of selecting an ADC that fits your needs, let’s evaluate the basics:\n- Where would you like to place the ADC?\n- How many line items do you need to be stored at that point of care?\n- Do you need secure storage (double-lock access) for narcotics and controlled substances?\n- Assuming a 5-day replenishment cycle, an ADC can store ~50 liters of liquid medication, do you need more?\nTake the first step with our ADC Configurator to find out what would be a suitable combination based on these four simple questions and to receive a first price indication. If you prefer to speak with someone about your specific needs, book an appointment with your local expert and we can customize a system that meets your needs."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f539a30c-929b-4667-9840-7936a48c4cca>","<urn:uuid:d4c526f8-6f25-4581-ac2d-7e4a2d89b184>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do cities' living conditions impact wildlife habitat conservation? 如何评估城市生活环境对野生动物栖息地保护的影响？","answer":"Cities' living conditions directly impact wildlife habitat conservation in several ways. When cities become unlivable, people tend to move to suburbs, building bigger houses on larger lots, which consumes more natural habitat. Conversely, making urban areas more pleasant helps protect nature since apartment or condo living in cities has a smaller per-person impact on the natural world. Cities can protect wildlife by maintaining green spaces, implementing strong pollution regulations, and developing efficient mass transit systems. Additionally, cities need vibrant urban green infrastructure, including fish-bearing creeks, backyard habitats, community gardens, parks, greenbelts, and wetlands for both wildlife and people.","context":["8. Build or choose a home with the least impact on the natural world.\nAll of us compete with birds and other wildlife for space and habitat. As our own species spreads out, wild habitats become fragmented or lost altogether. This land-use pattern promotes deer, skunks, cowbirds, predators, and other “edge” species at the expense of those that thrive in forest, grassland, and wetland interiors. The more habitat each person consumes, the greater the total impact on the natural world.\nA growing human population places higher demands on natural resources and contributes to the loss of natural habitat. Exacerbating this problem, Americans are living on increasingly larger lots and building increasingly larger homes, individually appropriating more space and resources and leaving less room for wildlife and the regeneration of resources that we all depend on.\nMaking urban homes and neighborhoods as pleasant as possible is one of the best ways to protect the natural world. Living in an apartment or condo in a city has a far smaller per-person impact on the natural world than living anywhere else. The smaller the area required for each human, the more land can remain natural. So the more habitable our urban areas are, the happier people can be without contributing to continued sprawl.\nMost big cities are built on shorelines or in other areas with important natural resources. The vast majority of birds that migrate from the tropics to northern forests pass through cities during their migration. Promoting and enforcing strong regulations with regard to sewage, garbage, industrial waste, and other pollutants and encouraging comfortable, efficient, and affordable mass transit can protect the natural environment and make cities more healthy and livable for humans. When cities retain as much “green space” as possible, they not only help birds and other wildlife directly but also become more pleasant for all of us. According to the Seattle Audubon Society, “A livable city needs a vibrant, healthy urban green infrastructure, an interconnected system of fish-bearing creeks, backyard habitats, community gardens, neighborhood parks, greenbelts, and wetlands—for wildlife and people to enjoy.” When cities become unlivable, people tend to migrate to the suburbs, building bigger houses on bigger lots and taking up more natural habitat.\nMany people dislike cities and are happiest when they live in natural settings, among natural sights and sounds. People who find satisfaction in a large home on a sprawling lot are going to buy just that, if they can afford it. But by making our homes and lot as bird-friendly as possible, we can at least minimize our personal impact on the natural world and, as a bonus, almost invariably make our home environments healthier and more pleasant for us, too.\nLive in the smallest home on the smallest lot that makes you happy. Join neighborhood groups that work actively to make our cities as pleasant for humans and urban wildlife as possible, and support programs that encourage nature study in urban areas, such as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s Urban Bird Studies. Henry David Thoreau wisely understood that “in wildness is the preservation of the world.” But on a planet populated with billions of humans, in cities is the preservation of wildness.\nFrom 101 Ways to Help Birds, published by Stackpole in 2006.

{"question":"I live near Chernobyl and I'm pregnant. What risks should I be concerned about from the residual radiation? 妊娠中の女性にとって、チェルノブイリの放射線被曝はどのような危険がありますか？","answer":"Based on the scientific evidence, pregnant women near Chernobyl face serious risks that require caution. Research shows radiation exposure is most dangerous in the first three months of pregnancy, when even very low doses can disturb embryonic development and double the rate of childhood leukemia. The area 50km from Chernobyl still has unsafe radiation levels in food (45% of grain samples) and wood (75% of samples). Additionally, the timing of exposure is more critical than the dose, as radiation can cause epigenetic changes within minutes that affect fetal development and may be passed to future generations. The local food and wood should be avoided during pregnancy due to continuing contamination with strontium 90 and cesium 137 above safe limits.","context":["This is an expanded version of an article I wrote a couple of days ago.\nWhen scientists speak of radiation, they speak not only of single doses but also of cumulative doses.\nSee for example, this research from the University of Iowa showing that “cumulative radon exposure is a significant risk factor for lung cancer in women”.\nAnd see these studies on the health effects cumulative doses of radioactive cesium. (As I noted on March 29th, the radioactive cesium fallout from Japan already rivals Chernobyl. And the amount of radioactive fuel at Fukushima dwarfs Chernobyl).\nAdmittedly, the damage from huge single doses may be greater than the same cumulative dose from many small exposures. But the smaller doses can still add up.\nRemember, the radiation from CT scans and x-rays are external emitters – the radiation emanates from outside the body. In contract, internal emitters keep emitting their radiation inside the body. Therefore, the cumulative effect of multiple small doses of radiation from internal emitters could be even more dramatic, depending on the half life, metabolic pathways and other properties of the particular radioactive particle.\nAs the European Committee on Radiation Risk notes:\nCumulative impacts of chronic irradiation in low doses are … important for the comprehension, assessment and prognosis of the late effects of irradiation on human beings …\nAnd see this.\nOne of the World’s Leading Experts on Radiation – Karl Morgan – Warned of Cumulative Low-Dose Exposures\nAmerican reporter Dahr Jamail reports today for Al Jazeera:\n“The U.S. Department of Energy has testified that there is no level of radiation that is so low that it is without health risks,” Jacqueline Cabasso, the Executive Director of the Western States Legal Foundation, told Al Jazeera.\nHer foundation monitors and analyzes U.S. nuclear weapons programs and policies and related high technology energy, with a focus on the national nuclear weapons laboratories.\nCabasso explained that natural background radiation exists, “But more than 2,000 nuclear tests have enhanced this background radiation level, so we are already living in an artificially radiated environment due to all the nuclear tests.”\n“Karl Morgan, who worked on the Manhattan project, later came out against the nuclear industry when he understood the danger of low levels of ionizing radiation-and he said there is no safe dose of radiation exposure,” Cabasso continued, “That means all this talk about what a worker or the public can withstand on a yearly basis is bogus. There is no safe level of radiation exposure. These so-called safe levels are coming from within the nuclear establishment.”\nKarl Morgan was an American physicist who was a founder of the field of radiation health physics. After a long career in the Manhattan Project and at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he became a critic of nuclear power and weapons. Morgan, who died in 1999, began to offer court testimony for people who said they had been harmed by the nuclear power industry.\n“Nobody is talking about the fact that there is no safe dose of radiation,” Cabasso added, “One of the reasons Morgan said this is because doses are cumulative in the body.”\nAs the Guardian wrote in Morgan’s obituary in 1999:\nKarl Morgan … was a pioneer of health physics – the science of the effect of exposure to radiation on health. He was a member of the research group which laid the foundations for the Manhattan project and produced the first atomic bomb. However, after 30 years in the inner cabinet of the nuclear establishment, Morgan changed sides and testified in key radiation cases on behalf of those who claimed they had been harmed by nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industry.\nThe first signs of his change of view came in 1968, when he became an influential campaigner in obtaining a US law that required the medical profession to control excessive doses of radiation during X-rays.\nAfter retirement in 1972 he became more active in drawing attention to the limitations of radiation protection measures.\nHe began his career as a physics professor but in 1943 was recruited to become a senior scientist in health physics to the top secret, atomic bomb project codenamed Manhattan Engineer District.\nThe following year, Morgan went to the newly-formed Oak Ridge national laboratory in Tennessee, where he became director of health physics from 1944 until his retirement. When told he would be in the health physics group, he was shocked and said it was a terrible mistake because he had never heard of health physics. The leaders of the research project said they had been in the same position. But they realised that since their attempts to build the first atomic pile, now known as a reactor, would create a source of intense radiation, they needed to understand how to protect people.\nHe wrote in his autobiography, The Angry Genie: One Man’s Walk Through The Nuclear Age, that he did not believe they had ever determined that it was safe. “We determined what we considered was acceptable.”\nThe Townsend Letter for Doctors & Patients wrote in 2002:\nOne of the original five ‘health physicists’ to set radiation safety standards was Karl Z. Morgan. Dr. Morgan served on the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), which set up most radiation standards. He also directed the Health Physics Division at Oak Ridge from 1944 until his retirement in 1972. In recent years, Dr. Morgan has publicly criticized the ICRP for failing to protect human health. In a 1994 article for the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, Dr. Morgan wrote: “The period of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons by the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the USSR is a sad page in the history of civilized man. Without question, it was the cause of hundreds of thousands of cancer deaths. Yet there was complete silence on the part of the ICRP. During these years (1960-1965), most members of the ICRP either worked directly with the nuclear weapons industry or indirectly received most of their funding for their research from this industry.”\nThe ICRP’s alliance with the nuclear industry includes ties to the International Congress of Radiology. In his 1999 autobiography, The Angry Genie: One Man’s Walk Through the Nuclear Age (ISBN 0-8061-3122-5), Dr. Morgan related his concern about the ICRP’s refusal to address the danger of excessive X-ray exposure during diagnostic procedures and dentistry. Until the passage of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, some X-ray equipment used in the 1950s and 1960s delivered 2 to 3 rem per X-ray. X-ray doses as low as 1.6 rem increase a woman’s chance of developing cancer, according to a 1974 study by Baruch Modan [Lancet (Feb. 23,1974), pp 277-279]. The Act did not address the cumulative effect of multiple, routine, and often unnecessary X-rays.\nOther Top Radiation Experts Agree\nBy any measure, Dr. John Gofman was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century. Gofman earned his doctorate in nuclear and physical chemistry, and was also a medical doctor. He worked on the Manhattan Project, co-discovered uranium-232 and -233 and proved their fissionability, helped discover how to extract plutonium and led the team that discovered and characterized lipoproteins in the causation of heart disease.\nDr. Arthur R. Tamplin was a doctor of biophysics, who was tasked – as a group leader in the Biomedical Division at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories – with predicting the ultimate distribution within the biosphere and in humans of each radionuclide produced in the explosion of a nuclear device.\nIn 1963 the Atomic Energy Commission asked Gofman and Tamplin to undertake a series of long range studies on potential dangers that might arise from the “peaceful uses of the atom.” They told the truth, and the AEC launched a campaign of harassment in response.\nWhat did they say, and why was the AEC so hostile?\nGofman and Tamplin documented that low levels of radiation can cause cancer and other diseases, and they argued that federal safety guidelines for low-level exposures should be reduced by 90 percent.\nErnest Sternglass (Emeritus Professor of Radiological Physics in the Department of Radiology, at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine), Dr. Alice Stewart (head of the Department of Preventive Medicine of Oxford University) and many other top scientists have also shown that low level radiation can cause cancer.\nMilitary Commanders Told that Low-Level Radiation Increases the Risk of Cancer\nA military briefing written by the U.S. Army for commanders in Iraq states:\nHazards from low level radiation are long-term, not acute effects… Every exposure increases risk of cancer.\n(Military briefings for commanders often contain less propaganda than literature aimed at civilians, as the commanders have to know the basic facts to be able to assess risk to their soldiers.)\nThe briefing states that doses are cumulative, citing the following military studies and reports:\n- ACE Directive 80-63, ACE Policy for Defensive Measures against Low Level Radiological Hazards during Military Operations, 2 AUG 96\n- AR 11-9, The Army Radiation Program, 28 MAY 99\n- FM 4-02.283, Treatment of Nuclear and Radiological Casualties, 20 DEC 01\n- JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in NBC Environments, 11 JUL 00\n- NATO STANAG 2473, Command Guidance on Low Level Radiation Exposure in Military Operations, 3 MAY 00\n- USACHPPM TG 244, The NBC Battle Book, AUG 02\nInfants Are Most at Risk\nInfants are, apparently, most vulnerable to low level radiation exposure.\nAs Brian Moench, MD, notes:\nAdministration spokespeople continuously claim “no threat” from the radiation reaching the US from Japan, just as they did with oil hemorrhaging into the Gulf. Perhaps we should all whistle “Don’t worry, be happy” in unison. A thorough review of the science, however, begs a second opinion.\nThat the radiation is being released 5,000 miles away isn’t as comforting as it seems…. Every day, the jet stream carries pollution from Asian smoke stacks and dust from the Gobi Desert to our West Coast, contributing 10 to 60 percent of the total pollution breathed by Californians, depending on the time of year. Mercury is probably the second most toxic substance known after plutonium. Half the mercury in the atmosphere over the entire US originates in China. It, too, is 5,000 miles away. A week after a nuclear weapons test in China, iodine 131 could be detected in the thyroid glands of deer in Colorado, although it could not be detected in the air or in nearby vegetation.\nThe idea that a threshold exists or there is a safe level of radiation for human exposure began unraveling in the 1950s when research showed one pelvic x-ray in a pregnant woman could double the rate of childhood leukemia in an exposed baby. Furthermore, the risk was ten times higher if it occurred in the first three months of pregnancy than near the end. This became the stepping-stone to the understanding that the timing of exposure was even more critical than the dose. The earlier in embryonic development it occurred, the greater the risk.\nA new medical concept has emerged, increasingly supported by the latest research, called “fetal origins of disease,” that centers on the evidence that a multitude of chronic diseases, including cancer, often have their origins in the first few weeks after conception by environmental insults disturbing normal embryonic development. It is now established medical advice that pregnant women should avoid any exposure to x-rays, medicines or chemicals when not absolutely necessary, no matter how small the dose, especially in the first three months.\n“Epigenetics” is a term integral to fetal origins of disease, referring to chemical attachments to genes that turn them on or off inappropriately and have impacts functionally similar to broken genetic bonds. Epigenetic changes can be caused by unimaginably small doses – parts per trillion – be it chemicals, air pollution, cigarette smoke or radiation. Furthermore, these epigenetic changes can occur within minutes after exposure and may be passed on to subsequent generations.\nThe Endocrine Society, 14,000 researchers and medical specialists in more than 100 countries, warned that “even infinitesimally low levels of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, indeed, any level of exposure at all, may cause endocrine or reproductive abnormalities, particularly if exposure occurs during a critical developmental window. Surprisingly, low doses may even exert more potent effects than higher doses.” If hormone-mimicking chemicals at any level are not safe for a fetus, then the concept is likely to be equally true of the even more intensely toxic radioactive elements drifting over from Japan, some of which may also act as endocrine disruptors.\nMany epidemiologic studies show that extremely low doses of radiation increase the incidence of childhood cancers, low birth-weight babies, premature births, infant mortality, birth defects and even diminished intelligence. Just two abdominal x-rays delivered to a male can slightly increase the chance of his future children developing leukemia. By damaging proteins anywhere in a living cell, radiation can accelerate the aging process and diminish the function of any organ. Cells can repair themselves, but the rapidly growing cells in a fetus may divide before repair can occur, negating the body’s defense mechanism and replicating the damage.\nComforting statements about the safety of low radiation are not even accurate for adults. Small increases in risk per individual have immense consequences in the aggregate. When low risk is accepted for billions of people, there will still be millions of victims. New research on risks of x-rays illustrate the point.\nRadiation from CT coronary scans is considered low, but, statistically, it causes cancer in one of every 270 40-year-old women who receive the scan. Twenty year olds will have double that rate. Annually, 29,000 cancers are caused by the 70 million CT scans done in the US. Common, low-dose dental x-rays more than double the rate of thyroid cancer. Those exposed to repeated dental x-rays have an even higher risk of thyroid cancer.\nBeginning with Madam Curie, the story of nuclear power is one where key players have consistently miscalculated or misrepresented the risks of radiation. The victims include many of those who worked on the original Manhattan Project, the 200,000 soldiers who were assigned to eye witness our nuclear tests, the residents of the Western US who absorbed the lion’s share of fallout from our nuclear testing in Nevada, the thousands of forgotten victims of Three Mile Island or the likely hundreds of thousands of casualties of Chernobyl. This could be the latest chapter in that long and tragic story when, once again, we were told not to worry.","The radiation resulting from the explosion in 1986 of reactor 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, on the border between Belarus and Ukraine, continues to be monitored, both in wildlife and in forests and on the land nearby. Even after 34 years, the region produces food contaminated with radioactive elements.\nScientists at Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter and the Ukrainian Institute of Agricultural Radiology measured levels of strontium 90 and cesium 137 radioactive isotopes in crops grown near the plant (such as wheat, rye, oats and barley) and found that they continue beyond the limits considered safe by the Ukrainian government.\nThe radiation is still present 50 kilometers from the site of the nuclear disaster.Source: Greenpeace / Denis Sinyakov / Disclosure\n“We focus on strontium 90 because it is known to be currently present in the soil, mainly in bioavailable form, which means that it can be absorbed by plants,” said chemist Iryna Labunska, lead author of the study now published in the journal Environment International.\nNot only were the harvests analyzed; 75% of the wood, used by the local population in the kitchen and in fireplaces, still has strontium 90 concentrations above the limits considered safe.\nOne of each\n“The Ukrainian government’s monitoring of products containing strontium 90 has to be aware of the continued contamination of soil and plants, and needs to be advised on the safest agricultural and recovery methods. We found very high levels of this isotope in the ash of the wood – many people use them as fertilizer for plantations ”, says the scientist.\n116 grain samples collected between the years 2011 and 2019 from 13 settlements throughout the Ivankiv district, a region about 50 kilometers south of the Chernobyl plant and outside the so-called exclusion zone (where entry is prohibited and subject to prison terms). Wood samples (mainly pine) came from twelve locations in the same district, collected between 2015 and 2019.\nThe radiation in the trees will remain until the end of this century.Source: Greenpeace / Denis Sinyakov / Disclosure\nThe results showed that 45% of the grain samples contained strontium 90 above that allowed for human consumption. That level will still persist for at least ten years. The combination between this isotope and cesium 137 appeared in 48% of the samples, also above the levels considered safe.\nChemist Iryna Labunska collects grain samples.Source: Greenpeace / Denis Sinyakov / Disclosure\nThere is strontium 90 beyond the limits allowed in trees as well, and that should not change until the end of this century. In a sample of ash from a domestic wood oven, the level of the isotope found was 20 times higher than that of the most contaminated wood sample collected in the study.\nAccording to the researchers, agricultural practices can help cut strontium 90 concentrations in half. As for the use of contaminated wood, the recommendation is to end its use.\nThe area is no longer monitored by the Ukrainian government since 2013.Source: Greenpeace / Denis Sinyakov / Disclosure\n“Our findings point to continued contamination and human exposure, exacerbated by the lack of official routine monitoring, and the potential for Chernobyl-derived radiation to spread, again and more widely, as more and more wood is used for generation in the region, ”said biologist David Santillo.\nIn a previous study, the same researchers found that, in parts of Ukraine, milk had levels of radioactivity up to five times above the country’s official safety limit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:032d2c2a-4c0f-4f8e-862d-fff6e55857f4>","<urn:uuid:94a22b9e-e345-4d4b-9717-d6404c9eccf2>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What temperature ranges trigger health risks in both heat stroke and cold water immersion?","answer":"Heat stroke occurs when body temperature reaches 104°F or higher, while cold water immersion symptoms can occur at water temperatures as warm as 77°F. In Lake Tahoe specifically, water temperatures range from 50-60°F in early summer, rising to 65-75°F in hotter days, all of which are cold enough to cause dangerous immersion effects. The temperature threshold for both conditions can be dangerous - heat stroke causes organ damage and requires emergency treatment, while cold water causes the body to lose heat 25 times faster than cold air, leading to hypothermia.","context":["Preventing Heat Stroke in the Elderly: Beat the Heat with These Summer Safety Tips\nReading Time: 5 minutes\nPublished on June 6, 2018\nThe sunny days of summer are here, and along with warmer temperatures comes the risk of dehydration and heat stroke in the elderly. Seniors have a higher risk of dehydration and heat stroke for several reasons, including:\n- They are more likely to have medical conditions that may change the way the body responds to heat.\n- They may take prescription medications that impair their body’s ability to perspire or regulate temperature.\n- They may take medications that make them more susceptible to the sun.\n- They don’t adjust as well as younger people to sudden temperature changes.\nDuring the summer months, it helps to take some safety precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses like heat stroke. Below are some helpful safety tips, an explanation of what heat stroke is and an overview of the important symptoms of heat stroke to look out for in the elderly.\nSummer Safety Tips\nWith a few summer safety tips for seniors and their caregivers, you can beat the heat and have fun in the sun this summer.\nTip #1 – Stay Well Hydrated\nAs you age, your body loses some of its ability to conserve water, which makes seniors more susceptible to dehydration. You may also be less aware that you’re thirsty as you age. When it’s warmer, it’s important to make sure you’re drinking enough water each day, especially when out in hot weather. If you’ll be out on a summer drive, pack some water to take along.\nIf you’ll be outdoors for an extended period of time, it’s a good idea to have some electrolyte replacement drinks that have potassium and salt in them, such as Gatorade or PowerAde. Consuming foods that have sodium and potassium can also be helpful when you’re trying to stay well hydrated.\nIt’s also a good idea to avoid drinking caffeinated beverages, drinks with a lot of sugar, and alcohol, since they can make your body lose even more water, increasing the risk of dehydration.\nTip #2 – Choose the Right Clothing\nDressing for warm weather can keep seniors from getting overheated as well. During the warmer months, natural fabrics like cotton are usually cooler than clothing made out of synthetic fibers. Light-colored, loose-fitting clothes can keep you feeling comfortable and cool. Choosing clothing that covers your skin from direct sun rays can also be helpful, protecting the skin from sunburn.\nTip #3 – Avoid the Mid-Day Sun and Heat\nThe hottest part of the day in the summer is usually between 10 am and 4 pm, so it’s best to avoid being outdoors in the midday sun and heat, particularly if you’re dealing with extreme heat or humidity. If you need to be outdoors to run errands or take care of other tasks, try doing so before 10 am or later in the evening when you’ll have cooler temperatures.\nIndependent living should be safe and comfortable. If you’re considering safety modifications to your home, such as ramp installation, bathroom accessibility solutions or stairlifts, HandyWorkx is here to help.\nTip #4 – Be Aware of the Heat Index\nDon’t just pay attention to the temperature outdoors, make sure you are aware of the heat index as well. The heat index factors in the temperature and the humidity to figure out how hot the weather feels. You can easily find the current heat index on weather websites, on radio weather reports, or on local television weather reports. The higher the heat index, the tougher time your body will have cooling itself, so avoid being outdoors when the heat index is high.\nTip #5 – Keep the Eyes Protected\nMany elderly individuals deal with vision loss and exposing your eyes to too much sun can cause more damage and irritate them. Wear sunglasses to keep your eyes protected from the harmful UV rays, which will help preserve your vision and reduce your risk of further eye damage.\nTip #6 – Use Hats and Sunscreen\nNo matter your age, it’s always important to make sure you’re putting on sunscreen. Seniors often have more sensitive skin, so you’ll need extra sun protection to avoid burns. In some cases, medications may make you more vulnerable to the sun’s rays, so check with your pharmacist to find out if you need to avoid sun exposure.\nHats can also protect you from the sun, especially if you have little hair or light-colored hair. A good hat can offer some extra protection for your eyes as well.\nTip #7 – Be Smart with Exercise\nIf you love doing a little outdoor gardening, walking outdoors, or engaging in other types of outdoor exercise, make sure you do it the smart way during the summer. Exercising later in the evening or early in the morning is a great idea. Wearing the right clothing, sunscreen, and any other needed protective gear can help as well. Avoid exercising outdoors for long periods and ensure you’re drinking more water than you normally would when you’re exercising outdoors in warm weather.\nYou may even want to move your exercise routine indoors. You can head to the mall to do some walking. Visit a local gym to do some light strength training or walk on a treadmill. Try water aerobics or swimming at an indoor pool to stay active. You don’t have to be outdoors in the heat to make sure you stay moving this summer.\nTip #8 – Don’t Forget the Bug Spray\nAlong with beating the heat, another concern that comes with the summer months is bug bites. Elderly individuals are more prone to get encephalitis and West Nile Virus, so if you live in areas where there are many mosquitoes or you are outdoors a lot, especially in the evening, make sure you’re applying mosquito repellent to reduce your risk of being bitten.\nWhat is Heat Stroke?\nHeat stroke is the most serious type of heat injury, and it’s considered to be a medical emergency. Heat stroke occurs when the body overheats, usually as a result of physical exertion or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. Heat stroke may occur when the body temperature reaches 104°F or even higher, and the condition most commonly occurs during hot, summer months.\nIt’s important for seniors and senior caregivers to understand that a heat stroke is very dangerous and requires emergency treatment. It has the ability to quickly damage muscles, kidneys, brain, and heart. The longer treatment is delayed, the worse the damage can be, increasing the risk of serious complications or even death.\nSigns and Symptoms of Heat Stroke\nSince heat stroke does require emergency treatment, it’s important for the elderly and their caregivers to be aware of the signs and symptoms of heat stroke. According to the Mayo Clinic, some of the signs and symptoms of heat stroke may include:\n- Rapid Heart Rate – The pulse may increase significantly because the heat is placing a huge burden on the heart to help cool the body down.\n- High Body Temperature – A body temperature that is 104°F or higher is the top sign of a heat stroke.\n- Altered Sweating – If you have a heat stroke brought on by exercising strenuously, skin may feel slightly moist or dry. Heat strokes brought on by very hot weather generally cause the skin to feel dry and hot to the touch.\n- Rapid Breathing – Breathing often becomes shallow and rapid.\n- Headaches – Heat stroke may cause extreme headaches that feel like a throbbing in the head.\n- Altered Behavior or Mental State – This may include irritability, confusion, seizures, delirium, slurred speech, agitation, or even coma.\n- Muscle Cramps or Weakness – You may feel very weak or your muscles may begin to cramp.\n- Vomiting and Nausea – You may feel very nauseated or you could begin vomiting.\nIf you think you or a person you care for is suffering from a heat stroke, get immediate medical attention. Call a local emergency services number or 911. While waiting for emergency treatment, remove any excess clothing and move the person indoors or into the shade. Cooling the person in any way possible, such as sponging with cool water, placing cold, wet towels on the groin, armpits, neck, and head, or spraying with cool water from a hose or shower, can help. Keep in mind, it’s not recommended to use ice on older individuals, since quick changes in body temperature are more dangerous for aging adults.\nIf you are aging in place or you’re a family member that is caring for an elderly individual, having the help of a caregiver during the summer months may be a great idea. Caregivers can help with summer outings, help seniors stay hydrated and keep safe in the hot weather, and be alert for the symptoms of heat-related illnesses.","Be aware of cold water immersion\nAbout the author\nKristi Kimball, RN, BSN, is the Trauma Program manager at Barton Health. Barton’s Level III Trauma Center is a critical medical facility for Lake Tahoe offering resources for trauma care and the immediate availability of emergency medicine physicians, surgeons, nurses, lab and x-ray technicians, and life support equipment 24 hours a day.\nSummer is here and after a snow-packed winter, locals and visitors alike are ready to get out and enjoy Lake Tahoe.\nWhether out on the water, lounging on the beach or hiking to a rock outcropping to take a plunge, there are important precautions to keep in mind with water surface temperatures and cold water immersion.\nLake Tahoe’s temperatures are on the colder side at the beginning of the summer, ranging between 50-60 degrees Fahrenheit. Although these temperatures will continue to rise to 65-75 degrees as the days get hotter, keep in mind that symptoms of cold water immersion can occur at water temperatures as warm as 77 degrees.\nThere are four stages to cold water immersion:\nStage 1: Initial Cold Shock\nSudden immersion into cold water can cause immediate, involuntary gasping for air, panic and vertigo as well as create changes in your body’s blood pressure and heart rate. The sensation of taking your breath away can result in panic and inhalation of water and drowning. If you do fall in or enter the cold water, attempt to get control of breathing and try not to panic. Focus on floating with your head above water, until the initial cold shock phase passes.\nStage 2: Short-Term Swim Failure\nSwim failure occurs anywhere from 3-30 minutes following the initial cold water shock. In this phase, the muscles and nerves in the legs and arms will begin to cool quickly, causing strength and movement to drop significantly. This stage of cold water immersion can render a strong person unable to pull themselves out of the water or keep their head above the water.\nStage 3: Long-Term Immersion Hypothermia\nHypothermia sets in after 30 minutes of cold water exposure, depending on the water temperature; as cold water causes the body to lose heat 25 times faster than cold air. Hypothermia is a cooling of the body’s core temperature caused by active heat loss and the failure of the body to produce more heat. Recognize signs of hypothermia to help identify its early onset: shivering slurred speech; cold and blueish lips, skin and fingernails; loss of feeling in extremities; confusion; dizziness and rigidity in extremities.\nStage 4: Post Immersion Collapse\nPost immersion collapse can occur at any point. Your body is still in danger while being rescued from cold water or after. Cardiac arrest after cold water immersion occurs due to the collapse of the arterial blood pressure. Along with hypothermia, possible water in the lungs due to inhalation, or coagulation issues due to cold and thickened blood.\nTo have a fun, safe time on the water, practice simple “dos” and “don’ts” such as making sure to wear a personal flotation device at all times and if you’re operating a boat, ensure there are life jackets for every passenger aboard. Don’t jump off large rocks into deep water, as this runs the risk of increased cold water immersion and trauma based off the height of your jump.\nRecognizing the four stages of cold water immersion and signs of hypothermia prevents emergencies, injuries and helps to keep you and your family safe around the lake this summer.\nHealthy Tahoe is a look at health-related topics that shape our community and is made possible through content provided by our sponsors.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around the Lake Tahoe Basin and beyond make the Tahoe Tribune's work possible.

ONLY PURSING SUSTAINABILITY INTERNALLY MEANS THE MAIN OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY ARE MISSED IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN.\nProcurement is at the core of any business effort to achieve sustainability. Sustainable procurement contributes value in many ways by reducing costs and minimizing the risk of disrupted sources of materials. This is a minimal perspective however, because sustainable procurement is also at the core of the world’s ability to reach environmental and social sustainability. Business leaders are focused on responsibility, resilience, and supply regeneration of critical resources, and for too long, procurement has been relegated to the background when it should have an equal voice at the table. Only this way can supply chain models be reinvented and procurement become a central player in developing sustainable products and services.\nEMBEDDING (REAL) SUSTAINABILITY\nA research project called The Embedding Project is a global public-benefit research project collaborating with companies ready to embed environmental and social factors into their operations and decision-making. The ultimate goal is progress towards a regenerative economy, which requires conscientious procurement. The white paper “Procuring a Regenerative Economy” addresses the fact that “a truly sustainable and impact-free sourcing network can only be implemented by rethinking the overall company business model,” and goes on to say that today’s “sustainable procurement largely entails check-lists pushed onto suppliers, often through third parties, and the results can be overridden if short-term financial conditions make it seem preferable to do so.”\nThe future of sustainable procurement is marked by necessity. Without sustainable procurement, a regenerative economy is not possible, but the question is how to get buyers and suppliers focused on sourcing sustainable products and services. The sustainability efforts going on right now are not producing the desired results, and one of the biggest challenges is connecting the strategic plan to actual procurement processes and systems. Regenerative sourcing has challenging goals which includegenerating net-zero GHG emissions, restoring ecosystems, and providing inclusive, fair and safe livelihoods for people. As the white paper points out, sustainable procurement is about more than material flows; it recognizes purchasing decisions made as the business will impact a multitude of organizations in terms of community, climate, resources, and the environment.\nEVERY STEP OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION\nSustainable procurement is not altruistic. It is crucial to business reputation, minimizing the risk of scarcity of supply in the future, and maintaining competitiveness by managing costs through energy consumption and waste reduction. It is a risk management strategy for competitive endurance as much as an environmental and social strategy. True sustainable procurement requires deep analysis, and a commitment to ensuring suppliers are adhering to sustainability values as much as the buyer.\nCosmetic companies are expected to act responsibly in many areas – product testing, diversity, environmental protection, fair labor practices, packaging and logistics. The RBI was founded by L’Oréal, Coty, Groupe Rocher, and Clarins to promote sustainability best practices and processes. The mission statement provides insight into what sustainable procurement is really all about, saying, “Responsibility is spread all along the value chain” from the small-holder producer to the final consumer, including of course all the manufacturers and intermediaries that enable them to produce and distribute a good.” RBI established sustainability ratings to measure and benchmark Corporate Social Responsibility and engaging suppliers more effectively is a core strategy. L’Occitane is a French cosmetics company that signed onto the RBI, which was a public commitment to sustainable supply chains.\nA company like Elate Beauty is a good example of a business that has innovatively developed products based on sourcing sustainable ingredients. This company looks at every step of the supply chain and product design to ensure maximum sustainability is achieved. The company has an impressive procurement process, in which ingredients sourced are 75% organic, but they will choose fair trade over organic if unable to have both. All products are 100% vegan and cruelty free. Bamboo used in products comes from suppliers with Forest Stewardship Council Certification, mica comes from suppliers who are members of the Responsible Mica Initiative, and wood for pencils comes from suppliers who can demonstrate the Californian cedar wood is certified by the Program for Endorsement of Forest Certification. As the company says, innovation and ethics in sustainability are core values.\nOPTIMIZING SUSTAINABILITY INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY\nElate Beauty is offered as an example of procurement innovation in sustainability because the company has considered every stage of its procurement and production processes. McKinsey research has found that two-thirds of a company’s ESG (environment, social, and governance footprint) is with suppliers. ESG can lead to higher business performance too. Companies focused on ESG experience faster growth and higher valuation compared to the competition by 10-20%. However, optimizing resource consumption internally is not enough, and that is where procurement becomes so important.\nPer McKinsey, as much as 80-90% of greenhouse-gas emissions of products are indirect emissions in procured goods and services, travel, commuting, and the use of end-of-product life cycle treatment. Two-thirds of the emissions are from the upstream supply chain. Procurement can have an enormous influence on ESG by influencing product design and purchasing decisions. McKinsey suggest building sustainability as a procurement standard, expanding collaboration with suppliers, evaluating ESG credentials of potential suppliers, and employing carbon accounting principles. This requires procurement having access to the right tools, resources, and data sources.\nIt is no secret that lower levels of suppliers in the supply chain often violate sustainability principles, yet most companies concentrate on Tier 1 suppliers. One of the procurement challenges is developing supplier networks that are sustainable down to the lower levels, which is not only the right thing to do, but can save a company from reputational damage. A good example is when the media reported Nestle was using forced labor in its supply chain. A long investigation uncovered the slave labor was actually in the Fancy Feast supply chain.\nEvery supplier should adhere to procurement policies and requirements for sustainability, meaning all tiers of suppliers should be included in the procurement sustainability strategy. Tier 1 suppliers can play a major role here, because they have the ability to assess their own suppliers.\nCompanies are adopting sustainable procurement best practices because environmental and social sustainability is directly connected to business sustainability. The future of sustainable procurement depends on the honest, transparent, and sincere effort of businesses."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7ff35e57-55e8-44bf-886d-0d7b639c6175>","<urn:uuid:e581a43e-6de5-4a11-a4e2-b3b3a08951e9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿How do noise-cancelling headphones help durante un viaje en avión with sensory processing disorders?","answer":"Noise-cancelling headphones help during air travel in several ways. For children with sensory processing disorders, they effectively reduce unwanted ambient sounds that can cause sensory overload. These headphones use active noise control and sound proofing to prevent high frequency noise from reaching the ears, while still allowing users to hear important safety announcements. They are particularly helpful for airplane travel as they prevent ears from aircraft engine and air conditioner noise. Additionally, they allow users to hear lower level details without increasing volume excessively, and some models include an 'Aware' mode to selectively hear background sounds when needed.","context":["Planning a summer vacation for a child with a sensory processing disorder involves careful planning. While popular vacation spots are becoming more and more autism spectrum disorder and special needs-friendly, families still worry about their child becoming overwhelmed during the roadtrip, flight, or even the trip location itself. One helpful planning trick is to prepare a toolkit for your child that you’ve designed to help soothe and entertain them in case there is too much sensory input. These toolkits can be so helpful that you might even consider continuing to use them after your vacation, like during routine errands, school functions, or doctor’s appointments.\nPreparing Your Sensory Toolkit\nHow you decide to put together your toolkit will depend on your individual child’s specific needs and past experiences. Some children with special sensory needs crave sensory experiences, while other children actively try to avoid sensory input. Some children, meanwhile, go back and forth between the two. The type of child that your child is will help you to determine what you should include in your sensory toolbox.(1)\nYour sensory toolkit can be as large or as small as you need, and you can use something simple that you have at home, like a backpack, or you can buy something more elaborate, like a literal toolbox with compartments. A backpack may be a particularly good choice, as the weight of it helps with body awareness (a concept known as heavy work)(2) and can help calm the child. You might choose to pack:\n- Noise-cancelling headphones for children affected by too much noise.\n- An iPad or music playing device, pre-loaded with favorite apps, games, and songs, to engage and calm a child. Radio apps, like Spotify, usually have white noise and calming nature sounds available to listeners on the app. Remember, too, that most flights allow you to follow your flight path online. This can help your child see exactly where you are in the sky.\n- Sunglasses and a hat or a visor for children sensitive to bright light. If you’re taking a road trip, you can buy tinted screens to stick onto the windows surrounding the child’s seat in the car.\n- Non-toxic Play-Doh, silly putty, slime, clay, Floof, or other items for children craving tactile stimulation or touch. You can also include textured items, such as a spikey ball, or chewing items, like chewable jewelry.\n- Unique visual items, like a kaleidoscope or sensory bottle. You can make your own homemade sensory bottle using a bottle, water, and a type of oil, gel, or glue, as well as glitter, food coloring, and interesting, small ingredients, like water beads. Make sure that your bottle is well-sealed with hot glue or another sealant after creation.\n- Special toys, such as fidget spinners, may appeal to your child.\n- A few favorite and calming books or toys, including coloring books with freshly sharpened crayons.\n- A blanket, especially a weighted lap pad or blanket for older children,(3) as well as a pillow and stuffed animal or other cuddly toy to provide your child with comfort.\n- Scented stickers or markers to engage the child’s sense of smell. Your child might also enjoy aromatherapy or essential oils.\n- Something physical to use during breaks at rest stops or at parks around your hotel, such as a ball or jump rope.\n- Favorite snacks and drinks, particularly ones that engage the senses, like gummy bears.(2)\nPreventing Sensory Overload During Vacations\nMake sure to keep your sensory toolkit within easy reach of your child during your trip. Talk with them about how they can use the items in their toolkit when they’re feeling overwhelmed or need a break. Before the trip, your child might also benefit from social stories regarding the vacation. Put together a book with details and pictures of where they’re going and the sights they’ll see along the way.(4) You can even include your social story in your sensory toolkit, so that your child always knows what comes next.\nAlternatively, read them books that are as closely related to the trip as you can. If you’re flying, show them videos of planes (explain that planes are loud!) and help them practice for the TSA screening as much as possible by talking them through the process. Maybe even set up a play airport in your house for your child to have the physical experience of going through a screening, etc. If you’re taking a road trip, remember to build in plenty of breaks. Rest stops with outdoor space for your child to run or just to relax at a picnic table with a snack can be extremely helpful.\n72 hours before boarding your flight, you can call to speak with TSA Cares to discuss your specific concerns and boarding needs.(5) You’ll want to be as prepared as possible for the airport screening. Give yourself plenty of time the day of your flight.\nChildren experiencing a sensory processing disorder or ASD find the sensory input offered by their environments to be more stimulating and overwhelming than someone without a sensory processing issue. A brightly lit hotel lobby, for instance, might not seem so bright to you, but for a child with autism spectrum disorder, the intensity of the lights, the voices of the guests, and the unfamiliar hotel smells can all combine to create a kind of sensory overload that makes travel difficult. Try to make note of your child’s individual triggers and signs that your child might be feeling overwhelmed. Planning ahead by packing a sensory toolkit, communicating with travel staff, and preparing your child as much as possible for the experience can allow your family to spend less time worrying and more time building memories.\nConcerned about a Sensory Processing Disorder?\nIf you’re concerned that your child may have a neurobehavioral disorder, such as a sensory processing disorder, Neurobehavioral Associates can help.

User can enjoy the music without increasing the volume of headphone. In the aviation environment, people get irritated because of the continuous unwanted sound knocking at their ears all the time. Also they cannot wear normal headphones because it is important to hear safety announcements as well. Keeping all these things in mind, noise cancelling head phones are created and designed in such a way that the users can use them while they are traveling in airplane. These headphones make hearing important information better to the user such as safety announcements etc. These Headphones help users to hear only those things which they want to listen. All unwanted noise can be ignored by using noise cancelling Headphones.\nHow do they work?\nNoise Cancelling Head phones use active noise control to control the frequency of the noise. They use technique called sound proofing to prevent high frequency noise from reaching the ear. These Head phones cancel high frequency components coming to the ear from all the directions. Now days, most noise cancelling headsets use analogue technology. Also, there are many airlines which provide these types of headsets to all who travel in business class or cabin class. There are many companies who are making Noise cancelling Headphones.\nAdvantages of Noise Cancelling Head Phones\nThese Headphones hush ambient sounds by creating different frequencies that prevent the noise coming at ears.

{"question":"As a horse trainer, I'm concerned about both young and mature horses: how do injury patterns differ between 2-year-old racehorses in training compared to horses with muscle imbalance problems? Can you explain the main issues for each group?","answer":"2-year-old racehorses and horses with muscle imbalance show distinct injury patterns. 2-year-old racehorses primarily suffer from bucked shins (affecting 42% of young horses), fetlock problems (16%), and knee issues like carpitis and chip fractures. These injuries typically result in reduced training days, with bucked shins accounting for about 35% of reduced training time. In contrast, horses with muscle imbalance show different symptoms - they develop uneven muscle size and strength on different sides of their body, leading to deviation in posture, sub-luxation of skeletal joints, limited movements, and increased risk of injury to muscles, bones, joints, tendons and ligaments. Muscle imbalance develops gradually due to unbalanced exercises, improper form, bad posture, or daily activities, while young racehorse injuries are more directly related to the intensive training process.","context":["Introduction to muscle imbalance and spasm\nThe muscles of a horse’s body hold the backbone and limbs together in the correct position. Properly functioning, healthy muscles, therefore, are responsible for balanced posture and movements. Muscle imbalance is a common issue that affects the wellbeing of a horse. This causes deviation in posture and leads to sub-luxation of the skeletal joints, limiting joint movements.\nIt is important for the size and strength of the muscles on each side of the body to be symmetrical. If a muscle or group of muscles on one side of the body becomes weaker, stronger, looser, tighter, larger, or smaller than the corresponding muscle or muscles on the other side, this will cause muscle imbalance.\nMuscle imbalance does not occur suddenly. It is a condition which often results from carrying out unbalanced exercises, exercising with improper form or bad posture, carrying out several daily life activities, and in very rare cases is congenital. Injuries, poor nutrition, and neurologic issues can also muscle imbalance in horses.\nMuscle imbalance can lead to an unbalanced appearance, pain for the horse, limited movements, and instability. It also leads to an increased risk of injury to muscle, bone, joints, tendons and ligaments. Fatigue is the main cause of sports injuries in horses. This occurs when the horse moves in an unbalanced posture. Ensuring that muscles are balanced can relieve fatigue and prevent injuries.\nMuscle spasm is a painful condition where a muscle or group of muscles contracts forcefully and involuntarily. When this condition occurs, the muscle can become unable to relax. Muscle spasm can occur in any muscle but most commonly occurs in the limbs and the muscles of the abdomen. A sustained muscle spasm is known as muscle cramps, and a condition where painful muscle cramps occur in the limbs is called charley horse. Muscle spasms in the horse’s back limbs are known as shivers. Equine shivering is characterised by periodic involuntary spasms of the muscles in the pelvic region, pelvic limbs, and tail. Sometimes forelimbs are also affected. Affected horses show stiffness, s sudden jerky extensor movements in the tail (tail elevation), and a tendency to move backwards.\nThere are many potential causes for muscle spasms in horses. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in the extracellular fluid is the most common cause. Excessive sweating causes dehydration and loss of electrolytes. Horses which have been intensely exercised in hot, humid weather conditions can suffer from a depleted water level in the body caused by sweating which takes place to help dissipate the body heat. Fluid loss occurs at a rate of up to 15-20L per hour when horses sweat. This can result in huge deficits in minerals like Sodium(Na), Potassium(K), Chlorine(Cl), Magnesium(Mg), and Calcium (Ca).\nOtobius megnini ear tick infestation is another common cause of muscle spasms in horses.\nDiagnosing muscle imbalance and spasms\nIn order to diagnose a muscle imbalance in a horse, a clinician will take into consideration information from the following sources:\n- The horse’s history\n- A physical examination\n- The horse’s biochemical profile (obtained via a serum enzyme test)\n- Blood test\n- Electromyography (EMG)\n- Muscle biopsy\n- Genetic test\nAn informative history is required when assessing almost any disease in an animal. A history of any muscle problems such as cramping, pain and weakness, and the frequency of such problems is essential information. It is also useful for the clinician to know the animal’s exercise schedule, diet, vaccination and medication history, as well as all information relating to factors that are often precursors to muscle problems such as lameness, stress, and strenuous exercise carried out.\nThere are a few characteristic clinical signs in horses suffering from muscle imbalance and spasm. These can be diagnosed via careful physical examination and palpation. Palpation of muscle mass provides important information about any muscle pain the animal is suffering, as well as swelling and muscle tone.\nIf a horse’s limbs are balanced, they will land in a perpendicular way as the horse moves. Observing the horse both while standing and while walking, therefore, can help identify any gait abnormalities which may indicate that the limbs are unbalanced. Shivering horses show tenseness and trembling of the hind limb, a sudden elevation of the tail, or a tendency to move backwards, picking up their feet. Muscle imbalance and spasms can very often result in lameness, and a lameness evaluation can be carried out by means of a flexion test. This test indicates if the animal is experiencing any muscle pain or problems with its joints.\nExtremely fatiguing exercises such as endurance rides can cause increased creatine kinase(CK) level in the serum. The standard level of CK in serum is less than 1000U/L. A serum biochemical profile can determine the animal’s CK level. Measuring the levels of electrolytes and mineral concentration in the horse’s urine and blood can help to detect electrolyte imbalances in horses which are suffering from muscle spasms and cramping. For this diagnosis, urinalysis and blood tests can be carried out. Dehydration is the most common cause of muscle spasms and can be determined as part of these tests.\nElectromyography (EMG) is a technique which detects muscle potential by placing a needle very close to the motor endplate. When muscle contract action potential occurs, this can be observed as a wave pattern in the EMG. If the horse is suffering from muscle spasms or cramp problems; this wave pattern will appear irregular.\nMuscle biopsy is an important technique used to obtain diagnostic information regarding muscle problems. Genetic tests can also be used to help detect congenital myopathies in horses.\nDifferent causes of myopathy\nThe word ‘myopathy’ is defined as a disease of the skeletal muscles. The major sign of this disease is muscle weakness which occurs due to dysfunction of muscle fibres. Other symptoms are muscle cramps, pain and stiffness. Myopathies can either be genetic or acquired. There are several myopathies that commonly occur in horses, all of which have several possible causes.\nTypes of Myopathies\n- Equine exertional rhabdomyolysis(ER)\n- Equine polysaccharide storage myopathy(PSSM)\n- Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis(HYPP)\n- Fibrotic myopathy\n- Inflammatory myopathy\n- Nutritional myopathy\n- Toxic myopathy\n- Atypical myopathy\n- Post anesthetic myopathy\n- Ischemic myopathy\nEquine exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) occurs due to abnormal Ca homeostasis within the muscle cells; causing muscle contraction to be intermittently disrupted, damaging the muscle tissue of the horse. The most common causes of this are excessive exercise and a high-grain diet.\nEquine polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) is a genetic disorder that occurs due to a dominantly inherited gene mutation.\nHyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) is another genetic condition that results from a point mutation in the Na channel gene in the skeletal muscle. When these abnormal Na channels are activated, they decrease Na-K exchange through the channel. This results in an increase in intracellular Na level and K level in the extracellular space, causing hyperkalemia. The most common cause of this myopathy is feed that is high in potassium, such as soya bean meal or oil, sugar molasses, beet molasses, alfalfa hay, brome hay, canola oil, grains such as corn, wheat, oats, and barley or beer pulp.\nFibrotic myopathy occurs when the inner thigh muscles are injured via exercise, trauma, or IM injection.\nInflammatory myopathy occurs via bacteria, viruses, and some parasites infecting the muscles. Equine influenza 2 and Equine herpesvirus 1 are common viruses which cause this myopathy.\nSarcocystis fayeri, an infectious parasite, enters the horse via feed which is contaminated with canine feces. Another infectious parasite, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, can enter a horse via a tick bite.\nBacteria such as Streptococcus equi equi and Clostridium spp. (C.septicum / C.perfringens/ C.chauvoei) can be a cause of inflammatory myopathy in horses. S.equi, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis often cause muscle abscesses.\nNutritional myopathy in horses is associated with a deficiency of antioxidants like Selenium (Se) or vitamin E (Vit. E). A Vitamin E deficiency occurs when the horse eats low quality grass hay. This condition is common in foals up to 2 weeks old and young adult horses.\nToxic myopathy is caused by ingestion of poisonous portions (leaves/fruit/seeds) of certain plants like coyotillo (Karwinskia humboldtians), coffee sennas (Cassia occidentalis), white snakeroot (Eupatorium rugosum), and box elder seeds (Acer negundo). As well as certain plant toxins, ionophores are also toxic to horses. These are often used as a feed additive for poultry and other livestock, but should not be fed to horses. If a horse’s feed is accidentally contaminated with ionophores, toxic myopathy occurs. Horses are ten times more sensitive to ionophores than any other species.\nAtypical myopathy is a fatal muscle disease caused by the ingestion of sycamore seeds, seedlings, and leaves.\nProblems in the horse’s circulatory system cause post-anesthetic myopathy and ischemic myopathies.\nHow to treat muscle problems\nAs long as you get to the root cause of a horse’s muscle problems, treatment is easy. In mild cases, owners can manage these problems themselves, but in severe cases it is essential to seek help from a veterinarian.\nDehydration and electrolyte imbalance is the primary cause of most muscle disorders. Ionized Ca in the serum is an essential mineral which allows muscle contraction to take place. To prevent a hypo-calcemic condition, a sufficient amount of Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Cl, as well as essential minerals for healthy muscles should be provided as part of the horse’s diet. Changing the horse’s diet is a common treatment for several different muscle problems, however the exactt dietary change required varies according to the problem. A horse with nutritional myopathy, for instance, must be provided with sufficient dietary Se and Vitatim E.\nA diet containing fresh grasses is good for horses with HYPP as fresh grasses have a high water content, and eating them can also help to reduce K intake.\nThere are no antitoxins for muscle problems like atypical myopathy and toxic myopathy, however certain medications can help stop or reduce the absorption of toxins from the intestine.\nBesides dietary changes, horses should be provided with freshwater or electrolyte supplemented water to help prevent dehydration. Anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics are the main treatments for inflammatory myopathy. Injectable methocarbamol, IV fluids and pain relievers can also be used to treat muscle disorders. If these treatments do not work sufficiently, surgery may be required.\nHealthy muscles are essential for the wellbeing of a horse. Because horses are athletic animals, injuries and muscle disorders happen frequently. The common causes of these disorders are strenuous exercise, dehydration, electrolytic imbalance, intoxication, and genetic mutations. The best way to prevent these disorders is through providing sufficient dietary nutrients, however problems can often be treated with proper management and medication.","There seems to be little doubt that musculoskeletal injury--including injury to bones, joints, tendons, and ligaments--is a major problem for Thoroughbred racehorses. This impression has been borne out by studies of \"wastage\" in the racing industry, where wastage describes the losses that occur during the training and racing of a horse. In some studies, more than 50% of these racehorses experienced a period of lameness and, in about 20% of affected horses, lameness was severe enough to prevent racing during the period of investigation.\nAlthough the economic impact of this wastage due to injury has not been quantified, the losses are probably substantial. Some have estimated that in the United States alone, the annual economic loss from these injuries approaches $1 billion. These losses can be measured in terms of days out of training, decreased athletic performance, veterinary care, reduced income from race winnings, loss of training fees, the cost of replacement horses, etc.\nPerhaps even more important than the economic losses are the animal welfare implications. Those involved in the equine racing industry realize they must make it a priority to better understand the factors that contribute to the development of musculoskeletal injuries during racing and training, and to develop means for preventing these injuries.\nThis article gives an overview of musculoskeletal injury rates in Thoroughbreds and discusses current research that is focused on developing strategies for preventing these injuries. Note that this discussion focuses on Thoroughbred racehorses in large part because most research has focused on this breed rather than other racehorses (Standardbreds, Quarter Horses, or Arabians).\nEpidemiological studies (dealing with the incidence, distribution, and control of disease or injury in a population) over the past decade have shed much light on the type and frequency of musculoskeletal injuries in Thoroughbred racehorses. There are several ways to classify these musculoskeletal injuries. One way is to record the number of injuries that occur during races, and to classify those injuries as catastrophic or non-catastrophic. Catastrophic means the injury is fatal--the horse dies as a result of the injury or is euthanized because of the severity of the injury. The most common catastrophic injuries include fractures of the humerus (the bone located between the shoulder and elbow joints), cannon or third metacarpal bone, and sesamoid bones, with 90% of these injuries occurring in the forelimbs.\nAll other non-fatal injuries are in the non-catastrophic category. However, these non-catastrophic injuries are no less important, because there is increasing evidence that seemingly minor injuries can eventually lead to more serious problems. For example, a recent study at the University of California, Davis, looked at the effects of mild suspensory apparatus injury in 219 Thoroughbred racehorses.1 (The suspensory apparatus includes the suspensory ligament and the distal sesamoidean ligaments; it is crucial for support of the fetlock joint.) Horses which had a mild suspensory injury were at increased risk for a more severe musculoskeletal injury, including complete failure of the suspensory apparatus--a condition that is often fatal. The moral of the story is that minor injuries can quickly turn into big, potentially serious problems.\nOne study in Kentucky over an 18-month period involving 35,484 racing starts among 7,649 horses identified 132 musculoskeletal racing injuries among 117 horses.2 Of these injuries, 51 were classified as catastrophic and 66 as non-catastrophic. This means that about one in 700 racing starts is associated with a catastrophic musculoskeletal injury (most commonly, fractures of the lower limbs). Recent studies in Britain have revealed a similar overall death rate in flat racing Thoroughbreds (0.9 per 1,000 starts). Although some might argue that this number of catastrophic injuries is small in relation to the number of racing starts, the opposing view is that any number other than zero is unacceptable.\nIt is also important to realize that many (if not the majority of) racehorse injuries actually occur during training. Therefore, the statistics on race day injuries can be viewed as the tip of the iceberg in relation to the overall injury rate in racehorses in training. The injuries occurring during training might occasionally be fatal, but more commonly result in wastage--days lost in training, missed racing opportunities, premature retirement from racing, etc.--and can lead to more serious injuries later on.\nHowever, an Australian study of 169 young Thoroughbreds (distributed among 24 trainers) during their 2- and 3-year-old racing seasons found that catastrophic injury was uncommon during training.3 However, during the 2-year-old season, there was a high incidence of low-grade injuries that had a marked impact on training and racing activities. The most common injury was bucked shins (also termed shin soreness), which affected 42% of the horses, followed by fetlock problems (16%) and a mixed bag of other leg injuries. Many of these horses developed shin soreness a second or third time in the same year (2-year-old) or subsequent (3-year-old) racing campaign.\nIn 3-year-olds, knee (carpus) problems--such as carpitis (knee inflammation) and chip fractures--were the most common causes of lameness, although fetlock injuries were also important in this age group. These lameness problems were the most common reason for alterations in training; in particular, bucked shins accounted for about 35% of reduced training days (i.e., training was modified in some fashion) and 4% of lost training days. Overall, days lost to training because of injury or other illnesses (e.g., respiratory disease) were higher in 2-year-olds (3.1%) than in 3-year-olds (2.2%), probably reflecting the greater impact of shin soreness in the younger horses.\nTendon and suspensory ligament injuries were uncommon in this small group of young Thoroughbreds. However, injuries of these structures are much more common in older racehorses. In a survey of 222,000 racing starts in Britain, involving both flat and National Hunt (steeplechase) races, there were a total of 2,358 clinical problems (about 10 per 1,000 starts). Of this total, 1,790 were injuries of the musculoskeletal system--81% affected the forelimbs and 46% involved the flexor tendons and/or suspensory ligament.4\nWithout getting too bogged down in the numbers, we can conclude that:\n- Catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries (mainly long bone fractures and \"breakdown\" of the fetlock and pastern area) occur at the rate of about one per 1,000 race starts in flat racing Thoroughbreds;\n- Injury occurs during both training and racing;\n- Forelimb fractures, including chip fractures that involve the knee and fetlock joints, are common in all age groups;\n- The frequency of tendon and ligament injuries increases dramatically with age; and\n- Bucked shins are very common problems in young racehorses and contribute to the apparently higher rate of injury in this age group compared to older horses.\nThe 2-Year-Old Issue\nThis last point raises the question of 2-year-old racing. A view long held by many in the horse racing community is that 2-year-old training and racing contribute to the unacceptably high rate of musculoskeletal injuries in racehorses. It is also argued that 2-year-old racing shortens racing careers. Buried in this argument is the assumption that a delay in the commencement of training and racing until a horse's 3-year-old year will minimize injury problems, largely because the skeleton and supporting structures are more mature at the start of training and therefore better able to withstand the rigors of repetitive exercise.\nThis debate has recently resurfaced because of the popularity of \"2-year-olds in training sales\" and reports of breakdown injuries in horses being prepared for the solitary sprint (each sales horse performs alone against the clock) that is part of the sales process. Because these sales are held in early spring, horses enter training at around 16 to 18 months of age. The level of fitness required for what is in effect \"race readiness\" necessitates an intense training program with these young horses.\nAs yet, there is no easy answer to this perplexing issue. True, there is some evidence that injury rates are higher in 2-year-olds than other age groups. However, bucked shins are a big part of this difference, and it is important to realize that this injury will also occur in horses which commence serious training later in life. As well, some horses can suffer recurrences of shin soreness following a period of stall or paddock rest. Therefore, development of bucked shins is not so much due to the age of the horse, but rather is the consequence of horses entering intensive training, particularly on the first occasion.\nRecent studies have also demonstrated that Thoroughbreds which begin racing as 2-year-olds have a longer career compared to those which begin training and racing at an older age. There is growing evidence that in order to maximize the increases in bone and tendon strength that result from training, horses should begin training at an early age. Although this debate is sure to continue, so far there is no convincing evidence that age per se is the biggest factor in musculoskeletal injuries.\nAs discussed in a recent article5, bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly remodeling. In the case of physical conditioning (training), this remodeling process serves to increase bone strength so that the bone is better able to withstand the stresses placed upon it during exercise. However, this beneficial effect might not always occur and these areas of extensive remodeling could actually be prone to fatigue failure or \"stress fracture\" under the continued rigors of high-speed exercise.\nFor example, it is now thought that chip fractures involving the knee bones in racehorses are not an acute traumatic event, but rather the end result of a negative remodeling balance that leads to a loss of bone mass and strength (termed osteoporosis). The weakened area of bone is then predisposed to fracture. Unfortunately, just why this osteoporosis occurs is not yet understood.\nBucked shins can also be regarded as the bone modeling process gone wrong. With the onset of galloping exercise, additional bone is deposited on the front portion of the cannon bone, which should ultimately result in improved bone strength. However, early on this new bone appears to be prone to microfractures similar to the stress fractures that can occur in human athletes during training.\nStress fracture of the bottom portion of the cannon (distal condyle) is another common injury in racing Thoroughbreds that might be the result of unbalanced bone modeling. Recent research has found that training results in an uneven increase in the density of the condyles. The resultant variation in bone density might then predispose the bone to stress fractures in the weaker areas under the strain of normal training and racing.\nProgress Toward Prevention\nVeterinarians have become highly skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of many musculoskeletal injuries that afflict racehorses. As an example, the advent of arthroscopic surgery was a huge step forward in the treatment of joint problems and, compared to older therapies, has greatly improved the prognosis for a return to successful racing. Still, the ultimate goal must be prevention of this and other types of injuries, or at least a marked reduction in overall injury rate and a decrease in the number of catastrophic or career-limiting injuries.\nThere is much to be done before we can achieve this ideal. However, researchers around the world are working hard to develop better training methods and means for preventing musculoskeletal injury. This research effort has many facets. Some groups are working on the early diagnosis of mild injuries in racehorses--that is, diagnosis before these injuries result in lameness or other obvious signs such as swelling. For example, Tracy Turner, DVM, MS, Dipl. ACVS, of the University of Minnesota, has been using thermography (a pictorial representation of skin temperature) as a means to identify areas of heat associated with underlying bone or tendon problems (e.g., stress fractures or tendon strains).6 Few will dispute that the early diagnosis and treatment of mild problems are important in preventing more severe, even catastrophic injuries. Perhaps in the near future, it will be routine to use these highly sensitive scanning tools on a weekly basis during training.\nOther research teams are investigating the effects of training methods and age at commencement of training on the development of bone, joints, and tendons. Others continue to focus on factors that could contribute to the development of musculoskeletal injuries. These factors include conformation, shoeing techniques, track design and surface, and the volume and intensity of training. These epidemiological studies, which will identify common risk factors, are a vital first step in the development of effective preventive strategies.\nRecent findings from some of these studies are challenging conventional Thoroughbred training methods. For example, recent English studies reported at a conference on racehorse injuries in November of 2001 have shown that galloping at least one furlong for every seven furlongs at lower speed is associated with a decreased risk of fracture compared with no galloping work.7 Surprising as it might seem, this finding is actually in line with the concept that a certain amount of very hard exercise is necessary for maximum increases in bone strength and resistance to fracture.\nConsistent with this idea, studies of young racehorses in the United States have shown that the allocation of more training effort to regular short-distance breezing (one to two furlongs of full gallop) and less to longer-distance cantering helps to minimize the incidence and severity of bucked shins.7 The implication is that beyond a period of base training, the emphasis in conditioning programs should be on quality rather than quantity of work efforts.\nClinical experience and epidemiological studies have also identified that certain stress fractures are more likely to occur when horses race during the two- to three-week period following a time of inactivity (such as a lay-up because of injury). One theory is that the period of rest results in a decrease in bone strength that makes the bone more susceptible to injury when fast exercise is resumed. Perhaps horses returning from lay-up periods need a longer period of reconditioning before they are raced again, with a particular emphasis on short bursts of hard galloping to rebuild bone strength.\nAs with all research, patience is a must. At this point, there are more questions than there are answers. Still, the evidence so far points to changes in training methods (speed, distance, and gait) as important in the prevention of musculoskeletal injuries. As always, the \"proof is in the pudding.\" The challenge now is to compare specific training protocols and figure out which method(s) work best in terms of injury prevention.\n1 Hill, A.E.; Stover, S.M.; Gardner, I.A.; et al.

{"question":"I'm interested in recording traditional music. What did Alan Lomax record for Christmas in Spain, and what are the key differences between classical and flamenco nylon guitars used in Spanish music?","answer":"In Spain during 1952-1953, Lomax recorded several Christmas-related pieces: the 'Ronda de Nochebuena' played on ximbombas (clay-pot drums with reed canes) in Lagartera, 'Caramelles Cobla' sung in a guttural style in the Balearic Islands, and a Basque song 'Abenduko hilaren hogeitalauean' about shepherds bringing lambs to Jesus. As for the guitars, classical and flamenco nylon guitars have distinct characteristics. Classical guitars typically have no pick guard, higher action for clear tone, and are built with cedar or spruce tops for warm sounds. Flamenco guitars often feature pick guards (tap plates) on both sides of the sound hole for protection during percussive playing, have lower action on a thinner neck, and traditionally use cypress wood for quick, bright attack suited to flamenco's aggressive playing style.","context":["As we approach the end of the centennial year of the birth of Alan Lomax, it seems appropriate to look at recordings of songs and music he collected celebrating Christmas, the new year, and Epiphany. The recordings presented here are all part of the collections of the American Folklife Center, but many have been put online by partner organizations and researchers working to make Alan Lomax’s collections more widely available — with a great deal that is new this year. You may want to take note of these sites and collections to explore them further, so a list of these is provided in the Resources section at the end of this article.\nAmong the earliest Christmas songs recorded by Alan Lomax currently available online are from fieldwork he did in Kentucky with his new wife, Elizabeth, in 1937. These include a fiddle tune, “Old Christmas,” played by Boyd Asher and recorded in Hyden, Kentucky and “Away in a Manger,” sung by a six-year-old child, Betty Sue Shepard, in Cumberland, Kentucky. Elizabeth Lomax can be heard giving the name of the singer at the end of this song. On the same trip they recorded “Fair Charlotte” (also known as “Young Charlotte”), a tragic ballad not usually thought of as a Christmas song, but in this version it is a celebration of Christmas time that causes Charlotte to go out in her carriage without enough wrapped over her fined dress to keep her warm, and arrives frozen to death at the party.1\nThe next year Alan Lomax went on his first solo documentation trip to Michigan and Wisconsin. There he recorded “Christmas Evening,” a sad Irish ballad about a death at Christmas sung by John W. Green and recorded by Alan Lomax in Saint James, Beaver Island, Michigan, in 1938.2\nIn 1940 Alan Lomax hosted a CBS radio show called, Back Where I Come From, and for a Christmas treat, he presented “Christmas Songs with Woody Guthrie and Burl Ives.” Guthrie sang a song for children that he composed for the occasion, while Burl Ives sang a version of “The Twelve Days of Christmas.” Both talked about early Christmas traditions, including gift-giving on “old Christmas” (Epiphany) instead of Christmas morning. This and other radio shows that Alan Lomax produced are available on the Association for Cultural Equity web site.\nLomax spent Christmas 1952 in Spain and collected songs in many regions in the last months of 1952 and January of 1953. An instrument associated with Christmas and often carried by carolers, the ximbomba (or zambomba ) is found in many parts of the country, and is usually home-made. It is made from a clay-pot drum with a reed cane attached to the head. The reed is moistened and rubbed to create the characteristic sound. Drums made out of various sized clay pots have different sounds. Here is a group of ximbombas being played by a group of young people in Lagartera, Castilla-La Mancha. After playing for a bit, they sing a song, “Ronda de Nochebuena.”\nIn the Balearic Islands of Spain Lomax recorded an interesting style of singing with gutteral adornment. “Caramelles Cobla,” is sung by Miquel Bonet (Can Frare or Jaia), Josep Cardona (Pep Pujoleti), and Josep Marí Prats (Pep den Rotes) of Sant Josep in this ancient Mediterranean style.\nIn January 1953 Alan Lomax was recording songs in the Basque country of Spain. This Basque song for Christmas Eve tells of the shepherds bringing lambs as gifts for the baby Jesus: “Abenduko hilaren hogeitalauean” sung by a group of men in Tolosa, País Vasco, Spain, on New Years Day, 1953.3\nAlan Lomax made many recordings of songs sung by the late collector and singer Jean Ritchie, who learned much of her repertoire in Kentucky. In 1959 he recorded her at his apartment in New York City. Along with some familiar Christmas songs, she sings some that are unusual, such as “Christmas Day in the Morning,” which describes the activities of various animals on Christmas and is certain to delight children. Her version of “I Saw Three Ships” (Come Sailing In), uses a familiar lyric sung to a different tune than the one widely known.\nLomax traveled in the Southeast making recordings in 1959 and 1960. Vera Hall Ward was an African American singer from Alabama who was recorded by several folklorists. This is her rendition of “The Last Month of the Year,” with an introduction to remind us of the joy of Christmas.\nIn September 1959 Lomax recorded songs at the 56th Annual United Sacred Harp Musical Association Convention in Fyffe, Alabama. The Alabama Sacred Harp Convention sang “Sherburne,” better known as “While Shepherds Watched their Flocks by Night,” and a less well-known “Christmas Anthem.” For those who have not heard this style of singing hymns before, you will hear the choir sing the tune first using names for the notes, fa, sol, la, etc, before they begin singing the lyrics of the songs. Sacred Harp groups at this time organized as white and African American groups with some differences in style and repertoire. These examples are from the white tradition.4\nCaribbean bands often translated popular Christmas songs into their own musical styles. In 1962 Lomax visited Gingerland on the island of Nevis, and recorded the Marigolds dance band playing “Noel,” in in the style of a Caribbean dance tune. In this recording, the band leader, Merritt Boddie, leads the melody on the flute.\nIn 1969 Bessie Jones and the Georgia Sea Island Singers performed “O Day” or “Yonder Come Day” for Alan Lomax. This song may be used on Christmas Eve, New Years Eve, or both for singers who are staying up the whole night, so it is called a “watch night song” and welcomes the dawn. In this interview Bessie Jones and John Davis talk with Alan Lomax about this song and “watch nights.”\nSongs for the New Year\nNew Years Eve and Day are a time for socializing, visiting, and dancing in many cultures. In Quebec, Canada, New Years is an even more festive period than Christmas. In 1938 in Baraga, Michigan, Alan Lomax found Edward King, a Québécois singer, who performed a dance song for the New Year, “C’est dans temp jour de l’an.” In its many verses, the song celebrates the whole of the Christmas and New Year season.\nWhile on a recording trip in Louisiana in 1934, John and Alan Lomax recorded Lunéda Comeaux performing a song for dancing, “Fait le tour” (We danced all night), a song set on New Years Day after a dance. Joshua Caffery has made this and other recordings from the 1934 Louisiana field trip available online. In his book, Traditional Music in Coastal Louisiana: The 1934 Lomax Recordings (2013), Caffery notes that New Years Day is an appropriate time for asking a girl’s father if he can court her, so this song may relate to this romantic moment.5\nLomax traveled in Romania in 1964 and collected this medley of songs for the new year in Dragus: “Llaube (The Dawn) / Happy New Year / Strigaturi” performed by an unidentified group of men.\nIn many places Three Kings Day or Epiphany is celebrated in addition to Christmas. In some cultures it is the day that gifts are given as it celebrates the day that the wise men visited the new-born Jesus. “Los reyes magos,” sung by Araceli Garrido, Carmen Gómez, and Angelines Soberón is a song for Three Kings Day that Lomax recorded in Potes, Cantabria, Spain, in November 1952. That same month in Galacia, Lomax recorded a group singing a song for Three Kings Day with a bagpipe, “Buenas entradas de Reyes.”\nIn 1962 Alan Lomax was able to record a session of songs performed in French by a group led by Eugene Modestus in Paramain, Maraval, Trinidad. They performed as if they were singing for an all-night vigil at the crèche on the eve of Epiphany or, as they called it “the break up of Christmas,” even though it was the end of April. “Cantique,” is an example of the solemn songs often sung at this event. As the dawn comes, January 6th is greeted with more joyful songs, such as “Bon Novelle.”\nI hope you have enjoyed this tour of the Lomax songs of the holidays currently available. More are available in the collections listed below. As you will find as you explore these collections, a many people continue to hard to make Alan Lomax’s legacy available and to support research on the cultures he documented.\n1.

The choice between nylon and steel string guitars really comes down to what kind of sound you’d like to produce and what style of music you’d like to play. Can you rock out on a classical guitar? Play spaghetti western music on a dreadnought? Sure, the authorities won’t come for you. After all, there’s plenty of crossover with many a rock or pop song featuring a classical guitar (from Willy Nelson to Eric Clapton.) Traditionally, nylon string guitars are used for classical and flamenco music and steel string acoustics are used for rock, pop, and folk. But don’t be afraid to be a rebel.\nFor the beginner, there’s often the temptation to choose a nylon string over steel due to the softer feel of the nylon strings. This should always be weighed against the tone the instrument will produce and how that fits with the style of music you’d like to play.\nClassical or Flamenco?\nThe nylon string guitar you will most likely encounter in a music store or web site is a classical. In the majority of music stores you’ll find a much smaller contingent of flamenco guitars, if there are any at all. Classical or flamenco? Again, this boils down to the style of music you want to play, and again, there’s some crossover. Though they both use nylon strings, there’s some subtle, yet important, differences between the two. Click on the tabs for each to learn more.\nAbout the Author - Michael Barberich\nA New York guitar phenom from a young age, Michael still smiles looking back on playing his first bar gig at the ripe old age of fourteen. By eighteen, his acrobatic guitar style had caught the attention of a popular local band (whose members were all ten years older) and together they quickly conquered the legendary Long Island music scene, playing six nights a week to large audiences. Says Michael of this period, \"To fill time, the band would often throw me two solos per song. I did the math recently and realized I was playing about sixty solos a night times six nights a week. That's three hundred and sixty solos per week! That's really where I learned to play, on stage every night in front of lots of people.\"\nAs comfortable playing or producing in the studio as he is on the stage, Michael's varied career has afforded him the opportunity to work with many of his heroes including Steve Vai, Justin Hayward, Gary Brooker, Rod Morgenstein, Steve Howe and Cheap Trick. Always happiest with a guitar in his hand, you can find Michael showing his versatility performing with LI Hall of Fame inductees Barnaby Bye, Macca Nation (a tribute to Paul McCartney & Wings) or his kitschy 70's band, the insanely popular, 45rpm (voted Long Island's best cover band for 2013 and 2014.)\nClassical refers to the specific technique of finger style playing, the repertoire , and the style of the instrument. What once drew the distinction of being used to entertaining the aristocracy with works by Bach and Mozart now entertains the masses in the hands of Willie Nelson. Go figure. The classical guitar has traveled through many styles of music. From Andres Segovia to Paco de Lucia to Tom Morello. It’s an interesting journey.\nIn addition to the wood used in construction, the rich warm tone of a classical guitar is a function of its nylon strings, whose slinky feel make fretting a note or chord softer than on an acoustic guitar. This doesn’t mean that only soft sounds can be produced though. A classical guitar is one of the most expressive instruments in all of music with a wide dynamic range. Some characteristics of a classical guitar are a much flatter and wider fret board than you would find on an acoustic guitar. Classical players also like their action a little higher to produce a clear, full tone. You’ll notice the slotted headstock with the tuners inserted horizontally. You’ll also find that the strings are attached a little different than on an acoustic or electric at both the bridge and tuners. Unlike the standard acoustic guitar, the classical has no pick guard, leaving the gloss cedar or spruce top to resonate freely in concert with the rosewood or mahogany back and sides. The classical guitar can also be held differently depending on the style of playing. For instance, traditional Tarrega style is performed using a foot stool.\nCordoba Luthier C10 CD Classical Acoustic Guitar with Case\nCordoba Iberia C7 CDIN Classical Acoustic Guitar with Gig Bag\nTaylor 814CE-N Grand Auditorium Nylon Acoustic Electric wCase\nFlamenco guitar players use an aggressive, often rapid-fire, right-hand technique known as rasgueado where the strings are “raked” using the nail side of the fingers. For this reason, flamenco guitars often (but not always) employ pick guards or tap plates on either side of the sound hole. These serve a dual purpose as they not only protect the instrument’s finish, they are also used for the percussive tapping common in flamenco. Lastly, the action, or string height, on the slightly thinner neck of flamenco guitars is set very low to accommodate the playing style.\nCordoba GK Studio Negra Flamenco Acoustic Electric with Gigbag\nCordoba Iberia F7 Flamenco Classical Acoustic Guitar with Gigbag\nYamaha CG172SF Flamenco Guitar\nAny acoustic guitar is an amalgamation of the types of wood used to construct it and a nylon string is no different. Widely considered the major factor in producing the guitar’s tone, the soundboard, or top, is often made of a very resonant wood. Cedar is the most common for its production of a round, full bass with warm sounding trebles. Shades of cedar can run from tan through red or even brown. Also popular is spruce, which is usually lighter in color and produces a tighter, more focused sound with a bright, clear tone. Though a laminated top is less expensive, a solid top is much preferred and available for just a few dollars more. Favored by luthiers for its round bottom and smooth top, rosewood has been a perennial favorite for constructing the back and sides. Rosewood is darker in color than mahogany, another popular choice. Both lighter in color and weight, mahogany shades tend to range from a brick red to a light orange hue and provide a balanced, even tone. Cypress is the more traditional choice for flamenco guitars. Known for its quick and bright attack, cypress delivers ideal tone for flamenco playing styles.\nOf the six, the first three each consist of a single filament of DuPont nylon with the remaining three strings spun from bronze or copper wire plated with silver over a nylon core. Strings are available in either the traditional tie ends or ball ends, similar to an electric or acoustic guitar string. Tie ends tie at both, the bridge, and at the tuners. The string gauges are commonly listed as tensions. Medium tension, hard tension, extra-hard tension, etc.\nCan I String a Nylon Guitar with Steel Strings or a Steel String With Nylon?\nNo. Strings for nylon and steel string guitars are not interchangeable. Due to the difference in string tension between nylon and steel strings, this would wreak havoc on the instrument’s neck and top. There are also issues with the thickness of the strings and the associated tuning key openings. Lastly, most nylon strings lack the ball-end used on acoustic and electric guitars. In a nutshell, don’t do it. See all Classical Strings\nWith a full size scale of 25.6 inches, a classical guitar has roughly the same scale as a Telecaster. Great playing classical guitars can also be found in ½ and ¾ scale for smaller hands.\nAre you using this guitar for live performance? If so, you’ll want to consider getting a guitar with a pickup installed. This will allow you to amplify the instrument when performing with other musicians. Pickups can also be added on after your purchase. An under-saddle or internal mic system would require installation by a qualified professional but a transducer type is easily attached and removed.\nFishman Loudbox Mini Acoustic Guitar Amplifier\nMarshall AS100D Acoustic Soloist Guitar Amplifier\nBoss Acoustic Singer Pro Acoustic Guitar Amplifier"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:095e09ba-d8dd-4b8f-a04c-1df74324d21b>","<urn:uuid:7b04a9e0-0d19-481f-9645-e1b1d8c4c0be>"],"error":null}

Many Minnesota counseling programs are available that meet these requirements, though degrees from out-of-state schools may also be sufficient. Depending on the license pursued, applicants may also need to meet other work experience and testing requirements.\n1. Decide which area of counseling to pursue.\nThe first step towards a career in counseling is to decide which area of counseling you’d like to pursue. The pathways to Minnesota counseling licensure vary and knowing which type of counseling interests you is important because it will help you focus on the correct degree program required for licensure.\n2. Earn the degree(s) required for your counseling practice area.\nIn Minnesota, you will need at least some post-secondary education to begin your career as a counselor. Some types of licensure also require graduate-level education in a related field. For example, mental health counselors must have a master’s degree with an internship component and specific clinical coursework and marriage and family therapists must have a master’s degree in marriage and family therapy or a closely related field. School counselors can begin the licensure process with a bachelor’s degree and 24 credits of related graduate study, but a graduate degree is required for full licensure. Substance abuse counselors are not required to have a graduate degree, but a bachelor’s degree with a supervised practicum is required.\n3. Get licensed to practice counseling in Minnesota.\nThe final step is to become licensed by in Minnesota. In Minnesota, licenses for clinical mental health counselors and substance abuse counselors are issued by the Minnesota Board of Behavioral Health and Therapy and licenses for marriage and family therapists are issued by the Minnesota Board of Marriage and Family Therapy. School counselors are licensed by the Minnesota Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board. Continue reading to learn more about these licensure processes.\nLicensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC) Licensing Process\nThe Minnesota Board of Behavioral Health and Therapy is responsible for issuing licenses to mental health counselors, known as Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors (LPCCs). LPCCs use professional counseling knowledge and skills to diagnose, evaluate, and treat psychosocial and behavioral issues and mental illnesses. The Board also offers LPC licensure, which allows trained counselors to provide psychotherapeutic services except for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. For more about a career in professional counseling, read our mental health counselor career guide. LPCC applicants in Minnesota must have an accredited graduate degree comprised of at least 48 credits, including a 700-hour internship and clinical coursework in six key areas, including diagnostic assessments and clinical ethics.\n1. Pass the National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE).\nProspective LPCCs must pass the National Clinical Mental Health Counselor Examination (NCMHCE) administered by the National Board of Certified Counselors (NBCC). The NCMHCE is a simulation-based exam designed to test your knowledge of clinical counseling theories and interventions. The NBCC provides a handbook and links to exam prep resources to help you study.\n2. Accrue supervised experience.\nThe Board has strict work experience requirements for LPCC candidates. You must complete 4,000 hours of supervised clinical experience, including assessments, diagnoses, and interventions of mental illnesses with children and adults. Additionally, 1,800 of the 4,000 hours must be direct client contact and you must receive two hours of supervision for every 40 hours accrued. Supervisors must have the LPCC Supervisor designation from the Board or submit an application and credential verification form to earn approval. Acceptable LPCC supervisors must have four years of experience, including two years of clinical diagnosis and treatment experience, and must complete 45 hours of supervision training.\n3. Apply for and receive your LPCC license.\nYou can begin the application process for LPCC licensure while you complete your supervised experience or after it has been completed. The application form is available online and should be mailed to the Board. At the time of application, you must pay the $150 application fee, the $250 initial licensure fee, and the $33.25 fingerprinting fee (fees current as of September 2019). The Board will send you more information about how to complete the fingerprint background check, which must be completed before your license will be approved.\nProfessional Counselor Licensure by Reciprocity in Minnesota\nMinnesota accepts and evaluates applications for licensure by reciprocity on a case-by-case basis. The burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the licensure process in the state where they are licensed is equivalent to Minnesota requirements for LPCC licensure. The license held should also have a similar scope of practice to LPCCs in Minnesota, including clinical mental health skills. Reciprocity applicants must submit transcripts, exam scores, and documentation of 4,000 hours of supervised clinical experience to be considered.\nCounselor Licensing Renewal and Continuing Education Information\nThe Board issues renewal notices and forms 45 days prior to expiration. Minnesota has a complex continuing education (CE) system for LPCCs. The first renewal period for an LPCC license is four years. During that time, the licensee must complete 12 credits of related graduate study, up to a maximum of 60 credits, including the graduate degree, and 40 hours of CE. One credit of graduate coursework may be counted as 15 hours of CE during this period up to the 40-hour requirement. Thereafter, the license must be renewed every two years and licensees must complete 40 hours of CE during each renewal cycle. CE activities must be approved by the Board by submitting a request form at least 60 days before the proposed activity.\nAdditional Counseling Careers and Licenses in Minnesota\nChoosing an area of focus in the counseling profession will determine the steps of your career path. In addition to mental health counseling, some of the other major types of counseling licensure summarized below include licensed marriage and family therapists, school counselors, and substance abuse counselors.\nLicensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT)\nLicensed marriage and family therapists are licensed by the Minnesota Board of Marriage and Family Therapy. LMFT applicants must have a graduate degree in marriage and family therapy or a closely related field that is preferably accredited by COAMFTE. If the program is not accredited by COAMFTE, it must meet specific coursework requirements set by the Board. In Minnesota, marriage and family therapy is a specialized form of counseling and LMFTs are licensed to provide psychotherapy to individuals, couples, and families for emotional and mental problems affecting interpersonal dynamics, including premarital and marital counseling, divorce counseling, and family therapy. To become a licensed marriage and family therapist, follow these steps:\n- Apply to the Board for permission to take the AMFTRB national exam in marriage and family therapy.\n- Accrue supervised experience.\n- Apply for your LMFT license.\n- Pass the Minnesota marriage and family therapy oral exam.\n- Receive your LMFT license.\nTo learn more about LMFT careers, visit our LMFT career guide.\nThe Minnesota Professional Educator Licensing and Standards Board is responsible for issuing school counselor licenses. Minnesota school counselors work with students from kindergarten through twelfth grade to help promote age-appropriate academic, emotional, and behavioral development, and resiliency skills among students. There are three school counselor licensing tiers (tier two, tier three, and tier four) and tier four is considered a full license. The minimum requirement to begin the licensure process at tier two is a bachelor’s degree and 24 credits of graduate-level study in school counseling, but an accredited graduate degree in school counseling will enable you to apply directly to tier three. If you have a master’s degree that is not in school counseling, you must complete an approved school counselor preparation program before applying. After completing your graduate education, earn tier four school counseling licensure by completing the following steps:\n- Register as a tier three school counselor with the Board.\n- Earn supervised experience.\n- Request and receive your tier four school counseling license.\nRead more about opportunities in this field on our school counseling career guide.\nLicensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC)\nThe Minnesota Board of Behavioral Health and Therapy is responsible for issuing licenses for substance abuse counselors, known in Minnesota as the Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC) credential. There are two pathways to licensure, known as the standard method and the supervision method. Both pathways have the same minimum required education, which is a bachelor’s degree with at least 18 credits in drug and alcohol counseling and an 880-hour supervised practicum. The application form can be found online. In Minnesota, LADCs work in a variety of settings, including treatment facilities, correctional facilities, and hospitals, to assess, evaluate, and modify addictive behaviors related to alcohol and drug abuse. To earn a LADC license, follow these steps:\n- Pass the required exam and earn supervised experience if required.\n- Apply for your LADC license.\n- Complete a fingerprint background check.\n- Receive your LADC license.\nOther Substance Abuse Counseling Credentials Offered in Minnesota\n- Advanced Alcohol and Drug Counselor Reciprocal – Minnesota (AADCR-MN)\n- Alcohol and Drug Counselor – Minnesota (ADC-MN)\n- Alcohol & Drug Counselor Reciprocal – Minnesota (ADCR-MN)\n- Certified Clinical Supervisor Reciprocal (CCSR)\n- Certified Criminal Justice Addictions Professional Reciprocal (CCJPR)\n- Certified Peer Recovery Specialist (CPRS)\n- Certified Peer Recovery Specialist Approved Supervisor (CPRSAP)\n- Certified Peer Recovery Specialist Reciprocal (CPRSR)\n- Certified Prevention Professional (CPP)\n- Certified Prevention Professional Advanced (CPPA)\n- Certified Prevention Professional Reciprocal (CPPR)\nMore information about what substance abuse counselors do can be found on our substance abuse counseling career guide.\nOther Professional Counseling Careers\nIn addition to the major fields listed above, there are many other ways to develop a professional counseling career.

Details of these courses must be included with your application and you must submit all course syllabi so the Board can verify that your education meets the clinical coursework requirements.\nWhat do substance abuse counselors do in Minnesota?\nIn Minnesota, licensed alcohol and drug counselors (LADCs) are expected to be proficient in 12 core areas to be licensed. Some of these core skills include conducting initial screenings to determine if a client is eligible for services, assessing client strengths, weaknesses, and needs with regards to substance abuse, creating treatment plans that identify short- and long-term goals, providing appropriate counseling services to the client, responding to crisis situations when the client is in distress, and making appropriate referrals when the client’s needs are outside the scope of their expertise.\nAre there counseling careers without a degree in Minnesota?\nAll the major types of counseling licensure summarized on this page require a degree, and some require a graduate degree with specific coursework. Mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists must have a graduate degree in a related field, preferably from an accredited program. Substance abuse counselors must have a bachelor’s degree. For school counseling licensure, a bachelor’s degree is necessary and although you can begin the licensure process with a minimum of 24 credits of school counseling graduate education, ultimately you must complete a graduate degree to achieve full licensure.\nDo I need to apply for an LPC license before I can become an LPCC?\nIt is not necessary to apply for the LPC license if you meet the requirements for LPCC, nor is it necessary to progress to the LPCC license if you are an LPC in good standing.

{"question":"What's the relationship between smoking and vitamin requirements for both brain health and vitamin C levels?","answer":"According to the documents, smokers face increased risks in both areas. Smokers are more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as non-smokers, as smoking decreases blood flow to the brain, depriving it of oxygen and nutrients. Regarding vitamin C specifically, smokers need an extra 35 mg of vitamin C per day because smoking causes the body to use up vitamin C at a faster rate than normal. This requirement also applies to people exposed to second-hand smoke.","context":["Why does it seem like the brain, your most important part, is left to fend for itself? Even if there are no bookshelves dedicated to it, you can feed and improve your brain just like any other body part, with more important, more life-altering results.\nOne of the greatest fears and dangers of growing older is Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is progressive and irreversible. It changes behavior, erases personality and impairs memory and thinking, by causing the brain to develop abnormal protein deposits and tangle nerve fibers that damage brain cells.\nThe chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease are partly genetic, but current research is uncovering several lifestyle and dietary factors that also play a role. In other words, you can prevent brain drain with your eating and exercise decisions.\nCheck out the following health tips to help maintain your brain power:\n1. Be a Mover and Shaker\nDaily physical activity can lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, bathing it with vital nutrients and oxygen. Exercise also helps control cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and weight. All of these increase the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Work that heart muscle, for 30 minutes daily if possible, by walking, swimming, biking, golfing, or hiking. 2. Be a Thinker\nKeeping the mind active can help lower the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Stimulate your brain with board games, cards and puzzles. Read a book, magazine or newspaper. Sing a song, play an instrument or learn a new language. These brain-challenging activities increase the blood flow, establish more connections between the brain cells and stimulate brain cell growth.\n3. Go Fishing\nEating fish and other food sources high in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce one’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Omega-3 fatty acids are important components of brain cells and may help to reduce inflammation of the brain. Omega-3 fatty acids also help to protect arteries and improve blood flow to the brain. So go fishing for some salmon, sardines, tuna, shrimp, shellfish, walnuts, olives, olive oil, canola oil, soybean oil, flaxseed, and flaxseed oil…all excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids.\n4. Fat Attack\nsaturated fat and trans fatty acids may increase the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. These unhealthy fats are found in high-fat meats, high-fat dairy products, many margarines and other processed foods. They promote the buildup of the Low Density Level Lipoproteins (LDL), the \"bad\" cholesterol. This may cause a narrowing of the arteries, reduce blood flow to the brain, and cause inflammation.\nPreliminary research is showing a connection between folate, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6 intake and Alzheimer’s disease. It appears that people with Alzheimer’s disease have higher levels of homocysteine (a body chemical that causes arteries to clog) in their blood. Although homocysteine levels naturally increase with age, high levels are also due to a diet low in folate, vitamin B-12 and vitamin B-6. Until more is uncovered about this chemical’s effect on the brain, eat a diet high in the B-vitamins. For vitamin B-12, reach for lean meats, fish, chicken, milk and cheese. For vitamin B-6 and folate, include more dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, and collard greens, broccoli, oranges, orange juice, lima beans, asparagus, whole grains, and fortified grain products.\nThe brain can be damaged by free radicals in the body and their oxidation effect. So eating a diet high in antioxidants (vitamin E and vitamin C) can help lower the risk of these harmful effects and protect the brain. Dietary sources of vitamin E include whole grains, nuts, seeds, milk, egg yolks, wheat germ, and vegetable oils. Vitamin C sources include citrus fruits, kiwi, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes, and peppers.\n7. A Boost with Blueberries\nBlueberries contain compounds that can improve short-term memory, navigational skills, balance and coordination. Current research indicates that blueberries can boost weakened neuron signals. Blueberries contain this powerful punch whether fresh, frozen or dried. Enjoy them by the handful, add them to your cereal, muffins, and pancakes, or whip up a blueberry-yogurt smoothie.\n8. Stop Smoking\nSmokers are more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease as non-smokers. Smoking decreases blood flow to the brain, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. The best defense is to stop smoking, but beta-carotene and flavonoids found in foods may help to offset the effects of smoking to some degree. If you continue to smoke, add more colorful fruits and veggies to your diet. Eat more kale, carrots, broccoli, spinach, cranberries, green and black tea, and legumes.\n9. Healthy Heart\nHigh blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease and diabetes may also increase the risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Once again, anytime blood vessels are damaged, the blood supply to the brain can be affected. It is important to know your numbers. Monitor your blood pressure reading, lipid profile tests, and blood glucose tests. See your physician regularly. Make appropriate dietary, lifestyle, and medication changes that are necessary to keep your body at peak performance.\nStudies have shown that chronic, excessive stress may alter the brain structure. This makes the brain more susceptible to damage by free radicals in the body and can result in neuron damage. To manage stress, try practicing meditation, muscle relaxation, yoga, or T’ai chi. Talk to a mental health professional, or sign up for a stress management class.\n11. Ginkgo Biloba\nIn the United States, Ginkgo Biloba is sold as a dietary supplement for memory enhancement. It is thought to protect the brain by reducing oxidation damage to the cells. Research has not shown Ginkgo Biloba to protect against Alzheimer’s disease, but it may help with very mild to moderate dementia. People with severe dementia showed no improvement when given Ginkgo Biloba. Most of the studies used between 120 milligrams to 240 milligrams daily. Discuss usage with your physician.\n12. Weighty Issues\nPeople are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease when a body mass index of 20-27 is maintained.\nWeight change is very common with those who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease:\n- In the early stages of the disease, some gain more than 5% of their initial body weight.\n- In the later stages, weight loss of 5%-10% is common. The risk of excessive weight loss increases with the severity of the disease.\n13. Spice Up Your Life\nThe yellow spice turmeric may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. This spice is used in Indian cuisine and is a major ingredient in curry powder. Sprinkle on potato soup, chicken soup, omelets, chicken entrees, veal, and cream sauces.\nThis is the only brain you’ve got. With some simple maintenance, it can perform as well as your body does for years to come.","Vitamin C is an antioxidant present in many fruits and vegetables. Also known as L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C has a wide variety of uses in the body. It supports normal growth and development and helps the body repair damaged tissue.[2, 3] Vitamin C also assists in the production of collagen, a protein that’s necessary for healthy skin, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels.\nTo say that vitamin C is beneficial would be an understatement. It influences iron absorption and helps fight cell-damaging free radicals. A 16-year study found that regular vitamin C supplementation promoted heart health. Additionally, people who consume foods rich in vitamin C or other antioxidants may lower their risk of high blood pressure.[7, 8, 9]\nHigh Doses of Vitamin C\nIn the 1970s, chemist and Nobel Peace laureate, Linus Pauling, proposed that high doses of vitamin C could help prevent the common cold. Many people swear by Pauling's claim that vitamin C can boost the immune system naturally, but the research is still inconclusive.\nA number of studies have examined whether high-dose vitamin C can provide extraordinary therapeutic results. Results thus far are inconclusive. However, animal studies have found that vitamin C may make traditional therapies more effective.\nNatural Dietary Sources of Vitamin C\nMany types of food are fortified with vitamins and vitamin C is usually in the mix. However, like all vitamins, it’s best to get your daily intake from organic, natural sources and the best, natural sources of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables. Below are some of the best foods for vitamin C.\n|Sources of Vitamin C|\n|Food and Serving Size||Vitamin C (mg/serving)|\n|Red or Yellow Bell Pepper, Raw, 1/2 cup||95|\n|Orange Juice, 3/4 cup||93|\n|Orange, 1 medium||70|\n|Grapefruit Juice, 3/4 cup||70|\n|Kiwifruit, 1 medium||64|\n|Green Bell Pepper, raw, 1/2 cup||60|\n|Broccoli, cooked, 1/2 cup||51|\n|Strawberries, fresh, sliced 1/2 cup||49|\n|Brussels sprouts, cooked, ½ cup||48|\n|Grapefruit, ½ medium||39|\n|Broccoli, raw, ½ cup||39|\n|Tomato juice, ¾ cup||33|\n|Cantaloupe, ½ cup||29|\n|Cabbage, cooked, ½ cup||28|\n|Cauliflower, raw, ½ cup||26|\n|1 Lemon Yield, 48g||18.6|\n|Potato, baked, 1 medium||17|\n|Tomato, raw, 1 Medium||17|\n|Spinach, cooked, 1/2 cup||9|\n|Green peas, frozen, cooked, 1/2 cup||8|\nDaily Intake of Vitamin C\nThe amount of vitamin C that a person needs may vary with factors like age or whether a person is smoking, pregnant, or even breastfeeding. These are the guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Dietary Supplements:\n|Recommended Daily Allowances of Vitamin C|\n|Age||Female||Male||Pregnant female||Breastfeeding female|\n|0-6 months||40 mg||40 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|7-12 months||50 mg||50 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|1-3 years||15 mg||15 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|4-8 years||25 mg||25 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|9-13 years||45 mg||45 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|14-18 years||65 mg||75 mg||80 mg||115 mg|\n|19+ years||75 mg||90 mg||85 mg||120 mg|\nDangers of Vitamin C Deficiency\nA lot of people might think “scurvy” is just pirate lingo, but it’s actually a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C. Symptoms of scurvy include fatigue, gum disease, anemia, scaly skin, and easy bruising. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in the United States these days but some people remain at risk.\nPeople who get too little variety in their food may not receive adequate nutrition. Normally, when we hear \"malnourished\" many of us think \"starving\", but what it's more likely to mean is that a person is deficient in specific nutrients and it's affecting their health. Those who rely on a carnivorous diet might miss their daily quota for vitamin C as meat and dairy don’t contain much of this critical nutrient. Infants fed evaporated or boiled cow's milk may not get enough vitamin C, especially since cow’s milk is low in vitamin C to begin with. Breast milk and infant formula are both better sources of vitamin C.\nSome medical conditions can cause vitamin C deficiency. Digestive tract injuries or inefficiencies, genetic diseases, and other issues can negatively affect not just vitamin C absorption, but nutrient absorption as a whole. Kidney disease and some types of cancer can also cause vitamin C deficiency.\nSmoking cigarettes is a bad idea for many reasons. One of the effects of the tissue damage it causes is the body using up vitamin C at a faster rate than normal. As a result, smokers and people exposed to second-hand smoke may need an extra 35 mg of vitamin C a day.\nVitamin C Supplementation\nUsually, if you follow a balanced diet with a foundation of organic fruits and vegetables, you’ll get all the vitamin C you need. If you don’t, vitamin C supplementation might be something to consider and discuss with your healthcare provider.\nBe aware of the difference between synthetic and natural vitamins. Synthetic supplements are manufactured with unnatural ingredients and chemicals. They are made to mimic natural vitamins but not everyone is convinced of their efficacy. Conversely, natural supplements are made using ingredients drawn straight from their natural sources.\nVitamin C supplements are usually available as ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, or calcium ascorbate. Synthetic and natural ascorbic acid have similar properties, but I always recommend a natural, plant-based source.[15, 16]\nIf your diet isn’t providing you with enough vitamin C, you should consider that it's not providing you with all the other nutrients your body requires, either. In such a case, you may want to skip the vitamin C supplement and look for a solid multivitamin. I recommend IntraMAX® and believe, without a doubt, that it’s the best multivitamin available anywhere. It’s an organic, liquid formula loaded with all the nutrients you need, as well as powerful antioxidant and immune system stimulators. It's as complete as it gets.\nWhere do you get your vitamin C?

{"question":"Could you explain how water kefir and traditional probiotic supplements compare in terms of bacterial diversity?","answer":"Water kefir contains a diverse array of bacteria and yeast in its SCOBY (symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast), including lactobacillus hilgardii, while probiotic supplements typically contain only one or two probiotic strains. Research has shown that fermented foods, like water kefir, have greater bacterial diversity than supplements, which is better for health. Additionally, supplements aren't regulated and aren't guaranteed to be high quality, while fermented beverages like water kefir create an environment where healthy bacteria can naturally thrive.","context":["The Benefits of Foods High in Probiotics\nJuly 22, 2019\nYou've probably seen probiotic supplements and foods high in probiotics at your local grocery store. But are probiotics good for you? Are the stories about probiotics and gut health true? Here's a look at the benefits of a probiotic-rich diet and which foods are best in the world of probiotics.\nWhat Are Probiotics?\nProbiotics contain live microorganisms, like bacteria and yeasts, that provide health benefits and come in the form of supplements or food, NIH shares.\nThe microorganisms are the same or similar to ones that naturally live in your body, such as the bacteria in your intestines that help digest food. The most common bacteria in probiotics are bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, but probiotics may include other microorganisms too.\nThe Benefits of Probiotics\nAccording to Cleveland Clinic, the benefits of probiotics include:\n- Decreasing bad bacteria in your gut that may cause infection or swelling.\n- Stabilizing barriers against bad bacteria.\n- Replacing good bacteria lost from antibiotics.\n- Restoring the good versus bad bacteria balance in your body.\nBy doing all this, the NIH says probiotics can help with a number of issues:\n- Minimizing digestive disorders like diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome.\n- Alleviating or diminishing allergies like hay fever or eczema.\n- Helping with liver disease, infant colic or the cold.\nHarvard Health notes that probiotics can also be used in the treatment or prevention of:\n- Crohn's disease\n- H. pylori (which causes ulcers)\n- Ulcerative colitis\n- Vaginal infections and UTIs\n- Digestive tract infections\n- Reducing bladder cancer recurrence\nWhile there is still a lot to learn about probiotics, the research is promising. Most people have few or minor side effects from taking probiotics, but anyone with a compromised immune system should consult their doctor first.\nFoods High in Probiotics\nMany fermented foods, like yogurt, pickles and sauerkraut, are naturally high in probiotics, according to Mayo Clinic.\nKimchi is a Korean food made from fermented and salted vegetables, like radishes and cabbage. It may have seasonings like garlic, ginger and chili powder, Men's Health shares.\nYogurt has live and active cultures, like lactobacillus bulgaricus. Greek yogurt is an especially good choice because it has more protein and less sugar and sodium than many other types of yogurt.\nOlives are also a good probiotic; they have healthy fats and are full of antioxidants, Time reports.\nTempeh, which is made of fermented soybeans, is also high in protein and can help lower cholesterol. Miso, a paste made from soybeans, is delicious to eat in the form of miso soup.\nOther high-probiotic foods include milk, buttermilk and some soft cheese, according to Cleveland Clinic.\nProbiotic Food vs. Supplements\nAlthough there's nothing wrong with taking supplements, you might see better results with a healthy diet that includes fiber-rich and probiotic-rich foods, Men's Health suggests.\nSupplements, which may have only one or two probiotic strains, aren't regulated, so they aren't guaranteed to be high quality. When researchers compared the bacteria in supplements versus fermented foods, they found a greater diversity in probiotic foods, which is better for your health, Phys.org notes.\nIn general, probiotic foods are a better choice than probiotic supplements, Cleveland Clinic concludes. Some probiotic foods are low-calorie and very filling, and others come full of vitamins and minerals that your body needs. The environment provided by a fermented food lets healthy bacteria thrive while also creating short-chain fatty acids that can help with inflammation, cholesterol and immunity.\nEvery now and then, you might want to add a supplement to your probiotic-rich diet if you want a particular bacteria strain not available in the foods you're eating. You might also want to add some prebiotic foods that help your good bacteria thrive, like onions, asparagus, beans, leeks, garlic and green bananas.\nAre Probiotics Worth the Hype?\nSo are probiotics good for you? The answer is a resounding yes. And when you're considering how to add probiotics to your daily routine, lean toward food high in probiotics rather than supplements. Not only are probiotic foods delicious, but they're great for your health too.","Water kefir drinks are a healthy, tasty and non dairy way to quench your thirst while potentially adding more beneficial gut friendly cultures to your diet.\nQ. What is Water Kefir?\nWater kefir is made from what is referred to as “grains”. They are not however actual grains in the traditional sense ( no gluten) , but rather are small, translucent, gelatinous structures and are comprised of assorted bacteria and yeast ( otherwise known as a SCOBI , a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast ). This SCOBI includes lactobacillus hilgardii which gives them their characteristic crystal-like appearance. When properly cared for and regularly cultured, they produce a wonderful probiotic-rich beverage and will continue to grow and reproduce indefinitely.\nThe beneficial bacteria and yeast metabolise the ingredients into an array of beneficial acids and infusing it with beneficial microorganisms, additional B vitamins as well as food enzymes.\nQ. Where did Water Kefir come from?\nWhere the grains originated for certain, like all of the fermented food starter cultures, is very difficult to pinpoint. Water kefir is known under many different names in different cultures. such as tibicos ,tibi, water kefir grains, sugar kefir grains, Japanese water crystals and California bees.\nThere are some that speculate towards Mexico. According to some research, the tibicos culture forms on the pads of the Opuntia cactus as hard granules that can be reconstituted in a sugar-water solution as propagating tibicos. There is documentation from the late 1800s of water kefir grains being used in fermented drink made from the sweetened juice of the prickly pear cactus in Mexico.\nThere are, however, other stories that place their origin, or at least their use, in Tibet, the Caucasus Mountains, and the southern peninsula of the Ukraine. Determining an exact place of origin is made even more difficult by the fact that water kefir cultures can now be found throughout the world and no two cultures are exactly the same. A lack of recorded history also makes it difficult to place an origin date, but it seems that these grains have been used for many centuries.\nQ. Is water kefir good for everyone?\nThe GI tract or gut, is one big ecosystem, made up of over 500 diverse bacterial species. Much recent research is finding that the quantity and diversity of beneficial bacteria have a much bigger impact on overall health than the medical community initially presumed. The ambition is to make the gut an inviting place for beneficial bacteria to settle down and grow. One of the best ways people can do this is with healthful fermented foods like raw sauerkraut, kimchi, and beverages like kefir and kombucha.\nQ. What’s the difference between Kombucha and Water Kefir and Milk Kefir?\nBoth kombucha and kefir start off with a sugar-containing liquid ( in the case of Milk kefir ,lactose is a milk sugar) and a SCOBY culture in order to kick off fermentation. Meaning they all contain beneficial bacteria for gut health with variations in the strains of bacteria and yeast between the different SCOBI’s .\nAlthough kefirs and kombucha all contain healthful microbes, kefir is a richer source of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Kombucha has aceto bacteria that produces the vinegar. So you could think of kefir as a drinkable probiotic supplement, and kombucha as more of a digestive aid. Another difference is that kombucha typically has caffeine, since it’s made from tea. Milk kefir also contains a good amount of calcium, while water-based kefir and kombucha do not.\nSome further reading :\nPidoux, M. (1989).

{"question":"Which research facility is located deeper underground: AVATAR X Lab in Japan or Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy? Please provide the depths in meters!","answer":"The Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy is located deeper underground. It is covered by about 1400 meters of rock. The AVATAR X Lab, in contrast, floats eighteen meters above a crater bottom, making it an above-ground structure rather than an underground facility.","context":["Clouds Architecture Office have revealed a new design for a space research lab that floats above a crater in Oita, Japan. The space age has allowed us to leave Earth for the first time to explore other worlds, opening the door to a new era of discovery. In conceptualizing the design for the AVATAR X Lab @ Oita campus, Clouds AO wanted to convey the innovative spirit and energy of the space age.\nThe project is a partnership between ANA Holdings Inc. and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA); a part of AVATAR X, a collaborative program for the advancement of space exploration and development. ANA and JAXA are both experts at launching vehicles into the atmosphere, the feeling of suspension or ‘being in the air’ is natural for both entities. The AVATAR X Lab Building is designed as a suspended building floating above a moon-like crater. The multi-story structure floats eighteen meters above the crater bottom, and is accessible by a bridge.\nWhen astronauts board a spacecraft they cross a bridge; when we board a plane we walk across a jet bridge between the terminal and airplane. This is their last contact with familiar ground before taking off for someplace new. The suspended building embodies this crossing of thresholds: after passing over the bridge you are transported to a new place, the AVATAR X Lab Building, where technological innovation will change how we see the world.\nThe research campus will be located in Oita prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. The site was chosen due to its resemblance to a lunar landscape. The campus will be used as a test field for a consortium of global tech companies who have signed up to participate in developing Avatar. The campus will consist of several buildings, as well as a moon simulation terrain, which will be used to experiment with tele-operated remote semi-autonomous construction of lunar surface habitats using Avatar robots.\nThe AVATAR X Lab Building will be situated at the heart of the Oita campus, floating above a crater. The site plan is a radial organization centered around the crater, with other programmatic elements based on five directives necessary for human advancement in space as defined by JAXA, orbiting around them.\nThe design for the AVATAR X Lab Building is intentionally iconic, conveying the pioneering spirit of flight, by utilizing construction techniques gathered from space architecture and aviation. The AVATAR X Lab Building will be a unique symbol representing the leading edge of technological development.\nAVATAR X is part of ANA’s AVATAR Vision a breakthrough endeavor to advance and pioneer real-world Avatar technologies, and JAXA’s new research and development program J-SPARC (JAXA Space Innovation through Partnership and Co-creation). Together with a growing list of public and private partners, AVATAR X hopes to catalyze new space-based businesses that will provide key services and an unprecedented level of access to space.\nLocation: Oita, Kyushu, Japan\nDesign Architect: Clouds Architecture Office\nProject Team: Masayuki Sono, Ostap Rudakevych, Yuko Sono, Kevin Huang\nStructural Design: Jun Sato / University of Tokyo + Jun Sato Structural Engineers Co Ltd\nModel Photography: GION\nNews courtesy of Clouds Architecture Office","Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso\nOverview of overground laboratories of LNGS\n|Research type||Particle physics, nuclear physics|\n|Director||Lucia Votano; Stefano Ragazzi (since October 2012)|\n|Location||L'Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy|\n|Beyond the Standard Model|\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) is the largest underground research center in the world. Situated below Gran Sasso mountain in Italy, it's well known for particle physics research by the INFN. In addition to a surface portion of the laboratory, there are extensive underground facilities beneath the mountain. The nearest towns are L'Aquila and Teramo. The facility is located about 120 km from Rome.\nPrimary mission of the laboratory is to host experiments that require a low background environment in the field of astroparticle physics and nuclear astrophysics and other disciplines that can profit of its characteristics and of its infrastructures. The LNGS is, like the three other European underground astroparticle laboratories, Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane, Laboratorio subterráneo de Canfranc, and Boulby Underground Laboratory, a member of the coordinating group ILIAS.\nThe laboratory consists of a surface facility, located within the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park, and extensive underground facilities located next to the 10 km long Traforo del Gran Sasso freeway tunnel.\nThe first large experiments at LNGS ran in 1989; the facilities were later expanded, and it is now the largest underground laboratory in the world.\nThere are three main barrel vaulted experimental halls, each approximately 20 m wide, 18 m tall, and 100 m long. These provide roughly 3×20×100=6,000 m2 (65,000 sq ft) of floor space and 3×20×(8+10×π/4)×100=95,100 m3 (3,360,000 cu ft) of volume. Including smaller spaces and various connecting tunnels, the facility totals 17,800 m2 (192,000 sq ft) and 180,000 m3 (6,400,000 cu ft).\nThe experimental halls are covered by about 1400 m of rock, protecting the experiments from cosmic rays. Providing about 3400 metres of water equivalent (mwe) shielding, it is not the deepest underground laboratory, but the fact that it can be driven to without using mine elevators makes it very popular.\nSince late August 2006, CERN has directed a beam of muon neutrinos from the CERN SPS accelerator to the Gran Sasso lab, 730 km away, where they are detected by the OPERA and ICARUS detectors, in a study of neutrino oscillations that will improve on the results of the Fermilab to MINOS experiment.\nIn May 2010, Lucia Votano, Director of the Gran Sasso laboratories, announced that \"[t]he OPERA experiment has reached its first goal: the detection of a tau neutrino obtained from the transformation of a muon neutrino, which occurred during the journey from Geneva to the Gran Sasso Laboratory.\" This finding indicates a deficiency in the Standard Model of particle physics, as neutrinos would have to have mass for this change to occur.\nAn effort to determine the Majorana/Dirac nature of the neutrino, called CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), is scheduled to begin in 2012. The detector will be shielded with lead recovered from an ancient Roman shipwreck, due to the ancient lead's lower radioactivity than recently minted lead. The artifacts are being given to CUORE from the National Archaeological Museum in Cagliari.\nIn September 2011, Dario Autiero of the OPERA collaboration presented findings that indicated neutrinos were arriving at OPERA about 60 ns earlier than they would if they were travelling at the speed of light. This Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly was not immediately explained. The results were subsequently investigated and confirmed to be wrong. They were caused by a flawed optic fiber cable in OPERA receiver of the laboratory, resulting in late arrival of the clock signal to which the neutrinos' arrivals were compared.\nIn 2014 Borexino measured directly, for the first time, the neutrinos from the primary proton-proton fusion process in the Sun. This result is published on Nature. This measurement is consistent with the expectations derived from the standard solar model of J. Bahcall along with the theory of solar neutrino oscillations as described by MSW theory. It can be regarded as a cornerstone for our understanding of the PP-chain that fuels our Sun.\n- Colosimo, Gabriele; Crespi, Mattia; Mazzoni, Augusto; Riguzzi, Federica; Jones, Mark; Missiaen, Dominique (14 April 2012), Determination of the CNGS global geodesy (PDF), p. 6, OPERA public note 132 v3\n- \"INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso Annual Report 2011\" (PDF). p. 4.

{"question":"¿Pourquoi les community cats need medical attention - what specific health risks do they pose to humans and other animals?","answer":"Community cats require medical attention because they can carry multiple diseases transmissible to both humans and other animals. For humans, they can transmit zoonotic diseases including cat-scratch disease (causing fever and lymphadenopathy), rabies (a fatal viral encephalomyelitis), Toxoplasma (particularly dangerous for pregnant women), Cryptosporidia (causing diarrhea), Giardia (causing nausea and abdominal issues), and various parasites like hookworms and roundworms. For other animals, they can spread conditions such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia (FeLV), feline panleukopenia, and various parasitic infections. This is why trap-neuter-vaccinate-return (TNVR) programs are important for community cats, as they help control these health risks through proper veterinary care and vaccination.","context":["There are two reasons why you might want to learn how to trap cats humanely:\n- To rescue animals in danger. If you are rescuing animals in danger, you should be aware that they will require at least basic medical care and may need more extensive treatment. They may have diseases, injuries or major behavior challenges.\n- For trap-neuter-vaccinate-return (TNVR). If you get involved in a TNVR program for community cats, you’ll need to know how to successfully trap the cats to transport them to a veterinarian for spay/neuter surgery.\nBefore becoming involved in trapping animals, consider what you’ll be getting into: You will be the guardian (either temporarily or permanently) of an animal who may not have the social skills for living in our human world. Once trapped, an unsocialized animal will most likely be terrified and might thrash about in the trap, trying to escape. If your plan is to have the animal live with people as a pet, you should know that some animals need a great deal of time and attention before adoption can take place. Of course, some strays may eventually become wonderful family pets – which is possibly what they once were. However, keep in mind that animals that have never been socialized to humans may remain feral and might never become adoptable.\nIf you intend to trap a community (aka stray, feral) cat, consider what is in the best interest of the animal. The cat may have people in the community who are taking care of her and would miss her if she was gone. In most cases, if community cats appear to be healthy and are not in imminent danger, we recommend providing TNVR and returning them to the community.\n“Safety first” should be your mantra! Bites and scratches can lead to infection, so be careful and be prepared. While they may look harmless, very young animals can inflict serious bites. Learn first aid for yourself and others, including emergency aid for packaging injured animals for transport to a veterinarian.\nRead up on zoonoses (diseases that can be passed from animals to people) and seek medical attention if you become ill. Zoonoses include internal parasites like roundworms and hookworms, and external parasites like fleas and ticks (which can carry Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever). Other diseases transmissible to humans include ringworm, a fungal disease, and rabies and encephalitis, which are viral diseases. More information about zoonotic diseases can be found on the website of the Centers for Disease Control at www.cdc.gov (search for “zoonoses”).\nYou should also learn about diseases and conditions that are transmissible to other animals, rather than to people, such as parvovirus, canine distemper, feline panleukopenia, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia (FeLV), rabies, hantavirus, canine transmissible venereal tumors (CTVT), heartworm, mange, and worms and more worms (pin, tape, round, hook, whip). The American Veterinary Medical Association has excellent information about several of these conditions on their website: www.avma.org.\nWork with others\nDon’t try to do it all yourself – get other people involved. For one thing, traps are heavy once an animal is inside, so you may need help carrying the traps. To socialize animals who are lacking social skills, you’ll want to have people and other animals around to model healthy behavior. Placing animals that have medical or behavior challenges, training your foster parents and adopters, helping the rescued animals long-term – all these tasks are a lot more manageable if you have a team of people working together toward a common goal.\nYou might want to contact local wildlife management and animal control personnel, since they may be helpful if you have any questions or concerns. They may also be working on the same goal or know of other people involved.\nHere’s a list of items you’ll need for trapping:\n- Humane traps sized for the animals you are going to trap\n- Towels to cover the trap if you’ll be trapping cats\n- Blankets, for covering dog-sized traps\n- Newspaper or absorbent material to line the inside of the trap\n- Work gloves, for protection\n- Exam gloves, to wear anytime surfaces might be contaminated\n- First-aid kit\n- Antibacterial hand sanitizer\n- Disinfectant, bactericide and virucide cleaner to use on all surfaces and as a foot bath (read the labels carefully to find out how to use them)\n- Washable liner (tarp) to put in your vehicle, under the trap\nIf you need to buy a trap, you can purchase one online. Tomahawk Live Trap at www.livetrap.com is a good source. Other tools that can be helpful include throw nets, animal control catchpoles, and fence panels and gates to create a small, free-standing pen. Gates can also be used as squeeze boxes and shields if necessary. For the safety of yourself and the animals, learn how to use all tools properly.\nSetting the trap\nBefore setting the trap out in the wild, make sure it works. Here are the steps for testing\n- Set the trap up on a level surface.\n- Place newspaper inside the trap for comfortable footing once the animal is inside.\n- Hold the door open.\n- Set your bait (wet food) behind the trip plate. Put the food directly on the newspaper lining instead of in a can or on a plate. (The reason for this is that some animals will walk in, pick up the can or plate, and walk out without springing the trap. Also, cans and plates can get in the way of the trapping mechanisms.)\n- While holding the door open, set the door with the trip-pin/rod.\n- Apply pressure to the trip plate to spring the door.\n- You can adjust the pressure needed by changing your pin/rod setting on the door.\nBefore going out to set a trap, go through your checklist of necessary items and make sure you have everything. It’s a good idea to carry a cell phone, along with a list of phone numbers you might need.\nIf you are unsuccessful at trapping an animal within 48 hours, try putting a trail of cat or dog kibble outside the trap, leading to the open door. Don’t put out too much food, though. If too much food or high-value food is given outside the trap, trapping will be a challenge. Leaving water outside the trap might help lure the animal in.\nOnce you have the animal in the trap, keep in mind that the experience is probably very frightening for the animal. Wear your protective gloves in case the animal tries to bite through the trap. Covering the trap before lifting it may help prevent the animal from thrashing about in a panic, trying to escape.\nDo not open the door, unless you are releasing an unwanted animal. Carry the trap to a secure place (ideally, to your veterinarian’s office) before opening the trap.\nFor more on TNVR\nIf you’re trapping community cats for the purpose of sterilizing them and then returning them to their neighborhoods, you’ll need a lot more information. Below are some additional Best Friends resources. Alley Cat Allies’ website (www.alleycat.org) also contains a wealth of resources.","Cat-scratch Disease: Bartonella henselae, a rickettsial organism, is associated with cat-scratch disease. In young cats a chronic, asymptomatic bacteremia can occur. The disease can be transmitted to humans by bites, scratches or licks and can result in regional lymphadeopathy, fever, headache and splenomegaly. In immunocompromised people, a severe systemic or recurrent infection can occur.\nPrevention: The use of appropriate handling techniques and protective clothing should minimize the likelihood of exposure to bites and scratches from cats.\nRabies: The incidence of rabies in wildlife in the United States has increased in recent years and there is a possibility of transmission to dogs and cats with uncertain vaccination history. Rabies is very rare in the laboratory environment but any random source animal or wild animal showing central nervous system signs must be considered a potentially rabid animal. The rabies virus is most commonly transmitted to other animals or humans by the bite of a rabid animal or by introduction of saliva containing the virus into skin wounds or intact mucous membranes. Rabies produces a fatal acute viral encephalomyelitis.\nPrevention: Pre-exposure immunization should be available to personnel working with or caring for animals of uncertain vaccination status or those who work with wildlife known to be reservoirs of rabies.\nToxoplasma: The coccidian parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, has its complete life cycle in cats. Humans can act as an intermediate host for the parasite and can become infected with T. gondii by fecal material from infected cats. Toxoplasma usually produces an asymptomatic infection or a mild infection with flu-like symptoms. Infection in immunosuppressed people can be much more severe. Infection of a previously uninfected pregnant woman can result in death of the fetus or birth defects.\nPrevention: Personnel should practice good personal hygiene which includes frequent washing of hands after handling animals or animal waste. Proper disposal of cat feces and litter before the infective form of the parasite develops will also prevent spread of this disease.\nCryptosporidia: Cryptosporidium species have a worldwide distribution and can be found in many animal species including cats. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by protozoan parasites that live in the intestines of mammals. Cryptosporidiosis is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and can cause diarrhea in humans. Usually the diarrhea is self-limiting but in immunocompromised individuals the disease can have a prolonged course.\nPrevention: Appropriate personal-hygiene practices which include washing hands after contact with animals or their waste should prevent spread of this organism.\nGiardia: Giardia species are present in wild animals and laboratory animals, including dogs and cats. Giardia is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Human infection can be asymptomatic or cause nausea, abdominal cramping, and intermittent diarrhea.\nPrevention: Good personal hygiene which includes hand washing after contact with animals or their waste will help prevent spread of this organism.\nCampylobacter: Campylobacter species can be found in pet and laboratory animal species. Transmission to humans is by the fecal-oral route and can produce an acute enteritis. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.\nPrevention: Use of personal protective clothing, good personal hygiene, and sanitation measures will help to prevent the transmission of the disease.\nRingworm: Dermatophytes, which are fungi, cause ringworm in humans and animals. Infection in animals may be inapparent and is transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals or by indirect contact with contaminated equipment or materials. Dermatophytes produce flat, circular lesions that are clear in the center and crusted and red on the periphery.\nPrevention: The use of protective clothing, disposable gloves, and hand washing along with good personal hygiene will help to reduce the spread of dermatophytosis in a laboratory animal facility.\nSalmonellosis: Along with a variety of other species, Salmonella, and other enteric bacteria are capable of causing disease in humans. Salmonellae are transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Infection produces an acute enterocolitis and fever with possible secondary complications such as septicemia.\nPrevention: Use of protective clothing, personal hygiene which include hand washing after contact with animals or their waste, and sanitation measures prevent the transmission of the disease.\nAscariasis: Toxocara canis, the dog ascarid or round worm, is a cause of larva migrans syndromes in children. The ascarid of cats, Toxocara cati, is also capable of causing disease in humans. When eggs of either species are accidentally ingested, they will hatch and the infective stage larvae will migrate outside of the intestinal tract (larva migrans). Liver, lungs and other organs and tissue can be permanently damaged by the migrating larvae. Infected children may be left with permanent vision or neurologic damage.\nPrevention: Appropriate testing and treating of research dogs and cats for intestinal parasites will prevent the spread of ascarid between animals and lower the risk for personnel. Good personal hygiene to include hand washing after contact with dogs and cats and their waste will help prevent this disease in humans.\nHookworms: Ancylostoma caninum, Ancylostoma braziliense, Ancylostoma tubaeforme and Uncinaria stenocephala, are the hookworms of dogs and cats. People can also become infected when the larvae in soil or on other surfaces are ingested or directly penetrate the skin. These parasites then migrate under the skin creating cutaneous larva migrans syndromes characterized by pruritic, linear eruptive lesions. A. canium larvae are capable of penetrating into other tissues and inducing symptoms of visceral larva migrans or can migrate and mature in the intestine and cause an enteritis.\nPrevention: Appropriate testing and treating of research dogs and cats for intestinal parasites will prevent the spread of hookworms between animal and lower the risk for personnel. Good personnel hygiene to include hand washing after contact with animals or their waste will help prevent disease in humans.\nRisk assessment- UC Davis\nOccupational Health and Safety in the Care and Use of Research Animals, National Research Council; National Academy Press, 1997.\nCenter for Disease Control- Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bd353b5f-582c-4943-998c-178cf192d755>","<urn:uuid:1356c876-0717-4da5-aff5-1017422847b1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the economic consequences of climate change, and how can weatherization programs help address these impacts?","answer":"Climate change causes significant economic damage through multiple channels: it negatively affects property and critical infrastructure, impacts human health and productivity, and harms sectors like agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism. In South Africa, tourism alone, which contributes up to 10% of GDP, may be severely affected due to habitat loss and changes in temperature. To address these impacts, weatherization programs that increase energy efficiency and improve indoor temperatures can help reduce health impacts of extreme temperatures and financial stress. These modifications may improve health outcomes for older adults through better sleep and cognitive function, while also providing community-wide reductions in air pollution exposure.","context":["Research Assistant Professor, Social Environment and Health Program\nAs an environmental epidemiologist and with funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Science Foundation, and Detroit community input, I study how social, economic, health, and built environment characteristics and/or air quality affect vulnerability to extreme heat and extreme precipitation. This research will help cities understand how to adapt to heat, heat waves, higher pollen levels, and heavy rainfall in a changing climate.\nI received my BA in Biology from the University of Chicago, with a specialization in Ecology and Evolution. Subsequently, I worked as a research assistant in the Clinical Trials Office at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit, MI before pursing a Masters in Public Health at the University of Michigan. I completed my MPH in 2008 and then completed my PhD in 2013 in the University of Michigan Department of Environmental Health Sciences, where I was a National Institute on Aging Public Health and Aging trainee. My dissertation focused on associations between high temperatures and hospital admissions and mortality among the elderly as well as sociodemographic and land cover characteristics that modify these associations. In my postdoctoral fellowships, I studied how social and environmental characteristics influence vulnerability to heat-related health effects, using data from longitudinal studies of cardiovascular health in seven U.S. cities as well as state and national records of severe health events.\nAssessing the Neuropsychological Benefits of Weatherization Programs\nModifications to homes that increase energy efficiency and improve indoor temperatures may reduce the health impacts of extreme temperatures and financial stress. We will characterize and monetize the health impacts of low-cost and higher-cost weatherization measures, which may improve the health of older adults through improvements to sleep, cognitive function, and financial worry as well as community-wide reductions in air pollution exposure. Weatherization interventions may allow older adults to both mitigate and adapt to extreme weather.\nClimate Change and Allergies (Institute for Global Change Biology)\nWith climate change, pollen levels are rising in many parts of the country.

He broke with the positivist orientation of the science and philosophy of his day, yet he elaborated critiques of historicism and of psychologism in logic. Not limited to empiricism , but believing that experience is the source of all knowledge, he worked on a method of phenomenological reduction by which a subject may come to know directly an essence.\nFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche ( / ˈ n iː tʃ ə / [ 42 ] or / ˈ n i tʃ i / ; [ 43 ] German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːt͡sʃə] ; October 15, 1844 – August 25, 1900) was a German philosopher , poet , composer , cultural critic , and classical philologist . He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy, and science, displaying a fondness for metaphor , irony , and aphorism . Nietzsche's key ideas include the \" death of God ,\" the Übermensch , the eternal recurrence , the Apollonian and Dionysian dichotomy, perspectivism , and the will to power . Central to his philosophy is the idea of \"life-affirmation\", which involves questioning of all doctrines that drain life's expansive energies, however socially prevalent those views might be.

But philosophy, Western Civilization's chief way of questioning, had in the process of philosophizing lost sight of the being it sought. Finding ourselves \"always already\" fallen in a world of presuppositions, we lose touch with what being was before its truth became \"muddled\".

A stroke that results from inadequate blood supply to the brain is referred to as an ischemic stroke. When a blood vessel to the brain breaks open and bleeds, it causes a hemorrhagic stroke.\nQ:When heart trouble is sensed, who waits at least two hours before help is called: Men or women?\nA:Both men and women.\nUnfortunately, Americans typically wait over two hours before calling for help when they have symptoms of heart disease. This can be a dangerous mistake.\nQ:The term \"heart failure\" means the heart has stopped working. True or false?\nWhen the heart does not pump strongly enough to circulate blood throughout the body, the condition is referred to as heart failure. This can occur because of heart muscle weakness or inadequate filling of blood into the heart chambers.\nQ:People can be born with heart disease. True or false?\nCongenital heart disease and congenital heart defects are heart problems that are present at birth. There are many forms of heart defects including abnormal design of the heart muscle, heart valves, and blood vessels into and out of the heart. Heart defects are common birth abnormalities, present in over 30,000 infants born annually.\nQ:Has heart disease ever been responsible for half of the deaths in America?\nHeart disease and stroke were the causes of 50% of deaths in the U.S. by 1950. At that time, it was not fully understood what led to cardiovascular disease and heart deaths were common in people 50 years of age.\nQ:What is the most common type of heart disease in the U.S.?\nA:Coronary artery disease.\nThe most common form of heart disease in the U.S. is coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD causes heart attacks because the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle is inadequate. Lifestyle changes and medications can reduce the risk of CAD.\nQ:What is the medical term for chest pain?\nSource quiz on MedicineNet\nImprove your Health I.Q. on Heart Diseaseback to top ↑\nHeart Disease Related Slideshows\nGet the latest treatment options.","Atherosclerosis is a condition that occurs when there is a build-up of plaque due to the deposits of fat in the arteries and other blood vessels. Generally, the blood vessels are thin-walled(tube-like) vessels that carry blood that contains oxygen and nutrients around the body.\nBecause the space within these tube-like vessels is quite small and just enough for blood to pass through, any build-up by the sides of the wall will cause difficulties in blood flowing, and this is precisely what causes atherosclerosis.\nUsually, your healthy blood vessels are elastic and flexible in nature. They can expand when there is an enormous blood flow and go back to its normal size after the blood flow. However, as we age, we tend to lose the elastic nature of our blood vessels.\nGenerally, the fact that we lose the elastic nature of our blood vessels as we age is normal. However, when there is a build-up of plaque within these blood vessels, it can also cause damage to these vessels and also causing a blockage to the blood flow to that organ.\nAs we get older, calcium, fat as well as cholesterol tend to start building up within our blood vessels resulting in the formation of a plaque. Once the plaque is formed within the blood vessels, especially the arteries, it causes a blockage, and as such, blood can’t flow normally into the other organs of the body.\nIn the body, there are arteries everywhere. If the arteries that supply major organs in the body, such as the kidney, the liver, heart, and so on, become blocked, then you have a huge problem. This blockage can result in you having a heart attack, kidney failure, heart failure, or even a stroke(either partial or complete).\nAtherosclerosis is one of the most common problems we face as we age. In fact, according to a recent study, the majority of people who tend to have atherosclerosis are the elderly, who are between the ages of 40 and above.\nOften, people interchange atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis; however, these two don’t mean the same thing. While atherosclerosis means the blockage of the arteries, arteriosclerosis, on the other hand, means the hardening of the arterial walls causing It to lose its elasticity and flexibility.\nMost times, doctors consider atherosclerosis is a problem that has to do with the heart. It is important to note that this condition is treatable and can also be prevented in many ways.\nWhat are the Causes of atherosclerosis?\nAtherosclerosis is caused by the building up of plaque within the arteries. Plaque is formed by the combination of calcium, fat, and cholesterol deposits within the blood vessels.\nHence, when there is the build-up of plaque in the arteries, it causes the obstruction of blood flow to the organs in the body.\nThe formation of plaque isn’t a one-time problem. Most times, little deposits have been dropped there, and over-time, they become an enormous blockade.\nAlso, over time due to the build-up of plaque in the arteries, the arteries may begin to harden as such most organs in your body begin to be deprived of oxygenated blood flow.\nThe following can cause your arteries to harden over time. They include:\n1. High Cholesterol\nMacroscopically, cholesterol is seen as that yellow waxy substance that is mostly seen occurring naturally in the body of all animals and also, in some food we eat. Humans generally need a healthy amount of cholesterol in the body to function.\nThis cholesterol often serves as a source of energy, especially when you have gone for an extended period without food. However, when this amount is exceeded in the body, it causes many problems. One of such problems is the clogging of the walls of the arteries.\nLittle amounts of cholesterol that has been dumped over time can lead to the formation of a hard plaque that can pose as a restriction of blood flow or cut off blood circulation entirely to the heart as well as other organs in the body.\nIt is a well-known fact that as we age, some organs in the body tend to lose their capacity to work as hard as they used to when we were younger. The higher you go in age, the harder your heart, your blood vessels, and your other organs have to work.\nIf you aren’t helping your heart and your blood vessels by exercising regularly, over time, your heart and arteries will become weak from all the work it has to do and, as such, lose its elastic strength.\nOnce this occurs, it results in the easy formation of plaque in the heart and can invariably lead to atherosclerosis.\n3. Unhealthy diet\nIt is important to eat as we need a healthy diet to survive. However, it is more important to eat right and healthy. Unhealthy food has been one of the leading causes of obesity, atherosclerosis, as well as some other diseases.\nAccording to the American Heart Association, it is recommended for us to keep a healthy heart functioning. We must be able to have the following in our diet and at a balanced proportion.\nA wide range of fruits and vegetables\nThe importance of fruits and vegetables in our diet can’t be overemphasized. Asides the fact that it releases so many healthy chemicals in our body, it also helps strengthen our heart and also helps in reducing the build-up of plaque in our arteries.\nIt is important to eat whole grains as they help you develop healthy cholesterol as well as serve as a good source of energy.\nLow-Fat dairy foods\nLow-Fat dairy foods contain a healthy kind of fat, and that is what your body needs to function.\nNuts and legumes\nThis type of food also gives you a healthy boost in your cholesterol levels and helps you feel quite full on time, effectively helping you to cut back on your food intake.\nPoultry and fish without skin\nIt is important to eat proteins to have a balanced diet. Poultry products such as chicken, Turkey, ducks, eggs, and so on are all excellent sources of protein. Eating of fish isn’t left out as well. However, when taking these foods, it is important or removes the skin before eating.\nResearch shows that the average skin of a chicken contains about 57% fat. Consuming that alone is enough cholesterol for three days. So, it is important that you have to remove the skin if you must go for poultry meat.\nOlive oils and sunflower oil\nOlives, as well as sunflower oil, are ultimately the best type of oil for you to use when cooking or frying. This is because they contain High-Density Lipoprotein(HDL), which is the good kind of cholesterol.\nAlso, according to the American Heart Association, about 60% of Americans consume large amounts of unhealthy foods, which puts them at risk of developing atherosclerosis as well as other heart-related diseases.\nSome of such unhealthy foods include:\n1. Sugary foods and drinks\nFoods such as candy, cakes, doughnut, and so on are not advisable for you as you grow older. According to AHA, all you need as a woman in a day are one to six teaspoons of sugar or 80-100 calories of sugar, and as a man, all you need is eight to nine teaspoons of sugar or no more than 150 calories of sugar in a day.\n2. Super Salty foods\nSalt is one food that is high in sodium, and when too much sodium is ingested, it can result in heart problems. The average amount of salt to be taken in a day is about 1,500mls a day. If you must take too much, you shouldn’t take more than 2,300mls in a day.\n3. Fatty foods\nMost fatty foods contain mostly trans fat. Trans fat is a type of fat that is rich in Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL). Low-Density Lipoproteins are very bad for your health. If you must take fatty foods, choose foods that are rich in unsaturated fats. This is because unsaturated fats contain High-Density Lipoproteins, which is very good for your health.\nSymptoms of atherosclerosis\nOne striking fact about atherosclerosis is that you may not experience any symptoms until there is a complete blockage of your arteries leading to no blood flow to the organ. Most times, people who suffer from atherosclerosis tend to have a stroke or a heart attack.\nIt is important to note that the signs of atherosclerosis are largely dependent on which of the arteries have been affected. For the purpose of this article, we will classify the signs based on where the plaque may be formed.\n1. If the blockage is in your Coronary arteries(Coronary arteries are the arteries present in your heart):\n- Arrhythmias: which is characterized by unusual heart sounds.\n- Angina is often characterized by intense sharp pains in the arms, the chest, necks, as well as their jaw.\n2. If the blockage is in any of the arteries that supply the brain, you may most likely experience the following:\n- Difficulty in seeing especially with the two eyes\n- Feelings of numbness and weakness in the patient’s hands and legs.\n- Difficulties in speaking to someone or understanding someone cogently enough.\n- Paralysis of the facial muscles leading to drooping face\n3. If the blockage is in any of the arteries that supply either the arms, the legs, the pelvis or the kidneys:\n- Kidney failure\n- Hypertension, which is characterized by the steady rise in blood pressure.\nIf you have these symptoms and you are not sure what you have, it is better to visit the doctor immediately. The first thing your doctor will perform is a physical diagnosis. He will check for your pulse to detect if your pulse is normal, racing, or weakened.\nNext, he will check for the presence of an aneurysm. An aneurysm is an abnormal bulging or stretching of an artery due to the weakened elasticity of the arterial wall. Also, your doctor might perform a healing test for you.\nThis test is to indicate how well your wound heals. If your injury is slow in healing, then you probably have a restriction in the flow of your blood. Also, your cardiologist will have to listen to your heart in order to see if you have any abnormal sounds.\nIt may mean that your arteries are blocked if you have some abnormal heart sounds such as a whooshing or a murmuring sound. Then he may require you to go for the following tests.\n1. A blood test\nThis test is done in order to check for the level of cholesterol in your blood.\n2. A Doppler Ultrasound\nA Doppler ultrasound is a particular kind of imaging test that uses sound waves to show the picture of your arteries to see if there is any blockage and in case there is any, where it is located.\n3. An Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)\nThis test is done specifically to look for any blockage in both your arms and thigh. Most times, the blood pressure is collected at these two places and then compared with each other.\n4. A Magnetic Resonance Angiography(MRA)\nA Magnetic Resonance Angiography test or a Computed Topography Angiography (CTA) is a scan that uses x-rays to make images of your large arteries. These images can help the doctor to identify if there is any blockage in your artery.\n5. A Cardiac Angiogram\nA Cardiac Angiogram is a type of chest x-ray that helps takes the images of organs in your chest(in this case, your heart) and helps the doctor identify if your coronary arteries have a problem.\nBefore this test is done, your doctor will have to inject a radioactive dye into your coronary arteries in order to get the best and clear images.\nAn Electrocardiogram popularly known as an ECG is a test that is carried out to measure the electrical activity of your heart and to detect any malfunctions or areas with a decreased amount of blood flow.\n7. An Exercise Tolerance or Stress Test\nAn Exercise Tolerance or Stress Test is done to check for your heart rate as well as your blood pressure when exercising. This test is mostly done with the patient running on a treadmill or exercising while on a stationary bicycle.\nYour doctor may require you to do a couple of these tests just to be sure that you have atherosclerosis. After confirming your diagnosis, then you will be required to go for treatment.\nMost times, the first type of treatment you will be required to undergo is basically a lifestyle change, as well as a change in eating habits. According to the American Heart Association, most people who have heart diseases live a sedentary lifestyle.\nIn other words, one of the first things your doctor will require of you is to start exercising more and eating less fatty foods. If your atherosclerosis is severe, your doctor may recommend other lines of treatment which includes:\nThere are certain drugs that can help in preventing atherosclerosis from getting worse. Such drugs include:\n- Statins and fibrates which specializes in reducing your cholesterol levels.\n- Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme(ACE) inhibitors: These drugs help to prevent your arteries from narrowing.\n- Beta-blockers or Calcium Channel blockers: These drugs effectively help to reduce your blood pressure\n- Diuretics: They are also known as water pills. They help to reduce your blood pressure.\n- Antiplatelet drugs and coagulants: These drugs help prevent the clotting of your blood and clog your arteries. An example of these drugs is aspirin. Doctors often recommend using aspirin for people who have a history of cardiovascular diseases, especially atherosclerosis.\nAccording to the AHA, a regimen present in aspirin helps in reducing the risk of having another episode of a heart attack. If you don’t have any prior history of any cardiovascular disease, one can still easily use aspirin for preventive purposes.\nIf medicines aren’t effective, your doctors may recommend the second option, which is the use of Surgery.\nSurgery is usually the last resort. When the skin is severely damaged or if the muscle tissues are too adhered to and endangered, your doctor may recommend either one of the following surgeries.\nBypass surgery is often done using the blood vessel from another part of your body or a tube that is synthetic in nature to divert the flow of blood from the narrowed or already blocked vessel.\nThis procedure is done by injecting a particular drug to dissolve the clot in the affected artery.\nThis procedure involves the use of surgical methods in removing fat deposits from the affected artery.\nThis involves the use of a catheter that has a sharp end to scrap off the fat deposits in your arteries.\nThis surgical process involves using a balloon and a catheter to expand the artery to allow for the free passage of blood. Sometimes, they may use a stent to help keep the artery open."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:34db122c-386d-49f5-a1ef-2569ebc21356>","<urn:uuid:8994fa86-0c2d-4a58-958c-b41d8c29f5e7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What innovative water conservation methods are implemented in the Adobe Systems Research Center?","answer":"The building employs multiple water conservation methods including waterless urinals, dual flushing systems, and water recycling for irrigation. Due to high water table preventing direct ground water recharge, they use rooftop rainwater harvesting, rainwater storage tanks, and reuse water for plumbing applications. They also have a solar hot water system for toilets and LPG boilers for kitchens.","context":["Green architecture today is slowly but surely progressing towards the mainstream in a most striking and unique fashion. We present here a model that meets the needs of the present by looking at the past, without compromising on the needs of the future.\nMoving from built environments that produce a sea of unintended externalised impacts to knowing and taking responsibility for those impacts is how green buildings take root. The Research and Development Center for Adobe Systems in Noida by SWBI Architects draws the spotlight on this notion.\nAs the team informs, “the campus is conceived as a highly utilitarian and functionality driven office conceptualised with an energy and ecological conservation approach. The brief was to plan a world class campus for over 2000 IT professionals in an energy efficient sustainable office space spread over 7 acres with 2 phases.”\nWorking for a programming giant that treads on the tag line –‘Back to Basics’, SWBI Architects explain that, “Adobe is a Spanish word for sun dried clay bricks – a basic building block. Thus a basic design philosophy was adopted using terracotta as the primary material expressed in a modern style. Terracotta is the new age green material which not only provides the ethnicity but also renders the technical advantage that an architect looks for. Being maintenance free, insect resistant and fungus proof are just some of its green properties.”\nThe architects tell us, “The scale was a challenge; hence an extensive research of Adobe’s newly commissioned facilities was undertaken before arriving at the final design solution.” Each phase consists of large data center labs, meeting and collaborative spaces and security and ancillary support functions.\nPlaced in a T-shaped manner, Phase I and II overlook landscaped courts that create an inviting micro climate. The parking and services blocks are wisely tucked away so that they are not visible from the workspaces,which in turn helps reduce the reflective heat component emitted by vehicles.\nA Distributed Privacy Framework Model allows creation of ‘me’ and ‘we’ spaces. The main spine runs through the entire campus and acts as a visual and physical buffer to the whole building. The ground floor houses the reception, cafeteria, training hall and library overlooking the pedestrian street.\nWhile the Phase 2 Block Core, in the Western Zone helps cut down the sun, the central Atrium is provided with a skylight for enhanced penetration of daylight in workspaces.The outdoor recreational activity zone with an amphitheater and sports facilities, located in the North is shaded throughout the year in order to help achieve optimum light and shade. The extended horizontal parasol diminishes the high altitude South sun in summer and admits the low altitude winter sun.\nThe East and West façades showcase minimum use of glass; this creates a glare free work environment. It also helps minimise heat gain from the building skin. An expansive, sloping landscaped area serves as a forecourt space for the building, comprising of feature walls that support the roof parasol that lends shade. A bio wall traps air pollutants and aids in lowering the surrounding air temperature and reduces cooling loads. Terracotta tiled screens and the parasol provide shaded pedestrian walkways delivering comfort. The building’s green roof is optimised to trap heat and provide solar shielding.\nThe architectural team has suspended a well thought out system in place in order to reduce heat gain. Shaded curtain walling mediates between the interior and the exterior while reducing heat gain and harvests daylight, thereby reducing interior lighting demands. The use of Albino paint on the roof keeps the building cool by reflecting sunlight.\nAn RCC (Reinforced Cement Concrete) structure with PT (Post-Tensioned) slabs assists in sound insulation. The use of AAC (Autoclaved Aeratad Concrete) Blocks, also tagged the green building blocks, render fire resistance and acoustic friendly components.\nApart from these passive measures, chilled beams help deploy radiant cooling while sensor based LED lighting helps conserve electricity. Ventilation through fresh air and water conservation through waterless urinals, dual flushing and re-cycling of water in irrigation are some of the other active measures that have been incorporated.\nSince the water table is high and direct ground water recharge is not possible, rooftop rainwater harvesting, capacity rainwater storage tanks and reuse of water for other plumbing applications add to the sustainability of the building. A solar hot water system generates hot water in toilets while instantaneous LPG boilers are used in kitchens. An underground HSD oil storage tank meets a week long oil requirement.\nSWBI Architects explain, “We take a proactive approach focused on the concern for energy efficiency, environmental management, water management, renewable energy, waste management and recycling.” Taking this approach, the Adobe Campus is without doubt a standing vocabulary of a language that coins it a LEED platinum rated ‘living building’!\nWith this approach, the Adobe Campus is without doubt a more than fitting example of a LEED platinum rated ‘living building’!\nText By Kanupriya Pachisia\nPhotographs Courtesy Kapil Kamra"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:91656d5f-cf9d-4e23-8d19-12c458e4c1e4>"],"error":null}

This is still a very challenging task, especially when subsurface uncertainties must be conditioned to production data. Many different approaches have been proposed, each with their strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we develop a robust uncertainty-quantification work flow by seamless integration of a distributed-Gauss-Newton (GN) (DGN) optimization method with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and parallelized sampling algorithms. Results are compared with those obtained from other approaches.\nMultiple local maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimates are determined with the local-search DGN optimization method. A GMM is constructed to approximate the posterior probability-density function (PDF) by reusing simulation results generated during the DGN minimization process. The traditional acceptance/rejection (AR) algorithm is parallelized and applied to improve the quality of GMM samples by rejecting unqualified samples. AR-GMM samples are independent, identically distributed samples that can be directly used for uncertainty quantification of model parameters and production forecasts.\nThe proposed method is first validated with 1D nonlinear synthetic problems with multiple MAP points. The AR-GMM samples are better than the original GMM samples. The method is then tested with a synthetic history-matching problem using the SPE01 reservoir model (Odeh 1981; Islam and Sepehrnoori 2013) with eight uncertain parameters. The proposed method generates conditional samples that are better than or equivalent to those generated by other methods, such as Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and global-search DGN combined with the randomized-maximum-likelihood (RML) approach, but have a much lower computational cost (by a factor of five to 100). Finally, it is applied to a real-field reservoir model with synthetic data, with 235 uncertain parameters. AGMM with 27 Gaussian components is constructed to approximate the actual posterior PDF. There are 105 AR-GMM samples accepted from the 1,000 original GMM samples, and they are used to quantify the uncertainty of production forecasts. The proposed method is further validated by the fact that production forecasts for all AR-GMM samples are quite consistent with the production data observed after the history-matching period.\nThe newly proposed approach for history matching and uncertainty quantification is quite efficient and robust. The DGN optimization method can efficiently identify multiple local MAP points in parallel. The GMM yields proposal candidates with sufficiently high acceptance ratios for the AR algorithm. Parallelization makes the AR algorithm much more efficient, which further enhances the efficiency of the integrated work flow.\n|File Size||1 MB||Number of Pages||20|\nAanonsen, S.

{"question":"Yo q soy estudiante de medicina: how do the subgroups most affected by asthma compare to those most affected by emphysema in terms of gender patterns?","answer":"The gender patterns differ between asthma and emphysema. For asthma, male gender is a risk factor in children before puberty, but after puberty and into adulthood, women are more affected than men, with women having higher hospitalization needs and death rates. For emphysema, it historically has been more prevalent among men due to smoking patterns. However, this gender gap is now decreasing, with the difference in prevalence between males and females becoming less pronounced.","context":["What is Obstructive Pulmonary Disease?\nThe most common chronic lung disease, includes diseased characterized by increased resistance to airflow as a result of airway obstruction or airway narrowing.\nWhat are the types of Obstructive Pulmonary Disease?\nAsthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis.\nWhat is Asthma?\nIs a chronic inflammatory lung disease that results in variable episodes of airflow obstruction, but is usually reversible.\nWhat does chronic inflammation in Asthma lead too?\nRecurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, cough, particularly at night or in the early morning.\nWhat are the risk factors of Asthma?\nRelated to the patient (e.g., genetic factors), or the environment. Obesity as well, and gender.\nWhat are the gender differences for males with Asthma?\nMale gender is a risk factor for asthma in children, but not adults for unclear reasons. Before puberty males are more affected.\nWhat are the gender differences for females with Asthma?\nAfter puberty and into adulthood, women are more affected then men. Women who are admitted to the ER are more likely to need hospitalization. Death rates in women are greater then men.\nWhat are the cultural and ethnic health disparities in regards to Asthma with African Americans?\nHigher prevelance rates over 38%, females have the highest mortality rate.\nWhat are the cultural and ethnic health disparities in regards to Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases with Whites?\nHighest incidence of COPD, highest incidence of Cystic Fibrosis.\nWhat are the cultural and ethnic health disparities in regards to Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases with Puerto Ricans?\nHigher asthma prevalence rates and age adjusted death rates than all other racial and ethnic subgroups.\nWhat is the Genetic Risk factor with Asthma?\nAsthma has a component that is inherited. Numerous genes are involved. Atopy the genetic predisposition to develop an allergic (IgE-mediated) response to common allergies, is a major risk factor.\nWhat is the Immune Response Risk factor with Asthma?\nHygiene response hypothesis is thought to play a role in Asthma.\nHow do Allergies effect Asthma?\nIndoor and outdoor allergens are well known to trigger asthma. House dust mites, cockroaches, furry animals, fungi and mold can trigger.\nHow does exercise effect Asthma?\nInduced or exacerbated asthma. Occurs after vigorous exercise. Symptoms are pronounced during activities where there is exposure to cool, dry air.\nHow do air pollutants effect Asthma?\nCigarette or wood smoke, vehicle exhaust, elevated ozone levels, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide can trigger an attack.\nHow does cigarette smoking effect Asthma?\nAssociated with an accelerated decline of lung function. Increases the severity of the disease, may cause patients to be less responsive to treatment with corticosteroids (systemic or inhaled), and reduces the chance of asthma being controlled.\nWhat are occupational factors with Asthma?\nJob-related exposures. Irritants cause a change in the responsiveness of the airways. Agricultural workers, painters, plastics manufacturing, and cleaning work are high risk. Arrive at work feeling well but experience gradual development of symptoms towards the end of the day.\nHow do Respiratory Infections effect Asthma?\nMajor precipitating factors in acute asthma attacks. RSV and rhinovirus are two factors in developing and increasing severity of Asthma. Cause an increase in hyperresponsiveness of the bronchial system.\nHow do nose and sinus problems effect Asthma?\nAllergic rhinitis is a major predictor. Treatment of allergic rhinitis may reduce frequency of exacerbation. Chronic sinus problems can cause inflammation of the mucus membranes.\nWhat happens when some asthmatics take aspirin or NSAIDS?\nWheezing will develop within two hours. Usually rhinorrhea, congestion, and tearing occurs. Facial flushing, GI symptoms, and angioedema can occur.\nHow can B-Adrenergic Blockers PO or topical eyedrops effect Asthma?\nMay trigger asthma because of bronchospasms.\nHow can ACE inhibitors effect Asthma?\nMay produce cough in susceptible individuals, making symptoms worse.\nHow does tartrazine (yellow dye #5) and sulfating agents effect Asthma?\nUsed as preservatives and sanitizing agents. Commonly found in fruits, beer, and wine used extensively in salad to prevent oxidation. Can cause asthma exacerbation.\nHow does GERD effect Asthma?\nPostulated that reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus can be aspirated into the lungs, causing relfex vagal stimulation and bronchoconstriction.\nWhat are the Psychological Factors with Asthma?\nEmotional stress, extreme emotions such as crying, laughing, anger and fear can lead to hyperventilation and hypocapnia, which can cause airway narrowing.\nWhat is the Pathophysiology of Asthma?\nPersistent but variable inflammation of the airway. Airflow is limited because of inflammation results in bronchoconstriction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and edema of the airways.\nWhat are the inflammatory cells that are involved with Asthma?\nMast cells, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, T and B lymphocytes, and epithelial cells of the airways.\nHow long does it take for someone to have an early phase response with Asthma?\n30 - 60 minutes after exposure to allergen or irritant.\nHow long does it take for someone to have an late phase response with Asthma?\n4 - 10 hours after initial attack because of eosinophil and lymphocyte activation and their release of more inflammatory mediators. Epithelial cells also produce cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.. Can persist for 24 hours or more.\nWhat is the allergic asthma response?\nTriggered when an allergen cross links IgE receptors on Mast cells, which are activated to release histamine and other inflammatory mediators (early-phase response). A late phase response may occur due to further inflammation.\nWhat are the clinical manifestations of Asthma?\nWheezing, cough, dyspnea, chest tightness after exposure to a precipitating factor or trigger. Expiration may be prolonged. Expiratory ration may be prolonged to 1:3, or 1:4. Bronchospasm, edema, and mucus in the brochioles, narrowing.\nWhat does examination of the person with Asthma reveal?\nHypoxemia, restlessness, increased anxiety, inappropriate behavior, increased pulse and blood pressure, and pulsus paradoxus (a drop in systolic during during the inspiratory cycle greater than 10 mm Hg). Difficulty speaking, increased RR (^30), use of accessory muscles. Hyperresonance on percussion, auscultating with wheezing. Silent chest indicates severe obstruction and impending respiratory failure.\nHow can Asthma be classified?\nIntermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, or severe persistent.\nWhat are the diagnostic studies for Asthma?\nH & P, pulmonary function studies including response to bronchodilator therapy, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), chest x-ray, measure of oximetry, allergy skin test if indicated, blood level of eosinophil and IgE.\nWhat is collaborative therapy for Asthma?\nID and avoidance/elimination triggers, patient and caregiver teaching, drug therapy, asthma action plan, desensitization, assess for control.\nWhat does a severe of life-threatening asthma exacerbation indicate?\nSaO2, ABGs, inhaled B2-adrenergic agonists, inhaled anticholinergic agents, )2 by mask or nasal prongs, IV or oral corticosteroids, IV fluids, IV magnesium or/and heliox, intubation or assisted ventilation.\nWhat do ABG's reveal with a person with Asthma?\nNormal between exacerbation, increase in pH in exacerbation, then decrease if prolonged or severe exacerbation, decrease in PaO2, decrease early in exacerbation of PaCO2 and increase if prolonged severe exacerbation.\nWhat do Pulmonary Function Tests reveal with Asthma?\nTotal lung capacity is increased, residual volume is increased, FEV1 decreased, FEV1/FVC normal to decreased.\nWhat are the goals in collaborative care with Asthma?\nTo achieve and maintain control of the disease.\nWhat anti-inflammatory drugs are used for Long term Control of Asthma?\nAnti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids: inhaled (e.g., fluticasone [Floventil]), Oral (e.g., Prednisone). Leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast [Singular]), Anti-IgE (omalizumab [Xolair]).\nWhat bronchodilators are used for Long Term Control of Asthma?\nLong acting inhaled b2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., salmeterol [Serevent]), Long acting oral b2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., albuteral [VoSpire ER]). Methylxanthines (e.g., theophyline [Uniphyl]), and Anticholinergics (inhaled) (e.g., tiotropium [Spirival]).\nWhat bronchodilators are used for Quick Relief of Asthma?\nShort-acting inhaled b2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., albuterol [Proventil HFA]), Anticholinergics (inhaled) (e.g., ipratropium [Atrovent]).\nWhat antiinflammatory drugs are used for Quick Relief of Asthma?\nCorticosteroids (systemic) (e.g., prednisone) - considered quick-relief when used in a short burst 3-10 days at the start of therapy or during a period of gradual deterioration.\nHow do Corticosteroids effect Asthma?\nAntiinflammatory medications that reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness, block the late-phase reaction, and inhibit migration of inflammatory cells. More effective in improving asthma control then any other long term drug.\nHow do Leukotriene Modifiers effect Asthma?\nLeukotriene receptor blockers (antagonists) and leukotriene synthesis inhibitors interfere with the synthesis or block the action of leukotrienes - inflammatory mediators produced from arachidionic acid metabolism.\nHow do Anti-IgE medications effect Asthma?\nPrevents IgE from attaching to mast cells, thus preventing the release of the chemical mediators.\nWhat are the three classes of Bronchodilators?\nB2-adrenergic agonists, methylxanthines and derivatives, and anticholinergics.\nHow do B2-Adrenergic Agonists Drug effect Asthma?\nCan be short acting or long acting. Act by stimulating b-adrenergic receptors in the bronchioles, thus producing bronchodilation. They also increase mucociliary clearance.\nHow do Methylxanthines effect Asthma?\nBronchodilator with mild antiinflammatory effects, but the exact mechanism is unknown.\nWhat is the main problem with Methylxanthines Theophylline?\nRelatively high incidence of interaction with other drugs and the occurrence of side effects, which include nausea, headache, insomnia, GI distress, tachcardia, dysrhythmias, and seizures.\nHow do anticholinergic drugs effect Asthma?\nBlock the bronchoconstricting influence of the parasympathetic nervous system.

However, if you have emphysema, you lose your surface area, which means you do not have an effective gas exchange; hence, your diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is reduced.\nPathophysiology of Emphysema\nThe part of the acinus that is affected by destruction or permanent dilation decides the subtype of emphysema, which includes:\n1. Centrilobular (proximal acinar) emphysema\nOf this type, there is abnormal destruction or dilation of the respiratory bronchiole.\n- Common among chronic smokers and coal workers’ pneumoconiosis\n- The excess amount of neutrophils, due to cigarette smoking, results in the release of huge amounts of elastase into the lung parenchyma, which leads to the inability of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) to maintain the integrity of the tissue.\n- There is a loss of respiratory bronchioles, mainly in the upper and middle lobes.\n2. Panacinar emphysema\nThis type is defined as enlargement or destruction of all parts of the acinus.\n- The mutation of the normal alpha-1-antitrypsin gene (Pi) to PiZZ is one of the most common homozygous genetic mutations seen in Caucasians.\n- It can also be seen in centrilobular emphysema in smokers.\n3. Paraseptal (distal acinar) emphysema\nThis type results in the destruction of the alveolar ducts. It usually results in spontaneous pneumothorax when patients are affected with this type alone. However, it may occur in combination with other types of emphysema.\nEpidemiology of Emphysema\nUnited States: 18 cases per 1000 persons suffer from emphysema and 34 cases per 1000 persons suffer from chronic bronchitis.\nInternational: The prevalence of COPD stage II or higher is 10.1%.\nMortality: There are 64.3 deaths from COPD per 100,000 population in adults older than 25 years in the United States.\nGender: It used to be more prevalent among men because of smoking. However, the difference in prevalence between the two genders is decreasing.\nPresentation of Emphysema\nSymptoms of emphysema\nPatients usually ignore their symptoms and adapt themselves to them as they start gradually and progress over the years. These symptoms include:\n- A productive cough worse in the morning with clear-to-white sputum\n- Acute chest illness\nSigns of emphysema\nObserved signs may be different depending on the severity and the stage of the disease. They include:\n- Limitation of expiratory flow with relative preservation of inspiratory flow\n- Dyspnea with mild exertion\n- Increased respiratory rate\n- Use of accessory respiratory muscles\n- Paradoxical contraction of lower intercostal spaces\n- Elevated Jugular venous pressure\n- Atrophy of limb musculature\n- Peripheral edema\n- Barrel chest\n- Diffuse or focal wheezing\n- Diminished breath sounds\n- Hyper-resonance upon percussion\n- Prolonged expiration\n- Hyperinflation in chest radiograph\nCauses of Emphysema\nDifferent risk factors may increase the risk of developing emphysema, these causes and risk factors include:\n- Cigarette smoking\n- Alpha-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency syndromes\n- Intravenous drug users\n- Immune deficiency syndromes\n- Connective tissue disorders\n- Salla disease\nDifferential Diagnosis of Emphysema\nCongestive heart failure: this disorder might produce wheezing and can be difficult to distinguish from emphysema. However, a history of orthopnea and paroxysmal dyspnea that is nocturnal with the existence of fine basal crackles, and typical findings on upper body radiographs, can lead to the diagnosis of congestive heart failure.\nBronchiectasis: patients with bronchiectasis have chronic production of copious sputum that is purulent, coarse crackles, and clubbing upon physical examination. Abnormal findings on upper body radiographs and CT scans will be observed.\nBronchiolitis obliterans: it is observed in younger persons who do not smoke and in persons with collagen-vascular diseases. A CT scan characteristically shows regions of mosaic attenuation without proof of generalized emphysema.\nChronic asthma: the delayed onset of severe asthma may be hard to distinguish in older patients, but the main difference is the response to bronchodilators and normal diffusion on pulmonary function tests.\nDiagnosis of Emphysema\n- Arterial blood gas analysis: COPD patients have mild-to-moderate hypoxemia with no associated hypercapnia. However, hypercapnia may develop, and the\nhypoxemia worsens as the disease progresses.\n- Hematocrit: polycythemia may result from chronic hypoxemia. A hematocrit\nresult in more than 47% of female and more than 52% of males indicates\n- Serum bicarbonate: serum bicarbonate levels are useful in the follow-up of the\n- Serum alpha-1-antitrypsin: when the serum levels fall below the protective\nthreshold value, which is 3 to 7 mmol/L, the diagnosis of alpha-1-antitrypsin\ndeficiency is confirmed.\n- Sputum evaluation: the sputum is mucoid with macrophages as the\npredominant cells. The sputum becomes purulent with exacerbation and includes excessive neutrophils and a mixture of organisms visualized through Gram staining.\nSigns of hyperinflation, such as diaphragm flattening, increased retrosternal air space, and a long narrow heart shadow will be revealed on frontal and lateral chest x- rays. Other signs of emphysema include the hyperlucency of the lungs and rapid tapering vascular shadows. If the disease was complicated with pulmonary hypertension, the hilar vascular shadows become obvious and prominent. You may also notice opacity in the lower retrosternal air space and right ventricular enlargement.\nHigh-resolution CT scans are also used in the diagnosis of emphysema as they are more sensitive than chest x-rays. It is highly specific, and it makes bullae visible and clear, which are usually hard to see on chest x-rays. CT scans are not always done for emphysema patients; however, they are indicated for patients considered for surgical intervention.\nStaging of Emphysema\nCOPD is divided into different stages depending on FEV1. The widely used staging system is the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease staging system, which is\n- Stage I (mild): FEV1 more than or equal to 80% of the predicted value.\n- Stage II (moderate): FEV1 more than or equal to 50% and less than 80% of the predicted value.\n- Stage III (severe): FEV1 more than or equal to 30% and less than 50% of the predicted value.\n- Stage IV (very severe): FEV1 less than 50% of the predicted value with\nchronic respiratory failure; or FEV1 less than 30% of the predicted value.\nDefinition of respiratory failure: PaO2 less than 60 mm Hg (kPa 8.0) or a PaCO2 higher\nthan 50 mm Hg (kPa 6.7).\nManagement of Emphysema\n- Smoking cessation: it is the most important factor in the management of COPD patients.\n- Bronchodilators: both short and long-acting bronchodilators can be used in the management of COPD, and they work by dilating airways, resulting in decreased airflow resistance.\n- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors: they work by increasing intracellular cAMP, which results in bronchodilation.\n- Anti-inflammatory therapy: inflammation is one of the important factors in the pathogenesis of COPD, therefore oral and inhaled corticosteroids are used to manage this inflammation.\n- Antibiotics: chronic infection and colonization of the lower airways by bacteria may occur in COPD patients, which require the use of antibiotics.\n- Mucolytic agents: they improve secretion clearance and reduce sputum viscosity.\n- Proton pump inhibitors: studies showed that proton pump inhibitors reduce the incidence of the common cold in patients with COPD.\n- Oxygen therapy: chronic hypoxemia may develop in COPD patients, which requires the use of oxygen therapy.\n- Bullectomy: this has been the standard procedure in selected patients for many years; it involves the removal of giant bullae.\n- Lung volume reduction surgery: in this procedure, the most diseased parts of the lung are surgically resected to decrease hyperinflation.\n- Endobronchial valve placement: it is still under investigation as a replacement for lung volume reduction surgery.\n- Lung transplantation: most people who undergo lung transplantation are COPD patients."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0c5e1c2e-f443-4119-af68-b9c50575ff02>","<urn:uuid:39da7698-4687-4018-adce-7912cac61922>"],"error":null}

This Article aims to establish the correct legal characterization of these platforms and the implications thereof for competition law purposes. To do so, it explores two related questions: first, whether platforms are agents of their suppliers; and, second, whether the competition law prohibition of anticompetitive agreements should apply to agreements between platforms and suppliers, which restrict competition on the relevant market for the products/services regarding which the platform facilitates a transaction. The first question arises because the platform business model resembles an agency arrangement more than any other, and many platforms selfproclaim to be agents of their suppliers. Yet, the decisional practice and commentary have developed on the premise that they are not agents. The second question arises due to the “agency rule” under the “single economic entity doctrine,” according to which restrictive agreements between an agent and a principal take place within the same “undertaking” and are consequently immune from the competition law prohibition of anticompetitive agreements between separate undertakings. After applying concepts of agency and similar delegation models found in different areas of law to the standard contracts of six major platforms—Amazon Marketplace, Apple App Store, Uber, eBay, Booking.com, and, Airbnb—this Article finds that, as a matter of positive law, all of these platforms are agents of their suppliers. Consequently, platforms’ agreements with their suppliers that restrict competition on the relevant products/services market cannot be scrutinized due to the agency rule under the “single economic entity doctrine” as currently conceived. This represents a significant “platform gap” in the application of competition law in digital markets. Following these findings, this Article conducts a normative assessment to demonstrate that in the context of platforms that not only intermediate transactions for, but also compete with their suppliers on the relevant market, the “single economic entity doctrine” should be (re)interpreted. The “agency rule” should not apply to agreements of such platforms and suppliers that contain restrictions of competition on the relevant market. This is because the conflict of commercial and competitive interests between a “principal” (supplier) and an “agent” (platform) that competes with its principal fundamentally violates the principles of agency and the reasoning underlying the single economic entity doctrine. This Article develops a “competitive neutrality” principle to inform and underlie this proposed (re)interpretation of the “single economic entity doctrine .” This (re)interpretation fills the “platform gap” identified in this Article by subjecting the agreements of platforms that are not in a competitively neutral position with their suppliers to the full application of the prohibition of anticompetitive agreements.\nFor the full seminar series programme please visit our website: http://competitionpolicy.ac.uk/events/ccp-seminar-series","On 9 July 2021, the European Commission published a draft new block exemption regulation for vertical agreements (VBER) and new guidelines for vertical agreements. The draft is to replace the present block exemption regulation which expires on 31 May 2022. The consultation deadline concerning comments to the draft expired in September 2021, and the Commission is now working on the last phase towards a final text which must be adopted in May 2022 and come into force on 1 June 2022.\nWhat is the vertical block exemption regulation?\nVBER is an EU Regulation exempting a number of distribution agreements from the prohibition against anti-competitive agreements under the competition rules. A vertical agreement is an agreement between companies at different stages of the production or distribution chain, e.g. an agreement between a supplier and a distributor.\nHowever, VBER only applies to contractual relationships where the parties’ market shares do not exceed 30 % of the relevant market. Furthermore, the agreement may not contain so-called “serious restrictions of competition” (blacklisted restrictions). It seems that these conditions will be maintained in the new rules and guidelines.\nPurpose of the new vertical rules\nThe purpose of the revision of VBER is to ensure that the rules are still relevant and effective. The Commission's evaluation of VBER has proved that there is still a general need for an effective set of rules. The evaluation also proved that there is room for improvement. Since 2010, the markets have changed significantly, especially digitally. One of the purposes of the revision was therefore to adapt the applicable rules to a digital world where e-commerce and sale via online platforms are in strong growth.\nFuture rules on vertical agreements\nWe have not yet established how the new rules and guidelines are going to be, but the Commission’s draft gives a good indication of what to expect.\nIt seems that the basic method and many of the exemption options are upheld. It is for instance still possible to have maximum prices, recommended resale prices and 5-year non-competition clauses in the term of the agreement. The same applies to the classic distribution forms such as exclusive distribution with protection of exclusive areas or customer groups and selective distribution.\nMaterial changes in the rules on vertical agreements\nThe new VBER and guidelines also seem to introduce changes in a number of important areas: The most important changes are:\nRight to more than one exclusive distributor\nAccording to the present VBER, a supplier may only appoint one exclusive distributor for a specific area or a specific customer group. This makes it difficult to adapt the distributor network to the supplier’s needs. The new rules propose that a supplier must be able to appoint more than one exclusive distributor per area or customer group when appropriate compared to the exclusive area (shared exclusivity). The guidelines specify that the number must be fixed so that the supplier is ensured a turnover that equals the investment in the area.\nMore restrictive access to Dual Distribution\nDual distribution describes the situation where a supplier distributes to retailers parallel with independent distributors. The present VBER exempts parallel distribution from the prohibition against agreements restricting competition when the distributors are active only at retail level.\nThe competitive challenge of dual distribution is that suppliers and distributors have a trading relationship and at the same time they are competitors. The trading relationship may involve an exchange of competition-sensitive data, e.g. on prices and customers, which exchange is normally not legal for competitors. To avoid problems, a number of adjustments are proposed, including:\n- New de minimis rule: If the parties’ total market share at retail level does not exceed 10 %, the agreement is exempted.\n- If the parties’ total market share at retail level exceeds 10 % but is below VBER's limit of 30 %, all aspects of the agreement will be exempted, except for any exchange of data between the parties.\nThe area of exemption is expanded so that exemption does not apply only to manufacturers but also to wholesalers and importers.\nRestrictions of competition in connection with online distribution\nIt seems as if the new rules are to a greater extent adapted to the practical reality within online sale. A basic principle will still apply to general online distribution stating that a distributor must be entitled to distribute online. A prohibition against Internet sale is therefore still considered a serious restriction of competition not covered by VBER.\nThe draft new VBER describes directly when online sale is “active sale” which may lawfully be restricted in a sole distribution agreement. It appears directly that active customer inquiries both offline and online are considered “active sale”. Websites linguistically adapted to an area are considered active sale aimed at that area. Paid advertising aimed at a specific customer group also counts as active sale.\nIn addition, the draft guidelines are less restrictive when it comes to dual pricing where the supplier for instance grants more favourable wholesale prices to distributors with physical shops than to online sale. Dual pricing is a serious restriction of competition which cannot be exempted from under the present rules. In the draft new rules, it is proposed that it will be lawful to price differentiate if the purpose is to encourage or award investments in a physical point of sale. The price difference must be consistent with the cost difference of physical and online sale.\nNew rules on online platforms\nToday, online platforms play a more important role in the distribution of goods and services than before. It is not always easy to categorise online platform in the traditional boxes as either suppliers or distributors.\nThe draft block exemption regulation therefore contains a new framework for online platforms. Under the new rules, agreements between distributors and online platforms will generally not be exempted if the platform sells goods and services in competition with the distributors to which the platform provides online intermediary services. Online intermediary services are defined as suppliers in the P2B regulation.\nOnline platforms and MFN clauses\nA so-called “most-favoured nation” (MFN) clause is a price clause according to which a company obligates always to quote the best price for its products to the contractual party. MFN clauses are generally exempted from the present block exemption regulation.\nThe Commission proposes that the new VBER is not to exempt MFN clauses obligating a distributor as seller via an online platform not to sell its goods or services cheaper on competing platforms. The clauses are instead to be assessed individually. All other types of MFN clauses are still covered by the exemption.\nFor more information on the Commission’s draft new vertical block exemption regulation and the revised vertical guidelines: Public consultation on the draft revised Regulation on vertical agreements and vertical guidelines."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ab6195f7-e163-40f1-8141-b326c6f91d70>","<urn:uuid:3e2fef4f-6e18-4bef-b56c-25ddb7e9507c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What conditions or health needs can be treated through creative arts and music therapy interventions?","answer":"Both creative arts and music therapy can treat a wide range of conditions. Music-based treatments are applied to conditions including Autism Spectrum Disorder, sensorimotor issues, Parkinson's, ADHD, Alzheimer's, various dementias, PTSD, strokes, coma, pain management, and cardiac problems. Creative arts therapy helps with social stimulation, cognitive stimulation, relaxation training, psycho-emotional-spiritual support, stress and pain management, physical stimulation, sensory-environment stimulation, family conflict resolution, and medical compliance. These therapies can promote self-expression, develop coping skills for stress and trauma, enhance family communication, provide nonverbal emotional release, normalize hospital stays, build physical and mental strength, and support pain management.","context":["Dori, would you tell us about music therapy in general? What is it?\nMusic Therapy can be better described by saying music-based treatment, because it is a treatment in which various elements of music are applied to address human health issues. Music, as many know, contains six elements, including rhythm, tonality (melody), timbre, harmony, dynamics, and form, and variations thereof.\nAny one or more of these can be directed toward treatment interventions to address a variety of health needs. Music-based treatments are applied to a variety of diagnoses, including ASD, Sensorimotor issues, Parkinson’s, ADHD, Alzheimer’s and various dementias, PTSD, Strokes, COMA and other conditions involving consciousness, pain management, cardiac problems, and so much more.\nMany people confuse music therapy with “just listening to music”. Would you tell us about the difference and the overlaps?\nMusic-based treatment, aka music therapy, is a clinical intervention provided by a specially trained and credentialed (Board Certified, Licensed, etc.) clinician. There is a difference between music as “therapeutic”, and music therapy.\nSo, how would you describe “just listening to music”?\nMusic can be “therapeutic” when listened to recreationally. Listening to music may induce mood changes, memories, relaxation, release stress, help concentration and task attention, and more. But that is not “treatment” – it is like a self-medicated treatment, and yes, it’s good, but it is “in the moment.”\nThen, how would you describe Music-based treatment?\nMusic-based treatment has goals and objectives for changes and functional adaptations related to an individual’s current situation to enhance better coping and responses to problems.\nHow does Music-based treatment work, then?\nIf you’re an anxious person, you want a music-based clinician who can administer the kind of music intervention that will ultimately strive to more permanently release anxiety. Another way to look at this, is that you want a therapist who can utilize music to alter the function of the brain’s amygdala (moving the individual’s nervous and physiological system from high arousal to calmer). A music-based clinician can help you mediate fight/flight with music. Anxious people, and people with misophonia, both tend to have higher arousal systems, involving fight/flight. When a person is in fight/flight the HPA Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) shoots catecholamine in the blood stream (cortisone, adrenalin, etc.), and other hormonal and physiological processes occur. It is generally unhealthy for the body to be frequently and excessively activated like this.\nOh, so you are saying that music-based treatment can affect changes in the neurological/physiological system?\nYes. Sensorimotor and Neurologic Music Therapy treats all sorts of issues in persons of all ages. In essence, ‘just listening’ does not require a music-based clinician, but music-based treatment does, because it is interactive, and active interaction with music is a whole-brain activity that can address areas of function that ‘just listening’ omits (e.g., motor function, visual, tactile, etc.). I approach from a physiologic perspective, with the belief that even “psychology” is physiology.\nI am so glad to hear you say that! Dori, one of the ideas I have always had, which we have discussed on and off for almost a decade, is that of using music as a “tool” for down-regulating the nervous system specifically for people who are auditory over-responsive. However, for people with misophonia, this might be counter-intuitive because certain noises are so bothersome. In other words for people with misophonia music itself can be a double-edged sword.\nI think there are several ways music-based treatment can approach interventions for people with misophonia. As we’ve talked about, we can work on utilizing music as a means of down-regulating or “calming the system”.\nI’m remembering an article from years ago…it was an academic article entitled “What Gives You Chills” or something like that. The main point was that while there are some universal elements that apply to what make music calming and/or up-regulating, personal choice is really where one needs to begin. For example, I know you find classical music to be relaxing, whereas for me (a person with misophonia) most classical music is highly aversive to me. In fact, what I find calming is kind of random, and certainly not genre specific. I’m guessing it is probably the same with most people with misophonia.\nOf course, remember that listening to music and Music-based treatment are different. However, you are right (and this is particularly pertinent to misophonia). Finding the right music for the therapist to work with is going to be challenging. This is uncharted territory and we need to be careful.\nI would think the best place to start is to ask the individual.\nAbsolutely. And once, we begin working with music a person likes, we can deconstruct the elements of that music that he or she likes. Remember before I was talking about the different elements of music; rhythm, tonality (melody), timbre, harmony, dynamics, and form…\nAlso, we can work with frequencies. If a person is discomforted by high frequencies, for example, you can add just a tiny bit of high frequency into music so that the brain can adapt.\nWell, this is why I pointed out that Music based treatment is a lot more than just listening and that it involves use of the whole body. Expressing music, making music is not the same as listening and that can be a big part of music therapy treatment as well.\nOf course, and you have done so much work in this regard for people with SPD, and Autistic Spectrum Disorder etc. who of course are often auditory over-responsive (which is similar to or may be a variant of misophonia). While we are on the subject, would you describe from your experience the difference of these disorders?\nThe main difference that I have found between ASD and SPD is the ability to modulate behavior, and control responses more functionally by persons with SPD vs. persons with ASD. In ASD, socialization difficulties are usually very evident, whereas in SPD they are not. In ASD, cognitive delays, language delay or difficulty with the social elements of language (which includes variations in pitch, or prosody, knowing when the timing is right to interject in a conversation, etc.) and slower information processing are most always present. However, in SPD these elements are not necessarily present. In other words, individuals with SPD and ASD share the sensory issues but those with SPD do not have the significant cognitive/social/language impairment. In terms of behavior, then SPD and ASD look very different, and I, for one, never confuse the two. It’s almost like asking what’s the difference between a man with black hair, and a woman with black hair. Characteristics of each are entirely different, although they both have black hair.\nWell-stated Dori! I would add that people with Misophonia have extreme reactivity to certain noises and have great difficult modulating behavior because of the underlying fight/flight response that is triggered by this stimuli. I don’t think Misophonia is defined by any cognitive or language delays. However, there is no official definition yet. Speaking of which, many people with misophonia are also bothered by the visual perception of movement (often specifically of other people’s movement). Do you think music therapy might help with this?\nI know music therapy can address this issue, with movement activities. And a mirror. In other words, what if “the other person” was in the mirror? I have many ideas for helping with visual interruptions of perception. I have a friend with ASD (“Asperger’s) who has a terrible, terrible stutter. He told me that when he speaks in person to someone, the visual movements he sees of the other person causes him to stutter very badly. However, when he speaks on the phone to the person, he’s better with language flow! So I suggested that he practice talking to his image in his mirror, and this changed the visual distraction. In music-based treatment, I would have us play fun instruments in front of a mirror, sing in front of the mirror, move our bodies, while singing before a mirror, and more.\nThat is really interesting Dori and this is really something that should be researched further! I have a question about art therapy. How is it different from music therapy? Do music and art therapists have different training?\nI am not really qualified to talk about training of art therapists, except to note that art therapy is more a psychologically-based treatment – express your feelings through color, design, etc. Music expression does that also, but with the clinician who also participates with the client in music-making! Or – within a group. Art is individual, like the “just listening to music” vs. making music with another. The art therapist doesn’t make art with the client – the client is left to be inside his/her own head, without other external influences, while making music is collaborative with the clinician – we both make music with each other, and I will guide toward reaching an objective of self-expression, reduction of anxiety, and recognition of self. So yes, art therapists have different training as far as the treatment goals, objectives, and approaches. Art therapy’s main objectives are psychological (mind), while music therapy’s goals and objectives are mind-body – the whole persons, including muscles, joints, movements, etc. We don’t just sit in a chair and draw, paint, sculpt for a final result. We (music therapists) move, play, sing, share, interact, in a temporal manner – in the here and now and gone manner. (Unless we notate the music for future rendition – which does happen at times). Please understand, though, that I’m not comparing as to whether one or another is better – I have worked with art therapists and music, which was an ideal great advantage! It’s fun and a no-lose intervention for all.\nI know that you also research in the field and write books. Would you tell us about that?\nMy books and research involve behavior characteristics of particular neurologic and sensorimotor difficulties. I have four published books, my first being on the subject of Performance Anxiety in musicians, but the following three books involve music and how physiology plays a role in treatment of various diagnoses through music interventions. My books can be found at Amazon, under my name Dorita Berger, and some of my writings are posted on Academia.edu, including my research paper. My books have descriptions of case studies. And…. I am now in the process of writing my 5th book, a kind of ‘non-academic’ book for parents, titled “Kids ‘n’ Music: Thinking Beyond The Spectrum”. It’s not an “academic” book, but a quick read with advice. Titles of my other books: Eurhythmics For Autism and Other Neurophysiologic Diagnoses: A Sensorimotor Music-Based Treatment Approach (JKP, 2015); The Music Effect: Music Physiology And Clinical Applications (JKP 2006, with Daniel J. Schneck); Music Therapy, Sensory Integration and The Autistic Child (2002, JKP); and Toward The Zen Of Performance: Music Improvisation Therapy For Developing Self-Confidence In The Performer.\nThat’s amazing Dori. I don’t know how you find the time to write all of these books! As my final question, would you please tell us a little more about yourself? How did you get started as a music therapist?\nI started music when I was 5 years old, after being taken to the movies to see “A Song To Remember”, which is the life of Chopin – well, as Hollywood saw it. But the music (played by Arthur Rubinstein, by the way) was so gorgeous; all I wanted to do was to play the Piano!\nImagine, even at the age of 5, a child can already sense emotions in music! I began piano lessons then, in my native Argentine, and continued studying once we relocated from Argentina to New York City. And that was my life. I attended the High School of Music & Art in NYC, then went on to graduate in Piano Performance from Carnegie Mellon Univ. (I wanted to go out of town of course), returning to NY to attend graduate studies at Juilliard. Performed here and there, mostly chamber music, married, had kids, travelled, moved to different locations as a result of my husband’s profession, so performing became limited.\nThen when one of our two daughters became a serious and excellent student on the violin, I helped her attend Juilliard, Aspen, and all the spots for upcoming performers, in addition to concertizing with her at many locations. And one day, I read an article about a Music Therapy clinic working with Autistic children, and what they described I thought to myself, “I’ve already done that…. Maybe I should get the degree”. I had worked with children, taught them, did improvisation, movement, etc. So I thought why not?\nMy intention was actually to work with psychiatric adults. So I attended NYU’s music therapy program, and two years later, Master’s Degree and Board Certification in hand, I was on my way to working at a special school for Neurodevelopmentally Delayed children – as in, Autism.

What exactly is climate change? Put simply, climate change is a change in average weather patterns over a long period of time. However, people often confuse natural variations in weather with climate change. In order to understand the distinction, you have to understand the difference between weather and climate. Weather refers to atmospheric conditions like temperature, precipitation, and wind at a specific time and place, whereas climate refers to long-term trends of weather.\nLook outside. Is it sunny? Is it raining? Is it snowing? Is it windy? Whatever is happening right now is weather. Weather varies from day to day. Some days it might be sunny, other days in might be cloudy and rainy.\nA region’s climate is determined by weather patterns — patterns in precipitation, temperature, humidity and wind — usually averaged over a 30-year span. Climate gives us an idea of what the weather in a particular region might be. For example, if it’s winter in Miami, you don’t expect it to snow. That’s because Miami has a tropical climate with warm temperatures year-round and lots of rain. Likewise, if it’s winter in Maine, you don’t expect it to be 95 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTo determine changes in climate, you have to look at long-term trends and averages of past weather data. For example, past weather data from California’s Central Valley shows that this area is experiencing warmer temperatures and less fog compared to what would be normal variations in weather. This suggests a changing climate.\nClimate change is happening now and is already impacting the planet. With climate change, we are seeing shifts in regional climate. For example, spring temperatures in the Midwest arrive about two weeks earlier compared to the 1950s. Parts of the Northeast are experiencing an increase in heavy rain and snow events, and parts of the Southeast are having more days with temperatures above 95 degrees. These are all examples of changes to regional climates.\n- What does the term “weather” mean?\n- What is climate?\n- What does the term “climate change” mean?\n- Describe the climate where you live.\nThis post is part of our Clue into Climate collection of resources.\nThis explainer is featured in our Clue into Climate e-book series.

{"question":"What are the benefits of growing your own vegetables at home, and what soil quality factors must be considered to ensure safe food production?","answer":"Growing vegetables at home ensures more servings of healthy fruits and vegetables for your family, provides fresher produce with higher nutrient content, and allows control over pesticide use. It also offers health benefits through outdoor activity and stress relief. However, soil quality is crucial for safe food production. The soil must be properly tested for both nutrients and contaminants. For optimal growth, soil should be loamy (40% sand, 40% silt, 20% clay) and enriched with compost or well-aged manure. Urban gardeners must be particularly cautious about soil contamination from heavy metals like lead, cadmium, and arsenic, which can accumulate in plants and affect human health. Soil should be tested for these contaminants, especially in urban areas or near old buildings. If contamination is found, remediation options include soil treatment, raising pH levels, or using raised beds with clean soil.","context":["\"Victory gardens\" came about when food was being rationed during World War II. At one point 40% of the country’s produce came from backyard Victory gardens. After the war, gardening became more of a hobby than a necessity. Today homegrown fruits and vegetables are making a comeback for a cornucopia of reasons, not least of which is a global pandemic. Growing a Victory garden allows you to be more self-sufficient by having some control over your food supply.\nStarting your own seasonal supermarket ensures your family consumes more servings of healthy fruits and veggies. This is as farm-to-table as it gets, folks. When your produce does not have to journey from far away places, it reduces your carbon footprint. While you'll have to make several trips to the garden, you won't have to make so many to the grocery store, which also lessens your impact on the environment. Not only does garden fodder taste better than store-bought because it is so fresh and picked at its peak, but it also has more nutrients that the grocer version. On its journey to shelves, it loses nutrients. The Farmer's Almanac says that \"every day a vegetable is off the vine it loses its health benefits.\"\nIt's also beneficial for those who are wary of the quality of commercial produce. When you seed the plant and harvest it yourself, you can rest easy knowing that a chemical cocktail of pesticides was not used to produce your produce. Tending to your garden is also good for your health—it relieves stress, gets you outdoors, gives you something to do with your family, and can even help you live longer! Without further ado, let's get our hands dirty.\nIf this is your preliminary foray into the gardening game, start small so you don't get too overwhelmed. Pick plants that you usually buy at the store, such as broccoli, carrots, and herbs. The Farmer's Almanac suggests \"easy-to-grow crops, including fresh vegetables in season as well as root crops and hardier crops that could be stored during the winter.\" Seed packets explain when to grow what, and we will also go over that below.\nStake out where you want to put your Victory garden. It should be fairly close to the house, so you don't have to traipse too far to get to it and you can reach a hose out there for watering. Make sure it gets at least six hours of sun a day and has good drainage. A plot as small as 10 x 10 feet can grow a lot of food, but if you're short on space, you can always try a raised bed or container garden.\nPlants are super cliquey. Some of them want to hang out next to others—these are called \"companion\" plants. Not only do you have to configure who gets to sit next to whom, but you also have to consider which plants do not play nicely with others. For instance, tall crops like corn or even trellised tomatoes can overshadow their compadres and steal their sunshine, so it's important to put the tall dudes on the north side of the garden. According to the Farmer's Almanac, \"Plants set too close together compete for sunlight, water, and nutrition and fail to mature.\" Sprawling plants such as watermelon and squash require lots of space. Put them on the edges so they don't strangle their friends.\nOur grandparents were limited to graph paper, but we've got handy dandy tools like the Farmer's Almanac Garden Planner that can help make sure each plant is in its proper place. It lets you plot out your plan and gives you tips on seed spacing, companion plants, and even tells you the best times to plant. Be sure to leave a couple of feet of space around the beds for room to weed and harvest.\nSoil can make or break a garden. That is where the plants get their nutrients, after all. First, test your soil. Here are three simple soils tests you can do yourself, or you can always reach out to your local cooperative extension service office for a free or low-cost soil test. They can also make recommendations based on your soil's pH, texture, and phosphorus, lime, potassium, and soluble salts content. Then you can \"amend\" your soil, which is another word for enriching it to make sure there are plenty of nutrients. According to the Old Farmer’s Almanac, \"Compost, leaf-mould, or well-aged manure will increase the ability of your soil to both drain well and hold moisture.\" Notice the \"well-aged\" caveat—grabbing some horse dung and throwing it on the garden ain't gonna work. Manure needs to be composted for six to 12 months.\nLoam is soil made up of about 40% sand, 40% silt, and 20% clay. According to the Old Farmer’s Almanac, \"Plant roots penetrate soft, loamy soil more easily. Start with well-drained, sandy loam and add as much organic matter as possible.\" Another important step in preparing the soil for planting is tilling. However, if all of this testing, amending, and tilling sounds like too much work, you can always just go with a raised bed and purchase the perfect loam.\nFind seeds and plants at home improvement stores, Walmart, ag shops like Tractor Supply, co-ops, nurseries, or greenhouses. You can also order seeds online or from a catalog. Most garden vegetables, such as beans, beets, carrots, chard, cucumbers, lettuce, peas, spinach, and squash can be directly seeded, but you may want to give others, like tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and melons a head start. Start seeds indoors six to eight weeks before transplant, or just buy them as seedlings. Starting your seeds indoors has other advantages, like keeping young plants out of the harsh elements until they get a little stronger. This is also a good time to pick up a new pair of gardening gloves and make sure you've got the necessary tools, including a hoe and trowel.\nIf you don't protect your garden, all of the deer, rabbits, and groundhogs are going to get fat. Surround your plot with tall, sturdy fencing or netting like Jobe's or Deer-X Protective Netting and t-posts, which can be found at ag shops like Tractor Supply, home improvement stores, and Walmart. It's not the most visually appealing option, but it gets the job done without blowing the budget.\nSpring: Carrots, lettuce, kale, onions, peas, and radishes\nSummer: Basil, beans (pole, bush, and lima), corn, cucumbers, eggplants, okra, peppers, pumpkin, winter and summer squash, tomatoes, and watermelon\nFall and winter: Beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, lettuce, kohlrabi, parsley, parsnips, radish, spinach, Swiss chard, and turnips\nFor tips on growing each, check out the Almanac's growing guide.\nSprawling plants like melons and squash like to be planted in mounds, while other crops like carrots would rather be planted in a row. Get this info from the back of the seed packet or on the seedling's tag. It will also tell you the correct depth, number of seeds, and spacing. Once you've mounded your soil and hoed out your rows, you're finally ready to plant those little boogers. Simply drop the seeds in and cover with soil.\nIf you are transplanting seedlings, your holes need to be big enough for the roots to be buried. Carefully transplant from the container, gently loosening the outer roots. Place it in the hole, then cover the roots with soil.\nHow does your garden grow? Pretty well as long as you remember to fertilize, weed, and water it. Edible plants need to eat too. Make sure you are feeding them with a granular fertilizer like Miracle-Gro® Performance Organics® Edibles Plant Nutrition Granules. Read the label for proper application, but Miracle Gro suggests using it a month after planting before it rains.\nABP stands for Always Be Pulling. Much of gardening is weeding, and you have to catch those suckers when they're little or they'll try to take over the place. Miracle Gro suggests covering \"exposed soil with untreated grass clippings or other organic mulch, which blocks the sunlight and makes it harder for weeds to grow\" and then hand-pulling any weeds that do emerge.\nGet a rain gauge and put it in your garden to ensure it's getting about an inch of water a week from rain or watering. To encourage root growth, it's better to water deeply every few days than just a little every day. Of course, you don't have to water if it has been raining or is about to rain, and you'll need to water more in the really hot summer months. This is gardening 101, but don't water in the heat of the day, and try not to get the leaves wet, lest your plants get scorched.","Get The Lead Out: How To Test Your Soil For Contaminants\nIf you’re just getting into urban gardening, you’re undoubtedly excited to break out the fancy tools and get your hands dirty. You’ve selected those heirloom seeds with care, plotted out the beds, and stocked up on organic fertilizer. Now all that’s left to do is plot your urban oasis, right?\nNot so fast. It’s important for city-dweller’s to be mindful of the contaminants that often lace urban soil—a problem that has plagued urban gardening initiatives for decades. Centuries of mining, manufacturing, and the use and accumulation of manmade toxins (from pesticides, paints, batteries, sludge, and more) have led to higher-than-normal concentrations of heavy metals like lead, cadmium and arsenic in most urban soils.\nThe excess accumulation of heavy metals in most urban soil is dangerous to humans and other animals, largely because it is so chronic; these metals don’t leave the bloodstream of the plant or animal that ingests them, and they will remain prevalent in whichever food chain they pollute. When plants attempt to grow in contaminated soil, they inevitably take up these hazardous compounds through their roots, which ultimately cycle back into the human population through consumption. (Meaning: if the plants you eat are contaminated, you will be, too.)\nContamination will affect everything in a garden, from plants to the wildlife that comes to feast upon them. People who live in or near homes built before 1978 (when lead-based paint was taken off the market) or near roadways (a source for a streaky stream of harmful particles) are at an even greater risk.\nBioaccumulation of toxins is prevalent in greens like spinach or collards, but is for the most part absent in fruits (e.g. your tomatoes are safe). Nevertheless, gardeners with high concentrations of lead or other compounds in their soil should reconsider planting until they’ve tested (and treated) the soil (more on that below.)\nSome plants are capable of stabilizing or removing metals from surrounding areas through their roots, thus decontaminating groundwater.\nContaminated soil can be excavated from the ground and treated in a lab, or a large plastic cover can be placed over the contaminated soil to prevent runoff or direct contact with other plants and organisms. High temperature treatments (which produce a granular soil that won’t leach minerals) are among the most commonly used methods to treat soil, as are solidifying agents (which cement the soil,) and soil washing.\nThese treatments are expensive, however, so an expert will probably suggest a course of action that involves raising the pH of the soil, draining wetlands, applying phosphates, and choosing plants that are less susceptible to toxic uptake (which means planting fruits and seeds over leafy vegetables).\nSome plants are capable of stabilizing or removing metals from surrounding areas through their roots, thus decontaminating groundwater (after the Chernobyl disaster, scientists planted sunflowers in contaminated areas for this very purpose).\nSo why should you pay someone to test the dirt in your yard? For one thing, decontamination helps identify the pH and nutrient levels of your soil, which clues the gardener in to any deficiencies that may be compromising their crops. The process also helps identify potential planting hotspots, especially when tested in conjunction with major nutrients like Phosphorous, Potassium, Calcium, and Magnesium.\nKnowing this will be useful if you ever decide to purchase fertilizer with soil amendments (like added phosphate, limid, or dolomite) or if you combine soil with other additives that are already enriched.\nHere’s How To Test Your Soil\n- Using a spade or trowel, take small samples of soil from three to ten random spots in your garden. The Environmental Sciences Analytical Center at Brooklyn College recommends sampling 6 to 8 inches deep for vegetables.\n- Thoroughly mix the soil in the container, taking care to remove any pebbles, leaves, or roots you might find. Then, transfer at least one cup of the soil mixture into a plastic bag and seal it (don’t fill the bag; it’ll be flattened if you mail it in an envelope and you don’t want dirt spilling out). Make sure the sample is dry; do not dry soil on a stove or radiator as this may affect the readings.\n- Mail the bag to your preferred testing site. Many of the colleges and universities who operate soil testing programs offer testing services at a low cost (most tests cost between $10-20: be sure to ask for heavy metal testing in addition to the standard panel). If you live in the East or South, try the University of Delaware College of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Folks in the Midwest should try Midwest Laboratories (a nationally-renowned testing center), or the K-State Soil Testing Lab at Kansas State University. West-Coasters should check out Perry Laboratory and Wallace Laboratory, two California-based greats who work specifically with farmers and gardeners. New Englanders need look no further than the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Soil and Plant Tissue Testing Laboratory, which boasts a 3-6 day turnaround time for most samples.\n- Follow-up with whoever conducts your soil test on how to proceed with your gardening plans. This video from the University of Delaware’s Soil Testing Program offers a nice introduction on how to decipher the numbers that will come back with your results."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d49b42d6-469a-4fd3-902b-947da9c9f438>","<urn:uuid:09ff5ca8-8d30-4249-80f3-18396a48ce55>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does water quality influence sake production and what are the key elements that determine its suitability for brewing?","answer":"Water quality significantly affects sake production since water comprises about 80% of sake and is used in quantities over 50 times the total rice weight. The key elements that determine water's suitability for sake brewing can be divided into beneficial and detrimental elements. Beneficial elements include potassium, phosphoric acid, and magnesium, which help with yeast and Koji mold propagation. Detrimental elements are iron and manganese, which can cause sake discoloration and negatively impact taste and aroma. Due to water's importance, many sake breweries are strategically located near high-quality, well-conserved water sources.","context":["You may know Sake is made from rice. Well, yes, you’re right. But what else? Can you name the 5 main Sake ingredients? These 5 Sake ingredients play such an important role in determining flavors and aromas of Sake.\nCheck out the 5 essential Sake ingredients!\n5 Main Sake Ingredients\nThe 5 main Sake ingredients are:\nRice used for Sake making is called Sakamai or Shozo kotekimai. Basically Sakamai (literally meaning Sake rice) is the common one, and Shozo kotekimai is like a jargon.\nSake rice is different from food rice. Sake rice is grown especially for Sake.\nHow is Sake rice different from food rice? There are 3 large differences:\n1. Appearance (Size)\nSake rice is larger than food rice. A small rice grain would easily crumble when polished.\n2. White Core\nSake rice has a white, opaque core at its center, called ‘Shinpaku’ in Japanese. Most of its component is starch, while the external part of rice consists of protein and fat (which will give off-flavors).\nThe external part will be polished off to remove those off-flavors. However, food rice has no or little white core. Thus it would be difficult to remove those off-flavors from food rice.\n3. Brewing Suitability\nSake rice has high water absorption rate and lower levels of protein and fat (lipids). Also after steaming, it’s hard on the outside and soft on the inside; the great environment for Koji mold propagation.\nSake is comprised of approx. 80% water. Thus, water quality greatly affects sake quality.\nThe amount of water used in Sake making adds up to more than 50 times the total weight of rice. Water is used for almost all steps – washing & soaking rice, creating Moromi mash and dilute Sake to adjust flavor and alcohol content.\nSo what kind of water is suitable for Sake? Let’s take a look:\n- Beneficial Elements: Potassium, Phosphoric acid and magnesium\n- Detrimental Elements: Iron, Manganese\nThose beneficial elements are necessary to aid the propagation of yeasts and Koji mold. On the other hand, the detrimental ones will cause discoloration of Sake and ruin the Sake taste and aroma.\nThis is why many Sake breweries are located near exquisite, well-conserved water sources.\n3. Koji Mold\nKoji Mold is a type of mold. It’s a ‘mold’! Eww! But don’t step back; it’s harmless to human body and actually very nutritious.\nKoji basically converts rice starch to sugar (glucose), which will be converted to alcohol by yeasts.\nMany people confuse Koji Mold with Koji:\n- Koji Mold: Mold spores themselves (that will propagate on steamed rice).\n- Koji: Rice with propagated Koji mold (in case of Sake). So rice + koji mold. Also known as rice koji.\nKoji can be called rice Koji, soy Koji, barley Koji, etc., depending on what Koji mold has propagated on.\nPlease note that SAKE USES RICE KOJI. NO SOY OR BARLEY.\nWhy stressing this point? Because some (wrongly) say Sake is not gluten-free as it uses the same Koji as miso. That’s not true. Sake uses rice Koji, whereas Miso used barley or soy Koji.\nEven Wikipedia doesn’t explain enough. We think that’s where the misconception comes from.\nYeasts convert sugar to alcohol, just like wine and beer. Most Sake breweries buy cultured yeasts from Brewing Society of Japan who has a variety of yeast types.\nYeast type greatly affect Sake taste and aroma. It can make Sake a savory Junmai-type, a fragrant Ginjo-type and others. Discover more about Sake Yeast Types here.\n5. Lactic Acid\nLactic acid is added to kill germs and prevent Sake flavors from deteriorating over time. It also gives acidity to Sake to balance with sweetness.\nSake breweries use either wildlife lactic acid lurking in the breweries or store-bought lactic acid:\n- Sake with wildlife lactic acid is called Kimoto-type, and\n- Sake with store-bought lactic acid is called Sokujo-type (90% of Sake on the market)\nWe’ll talk about Kimoto Sake in another article (coming soon).\nOther Ingredients (Optional)\nAlbeit not necessary, other ingredients may be added to Sake.\n- Distilled Alcohol: to adjust Sake flavors (give cleaner flavor). Sake without distilled alcohol has a prefix of ‘Junmai’ before its name. e.g. Junmai Shu, Junmai Ginjo and Junmai Daiginjo.\n- Acidulants, sugar, amino acid and seasoning: Especially in poor quality Sake e.g. Futsu Shu."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:33b0592e-6110-4e06-bc5e-5199f524ab34>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between using an analytical balance for room temperature vs hot samples? 🤔","answer":"Hot objects must be allowed to cool to room temperature before weighing on an analytical balance. This is because temperature differences can decrease the precision and accuracy of the balance, as deviations from room temperature may cause air currents that disrupt the sample inside the analytical balance. Both the balance and the sample should be at room temperature before the weighing process begins.","context":["analytical balance Operation: Require a draft-free location on a solid bench that is free of vibrations. Do not bump or place objects on the bench after zeroing the balance. Weigh powders on weighing paper or in weighing dishes. Handle objects with tongs, gloves, or weighing paper to prevent fingerprints. Let hot objects cool before weighing. Weigh hygroscopic materials rapidly since they will absorb water during weighing.\nconductivity bridge with flow cell Purpose: Measurement of both electrical resistance and conductance of solutions. If a measurement is to be performed in pure water, it is necessary to use a flow cell.\nconductivity bridge with flow cell Operation: Rinse the apparatus with sample by filling the receptacle and putting it in place on the apparatus. Discard this rinse and then fill the receptacle with sample and place it on the apparatus so no air bubbles are inside the conductivity cell. Adjust the temperature to 25.0EC, and record the reading from the conductivity meter.\ninductively coupled plasma analyzer Purpose: Measure the isotopic ratios of elements used in geochronologic/ thermochronologic, radiogenic isotopic, and stable isotopic studies\ninductively coupled plasma analyzer Operation: ICP-AES, a type of atomic emission spectroscopy ICP-MS, a type of mass spectrometry ICP-RIE, a type of reactive-ion etching\nin-line sodium monitor Purpose: Continuous monitoring of sodium in the process water To detect sodium breakthrough and to ensure the process water is pure.\nin-line sodium monitor Operation: The hydrogen ion interference is controlled by raising the pH of the sample (reducing the hydrogen ion concentration). This is achieved by adding an alkali – usually ammonia gas or a volatile amine. Temperature effects are reduced by monitoring temperature and carrying out automatic temperature compensation. The monitor is calibrated by use of solutions of known sodium ion concentration, with the electrode pair producing a millivolt output proportional to the sodium ion concentration.\nion selective electrode Purpose: Converts the activity of a specific ion dissolved in a solution into an electrical potential, which can be measured by a voltmeter or pH meter.\nion selective electrode Operation: ISE measures the potential of a specific ion in solution. This potential is measured against a stable reference electrode of constant potential. The potential difference between the two electrodes will depend upon the activity of the specific ion in solution. This activity is related to the concentration of that specific ion, therefore allowing the end-user to make an analytical measurement of that specific ion.\nmicrowave digestion Purpose: Sample decomposition Dissolve heavy metals in the presence of organic molecules prior to analysis by inductively coupled plasma, atomic absorption, or atomic emission measurement\nmicrowave digestion 3 main approaches to microwave dissolution: focused open-vessel low-pressure closed-vessel high-pressure closed-vessel.\nmicrowave digestion Operation: Expose a sample to a strong acid Raise the pressure and temperature through microwave irradiation. This increase in temperature and pressure of the low pH sample medium thereby increases both the speed of thermal decomposition of the sample, and the solubility of heavy metals in solution. Once these heavy metals are in solution, it is possible to quantitate or quantify the sample through elemental techniques.","A more precise measuring tool required for scientific and medical purposes may call for the use of analytical balances. When dealing with potentially dangerous and life threatening situations common in these fields, precise measurements can mean the difference between a resounding success and catastrophic failure, both within the laboratory or operating room. This is amplified even more so when a lab experiment or medical operation is put to the test in an everyday environment.\nAn analytical balance can have its share of trials and uses, such as in the scientific and medical fields mentioned above, in addition to other fields of study such as culinary science or industrial work. Any form of work which requires the precise measurement of different kinds of chemicals, materials, substances and other sensitive items may require the use of analytical balances, along with the necessary maintenance and care of any precision machine.Using an Analytical Balance\nAnalytical balances are used on different laboratory substances to help determine the mass with great precision and accuracy. Analytical balances are also capable of weighing lab samples all the way down to micro quantities. These lab samples contained within the analytical balance are enclosed in a transparent weighing chamber, which also protects the substance from tampering when placed on the scale, as well as preventing air currents in the room from affect the operation of the balance.\nPrecise readings are achieved through the maintenance of a constant load on the balance beam, where the mass is subtracted on the same side of the beam on which the sample substance is added. The final balance measurement is achieved through the use of a small spring force instead of the subtracted fixed masses.\nA sample to be weighed inside any analytical balances should be handled with great care at all times. Room temperature should be maintained with both the balance and the sample before the weighing process begins. A deviation from room temperature may cause the formation of air currents to disrupt the sample inside the analytical balance. Differences in temperature can also decrease the precision and accuracy of the analytical balance.\nAs a precision instrument, an analytical balance needs to be calibrated every time before a sample is weighed. Newer analytical balances may have an auto calibration feature which only requires a short cool down time in order to acclimatise to the environmental conditions present in the current lab setting when switched on. An analytical balance may have standard masses used in the automatic calibration process.\nOnce the analytical balance is calibrated, do not place additional weight or object on the same lab table on which the analytical balance itself resides. This may also cause ill effects to the accuracy of the weighing process. The scale should also be operated at a comfortable distance. Take special care not to accidentally bump or tamper with the scale during weighing, as you will have to repeat the entire weighing process from the beginning.\nDepending on the samples which are to be weighed. Powders, granules and liquids should not be transferred directly onto the weighing pan; granular or powder like materials must be placed on the scale using a piece of paper. Liquids may have to be transferred onto the weighing platform through the use of a spatula which pours the substance into the analytical scale. Hygroscopic substances which absorb moisture the moment they are exposed to air must be weighed quickly as possible for accurate and precise results. It also goes without saying that toxic or flammable substances need to be handled very carefully when placed into the scale.\nA substance weighed on analytical balances of any kind may have to be tared after being weighed on the scale in order to disregard the added weight of the container or vessel which the substance is contained in. Some analytical scales may simply have a tare button on the balance itself, while others may not, requiring the use of manual calculation. This option present on some analytical balances allows the balance to negate the extra weight of the container or vessel counted in during the weighing process. The tare process requires that the doors of the weighing chamber are closed in order for correct and precise data.\nMaintenance of an Analytical Balance\nEvery precision instrument needs periodical maintenance to operate at peak performance and efficiency. Analytical balances are no different from this rule. Be sure to exercise proper care and maintenance on analytical balances to ensure a high degree of accuracy during every weighing session.\nThe weighing chamber must be free of dust particles at all times, even when not in use. The slightest hint of dirt may set your weighing results off by small quantities, as most analytical balances are particularly sensitive instruments. Be sure to always keep the doors of the weighing chamber closed at all times, so that dust and other particles may not enter the weighing chamber.\nTake special care to clean the weighing pan or platform regularly in order to ensure accurate measurement results which are not affected by dust and dirt particles. Also be sure not to touch the weighing platform without sterilized gloves in order not to leave fingerprints or grime accumulated on your fingers. These seemingly insignificant particles may also set the course of the weighing process off by more than you would be comfortable with. A soft cloth or a sterilized brush can be used to clean typical analytical balances."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:46db814b-6b6e-447a-a031-acc2b8143478>","<urn:uuid:82251843-9403-4ab7-b848-ce78cba6515a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do epigenetic modifications from trauma get transmitted across generations?","answer":"Epigenetic modifications can be transmitted from generation to generation through environmental conditions that modify gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. In the case of trauma, these modifications can occur through DNA methylation, which involves adding methyl groups to DNA and typically represses gene expression. This has been demonstrated in Holocaust survivors and their offspring, where trauma-induced methylation changes were observed in the FKBP5 gene, though in opposite directions - higher methylation in survivors but lower in their offspring. These modifications can influence the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms in offspring, though the exact mechanisms of transmission are not fully understood.","context":["Intergenerational Transmission of Stress Vulnerability and Resilience Following Trauma\nExtreme trauma affects FKBP5 methylation in survivors of the Holocaust as well as in their offspring.\nEnvironmental conditions modify the expression of genes without changing the DNA sequence. These so-called epigenetic modifications, just like a discrete sequence of DNA nucleotides, can be transmitted from generation to generation. In other words, the environment has an influence over heritable changes in phenotype.1 Epigenetic inheritance is known to play a role in the effects of nutrition and undernutrition on increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neonatal adiposity across generations.2,3 A similar concept may also explain the higher prevalence of lifetime neuropsychiatric illness—including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and mood and anxiety disorders—in offspring of Holocaust survivors, as well as in offspring of parents and grandparents who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to that in a control population.4,5\nEpigenetic alterations that occur as a consequence of exposure to traumatic stress and that are then transmitted across generations to influence the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms in offspring have been documented in rodents but not in humans. In 2015, a team of investigators led by Rachel Yehuda, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience, and director of the Traumatic Stress Studies Division at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, provided direct evidence that parental trauma in humans is associated with epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, which are seen in both Holocaust survivors and their adult offspring.6 (DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl group to DNA and is mainly associated with repression of gene expression.)\nThe neuroendocrine system, via activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and subsequent release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex, is crucial in regulating the physiologic stress response in mammals. Dysregulation of the HPA axis, which can be associated with abnormal cortisol production or altered glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity, contributes to enhanced stress vulnerability and susceptibility to developing PTSD. In addition, a number of different genes can modify HPA axis reactivity, and polymorphisms in HPA-axis-related genes can regulate both GR sensitivity and cortisol levels.7\nVideo news update: Dr. Rachel Yehuda speaks about trauma and memories. Watch now.\nClinical studies have implicated FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5), a co-chaperone of the GR, in stress-related disorders. Also, FKBP5 alters GR complex affinity for cortisol and decreases overall GR signaling. It is worth noting that human genetic studies have revealed interactions between FKBP5 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and early childhood adversity that significantly predict the onset of PTSD. Taken together, these biological pathways may contribute to the heightened risk of developing stress-related psychiatric disorders.7\nIn their 2015 study, Dr Yehuda and colleagues showed that extreme trauma affects FKBP5 methylation in surviving parents as well as in their offspring. Severe parental trauma-induced methylation changes, however, were in opposite directions. When compared to control participants, methylation was higher in survivors of the Holocaust but was lower in their adult offspring. “The directional difference in methylation between Holocaust survivors and their offspring was unexpected but may reflect an intergeneration biological accommodation,” the authors concluded.6\nIn a conversation with Psychiatry Advisor, Dr Yehuda added, “It's really important to understand that epigenetic effects are a combination of negative effects and positive effects, such as accommodations and adaptations, which might be transmitted from parents to their offspring. If a parent is able to transmit an effect to offspring, the reason may not be to perpetuate a negative effect of trauma but to prepare the offspring and give them tools to better cope with the environment. This is a very empowering concept that makes psychotherapy extremely valuable.”\nThe authors also noted that “it is not possible to infer mechanisms of transmission from these data.” However, “FKBP5 methylation was associated with wake-up cortisol levels, indicating functional relevance of the methylation measures.”6\nAlthough it is evident that PTSD is caused by a complex interplay between genetic and environmental components, association studies and epidemiologic analyses are unable to detect causative biological mechanisms that underlie its development. Thus, nonhuman animal models are essential to address the biological basis of psychiatric illness because they allow rigorous control of both genetic and environmental variables. Although the FKBP5 methylation findings were recently replicated in a monkey model, Dr Yehuda mentioned that these results are yet to be published.\n1. van Otterdijk SD, Michels KB.

{"question":"¿Cuál es la principal difference between criminal y civil conspiracy en terms of legal requirements?","answer":"The key difference is that civil conspiracy requires the agreement to be acted upon and cause actual damage, while criminal conspiracy does not require a positive act. As explained in the NCB v Gamble case, in criminal law, simply selling someone a gun knowing they will use it for murder makes the seller an accessory, but this alone would not create tort liability. Civil conspiracy requires both knowledge of the combination and active participation to achieve the common end.","context":["What is a civil conspiracy in law?\nCivil conspiracy is:\n- a combination – ie a type of agreement - between two or more individuals or legal entities\n- to do an act which is tortious\n- with a predominant purpose to injure another person,\n- where the agreement uses:\n- lawful means to injure the claimant, or\n- unlawful means to injure the claimant,\n- and damage is suffered by the other person.\nIn the tort of conspiracy, the combination required to make out a claim for conspiracy doesn’t require a formal, expressly stated agreement.\nThat’s because the law recognises that conspiracies can arise all sorts of different ways.\nWhen a person assists others to inflict tortious damage, they are all in the conspiracy.\nConspiracies to damage businesses as just as unlawful as conspiracies to cause physical harm.\nThere are two types of conspiracy. They both have elements in common.\nThe Combination in Conspiracy: the Agreement\nIt’s the combination of defendants taking concerted action to achieve the common end that makes conspiracy, conspiracy.\nThe agreement reached between the co-conspirators and the combined acts are aimed or directed at the claimant, the person that has suffered loss.\nThe combination isn’t the equivalent of making a contract. It’s more open-textured than that.\nFor the conspiracy to arise:\n- an express agreement is not required. It can be:\n- unspoken or\n- inferred from conduct, including knowledge attributed as a consequence of wilful blindness\nThere’s no need for the participants to map out a plan between one another.\nAnd the combination is able to be reverse engineered from facts proved on the balance of probabilities in the case.\n- two or more legal persons (ie legal entities) - deliberately combine with a common intention to achieve a common end. The co-conspirators share the same objective to cause damage to the claimant\n- the co-conspirators don’t need to join the conspiracy all at the same time\nIt’s likely that at least one of the alleged co-conspirators will be required to share the knowledge of unlawfulness of the relevant conduct with another co-conspirator.\nIn Lonrho Plc v Fayed  1 AC 448, Lord Bridge summarised it as follows:\nWhere conspirators act with the predominant purpose of injuring the plaintiff and in fact inflict damage on him, but do nothing which would have been actionable if done by an individual acting alone, it is in the fact of their concerted action for that illegitimate purpose that the law, however anomalous it may now seem, finds a sufficient ground to condemn their action as illegal and tortious.\nBut when conspirators intentionally injure the plaintiff and use unlawful means to do so, it is no defence for them to show that their primary purpose was to further or protect their own interests; it is sufficient to make their action tortious that the means used were unlawful.\nLiability of Co-conspirators\nIn the tort of conspiracy, it’s the combination that gives rise to the unlawfulness.\nThat combination alters the legal character and consequences of the actions of the conspirators, and gives rise to liability for those actions forming part of the conspiracy.\nWith that, the separate tort of conspiracy arises, which would not arise if the combination did not exist.\nSo, it gives rise to an independent and additional liability to any unlawful acts of each of the co-conspirators. Once the combination – the concerted action to a common end - is acted upon to cause loss or damage, it is actionable as a tort in its own right.\nThis also means that those co-conspirators that reach the agreement but do not cause the damage are just as liable as those that do cause the damage.\nSuppose 3 people conspire to steal copyright works of a company.\nOnly one of them actually infringes the copyright.\nThat person is liable for copyright infringement.\nThe others facilitate the infringement - knowing the common end to be achieved – to steal copyright works.\nAll 3 of them are liable for conspiracy.\n- liable as a joint tortfeasor because they participated in the commission of the tort with others, to achieve the combination, which was tortious.\n- jointly and severally liable for the loss caused by them arising from the actions of the co-conspirators.\nDifference with criminal conspiracies\nCivil conspiracy requires that the agreement is acted on, and causes damage. It follows that a conspiracy must necessarily have been acted on.\nCriminal conspiracy is different. The criminal law doesn’t require a positive act to assist with underlying the offence. Knowledge that a conspirator is aiding and abetting the primary offence is sufficient.\nIn NCB v Gamble (1959), Devlin LJ put it like this:\nthe consequence [in the criminal law] is that selling a person a gun knowing that person will use it to kill someone else will make the seller an accessory to the murder but will not in itself make him liable in tort.\nThere is no accessory liability in conspiracy without participation. Liability in tort requires knowledge of the combination and acting upon it to achieve the common end.\nThe Two Types of Civil Conspiracy\nClaims for conspiracy obviously involve more than one defendant.\nFor each defendant, the claimant bears the burden of proof of each individual element of the conspiracy on the balance of probabilities against each defendant (ie each co-conspirator).\nIt may be that some facts apply in common to different defendants: such as those going to the common concerted action.\nEach however will contribute in different ways by their own acts which establishes liability.\nLawful means Conspiracy\nThe acts constituting the conspiracy may be lawful, but the predominant purpose is to injure the claimant.\nThis gives rise to a lawful means conspiracy, also known as “conspiracy to injure”.\nWhat is Conspiracy to Injure?\nConspiracy to injure is also referred to as \"lawful means conspiracy\".\nBreaking it down, conspiracy to injure requires a claimant to satisfy a series of elements:\n- concerted action between two or more persons including the defendant (which is the combination)\n- a predominant purpose on the part of the defendant to cause damage to the claimant\n- an overt act by the defendant in pursuance of the agreement or undertaking; and\n- damage results.\nIn a \"lawful means conspiracy\":\n- the overt acts done pursuant to a conspiracy may be lawful,\n- but they are done with an intention with the intention of causing damage: injuring the claimant.\n- an otherwise innocent act of agreement becomes actionable when the object of the agreement is unlawful conduct.\nThe difference with unlawful means conspiracy (see below) is that the combination causes harm to the victim: the means employed to do so is lawful.\nAs it was put by Viscount Simon in Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch  AC 435:\nIf that predominant purpose is to damage another person and damage results, that is tortious conspiracy. If the predominant purpose is the lawful protection or promotion of any lawful interest of the combiners (no illegal means being employed), it is not a tortious conspiracy, even though it causes damage to another person.\nAccordingly, the question is whether a purpose to injure was the source of the acts that grew from them.\nWhere there is more than one purpose or motive to the conspiracy, the claimant bears the burden of proof to show that the predominant intention was to injure. If that is the case, a cause of action arises for conspiracy, even though the means used were lawful.\nUnlawful means Conspiracy\nThe elements of unlawful means conspiracy are:\n- concerted action between two or more persons including the defendant (the combination)\n- take steps which are unlawful\n- knowledge of the unlawfulness on the part of the defendant\n- intention on the part of defendant to cause damage to the claimant, whether or not it was the predominant purpose\n- an overt act by the defendant in pursuit of the combination; and\n- damage results.\nThe unlawful means conspiracy can arise from anything the conspirators are not lawfully entitled to do.\nThere must however be a sufficient connection between the acts carried out and the aim of the conspiracy. It is not enough that the unlawful means is just incidental to or nothing to do with the damage inflicted.\nThe lawful conduct must be the means by which harm is inflicted on the claimant.\nThe unlawful means might arise from:\n- infringement of copyright, or any other intellectual property right\n- infringement of the database right\n- breach of contract, whether or not it is actionable by the claimant\n- breach of confidence\n- breach of a statutory duty\n- sham transactions: acts done or documents created which are intended give the impression of legal rights which do not actually exist\n- contempt of court\n- theft, obtaining money by false pretences, or assault occasioning actual bodily harm\nA person has a right to advance his own interests by lawful means even if the foreseeable consequence is to damage the interests of others.\nThat is a natural incident of a market economy.\nThe existence of the right to advance one’s own interests affords a just cause or excuse. There cannot be any conspiracy. Where unlawful methods are engaged or the motive is unlawful, it’s a different matter.\nIt’s not simply a matter of exercising a legal right. It’s the predominant purpose not of advancing his own interests but of injuring the claimant which is the purpose.\nIn either case, there is no just cause or excuse for the combination.\nBusiness Conspiracy Solicitors\nConspiracies can arise in any situation where two or more people have cooperated to cause financial loss to a business.\nIt can stem from fraudulent intentions, infringement of intellectual property rights, breaches of contract, taking of physical property, and interfering with the administration of the business.\nConspiracies expand the collection of wrongdoers to draw in the benefit of the law to correct the unlawful wrongdoing.\nOur solicitors can help."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e79a3fdd-9ba9-4dc9-9005-5c28da6a3563>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm studying neuroscience and curious about how sedatives work in the brain. Could you explain the mechanism by which drugs like barbiturates and benzodiazepines affect GABA receptors?","answer":"Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and anesthetics like propofol work by binding to specific sites on receptors located at nerve cell contact points (synapses) in the brain. They increase the effect of the inhibiting endogenous neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). While high doses would be needed for these drugs to act like GABA itself, even lower doses can increase the effect of endogenous GABA by two to three times.","context":["Instead of a sleeping pill or a mood enhancer, a nose full of jasmine from Gardenia jasminoides could also help: in collaboration with Dr. Olga Sergeeva and Prof. Helmut Hass from the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, researchers from Bochum led by Prof. Dr. Dr. Dr. Hanns Hatt have discovered that the two fragrances Vertacetal-coeur (VC) and the chemical variation (PI24513) have the same molecular mechanism of action and are as strong as the commonly prescribed barbiturates or propofol. They soothe, relieve anxiety and promote sleep. The researchers have now been granted a patent for their discovery. They report in the current issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry (online).\nEvery fifth German takes a sedative once a year\nSedatives, sleeping pills and relaxants are the most frequently prescribed psychotropic drugs. The difference between calming and hypnotic effect depends solely on the dosage. The classes of substances that exert a calming effect include alcohol, barbiturates, opiates, and since the 1950s, the benzodiazepines, which are now among the world's most widely prescribed drugs. In the course of a year, about 20 percent of all Germans take such drugs or are treated with them for anaesthetic purposes. However, benzodiazepines are not only potentially addictive, but can also cause serious side effects, e.g. depression, dizziness, hypotension, muscle weakness and impaired coordination.\nDrugs enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA\nBenzodiazepines, barbiturates and anaesthetics such as propofol act via specific adhesion sites on receptors that lie at contact points of nerve cells (synapses) in the brain and increase the effect of the inhibiting endogenous neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). In order to act like GABA itself, the medication would have to be highly dosed, but even lower doses are sufficient to increase the effect of endogenous GABA two to threefold.\nFragrances instead of tablets\nThe RUB researchers have now performed a large screening study in which they tested hundreds of fragrances to determine their effect on GABA receptors in humans and mice. The two fragrances vertacetal-coeur (VC) and the chemical variation (PI24513) were the strongest: they were able to increase the GABA effect by more than five times and thus act as strongly as the known drugs. The \"cross check\" with genetically modified GABA receptors in transgenic mice which no longer responded to propofol confirmed that the mechanism of action is the same: the altered receptor also no longer responded to the fragrances.\nFragrances for sleep disorders and stress\nBehavioural tests with mice in Prof. Lübbert’s laboratory in the Department of Animal Physiology at the RUB then eliminated the last doubts concerning the qualities of fragrance as a sedative. Injected or inhaled, the fragrances generated a calming effect: in a Plexiglas cage whose air contained a high concentration of the fragrance, the mice ceased all activity and sat quietly in the corner. Via the air breathed in, the scent molecules go from the lungs into the blood and then transmitted from there to the brain. Electrophysiological measurements of neurons in the brain areas responsible for the sleep-wake cycle showed that the GABA-effect on those nerve cells active in sleep was enhanced by the fragrances. “We have discovered a new class of GABA receptor modulator which can be administered parentally and through the respiratory air,” says Prof. Hatt. “Applications in sedation, anxiety, excitement and aggression relieving treatment and sleep induction therapy are all imaginable. The results can also be seen as evidence of a scientific basis for aromatherapy.” By changing the chemical structure of the scent molecules, the researchers hope to achieve even stronger effects.\nOlga A.

{"question":"How do durability requirements compare between wood waterproofing materials and architectural shingles?","answer":"Wood waterproofing materials are required to maintain their protective properties for at least 5-6 years without changing specifications under high temperatures and other factors. They must also resist moisture, steam, and both natural and non-natural effects. In comparison, architectural shingles, while marketed as 30-year products, actually have an expected service life of approximately 25 years, though this depends on maintenance and climate conditions. Both materials' durability can be affected by weather patterns and require proper maintenance for optimal longevity.","context":["Discussing the main types of wood waterproofing and the ways of performing it in a proper way.\nWood is the most popular and indispensable construction material thanks to its excellent technical properties. But, just as any other coating, it is characterized by some disadvantages. The most important of them is timber’s instability to moisture – as a result it has a tendency to rot and mold. Wood waterproofing performed in a proper way will protect your house and will let it serve you for long.\nBefore you choose the best waterproofing for wood of your house, you can learn some main waterproofing rules. There are some general requirements for wood waterproofing process:\nThe protective layer has to:\n- be carried out in a certain way using special waterproofing compounds which do not contain any harmful toxic substances;\n- protect the wood from moisture, steam and other similar effects, both natural and non-natural;\n- provide the maximum moisture resistance;\n- be easy to apply, quick to dry;\n- create the dense invisible membrane on the surface;\n- be covered with a layer of waterproof decorative plaster, tile or any other building material having a solid resistant to moisture;\n- be characterized by improved stability and good adhesion to any other building materials.\nThe protective layer has not to:\n- change its specifications over the time under influence of high temperatures and other factors;\n- emit toxic substances which are dangerous to human health and the environment;\n- lose its properties for at least 5-6 years.\nThere are several groups of wood waterproofing materials:\n- waterproofing paint/waterproofing spray;\n- wood pasting;\n- cement compositions;\n- penetrating waterproofing.\nYou can use bitumen or polymer sealant or emulsion which must be covered in 2-5 layers using special tools (for example, by “Behr”). It usually creates the coating which has a solid resistant to mechanical, chemical and environmental impacts. It is easy in application, has durability and rather normal density. It is characterized by quite good fire, wear, steam, water, UV radiation resistance. It may be used in any climatic conditions. The main advantage of this kind of wood waterproofing is creating a solid coating which prevents the ingress of moisture in the joints and seams.\nThese are bitumen or polymer materials which form a continuous film (waterproof carpet) stuck or surfaced in several layers on the surface of the wooden structure. They are characterized by water and water vapor permeability, resistance to mechanical and natural impacts, have a long life, easy maintenance and affordability. They are glued to the wooden surface with a hot or cold mastics. The main advantage of this kind of wood waterproofing is its accessibility. An important drawback is the possible ingress of water through the joints.\nThe most popular cement compositions for wood waterproofing are hot bitumen and pitch. They are poured on the pre-roofed sheet or roll waterproofing, such as prepared roofing paper or other materials reinforced with fiberglass. After hardening they form another additional layer of waterproofing – which has no joints and seams and is resistant to moisture, sunlight and mechanical stress – on the wooden surface. The main advantages of this kind of wood waterproofing are ease of application, endurance, strength, excellent water, team and fire resistance, consistency and a long life.\nYou can use a water-repellent stain, based on cement, chemically active additives and ground sand, which is impregnated with 60% wooden substrates making them waterproof, but at the same time vapor-permeable. They are most commonly used for waterproofing basements and cellars of wooden buildings. The main advantages of this kind of wood waterproofing are ease of application, durability, availability, reliability, good water and vapor permeability, possibility of putting on a wet surface, no need in preliminary preparations, excellent anti-corrosion ability. The main disadvantage is the inability to resist the natural and mechanical stress.\n- Clean it from accumulated dirt and dust.\n- Repair cracks, holes, bumps and bulges with special mastics, it will provide a reliable protective layer.\n- Treated it with a special antiseptic composition.\n- Ensure good adhesion of waterproofing materials treated with a base by applying a special primer applied in several layers\nImportant! It is better to choose a primer of the same class as the waterproofing compound. Before you start the waterproofing process the prepared surface must be perfectly dried, all joints and angles must be glued using a special waterproof glue tape – it will provide good protection from moisture vulnerabilities.","How Long Do Asphalt Shingles Last?\nIf you have recently had an asphalt shingle installation, you will naturally want to know how long your roof will last. If you have an asphalt shingle composition roof, you can expect your roof to last about twenty years. This estimate, of course, depends on the climate and prevailing weather patterns of where you live. If your area has a history of hurricanes or severe weather events, this may impact the overall roof lifetime of your roof system. It will also be important to consider the amount of roof maintenance that your roof receives. It is important to conscript a professional roofing company for regular roof inspections. With great roofing maintenance and a a proper roof installation, you can expect great roof longevity.\nAre Asphalt Shingles Good?\nAsphalt shingles are exceedingly popular in North America. That is because they are endlessly versatile in terms of colors and shape. Asphalt shingles are also relatively easy to install and quite affordable. For these reasons, property developers and homeowners have welcomed asphalt shingles on to their homes and properties. They also have a good standard roof lifetime. While asphalt shingles don’t last as long as a metal or tile roof, they remain a popular and affordable standard in the roofing industry.\nWhat Are the Best Asphalt Shingles?\nQuality is very important when it comes to asphalt shingles. Please read over the following list of recommended shingles to learn more about high-quality asphalt shingles.\n- GAF Marquis WeatherMax shingles.\n- CertainTeed XT 25.\n- Owens Corning Supreme AR.\n- Tamko Heritage Vintage.\nWhile these shingles are certainly highly recommended, your local professional roofer will likely have some exceptional selections for you to choose from. You should be a discerning consumer and learn about your roofing material before it gets installed on your roof.\nWhat is the Difference Between Architectural Shingles and Asphalt Shingles?\nAre you wondering what the difference is between architectural shingles and asphalt shingles? If so, you are not alone. Many people look at shingles and wonder what the differences are. Please allow this distinction to be made here. Three-tab shingles have one shingle tab size and shape that consists of three separate tabs that are twelve inches wide. These tabs are coated with asphalt in order to shed water. Architectural shingles are characterized as laminate or dimensional. They come in different sizes and shapes and are considered a premium roofing product.\nHow Long Do 30-Year Architectural Shingles Really Last?\nWhile 30-year architectural shingles have a defining title, it is important to consider roofing maintenance and the prevailing climate and weather patterns of your area. According to leading resources online, the expected service life of a thirty-year product is approximately twenty-five years. Of course, the best way to find out the current condition of your roof is to consult with a professional, insured\nAre Asphalt Shingles Energy Efficient\nIf you are looking for energy-efficient roofing material, you may want to pass over asphalt shingles. This is because even in a lighter color, asphalt shingles do not perform well in comparison with other roofing materials in the industry. Asphalt shingles are very good at absorbing heat and are poor at reflecting it.\nWill Asphalt Shingles Seal in Cold Weather\nIf shingles are installed in cold weather, they will not immediately seal until warmer temperatures are present. The sealant will need to activate. If temperatures are at or below forty degrees Fahrenheit, it will impact the sealant. Your professional roofing contractor will have experience with shingle installations and will have some thoughts about installing shingles in different weather patterns and temperatures.\nWho Invented Asphalt Shingles\nAre you wondering who invented asphalt shingles? In terms of revolutionary inventions, asphalt shingles are a modern marvel. The official inventor of asphalt shingles is American Henry Reynolds. Henry Reynolds hailed from Grand Rapids, Michigan. The asphalt shingles he produced first were used in 1903. Asphalt shingles were generally used in America by 1911. Asphalt shingles were so successful that by 1939 eleven million squares of shingles were being produced. Since then, asphalt shingles have come to revolutionize and dominate the roofing industry in North America.\nWhy Do Asphalt Shingles Curl\nAre your asphalt shingles curling? If so, you will need to contact a professional roofing contractor. That is because you could have a problem with inadequate venting. The air that is taken in your roof is displaced through higher parts of your roof. Without proper venting moisture and heat could become trapped in your attic. The heat that is added additionally to the bottom side of your shingles can cause them to wear prematurely. They will fade and curl.\nIf you would like to discuss your asphalt shingles in Baltimore, MD, our team is here to assist.

{"question":"How can I extend the width and length of a modular circular bridge?","answer":"The circular bridge can be extended in both width and length quite straightforwardly: To make it wider, additional beams can be added side by side. To make it longer, additional units can be added to extend the beam length. However, the maximum span length possible with this design is around 25m. For bridges requiring longer distances, intermediate supports can be used to create a series of spans up to 25m each.","context":["Once assembled, the 20m-long beams could be erected using traditional methods (image: Rijkswaterstaat)\nFirms in the Netherlands developing the next generation of ‘circular’ bridge designs should consider whether the weight of bridge elements could be reduced, according to a review of Rijkswaterstaat’s prototype. New ideas for reusable surfacing and parapets are among other improvements being invited from commercial partners.\nThe pilot scheme, run by the Dutch infrastructure agency Rijkswaterstaat in partnership with contractor Van Hattum & Blankevoort and precast specialist Consolis Spanbeton, saw development and construction of a prototype ‘circular viaduct’ which was erected for use on a construction site in Kampen in December 2018 (Bd&e Long Life Bridges supplement). After being in service for ten months, it was dismantled in September and will be rebuilt for public use this year at a new location in the Dutch city of Almere.\nWhile this pilot scheme has proved that it is possible to build a circular bridge that results in only 1% of wasted material, Rijkswaterstaat is now inviting commercial partners to bid for funding either to progress improvements to this design, or develop new ideas to increase circularity in the infrastructure sector.\nThis call for proposals will be administered via the Strategic Business Innovation Research scheme, and was due to be launched officially during national circular economy week in the Netherlands, earlier this month (February).\nThe aim of the circular viaduct pilot project was to develop a bridge which was as close as possible to 100% reusable; significantly extending lifespan, reducing material usage and waste, and supporting sustainability. Estimates suggest the circular bridge elements have a lifespan of around 200 years – much longer than a traditional bridge as they can be dismantled and reused when they are no longer required in the original location. The idea came from contractor Van Hattum & Blankevoort and was taken on by RWS as for the circular working initiative.\nThe prototype was erected on a construction site and put into use for ten months (image: Rijkswaterstaat)\nThe 20m-long bridge consists of 40 precast reinforced concrete elements assembled into five beams to create a 7.4m-wide deck. Each beam is created by eight elements which are connected using prestressing cables and have specially-designed shear keys at the joints. The only material that cannot be reused is the grout between the precast elements – less than 0.5% of the total. Grout was chosen over epoxy as it enabled the elements to be separated after use.\nThe trial location was a construction site near Kampen in Overijssel, around 80km north-east of Amsterdam; the bridge was used by construction traffic as part of a haul road until September, when the dismantling procedure took place.\nThe prototype was fully dismantled in September to prove that it could be done (image: Rijkswaterstaat)\nRWS technical manager Jan Willem Spruit says that although the prototype was entirely dismantled into its constituent parts, it would not usually be necessary to do so if, as in this case, it will be reused in the same arrangement. The intention was to demonstrate that the prototype could be fully dismantled without any damage to the main elements, to prove the case for circularity. “It was interesting to see that the grout came off quite easily,” Spruit reveals. However it was also noted that the upper 100mm of the joints was not completely filled with grout – there were voids here and there. The joints remain the most difficult part of the design for this circular bridge prototype. “We still haven’t been able to find an alternative to the grout, but we will continue to look for one,” says Spruit.\nIn fact the dismantling procedure resulted in some damage to the shear keys, he reveals, but representing around 1% of the structure it was within the predicted tolerance. These keys will be repaired before the bridge is reassembled, he says. For future relocation, the bridge could simply be dismantled into its beam elements for transport and reassembly.\nAdapting the existing design to create a wider or longer structure is quite straightforward: additional beams can be added to make it wider, or additional units to make the beams longer. But the maximum span length with this design is around 25m, says Spruit. “That’s not a problem because the precast beams that it is intended to replace are around the same length.” If intermediate supports can be accommodated, a series of spans each up to 25m long can be used to create a longer bridge. The prototype is designed to carry full highway loading and was used daily by large construction wagons for the ten months it was in place. What’s more, the structure was thoroughly instrumented during its service life, and monitoring data is publicly available alongside all the details of the design, construction and dismantling of the bridge. The purpose of this is to try and create the right conditions to encourage commercial partners to pursue improvements to the prototype, or to use the data to develop other proposals.\nThe initial intention was to gather as much data as possible, but this idea was scaled back when it became clear that it would be too expensive, requiring separate sensors on each element of each beam. So, deflection was measured at a number of fixed points, along with joint movement, forces in the longitudinal prestressing, and temperature. A photo was taken of each vehicle as it crossed the bridge to correlate with the measurements. Limits were set so that warnings could be generated if they were exceeded, but in general the bridge behaved exactly as predicted, if anything with less deflection than had been anticipated.\nThe joint detail and grouting are the most challenging part of the prototype (image: Rijkswaterstaat)\nAs a test case, it has been a success, Spruit confirms, and the lessons are being shared in an open learning environment to support progress in the development of circular bridges. What was unexpected was the difficulty of seeing the process through. “Although we were using common technology, the process of putting it all together and building the bridge was a technical challenge,” he reflects, and warns that it is easy to underestimate the energy and time that such a project requires.\nSpruit acknowledges that moving from a prototype to a commercial product is a major challenge. “If you plan to build a circular bridge design, you will need more material, and it will be more expensive,” he confirms. RWS is trying to address this by including an incentive in its procurement process for bids that demonstrate circularity. “This is alongside incentives for reduced environmental impact, carbon footprint, and so on,” Spruit says. The whole life cost of a circular bridge would be competitive even if it was only used for 40 or 50 years, he believes – and the potential is for such bridges to last four times as long, whether on the original site or at other locations.\nDuring the process, the team learned that intensive collaboration between all parties is necessary if creativity is to be exploited and decisions made quickly. And while assembling the units into beams was slower than anticipated – the filling of the joints being a particularly time-intensive procedure – once they were assembled, erection of the beams took about the same time as precast alternatives.\nFurther work is needed into a number of technical aspects of the circular viaduct. For example, investigation into the behaviour of the shear keys is recommended, particularly in terms of collapse behaviour, and their standardisation has been proposed. Extending circularity to other elements, such as deck surfacing, parapets and lighting, is also necessary. Although the prototype works well, the report suggests that the size of the elements should be reviewed to see if they can be optimised to reduce material use even further. The report also asks what standardisation is necessary to enable the deck to reach its maximum lifespan – and indeed whether a 200-year service life can be proven n\nFor more about the circular viaduct project, visit www.circulairviaduct.nl (in Dutch)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8b7bd2d5-a7c4-489b-b654-3c70b8cb8dcf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey animation fans! Been looking for some old-school Canadian cartoons - which TV shows did the artist who worked on Heavy Metal also do backgrounds for?","answer":"The artist worked as a background painter on several TV series including The Raccoons, For Better or Worse, Dennis the Menace, The Chipmunks, Where's Waldo, and Sonic the Hedgehog.","context":["KT: First, we need to hear some of your backstory. Can you tell us a bit about yourself?\nGordon Coulthart: I grew up on a dairy farm near Morewood Ontario in a family of nine kids. You can see from my art that growing up on the farm had an impact on my art and humour. I was always creative, and I watched my sisters and brothers paint. I went to Algonquin College in the 70s to study Commercial Art. I was always a big fan of Norman Rockwell and advertising art.\nIn the late 70s, I heard about a cartoon studio here in Ottawa and I met Lee Atkinson, whose father Vic owned the studio. I started as a cel painter on a Christmas special called “The Little Brown Burro.” My world changed forever. I was working side by side with great animators and artists. I was most interested in background painting, and slowly worked my way up to become a background painter on many many TV series and a few movies: The Raccoons, For Better or Worse, Dennis the Menace, and Heavy Metal to name a few. I have always made Ottawa my home, but worked in LA and Vancouver for periods of time on shows like The Chipmunks, Where’s Waldo, and Sonic the Hedgehog. In 1992, I became partners with Funbag Animation, a studio that did service work for Toronto and LA. It is there I created King, an animated series of 56 episodes that ran on Family Channel for five years. While my career in animation was moving along, I was also co-creator in the syndicated cartoon called Farcus, which ran in The Ottawa Citizen and The Ottawa Sun as well as 250 other papers worldwide. I have worked on over a thousand titles in my 35 years in the animation world.\nYour work is really unique, and ranges from snowy landscapes with a Group of Seven vibe to cartoony robot fish and penguins. Where does your inspiration come from? Tell us about your process.\nI combine my two loves: cartooning and painting. I used to marvel at Mad Magazine and National Lampoon Magazine as a kid. I see everything as a cartoon or with a funny angle. Sometimes my paintings are just doodles, but taken to another level. I never discount an idea that pops in my head. I write it down or draw it out. I have books filled with crazy things. I paint a lot, and fast, so I can take chances and am not afraid to make mistakes with a crazy idea. And there are lots of crazy ideas! When I paint landscapes it is like putting a puzzle together using light and colour. I am constantly trying to fit all the pieces together. It’s like a training exercise. I switch back and forth all the time. Lots of times I will work on three of four cartoon and landscapes at a time. I just flick a switch in my brain.\nWhat do you do when you’re not painting?\nI love to do carpentry and handyman work. I am currently the manager of the seasonal department at Rona, and that gives me the freedom to paint.\nOne of your biggest works this year is at Dovercourt right now, at the bottom of the wading pool. Have you ever done anything like this before? How did it come about?\nThe Dovercourt pool was a lot of fun. I sold a painting to my friends Trish and David, and Trish [Stolte] works at Dovercourt. She suggested doing an art show there and it went very well this past spring. John Rapp, the Executive Director, loved my work and set up the pool job. It’s a big hit with the kids and their parents. I did a 16”x16” painting first, got the go ahead from John, and painted it in one afternoon.\nWhat’s the reaction to this piece been like so far?\nSuper positive. I have seen the kids playing games with it, trying not to get eaten by the giant metal fish.\nWhere else can we see your work right now?\nI have landscapes at the Wellington Eatery at 1012 Wellington St. I also have work hanging in Blueprint Home at 1301 Wellington as well as the Carleton Tavern. I will be showing new work in September at Living Colour Art Gallery at 412 Dalhousie St.\nYou seem to make good use of social media. You’re on Tumblr and Twitter and Facebook. Does it help or hinder your work? How does it affect your process, if at all. Or does it just provide the means to procrastinate?\nI use Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, and Crated for exposure. It’s like having a wall to hang my work on. It gets it out of my studio and in front of people, which gives me immediate access.\nDo you have any advice for artists who might just be starting out?\nGet into an art group or class, you will learn the most through others, and competition is good.

{"question":"Could you compare the health effects of ingesting arsenic versus caffeine? Both seem to be harmful substances, but I'd like to understand the differences.","answer":"Both substances can be harmful but have different effects. Arsenic is classified as a poison and carcinogen, with long-term exposure linked to multiple cancers (skin, lung, bladder, liver, kidney, and prostate). It can also cause skin lesions and diarrhea even at low levels. Caffeine, while less severe, can be harmful if swallowed, causing gastrointestinal irritation with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also cause warm/flushed skin, muscular weakness, rapid heart rate, insomnia, nervousness, increased metabolism and weight loss. According to animal studies, caffeine may cause cancer and affect reproduction, but arsenic is definitively classified as a carcinogen.","context":["May 1, 2013 — Harsh Bais and Janine Sherrier of the University of Delaware's Department of Plant and Soil Sciences are studying whether a naturally occurring soil bacterium, referred to as UD1023 because it was first characterized at the University, can create an iron barrier in rice roots that reduces arsenic uptake.\nRice, grown as a staple food for a large portion of the world's population, absorbs arsenic from the environment and transfers it to the grain. Arsenic is classified as a poison by the National Institutes of Health and is considered a carcinogen by the National Toxicology Program.\nLong-term exposure to arsenic has been associated with skin, lung, bladder, liver, kidney and prostate cancers, and low levels can cause skin lesions, diarrhea and other symptoms.\nThe risks of arsenic in rice were recently highlighted in the national press, when arsenic was detected in baby foods made from rice. In regions of the world where rice is the major component of the human diet, the health of entire communities of people can be negatively impacted by arsenic contamination of rice.\nArsenic may occur naturally in the soil, as it does in many parts of Southeast Asia, or it may be a result of environmental contamination. Despite the health risks arsenic in rice poses to millions of people around the world, there are currently no effective agricultural methods in use to reduce arsenic levels.\nSherrier, professor, and Bais, associate professor, are investigating whether UD1023 -- which is naturally found in the rhizosphere, the layer of soil and microbes adjacent to rice roots -- can be used to block the arsenic uptake. Bais first identified the bacterial species in soil samples taken from rice fields in California.\nThe pair's preliminary research has shown that UD1023 can mobilize iron from the soil and slow arsenic uptake in rice roots, but the researchers have not yet determined exactly how this process works and whether it will lead to reduced levels of arsenic in rice grains.\n\"We have a bacterium that moves iron, and we want to see if creating an iron shield around the rice roots will slow arsenic movement into other parts of the plant,\" Bais said.\nSherrier and Bais, who received a 2012 seed grant for the project from Delaware's National Science Foundation Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), ultimately want to determine how UD1023 slows arsenic movement into rice roots and whether it will lead to reduced levels of arsenic in the rice grains, the edible portion of the plant.\n\"That is the most important part,\" Bais said. \"We don't know yet whether we can reduce arsenic in the grains or reduce the upward movement of arsenic towards the grain, but we're optimistic.\"\n\"The implications could be tremendous,\" he said. \"Coating seeds with bacteria is very easy. With this bacteria, you could implement easy, low-cost strategies that farmers could use that would reduce arsenic in the human food chain.\"\nNote: If no author is given, the source is cited instead.","|Name:||Caffeine, 98% (Titr.)

{"question":"What contrasting approaches do these universities take to foster cultural integration - the UGR's Buddy Mentor Program versus Hasselt's community-based exchanges?","answer":"The UGR implements a Buddy Mentor Program specifically designed to help international students integrate into their new environment, providing support before and during their stay to facilitate cultural, academic, and linguistic integration in Granada. Hasselt University takes a different approach through its Erasmus Belgica program, which promotes cultural integration within Belgium's different communities, allowing students to experience different languages, cultures, and mentalities while staying within national borders. While UGR's approach pairs international students with local mentors for direct support, Hasselt's program leverages Belgium's unique multicultural structure to provide an 'international' experience within the country's borders.","context":["International orientation is an important basic competence for students, as the organisations by which you may be employed as a graduate are often active internationally. This is why Hasselt University encourages its students to spend time abroad, and we have noticed that this allows our students to develop an open, global vision and international competencies (including independence, self-confidence, improved language, communicative and social skills and a broader knowledge of your own field). In short, international experience is an important advantage in the globalised labour market. Of course, you can pursue an internship abroad either during or after your studies at Hasselt University.\nWould you like to say goodbye to Hasselt University's lecture halls and experience studying abroad? Some programmes offer the possibility of an internship abroad.\nYou can apply through your student file (exchange section), where you can also consult destinations that are available for your programme. The deadline for application is 20 February.\nThere are various scholarships with which you can (partially) finance your stay abroad\nErasmus+ is a programme of the European Commission. One of the main objectives of Erasmus is to stimulate the mobility of students and lectors and professors within higher education between participating countries.\nThe European Commission granted the Erasmus Charter for Higher Education to both Hasselt University and tUL for the complete Erasmus+ programme period 2021 - 2027. The Charter and the Erasmus Policy Statement can be consulted below:\nAll faculties of Hasselt University offer their students the opportunity to go on an Erasmus exchange for a study and/or internship stay abroad. This involves staying for a minimum of three (study) months and a maximum of one complete academic year in one of the participating countries (28 EU member states + Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)). For more information about the possibilities within your programme, please contact the internationalisation coordinator of your programme.\nThe internationalisation coordinator of your programme is - in consultation with the programmes - in charge of the selection of the candidates and will rank the selected candidates. This ranking determines the order in which the Erasmus scholarships are awarded.\nMore information about Erasmus+ and Erasmus is available on the website of the European Commission. Do you still have questions? Please contact the international office (firstname.lastname@example.org).\nErasmus Belgica is a partnership between the Flemish Community, the French Community and the German-speaking Community aimed at improving the mobility of students and teachers in higher education between the Communities of Belgium. The initiative was founded with assistance from the Prince Philippe foundation.\nAn international experience is often a fundamental requirement of employers for candidates for a job. Due to its special structure, Belgium offers students the unique advantage of being able to gain \"international\" experience within the borders of the country. The participating universities and university colleges are required to conclude an agreement with the partners of the other Communities.\nThe goal is to provide students the opportunity to spend part of their programme at a university or university college in another Community. This gives them a chance to integrate into the language and culture of another Community of Belgium and to adapt to different surroundings and a different mentality.\nGenerally speaking, the programme is conducted similarly to the European Erasmus programme. For more information regarding the conditions, nomination process, manuals, etc., please visit the Erasmus page.\nContact Laurien Stuvers of the international office for more information.\nThe Priority Country Programme aims to promote the exchange of students between the community of Flanders and the following priority countries: Brazil, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and the United States of America.\nThe ASEM Work Placement Programme (ASEM WPP) promotes the exchange of talent between Europe and Asia by offering scholarships to higher education students for an internship in a number of Asian countries.\nThe government of Flanders awards grants for student mobilities to countries outside Europe that are not among the Erasmus+ programme countries. This scholarship programme aims to encourage mobilities for studies, internships or thesis research in countries outside Europe, complementarily to those included in the Erasmus + programme.\nVLIR-UOS and Hasselt University award travel scholarships on an annual basis to students who would like to travel to a developing country for an internship or to perform (thesis) research. This scholarship programme aims to give students the opportunity to acquire field experience within an academic context.\nTo be eligible, students must find a Flemish and a local promoter who are willing to support the (research) project. The home institution must also thoroughly prepare the student with practical and substantive information.\nAn international internship is an opportunity to find your bearings on the international job market, supplement your academic knowledge with practical experience, improve your language skills and to get to know the work ethic of the host country.\nMost international organisations offer the opportunity to do an internship with them","A day at the UGR\nAttending classes at one of the seven campuses of the UGR (five in the city of Granada, one in Ceuta and Melilla), studying at one of their libraries, discuss with your teachers and colleagues, prepare reports and seminars, conduct practices in the laboratories of the UGR, collaborate with research groups, participate in field studies, internships, eating with friends in the dining halls, take the food or dinner through the take-away service, apply for a scholarship, connect to the Internet through WiFi in all campuses and facilities of the UGR, stay in some of the university residences, a course of tennis, a conference, the pool, tango lessons, advantage of discounts on public transport, an informative lecture, going to the psychology cabinet, a course of ski, participating as an actor in a play, join a student association, the movies forum, participate as a volunteer in an NGO, receiving language classes, riding by bike between campuses,… are some of many academic activities you can do as a student of the University of Granada.\nWhere to live?

{"question":"What solutions exist to protect user data both statistically and technologically? Please explain both approaches.","answer":"There are solutions in both statistical methodology and technological architecture. Statistically, one approach is to use separate datasets - using one dataset for discovery through data mining, then testing the hypotheses on new, untainted data. However, this is often impractical due to data scarcity and expense. Technologically, the Zero Trust Network Architecture offers a more secure approach than traditional perimeter security. Unlike perimeter networks that consider internal networks trusted, Zero Trust treats all networks as insecure and requires constant authentication, authorization and encryption for every user, device and data flow. This approach uses existing technologies in new ways and has been successfully implemented by companies like Google (through BeyondCorp) and Apple. Additionally, regulatory initiatives like GDPR and IT Security Act are pushing for stronger technical security measures to protect user data.","context":["‘Data mining’ is an interesting term. It’s used very positively in some academic circles, such as departments of marketing, and very negatively in others, most notably departments of economics. The term refers to the use of clever automatedsearch techniques to discover putatively significant relationships in large data sets.\nThe paradigm example, though a very old-fashioned one is ‘stepwise regression’. You take a variable of interest then set up a multivariate regression. The computer then tries out all the other variables in the data set one at a time. If the variable comes up significant, it stays in, otherwise it’s dropped. In the end you have what is, arguably, the best possible regression.\nEconomists were early and enthusiastic users of stepwise regression, but they rapidly became disillusioned. To see the problem, consider the simpler case of testing correlations. Suppose, in a given dataset you find that consumption of restaurant meals is positively correlated with education. This correlation might have arisen by chance or it might reflect a real causal relationship of some kind (not necessarily a direct or obvious one). The standard statistical test involves determining how likely it is that you would have seen the observed correlation if there was in fact no relationship. If this probability is lower than, say, 5 per cent, you say that the relationship is statistically significant.\nNow suppose you have a data set with 10 variables. That makes 45 (=10*9/2) distinct pairs you can test. Just by chance you’d expect two or three correlations that appear statistically significant correlations. So if your only goal is to find a significant relationship that you can turn into a publication, this strategy works wonders.\nBut perhaps you have views about the ‘right’ sign of the correlation, perhaps based on some economic theory or political viewpoint. On average, half of all random correlations will have the ‘wrong’ sign, but you can at expect to find at least one ‘right-signed’ and statistically significant correlation in a set of 10 variables. So, if data mining is extensive enough, the usual statistical checks on spurious results become worthless.\nIn principle, there is a simple solution to this problem, reflecting Popper’s distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification. There’s nothing wrong with using data mining as a method of discovery, to suggest testable hypotheses. Once you have a testable hypothesis, you can discard the data set you started with and test the hypothesis on new data untainted by the process of ‘pretesting’ that you applied to the original data set.\nUnfortunately, at least for economists, it’s not that simple. Data is scarce and expensive. Moreover, no-one gets their specification right first time, as the simple testing model would require. Inevitably, therefore, there has to be some exploration (mining) of the data before hypotheses are tested. As a result, statistical tests of significance never mean precisely what they are supposed to.\nIn practice, there’s not much that can be done except to rely on the honesty of investigators in reporting the procedures they went through before settling on the model they estimate. If the results are interesting enough, someone will find another data set to check or will wait for new data to allow ‘out of sample’ testing. Some models survive this stringent testing, but many do not.\nI don’t know how the marketing guys solve this problem. Perhaps their budgets are so large that they can discard used data sets like disposable syringes, never infecting their analysis with the virus of pretesting. Or perhaps they don’t know or don’t care.\nUpdate Kevin Drum at CalPundit gives the perspective of a marketing guy, with lots of interesting points (for example, loyalty programs are there to collect data for mining). He doesn’t accept my main point and raises the dreaded “B” word – Bayesian.\nFor those familiar with debates among statisticians, this is the point at which things typically become both heated and incomprehensible (just like a lot of blogs, really). A real challenge, which I may tackle at some point, is to explain the Bayesian concept of statistical reasoning in ordinary language. For the moment, though, I’ll just agree that a debate like the one over data mining ultimately makes sense only if it’s cast in Bayesian terms, that is, with a discussion of the beliefs we hold before we begin the statistical analysis.","Identity and Security – The Empowerment of the User through Technological Emancipation\nUser identity data highly exposed in digital space\nTechnological perimeter security paradigms used nowadays are insecure and vulnerable\nThere is currently little pressure to change security paradigms\nApproaches for technological emancipation by individual market participants and direct technological requirements on the part of the regulator\nEmpowering users by changing technologies and processes, and thereby creating sovereignty over their data in digital space\nUsers leave behind extensive traces when using apps and internet-based services. In contrast to the analog world, these generally remain available in the form of data and are analyzed and used by various service providers for a range of purposes. This process is usually legitimated by the business relationship between users and service providers. In most cases, this is used for targeted advertising. Some of the information and services also provide simplification for users, e.g. in the form of additional information about routes or delays.\nThe underlying data belongs to the digital identity of the user, or can be attributed to it (a fact that the user must be made aware of); in other words: Users make data accessible – also meaning that this data can be attributed to their identity whether they desire so or not. The user and their data are just as much a product as the platforms and services provided by the service provider.\nHowever, there are other illegitimate or illegal facets of data usage in addition to the forms of the agreed use of user data. There are gray areas in terms of anonymized disclosure of data to third parties or the further pursuit of digital “zombie users” (accounts that are no longer used and have not been deleted). Furthermore, despite the user objecting to data collection, e.g. if they opt to disable geolocationing, all sources will continue to be collected by the provider.\nA breach in the integrity of networks with the aim of stealing data is to be distinguished from this – be the networks corporate networks, databases or home computers belonging to consumers. These breaches are partly directly related to software (and hardware) security holes; they sometimes gain access through the seizure of user access data, which poses a major risk due to its simplicity and frequent reuse. A forgotten account or an easy-to-hack password in digital space is the equivalent of showing your ID on the street or signing a slip of paper without checking it in the analog world. Just one breach is enough to carry out extensive analyzes on the behavior and preferences of users.\nThe consequences for the user are incalculable. The data allows many groups to draw conclusions. This starts with persistent, personalized advertising, and extends to no-fly lists and adjusting credit scores. Moreover, the user loses complete control over their data, learning nothing about the information and its origin, nor about how it is stored, analyzed and used. The only thing they notice is that they are no longer able to fly or that they are given a higher interest rate on a loan.\nRegulatory authorities have hitherto pursued a purely legal approach by sanctioning unauthorized transfer of data. The general uncertainty surrounding technologies often used to store, analyze and use the data has not been a factor.\nVERIMI is designed as a central and cross-industry platform. Users register once and can then use the digital services and products of the connected partners. VERIMI also offers users the simple option of transferring customer data already stored on a partner’s platform. The main advantage of VERIMI is that users retain full control over their own data. Using settings on the platform, they can decide for themselves which personal data they want to share with which partner. Approvals once granted can be revoked at any time. VERIMI is designed as a central platform in the first release but will be converted to a decentralized model with the appropriate degree of mature technologies.\nWith the integration of VERIMI, partner companies benefit from a secure and simple way of addressing and retaining customers digitally in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). VERIMI also delivers secure identities to connected partners, reducing transaction breakups and payment defaults. In addition, VERIMI is continuously acquiring new partners and customers, thereby increasing the platform’s reach and relevance. VERIMI is developed as a platform open for all industries and branches, which makes it easy for companies to integrate the green VERIMI buttons comfortably into existing online offers.\nFigure 1: Structural Uncertainty Causes Massive Economic Damage, Sensitizing Users\nThe parties involved have little intrinsic motivation to change this situation. Influencing user behavior is rarely successful, as there are few alternatives available, and avoiding the use of apps and services would lead to a loss in quality of life and digital benefit for social relationships.\nAs far as service providers are concerned, there are a few companies that have an interest in the security of user data and thus ensuring the highest level of security. For many companies, however, the acquisition and use of data is part of the DNA of their business model. And for good reason – from the perspective of service providers – it is difficult for the user to adjust the settings of their smartphone to make it data protection friendly. The smartphone’s authorization settings are hardly useful in helping with this issue, e.g. they do not prevent access to unique access numbers such as the IMEI or MAC address.\nAfter all, the prevailing technology-architecture paradigm is seemingly secure. Perimeter networks – those that rely on the perimeter of security zones – distinguish between a trusted network (e.g. corporate network, internal), a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and an intrinsically insecure zone (external). Within the trusted network, the assumption is that every user, device and message that has been successfully authenticated can be trusted.\nThis assumption is false, as the consistency of similar successful attacks demonstrates: Based on a combination of different methods including CSS, CSRF, injections, phishing etc., malware is able to enter the trusted network and form a gateway. The attacker introduces a remote access tool (RAT) into the network, then moves laterally within the network until they can access higher privileges and find usable data.\nAs a result, the perimeter security approach not only contributes to uncertainty among consumers, but most significantly among service providers. They are systematically used as intermediaries for attacks on consumers and service providers. Faster product releases of apps and libraries, which allow for far greater abstract programming, massively increase complexity, reduce transparency, and thus security.\nThere would be no problem with perimeter networks in a static world – “static” in the sense that all end points of the network are not subject to greater dynamism. In reality, the end points are constantly changing, and end users and technical users are bringing new smartphones and IoT devices (or agents) into networks. The applications and tools posted around them, e.g. as IDEs, libraries, DevOps toolchains, change at an even faster rate than the endpoints. This dynamism results in a far greater number of systematic errors and opens up points of weakness for attackers. At the opposite end of the network, which is considered to be safe, the same people still sit and follow a link or open an attachment.\nIn contrast, in the case of the Zero Trust Network Architecture, the entire network is considered insecure, there is no internal secure privileged network, only an external insecure network. Threats are assumed to be a constant feature of the network. Every user, device and data flow must be authenticated, authorized and encrypted. Access to the network therefore no longer depends on localization in an internal network, rather solely on the state and credentials of the end device as well as the credentials of the user. The decision to reauthenticate and authorize is based on a dynamic set of regulations combining a variety of factors rather than a single static threshold, such as a euro amount, current location or registered address.\nZero Trust Networks use existing technologies in new ways, incorporating changes, meaning that there is no need for new protocols, libraries or languages. Alphabet/Google is an example of a pioneer in terms of Zero Trust Networks, as this company bundles these activities in its affiliate, BeyondCorp, and has been responsible for its own infrastructure (including employees) since 2014. Apple can be viewed as a Zero Trust Network with its significantly stricter closed system of closely tied iPhones and iOS for all end users.\nIn addition to this paradigmatic change in terms of security architecture, the regulatory authority is strengthening the security of user data by introducing several legislative initiatives. With the IT Security Act (IT-SiG), the German legislator has implemented the European guideline for ensuring high network and information security (NIS-RL). Since June 30, 2017, IT-SiG has applied to all seven so-called “critical sectors”, including the financial and insurance sectors as well as those of information technology and telecommunication. In particular, the European Payment Services Directive II (PSD) increases the security of user data when it comes to electronic payments – as of September 14, 2019, the RTS SCA must comply with the latest safety-related element of PSD II.\nSimilar to PSD II, IT-SiG requires a state-of-the-art minimum level of IT security as well as a system for reporting pending serious security incidents or those that have already occurred. The requirement to report these incidents is common to both laws.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation will come into force as from late May. The GDPR is the first data protection law that seeks to ensure data protection by requiring technical security measures. Article 32 of the GDPR requires adequate consideration of the state of technology when it comes to implementing appropriate organizational and technical measures – an “encryption” of personal data is dedicated to every user. For the first time, GDPR can provide sanctions for the effective enforcement of data protection; with fines of up to 4% of annual turnover – up to a maximum of 20 million euros.\nWith the introduction of the “data protection through technology and privacy-friendly default setting” (Article 25), the GDPR also sets requirements in terms of product development and implementation – privacy by design/ privacy by default. Furthermore, the rights of the persons affected outlined in Articles 15 to 20 of the GDPR, such as the right to have data forgotten or the right to data portability, constitute non-trivial technical requirements for service providers. The ePrivacy Regulation sets out the details of the GDPR in the field of electronic communication and extends the data protection regulation to so-called “over-the-top communication providers” (OTT) such as instant messaging. To date, only traditional telecommunications providers are subject to the regulations. However, this no longer suffices as it does not offer an adequate level of protection due to the increased importance of OTTs. It is unlikely that the ePrivacy Regulation will come into force until 2019. The final content of the last of the four relevant laws cannot yet be conclusively reported, but the current trilogy shows the emergence of a trend in “pro-data privacy”.\nAs a result, the four regulations will increase the IT security and privacy of user data through the implementation of technical measures.\nPurely digital players (GAFAs) have numerous advantages as service providers: Their solutions are widely used, set standards when it comes to user convenience, and are well-versed in adapting to the latest technology paradigms. However, as their business models are largely based on collecting, evaluating and exploiting user data, they may only have limited interest (genetically and structurally) in transferring the sovereignty over this data to the user.\nOn the other hand, traditional analog market participants have recognized that it can be beneficial to increase their previously limited focus on data in the context of the transformation of their business models. They work together in order to generate maximum reach on the basis of technology, and are increasingly inclined to focus on lifestyle as well as function.\nWith regard to data, they can credibly develop solutions which do not leave data sovereignty in the hands of the user (they are not domiciled in digital space anyway), but rather return the users their sovereignty by way of their data. This involves the prerequisite of creating transparency and ensuring security.\nDigital identity is set to experience further enhancement and economic exploitation. The sovereignty over individual digital identity thus becomes a major issue for users, as they wish to continue to preserve their data sovereignty as is the case in the analog world.\nStakeholders involved must provide users with the appropriate means in order for them to be able maintain their data sovereignty. One of the tools of choice is secure technology; major providers have recognized this and are adapting their security architectures to new, dynamic IT. Regulators and supervisory bodies are now supporting this technological approach to the solution in the form of numerous legislative initiatives aimed at achieving data security and data protection through means of secure IT systems. It is down to providers and users to walk this path themselves."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:86327804-2d84-4e5b-880b-361595335a93>","<urn:uuid:17735918-1d1d-4405-bc5c-713045d2d3fc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hi! I'm a theology student researching ancient manuscripts. What are the main differences between the Leningrad Codex and Codex Vaticanus in terms of their biblical content?","answer":"The Leningrad Codex (completed around 1008) is the earliest complete copy of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament in Hebrew, while Codex Vaticanus (from the fourth century AD) contains both Old and New Testament books in a different order, including additional apocryphal books. The Leningrad Codex represents the Masoretic Text tradition and is the basis for most modern Bible translations, particularly of the Old Testament. In contrast, Codex Vaticanus follows the Septuagint (LXX) order for its Old Testament books and includes apocryphal works like 3 Esdras, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobit, Baruch, and the Epistle of Jeremiah.","context":["TYNDALE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE\nTyndale House, Cambridge, England\nDiscovery published in the Tyndale Bulletin 68.1 (2017) 1-29\nTyndale House, Cambridge, announces a new discovery made by young researcher Dr Kim Phillips published in its latest Tyndale Bulletin 68.1.\nTyndale House Research Associate Dr Kim Phillips identifies the writing style of Samuel ben Jacob in newly published digitised photographs of a manuscript from the Firkowich collection in the depths of the National Library of Russia archives of St Petersburg. Locked away from the eyes of interested researchers for a number of years these microfilms have recently been posted online by the National Library of Israel. Due to painstaking work in the unusual practices of this\nscribe Dr Phillips has been able to identify that this is Samuel ben Jacob’s work despite there not being any identifying colophon, or signed publication note, on the text. The mystery of who wrote these texts has been decoded.\nSamuel ben Jacob is the scribe who wrote The Leningrad Codex, the earliest complete copy of the Old Testament we have reproduced in Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia. This manuscript is behind most modern translations. Identifying this piece of work to be by the same scribe will allow scholars to check the accuracy of tiny details in the manuscript behind most modern Bible translations. This will then contribute to future scholarly Bibles.\n“For the first time (for scholars outside Israel and Russia) it is possible to contextualise the readings of the Leningrad Codex against the background of equivalent readings in other manuscripts known to have been written by Samuel B. Jacob”\nDr Kim Phillips Tyndale Bulletin 68.1 p. 20\nThe Article is available online at www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/tyndale-bulletin\nFor further information, please contact:\nAlice Jackson, Communications Officer at Tyndale House, Cambridge.\nTyndale House is a registered charity no. 1161396 Limited company registration no. 9437542\nRegistered Office: Tyndale House, 36 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge, CB3 9BA UK\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nTyndale Bulletin 67.2 (2016) 287-307 Phillips has previously published work demonstrating single folios found in the Cairo Genizah to be by Samuel ben Jacob, using a set of identifying features, or fingerprints, that collectively point to this particular scribe’s handiwork.\nFor further details of the Cairo Genizah and its significance visit newly opened exhibition Discarded History: The Genizah of Mediaeval Cairo providing “a window on the life of a community a thousand years ago – a Jewish community in the centre of a thriving Islamic empire, international in outlook, multicultural in make up, devout to its core.” Cambridge University Library www.lib.cam.ac.uk\nTyndale House is an independent evangelical charity founded in 1944 to advance biblical research.

Expected Publication Date November 15th, 2017. Published by Crossway and Cambridge University Press\nThe Greek New Testament, Produced at Tyndale House, Cambridge has been created under the oversight of editors Dr. Dirk Jongkind (St Edmund’s College, University of Cambridge) and Dr. Peter Williams (Tyndale House, Cambridge). While a few trusted Greek texts are in print, significant advances have been made in Greek translation studies of the New Testament since a standard text was adopted by academics in 1975. Together with their team, they have taken a rigorously philological approach to reevaluating the standard text – reexamining spelling and paragraph decisions as well as allowing more recent discoveries related to scribal habits to inform editorial decisions. Ideal for students, scholars and pastors alike, and published to coincide with the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, The Greek New Testament, Produced at Tyndale House, Cambridge is a groundbreaking contribution to biblical scholarship.\nFor further details visit https://www.crossway.org/bibles/the-greek-new-testament-produced-at-tyndal-hconly/\nCodex Climaci Rescriptus\nCodex Climaci Rescriptus is an important and complex palimpsest containing much biblical text and many mysteries. Dr Kim Phillips is working alongside the Tyndale House Student Scholars Program to describe and publish this extraordinarily complex and intriguing manuscript. Research carried out on the codex is supported by the Museum of the Bible.

Tyndale House is currently working with the United Bible Society to create a Swahili version of STEP and our next project will be to create a Spanish version, as we seek to make this a multi-lingual resource.\nWhat is the background to this discovery?\nCodex Firkowich B19a (more commonly known as The Leningrad Codex, or L for short) was completed in around 1008. It is the earliest complete codex of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament).\n- L is the main manuscript behind the Hebrew Bibles used by scholars called the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia and the Biblia Hebraica Quinta (more recent, but not yet complete). See https://www.academic-bible.com/en/home/current-projects/biblia-hebraica-quinta-bhq/.\n- The textual traditions found in L and other manuscripts from the same period are referred to as The Masoretic Text (i.e. the text of the Hebrew Bible produced by a group of scholars called the Masoretes, between the 7th and 10th centuries).\n- Thousands of tiny details in L differ from the other high-quality Hebrew Bible codices written in the same period. Scholars have debated these differences: do they reflect an intentionally different Masoretic tradition, or are they simply errors?\n- The new manuscript, L17, will allow scholars to check whether those differences in the Leningrad Codex are deliberate. This will alter future scholarly Bibles, and will contribute to our understanding of how The Masoretic Text developed.\nBoth manuscripts were written by a scribe called Samuel ben Jacob (Samuel son of Jacob) Phillips has previously published demonstrating single folios found in the Cairo Genizah to be by Samuel ben Jacob, using a set of identifying features, or fingerprints, that collectively point to this particular scribe’s handiwork.\nSee http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/taylor-schechter-genizah-research-unit for details of the Cairo Genizah and its significance.\nWhat is its significance?\nThis discovery is significant because it will allow scholars to check the accuracy of tiny details in the manuscript behind most modern Bible translations. Scholars have not previously been able to agree about the accuracy of the scribe behind the earliest complete manuscript of the Hebrew Bible.\n• The Leningrad Codex is the main basis for the Old Testament in most Bible translations in the world\no Including most English translations\no And most scholarly editions of the Hebrew Bible\n• Scholars will be able to use this newly identified manuscript to check the accuracy of the most widely used manuscript of the Old Testament.\nWho discovered it?\nResearch by Dr Kim Phillips, Research Associate at Tyndale House, Cambridge, and Research Associate at the Taylor-Schechter Genizah Research Unit, University of Cambridge, aged 35.\nAbout Dr Phillips\nQualifications: MA, MPhil, PhD from University of Cambridge; PGDip from University of Wales Research Associate at Tyndale House [www.tyndalehouse.com] carrying out research on the Codex Climaci Rescriptus and on early Masoretic Manuscripts, research supported by the Museum of the Bible [https://www.museumofthebible.org]\nTyndale House is an independent evangelical charity founded in 1944 to advance biblical research, which is also producing its own edition of the Greek New Testament to be published by Crossway and Cambridge University Press this November.

Codex Vaticanus has been posted online. Now, you do not have to travel to Rome’s Vatican library to view the codex, or purchase an expensive facsimile, or live near a library which has a facsimile. Add this to access to Codex Sinaiticus, which has been available online for a couple of years now, and anyone can examine the two codices that have had the biggest impact in dethroning the received text.\nI began poking around the codex this morning. I had recently been interested in finding out how Vaticanus ordered the Biblical books (both OT and NT) and what apocryphal books it included in the OT. I had not been able to find a complete listing in secondary sources and had not yet been able to visit a library to look at a facsimile. Now, I can access it with the click of a mouse.\nMy interest in how Vaticanus orders the OT books is related to the development of canon in the fourth century AD (when the bulk of Vaticanus was apparently written—some sections were obviously written and added later [they appear in a completely different writing script which apparently dates to c. fifteenth century] to fill in gaps in the text, which the online version now also allows one to see in the opening of Genesis and the book of Revelation). There was obvious fluidity in the selection of the Old Testament books and also fluidity with the texts of those individual books. This is a factor that I do not think advocates of the modern critical text have adequately taken into consideration when they give such weight to Vaticanus and Sinaiticus in determining the NT text.\nHere is the list and some notes on the OT books in Vaticanus. I have not yet taken a close look at the entire text (e. g., examining additions to Esther and Daniel), so some of the info below might need to be nuanced, but here is a preliminary list.\nVaticanus Old Testament Books List*\n3 Esdras (LXX 1 Esdras)\n2 Esdras (Ezra-Nehemiah)\nSong of Songs\nPrologue to Ecclesiasticus\nEsther (with additions)\nEpistle of Jeremiah\nSome Notes on the Old Testament canonical order and content of Codex Vaticanus:\n1. The opening order: Genesis—2 Chronicles follows the LXX order with Ruth inserted between Judges and 1 Samuel.\n2. The apocryphal book of 3 Esdras (LXX 1 Esdras) is then followed by 2 Esdras (Ezra-Nehemiah).\n3. Next is the poetic and wisdom literature from the Hebrew Bible, following the LXX order.\n4. Next is the apocryphal wisdom literature of Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus. Note that Ecclesiasticus is preceded by a prologue. Note: Apocryphal Psalms of Solomon not included.\n5. Next is Jewish diaspora literature, including canonical Esther (with additions), followed by the apocryphal books of Judith and Tobit. Note: Apocryphal books of 1-4 Maccabees not included.\n6. Next are the twelve Minor Prophets (Hebrew Book of the Twelve) following the LXX order.\n7. Finally, there are the Major prophets.

From the original first flight in 1955 to its latest model still in production today, the Cessna 172 has been a reliable, dependable, easy-to-fly aircraft that is appreciated by students and seasoned pilots alike.\nIn this post we will explore the Cessna 172 and share ten things you need to know plus answers to the most frequently asked questions about this storied aircraft.\nBefore we delve into the things you need to know about the Cessna 172, let’s start with the basic specifications. Although there are many variations of the 172, we will share the specs for the current production model – the 172S.\nCessna 172S Specifications\n- Maximum occupants: 4\n- Maximum speed: 126 knots\n- Cruising speed: 124 knots (75% power, at 8000 feet)\n- Fuel capacity: 56 gallons\n- Maximum Range: 640 nm\n- Engine: Lycoming IO-360-L2A, 180 hp\n- Propeller: McCauley 2 blade metal, fixed pitch\n- Service ceiling: 14,000 feet\n- Maximum rate of climb: 730 fpm\n- Takeoff distance: 960 feet (ground roll), 1630 feet (total over 50-foot obstacle)\n- Landing distance: 575 feet (ground roll), 1335 feet (total over 50-foot obstacle)\n- Stall speed: 48 KCAS\n- Maximum ramp weight: 2558 pounds\n- Maximum takeoff weight: 2550 pounds\n- Maximum landing weight: 2550 pounds\n- Basic empty weight: 1680 pounds\n- Maximum useful load: 878 pounds\n- Baggage capacity: 120 pounds\n- Length: 27 feet 2 inches\n- Height: 8 feet 11 inches\n- Wingspan: 36 feet 1 inch\n- Wing area: 174 square feet\nNow that you know what to expect from the current Cessna 172 model, let’s take a look at the 172’s history and discover 10 must-know pieces of information about this aircraft.\n1. The Cessna 172 is the most-produced aircraft ever\nSince production began in 1956, over 43,000 Cessna 172s have been built with more still on the way. This legendary aircraft is well-loved, well-respected and still in demand more than sixty years after it first came on the market.\n2. There have been over 20 variations of the Cessna 172 (plus some special versions)\nOver the course of its long life, the Cessna 172 has naturally undergone a series of modifications, upgrades and enhancements while remaining true to the heart of her original solid design.\nAmong the most notable are the 172B which introduced the Skyhawk name, the 172D with its Omni-Vision rear wraparound window, and the 172S which incorporated Garmin G1000.\n3. Not all Cessna 172s were built in America\nIt is known as an American aircraft, but you may be surprised to learn that 1,436 Cessna 172s were actually built in France. From 1965-1971, Reims Cessna constructed the Cessna 172F. This model replaced a lever-operated flap system with electric flaps. It was also the basis for the U.S. Air Force’s T-41A Mescalero – a primary trainer.\n4. The “Skyhawk” name originally referred to a deluxe option package\nAlthough you may be used to hearing the name “Cessna Skyhawk,” originally, the Cessna 172 was called just that – the Cessna 172. It had no fancy name. The name Skyhawk came about in 1960 with the release of the 172B. This model had the option for a standard package or a deluxe option package – named the Skyhawk – with extra equipment and full exterior paint. Eventually the name stuck and came to refer to the entire Cessna 172 line-up.\n5. The 172’s tricycle landing gear design helps you ace your landings\nOne of the key design features of the 172 lineup has always been the tricycle landing gear design. This design was tested out on the WWII B-24, B-25 and B-26 bombers. The combination of a nosewheel in the front and moving the main wheels aft was found to make a tricycle landing gear aircraft easier to land.\nIn this configuration, the center of gravity (COG) is in front of the main wheels. What this means to you is that when you land in a tricycle gear aircraft, if you are crooked, the airplane’s weight will help to straighten you out. By contrast, a conventional landing gear setup has a center of gravity that is aft of the main wheels. Land crooked in this type of aircraft, and your mistake will just get exacerbated by the influence of the aircraft’s weight.\n6. Cessna 172s are used as trainer aircraft for many flight schools\nIf you have a private pilot’s license, odds are that you trained on a 172 at some point. Flight schools love this aircraft for several reasons. The ease of flying a tricycle landing gear configuration is a main selling point as are the forgiving handling characteristics and increased visibility of the high wing design plus rear “Omni-Vision” window.\nIn fact, the 172 is so stable that its built-in aerodynamic stability can often return a plane to straight and level flight after a spin even without input from the pilot.\n7. The world record for the longest endurance flight is held by a Cessna 172\nImagine what it would be like for a small aircraft to fly non-stop for over 64 days. Bob Timm and John Cook did just that from December of 1958 to February of 1959. Their 64-day, 22-hour, 19-minute flight out of Las Vegas still holds the endurance record.\nTimm and Cook flew a modified Cessna 172 which was named The Hacienda after the Hacienda Hotel who sponsored the $100,000 flight as a combined publicity stunt and fundraiser for cancer research.\nTo prepare for the flight, the team added a 95-gallon belly fuel tank to augment the 47 gallons carried in the wing tanks. An electric pump in the belly tank allowed fuel to be pumped into the wing tanks for refueling. Oil lines were replumbed to allow inflight oil and oil filter changes. In the cabin, the pilot seat stayed, but everything else was removed and a 4’x4’x4” foam pad was added as a bed for the off-duty pilot. An added platform off the co-pilot side allowed for better footing during refueling. A small sink in the rear was used for washing and shaving.\nAn FAA waiver allowed the overweight aircraft to operate at 350-400 pounds over the normal limit. Twice a day the Hacienda would rendezvous with a Ford truck over a straight stretch of closed off highway. Flying 20 feet above the ground, the Hacienda used an electric winch to hook a refueling hose from the truck. Three minutes later with its belly tank full, the Hacienda would release the hose and continue her flight.\nThe next time you pass through the Las Vegas McCarren Airport’s baggage claim area, look up – the Hacienda is hanging from the ceiling at the airport where her historic flight began and ended.\n8. There was (briefly) a diesel-powered Skyhawk on the market\nGiven the lower cost of Jet A and its more readily accessible nature overseas, Cessna decided to release a diesel version of the Skyhawk in 2017. The Turbo Skyhawk JT-A came powered by a Continental CD-155 diesel engine and received high marks in fuel efficiency and power.\nUnfortunately, the diesel engine also resulted in a higher purchase price ($420,000 compared to $307,000 for the 172S) and reduced payload capacity because of the added weight. Just 11 months after receiving FAA certification, the JT-A was discontinued due to poor sales.\n9. The triangle gear Skyhawk almost didn’t happen\nRumor has it that when a group of Cessna engineers approached the Cessna marketing department with their idea for a triangle gear aircraft, they were shot down. Marketing wanted to focus on tailwheel aircraft. Thankfully for Cessna and for all of us, the engineers were undaunted, and they continued work to build out the first concept version of the tricycle-geared Cessna 172 that we all know and love. Ultimately it met with approval and went into production.\n10. The Cessna 172 can be powered electrically (at least as a proof-of-concept)\nElectric Skyhawks may be in our future. In 2012, Cessna and Beyond Aviation worked together to develop an electrically powered variation of the Cessna 172. The aircraft took multiple successful test flights powered by the Panacis batteries that take the place of the back seats. One of the big advantages of an electric aircraft would be imperviousness to density altitude changes.\nBonus: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions\nFinally, we have rounded up the answers to some of the most frequently asked Cessna 172 questions.\n1. How safe is the Cessna 172 compared to other aircraft?\nThe 172 has an impressive safety record, especially when compared to the industry average. Statistically, the Cessna 172’s fatal accident rate is .56 per 100,000 hours. This is about half of the industry average rate of 1.2-1.4.\n2. How much does it cost to own and operate a Cessna 172?\nCost is an important consideration for most pilots when they are contemplating the purchase of an aircraft. Beyond the purchase price, you must also account for operational costs, storage, insurance, maintenance and more. AOPA crunched the numbers for you and put together a hypothetical operating cost calculation for a Cessna Skyhawk\nThis particular calculation was based on a 1975 Cessna 172M with a purchase price of $39,000. For comparison, the purchase price of a new Cessna 172S is around $307,000.\nLoan payments in the AOPA scenario were calculated at $290 for a $35,000 loan over 20 years at 7.9%. AOPA insurance payments came to $1200 a year, and hangar space rental was $250 a month, which equates to $3000 a year.\nYearly maintenance was estimated to be $2500 or $25/hr. for flying 100 hours or $4000 ($13.34/hr.) over 300 yearly hours.\nThe final factor to consider is any kind of projects you want to do, especially to an older aircraft.\nThe final AOPA estimate comes out to $108.10 per hour if flying 300 hours a year or $225.30/hr. for 100 flight hours.\nThe total annual cost is around $22,530 for 100 yearly hours of flight and $32,430 for 300 hours.\nThat said, keep in mind that you can save money by opting for tie-downs rather than hangars, and hangar costs vary by location. The amount you owe on your aircraft loan (should you need to take one out) is also an important variable component of this calculation.\n3. What kind of engine does the 172 have?\nThe original 1955 Cessna 172 was powered by a Continental O-300 145 hp engine. In 1968, the 172I debuted the Lycoming O-320-E2D 150 hp engine. Previous engines had used 80/87 fuel, but the 1977 Skyhawk N (172N) tried out a Lycoming O-320-H2AD 160 hp engine running on 100-octane. The performance wasn’t favorable, so starting in 1981, the 172P switched to the Lycoming O-320-D2J.\nFactory-fitted fuel-injected engines arrived with the 1996 172R’s Lycoming 160 hp Lycoming IO-360-L2A. The current 172S model was introduced in 1998 with an upgraded 180 hp Lycoming IO-360-L2A.\n4. When will Cessna release a new model of the 172?\nCessna has been exploring both diesel and electric options, but for now, the 172S is the only Skyhawk on the market.\nThe Cessna 172 is a classic plane with a long and storied history. Dig into its past and you will find a series of well-loved, reliable, safe aircraft that are easy and enjoyable to fly.

{"question":"I want to know about GPS technology. What is el funcionamiento básico of GPS satellites, and what security risks exist with location tracking?","answer":"GPS satellites broadcast signals that include timing information and their position, rather than tracking users from above as commonly believed. The satellites don't receive any information back - instead, receivers use signals from at least four satellites along with mapping databases to determine location. Regarding security risks, location tracking data from fitness devices can be problematic as it can reveal patterns of activity and movement that bad actors could exploit. Criminals can use this location information for scams by making stories more credible, and the data could potentially be subpoenaed by law enforcement or purchased by data brokers. Additionally, location patterns like regular running routes and times could be used maliciously if made public.","context":["GPS pioneer takes aim at the future of navigation: CNET Conversations\nCNET Conversations: GPS pioneer takes aim at the future of navigation5:00 /\nAfter you help invent GPS, what do you do for an encore? If you are TeleNav's Bob Rennard, you make it eerily smart.\n-We've all learned to love really rely on navigation devices powered by GPS, but honestly, they've only been half baked until now. There is a new trend toward now doing GPS on connected devices that blends search, past preferences and even your future activity into the task of getting you where you need to go. I'm Brian Cooley. In this episode of CNET conversations, we visit one of the companies involved in this trend that also happens to have one of the fathers of GPS as its chief officer, Bob Rennard. We met up with him at TeleNav to get his view of the future through his knowledge of the past. So, where are we? This is your knack. What is that. -So, we're in a TeleNav chief network operations center. So the people that work in this office, in this area, and this one similar this is Shanghai are responsible for keeping our connected services for scout up and running. They can see how's the system behaving today versus how that behave yesterday. So, they can see if there's any trends they have to be worried about. -This is like [unk] Omaha 30 years ago. -We don't have a big red button, but yes. -You may know the name TeleNav, but they are not as well known to consumers Garmin, Magellan, or Totom. TeleNav has always focused on the software and algorithms that make GPS devices and services work, and while firm the first dates back to the beginning of mass consumer use of GPS CTO Bob Rennard reaches way back before that. Take me back GPS started when. When some ask you, what's the date, what's the year? -So GPS was a name change and it was build up merging some things that the air force then under projects 621B in 1969. -Uh-huh. -And a similar system that the Navy did call Timation in about the same time frame, but it wasn't until 1972 that the DOD so let's put these two together and let's get on with it. -The myth about GPS and this goes back to the very core development back in the days that it's watching me. So many false think-- that the satellite is up here. Looking down at you and tracking you. Does not how it works, is it? -Not at all. So what the satellites do is they broadcast a message which describes what at what time it signal is being broadcast. -And if you know that time you can also get some coefficient and say where would the satellite be at that time and then the little receiver you have uses just that information from at least four satellites and it figures out where it is and it doesn't tell anything back to the satellites. It's the applications that bring the location information from satellites together with a database of points of interest and a database of mapping to produce this product they all called the GPS. It's all like Scout. We do all that on the back end. We have the mapping data and the point of interest data that can be dynamically accessed from your phone as opposed to be resident on it, which allows us to keep Scout up to date much more so than a locked up product. -You know, it's funny occurred to me that maybe they shouldn't be called Scout, but sniper because it wants to put a bullet in the head of three distinct navigation states you use today. First of all, they have scout.me. They would like you to use that instated of that let's say Google Maps or map quest because that's where you would go on the computer to find things to share locations and such and of course a lot of us are gonna do navigation on our phone. It's the new portable navigation device. That's where you've got this Scout app. This phone app can blend the functionality or weather app and a mapping app, maybe a place recommendation app. You know who I'm talking about. It also memorizes that your home and work destinations and always tells you how far you are from them in current traffic, and then of course once you put the phone in your pocket and get in the car, that's where Scout automotive is gonna transfer control to the dash. Whatever the interface is, simple text or full LCD, and then can take advantage of the vehicle's voice command as well as do things in a contextual way that is safer and more efficient while you're driving. -I might wanna go to the theater or go to a sports event or go to a music venue, so scout.me, our companion website for Scout, Allows you to go there and find what's going on around you. Pick when you like and then navigate to it later and also from your Scout application, you can share it with those other people you'd like to join you at that event. -Now, TeleNav's scout is part of a major shift that I've been waiting in what is loosely termed the GPS business. You see navigation without search just isn't making sense to me anymore. And soon it navigation without personal history preferences and even prediction will seem antiquated and laborious to use. So watch TeleNav android services Apple's new efforts in nav and location, and Microsoft's expression of all this in their new blended windows platform if you want to follow the major players in how GPS is evolving. However that shakes out, I can't help but see a big upside for all of us. For CNET conversations, I'm Brian Cooley. Thanks for watching.","- Fitness trackers and apps from companies including Google, Apple, Garmin and Strava offer a convenient way to stay on top of health and wellness, monitoring body metrics like sleep quality and heart rate.\n- But even the biggest brands focused on security and reputation can be hacked or share personal data in other unintended ways with serious, sometimes devastating, consequences.\n- Data collected by a fitness app is not protected like health information under the law, making social and location settings, and login credentials, critical for a user to set properly before making these devices part of their daily life.\nFitness trackers, which help keep tabs on sleep quality, heart rate and other biological metrics, are a popular way to help Americans improve their health and well-being.\nThere are many types of trackers on the market, including those from well-known brands such as Apple, Fitbit, Garmin and Oura. While these devices are growing in popularity — and have legitimate uses — consumers don't always understand the extent to which their information could be available to or intercepted by third parties. This is especially important because people can't simply change their DNA sequencing or heart rhythms as they could a credit card or bank account number.\n\"Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, you can't get it back,\" said Steve Grobman, senior vice president and chief technology officer of computer security company McAfee.\nThe holiday season is a popular time to purchase consumer health devices. Here's what you should know about the security risks tied to fitness trackers and personal health data.\nStick to a name brand, even though they are hacked\nFitness devices can be expensive, even without taking inflation into account, but don't be tempted to skimp on security to save a few dollars. While a less-known company may offer more bells and whistles at a better price, a well-established provider that is breached is more likely to care about its reputation and do things to help consumers, said Kevin Roundy, senior technical director at cybersecurity company Gen Digital.\nTo be sure, data compromise issues, from criminal hacks to unintended sharing of sensitive user information, can — and have — hit well-known players, including Fitbit, which Google bought in 2021, and Strava. But even so, security professionals say it's better to buy from a reputable manufacturer that knows how to design secure devices and has a reputation to upkeep.\n\"A smaller company might just go bankrupt,\" Roundy said.\nFitness app data is not protected like health information\nThere can be other concerns beyond having a person's sensitive information exposed in a data breach. For example, fitness trackers generally connect to a user's phone via Bluetooth, leaving personal data susceptible to hacking.\nWhat's more, the information that fitness trackers collect isn't considered \"health information\" under the federal HIPAA standard or state laws like California's Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. This means that personally revealing data can potentially be used in ways a consumer might never expect. For instance, the personal information could be shared with or sold to third parties such as data brokers or law enforcement, said Emory Roane, policy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer privacy, advocacy and education organization.\nSome fitness trackers may use consumers' health and wellness data to derive revenue from ads, so if that's a concern, you'll want to make sure there's a way to opt out. Review the provider's terms of service to understand the its policies before you buy the fitness tracker, Roundy said.\nDefault social, location settings may need to be changed\nA fitness tracker's default settings may not offer the most stringent security controls. To boost protection, look at what settings can be adjusted, such as those related to social networking, location and other sharable information, said Dan Demeter, security researcher at cybersecurity provider Kaspersky Lab.\nDepending on the state, consumers can also opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information to third parties, and in some cases, these rights are being expanded, according to Roane.\nCertainly, device users should be careful about what they post publicly about their location and activities, or what they allow to become public by default. This data could be searchable online and used by bad actors. Even if they aren't acting maliciously, third parties such as insurers and employers could get access to this type of public information.\n\"Users expect their data to be their data and use it how they want it to be used,\" Roane said, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\"It's not only about present data, but also about past data,\" Demeter said. For instance, a bad actor could see all the times the person goes running — what days and hours — and where, and use it to their advantage.\nThere are also a number of digital scams where criminals can use information about your location to make an opportunity seem more plausible. They can claim things like, \"I know you lost your wallet at so and so place, which lends credibility to the scammer's story,\" Grobman said.\nLocation data can prove problematic in other ways as well. Roane offers the example of a women seeking reproductive health care in a state where abortion is illegal. A fitness tracker with geolocation services enabled could collect information that could be subpoenaed by law enforcement or be purchased by data brokers and sold to law enforcement, he said.\nUse strong password, two-factor authentication, and never share credentials\nBe sure to secure your account by using a strong password that you don't use with another account and enabling two-factor authentication for the associated app. And don't share credentials. That's never a good idea, but it can have especially devastating consequences in certain circumstances. For example, a domestic violence victim could be tracked by her abuser, assuming he had access to her account credentials, Roane said.\nAlso be sure to keep the device and the app up-to-date with security fixes.\nWhile nothing is foolproof, the goal is to be as secure as possible. \"If somebody tries to profit from our personal information, we just make their lives harder so it's not that easy to hack us,\" Demeter said."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d7bf0f31-fcbb-41fc-830b-7182dbcb67d3>","<urn:uuid:760aa365-b7f3-4b99-94d6-4a27433898e1>"],"error":null}
